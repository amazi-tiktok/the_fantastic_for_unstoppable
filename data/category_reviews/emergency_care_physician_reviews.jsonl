I showed up to this urgent care to get refills on my medications, because I had moved to Wetumpka a couple days prior. They were not prompt in acknowledging my arrival into the waiting room, but eventually, one of the two ladies stopped gabbing and asked if they could helped me. I explained that I needed medication refills, and they asked what medications I was on in front of all the other patients in the waiting room. I am not shy about the medications I'm on, but some people are, and they should be sensitive to that. I told them, and they informed me that they don't have primary care physicians, and that they generally don't write prescriptions except for things such as sports injuries or general illnesses that pop up in daily life. I understand that, and said that was fine, I could find somewhere else to go, but they seemed upset at that prospect, and said they would ask the doctor on call if he would make an exception and asked me to fill out paperwork while they asked him. I did, and the doctor said he would make an exception, so I waited and filled out the paperwork to be seen. I waited a good while in the exam room, and when the doctor finally came in, he ho-hummed about giving the medicine that he supposedly had told the office staff he would give me with no problem. He finally asked me if I had enough to patch me over, and I informed him that I did not, so he wrote me the prescription (with refills, so he must not have had too much of a problem prescribing it), and sent me on my way. I left on my merry way, said good-bye to the office staff on my way out, and headed to the pharmacy to fill my prescriptions. Upon handing over the prescription, however, it was discovered that the doctor had given me an *unsigned* prescription! I'm fairly certain that could have ended very badly for him, had I chosen to make it, but since I needed those medications, I grumpily brought the prescription back to the now-busy urgent care, waited about fifteen minutes for the office staff to again acknowledge my existence at their window, and then get them to have the doctor sign his own prescription, that he had issued and sent into the world to have done who knows what with without his signature, begging to have fraudulence done in his name. So he signed it, and I filled the prescription, but the nonsense did not end there. Beyond all of that, I got a voicemail, without my phone ever ringing, which I'm sure was not their fault, but the fault of my phone, but the voicemail said something to the effect that they had made me an appointment that I had not asked for that I would be charged for if I did not show up for at an arbitrary date and time, and to call or come by if this was an inconvenience, and leaving no phone number to call back. I then got a letter in the mail, stating the date and time of this arbitrary appointment I had not asked them to make for me, which I was to be charged for if I no-showed on, that had a number to call if I wanted to cancel the appointment. I called the number, and it brought me to a busy signal, which hung up on me after five seconds each time I called (I tried this three times before coming on Google to look up their actual number to call and ream them out). Supposedly, they have cancelled this bogus appointment that they made for me. My question is: why do they make appointments at all, if they do not do primary care, and are supposedly only available for sports injuries and normal day to day illnesses? Do people nowadays schedule their injuries and illnesses? Why on earth would they schedule me an appointment in the first place, let alone without my asking for them to do so? Avoid this establishment at all costs. If you are looking for a place to receive urgent care or primary care, try PriMed that's right next to Walmart, right up the road. They actually respect their customers, do not make you appointments you never asked for, sign their prescription pads, do not ho-hum about writing you life-saving prescriptions, and treat you like a human being.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c27cb64f2a3e7:0xb33b4b7ec9f29b18"}

This Urgent Care is often busy, so write down your questions and observations in advance. If you need any updates on vaccinations or a flu shot done they should be able to do that there.\nYou can describe to the receptionist what you need done, but be prepared to describe it to the nurses and doctors, also. They don't always have the chances to communicate with the receptionist.\nThey will do whatever you need done, as quickly and efficiently as possible.\nAs in any doctors office, be confident to be your own advocate to ask questions or ask for other aspects of care for your Urgent Care concern.\nBe aware of the hours. Try to get there at least 1 hour before closing time.\nIf they forget to ask if there are any changes in your insurance, you might have to ask them for a form or you will end up with a bill from a prior Insurance Company that no longer covers you. That happened to me recently, but a phone call to the Urgent Care office rectified the situation in just a few minutes.\n\nI was looking at a prior comment and understand why the reviewer was dismayed and upset. To give the staff the benefit of the doubt, I would call ahead and tell them my insurance. I would ask if they accept that before heading to the office. If someone asked me if that was ObamaCare insurance, I might respond, \"Do you mean, do I have a public option Healthcare plan through the Affordable Care Act (or ACA)? This is my health care carrier, do you accept it?\"\nIf for any reason they say no, then indeed, I would go to the emergency room, but I would contact my health care representative as soon as possible and ask for an updated list of providers in my area.\n\nIt's always best after an insurance change to  find out ahead of time which providers accept the insurance and then confirm that with the providers before there's an Urgent Care situation, if possible.  Usually with a change in health insurance, the provider gives you a list of in-network and out-of-network offices, so it is a good idea to check that in advance. It sounded like a political judgment call, but it may not have been. A lot of people call the ACA public options Obamacare, and they may simply have different forms for public options than they do for health care provided through employers. If there is any further indication that it is a political judgment, the physician's office should be reported to the health care provider. But if they are simply out of network, it's a good idea to make those arrangements in advance.\n\nPeople can usually use an out-of-network doctor. This often happens if one spouse works out of state and the rest of the family is in a different state. The premiums might be a little bit higher, but if it is more convenient, it should be possible to make an arrangement with the physician's office. I've been told in some cases that they simply aren't accepting any more patients or that they are no longer carrying an insurance that was in my providers list.

The place was disgusting. The floors and chairs were smeared in god knows what and their wasn't a hand sanitizer station visible in the place.  Upon intake my child was given a large dose of Tylenol (even though i had just given him some 2 hours before) the dose was 3.75 ml even though our sheet from pediatrician says weight gets 2.5ml. and he was given a dose of Benadryl and we were sent back to waiting room. After an hour or so we were taken to a room where the billing representative came immediately to collect my 100 copay and then an hour later we saw a resident who snottily corrected me when i called him a nurse. He asked some questions looked him over and left. I didn't see anyone again for hours. I was by myself, my child is an infant and i needed to use the bathroom. the only one was in the hall. The bed had no rails to leave my baby in, there was no nurse visible or that answered the call button to assist and the bathroom had no table to lay him on so i could use the bathroom. After a few hours the doctor comes in with a nurse and informs me that my child is allergic to tape (where they taped his eyes down for surgery that morning) and he has sensitive skin. And that they were going to give him a dose of Benadryl to help the swelling. I said NO you just gave him Benadryl on intake and a very large dose of Tylenol. They were like oh we did? Sorry.. I pointed out that the Benadryl did not help and his eye is looking progressively worse and that if he was allergic to tape wouldn't both eyes be like this?  They informed me they weren't going to do anything or run any tests and to follow-up with regular doctor tomorrow. They would however do a flu test to appease me. I know he doesn't have the flu and after 30 minutes i paged the nurse to ask if we can go home and have the flu results called to doctor the next morning? They said they will tell the nurse and send her in to talk to us. Never showed up. Flash forward another hour and 45 minutes. Flu negative and we can finally go home. Vitals and temp never checked since intake and no bloodwork drawn. Nothing. The next morning my child breaks out in the roseola rash. Thanks for nothing Children's.

I have had the worst experience in my Life! My son has been having Migraines for the last 8 years & he is 12 yrs old. When you have a child that suffers from this type of pain it hurts my Heart that Dr.Anna White would come & ask questions. Conversation: Dr. Anna White    Kameron what's hurting on you? Kameron replies my head is hurting really bad & my stomach. Dr. Anna White asked: How long has your head been hurting & Kameron replied off & on since last night but my stomach started today. Dr. Anna White then asked have he had any bowel movements & Kameron replied: he did earlier today & it was normal. Dr.Anna White asked if he has eaten anything today & Kameron advised he ate a couple hours ago. Dr. Anna White asked what did he eat? Kameron told her  he had Mash Potatoes, Pork Chop, & Corn( Let me add it was the smallest portion of food ever) but anyway Dr. Anna White then goes in to say this is a Non-Emergency Visit because if he tolerated a Meal it's not an Emergency! My response: it's an Emergency  to me because my Son never complains unless he is really sick & if he tells me he needs to go to the Dr. I'm going to bring him. Dr. Anna White then goes on to tell me that they are just counseling patients on Non-Emergency visits, I then cut her off in mid sentence & told her you don't have to help him we will leave because I felt she has had a long day & is now taking it out on us because she feels it's not an Emergency. My son has been at this ER dozens of times & we have never been treated this way. I don't want to ever in my Life step back into this ER as long as I'm breathing because I work in Healthcare as well & our Mission is to always make sure the patient is taken care of. Nurse was Great! Check-in Great! Wait was Ok! The Escort to the room was Great with a Smile! The Patient Coordinator was Great! Dr. Anna White is Horrible & I will write & call Patient Advocate to complain.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bb82e602809:0xf4200c41f2c591b6"}
