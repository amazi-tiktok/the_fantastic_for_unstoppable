This really isn't much of an issue because I just ask them when I get there.\n\nHowever, the consistency of quality of the food hasn't been good since around June. We order bread bites a lot from there and sometimes they are drenched in oil to the point that they ooze out a lot with every bite (not good) and others it is bone dry with not even sauce to dip them in (also not good). Sometimes the bites are REALLY undercooked and sometimes they are just right. I understand it is different employees making the pizza, but sometimes the stuff is good and other times I don't even eat it because it is inedible. Ordering now is a 50/50 gamble on whether I will actually be eating what they give me. The pizza is often the same (undercooked or just right).\n\nAlso one time they gave us a cheesy bread instead of bread bites and then when we called about it they basically called us liars. We just wanted what we ordered and we order from there A LOT.\n\nRecently we have cut back on ordering from there because of the consistency issues. We used to order at least twice a week and now it is about once a month.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb33aefa62e9b:0xdcf1ec70484217f5"}

Got home and it was the WORST food we had ever gotten. A house full of 7 teenage boys and 2 adults and there was still 2 1/2 pizzas left afterwards. The wings were inedible. They looked and tasted like they were made the day before and set out overnight. Horrible...just horrible. Corporate will be getting a major complaint. They were refusing to refund money to those of us that were tired of waiting. The excuse was noone in the store was allowed to refund money and we would have to wait until the next day for the manager to deal with it.

NOT AT ALL the way it used to be.. and I did call to express my complaint about it, because certainly I must have gotten a childs portion or something like that and the lady I spoke with had an attitude and was not very nice at all.\nIt\u2019s just such a shame how this place had gone downhill.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1616672750474, "text": "Hi Michelle and thank you for your business and feedback.

The orders are usually ready within 15 minutes. I do realize they close at 10 pm on Saturday nights. I called at 9:30 to place an order to pick up. They said they do not take call in orders 30 minutes before they close. That was about a $40 to $45 loss, which I'm sure it would have been ready before 10pm, & I live 5 minutes from them. I just think that is bad business, & if I was the owner of that business I would have been upset. I thought the customer always came first, apparently not here. It needs to be posted on their website that they do not take call in orders 30 minutes before they close. What's the difference in calling in an order at 9:30, or going inside at 9:30 & sitting done & ordering?  That's just my opinion, & yes I wanted some food from there!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccb45e7a677a7:0x6ccbe06b7267c454"}
