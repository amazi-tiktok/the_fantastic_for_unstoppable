I checked with the county clerks office in Erie county New York and was told that those records are sealed pursuant to New York State law and that the only people that can view them are the plaintiff,defendant or attorneys of record so I called protective back and was told someone would call me back. SUPRISE no call back again so I called again and asked to speak with a supervisor and I was connected to John who stated he would look into it and call me back the next day. Guess what no call back again. I called them again and after being put on hold was told that everything was ok and I didn\u2019t need to do anything  After another week went by I called to check the status of my claim and was told I had to provide a copy of my parents divorce decree I explained again that I could not provide it because my parents divorced 49 years ago and were no longer alive my father passed years before my mother took out the policy. I was told I needed to provide a copy of my fathers death certificate in order for them to process my claim. By the way did I mention I am listed as the sole beneficiary on the policy.... I should not have to provide anything but my mother\u2019s death certificate which I did in the first place. I just faxed a copy of my fathers death certificate today let\u2019s see what excuse they come up with next not to pay on my claim. I will probably have to sue them for what is rightfully mine left to me by my late mother. This company should be ASHAMED\n\nUpdate\nProtective insurance got back to me to make sure the claim was closed and they listened to my concerns and stated that they would try to improve their call backs moving forward.
