Do not sign a contract with Adam\u2019s Acres, and do not trust them. Adam\u2019s Acres has been operating for less than a year. I was the first bride to book Adam\u2019s Acres. I booked them when all that Brittany Adam\u2019s had to show was studs and pictures of what it would look like when completed. I took a huge risk and trusted Brittany. Now, I regret that decision.\n\nDue to the COVID shutdowns in March, I was forced to postpone my April wedding. All of the dates I had to choose from included holiday dates or August dates. We picked August 15th thinking that COVID would be over by then. However, COVID-19 cases are worse now than they were in April. After a lot of praying and talking to relatives, a month from our wedding, we made the decision to postpone our wedding again! This is not at all what we wanted to do, but for the safty of our family and friends we felt it was necessary. Brittany, being the heartless person she is, refused to give us another Friday-Saturday date in 2021. She offered a Sunday date with our rehearsal dinner being on a Thursday. That would not work for religious purposes and the fact that we have so many out of town guests.  She said \u201cwe would cut into her 2021 revenue if she gave us a Friday-Saturday date\u201d. The only way we would be able to have a Friday-Saturday date is to pay the new 2021 rate of $3500.00 when we have already paid in full of $2500.00. Not only will she not let us postpone to a Friday- Saturday date in 2021, she refuses to give us a refund.\n\nShe has stolen our money and has taken advantage of the COVID-19 situation!!

COVID-19 has been a nightmare for everyone and we understand your frustration.\nWhen the State of Alabama shut down all businesses we rescheduled affected couples. It was heartbreaking for our couples and incredibly difficult for our small business that had been operating less than 6 months. We were so happy to have Fall dates still available, but we will be very honest...it has been difficult trying to recover from all the bookings we lost because of reschedules, especially when we didn't qualify for any assistance. We are thankful that unlike a lot of businesses we were able to survive and didn't have to close our doors.\nWhen we rescheduled you to August 14th/15th, we held that date for you and turned away other couples and parties that contacted us for that date. Unfortunately when you cancel 3 weeks prior, it is impossible to re-book.\nWe have been open and safely hosting events again since May 30th. Every single couple has been dealing with the uncertainty of COVID and taking precautions to keep everyone safe. We offered to discuss these options with you as well. The mother of the bride tonight told us, \"I know it wasn't as big as they planned, but they are finally married and we felt SAFE.\" Yesterday\u2019s couple rented additional tables to put outside to further socially distance. All weddings have provided masks and had hand-sanitizer readily available. Tonight's bride also live-streamed her event so that her grandmother (who could not attend because of her assisted-living's COVID policies) could watch her get married. Vendors are wearing masks, caterers are hiring extra staff to safely serve everyone, our venue has extra staff at events for sanitizing... Everyone is making compromises and working hard to keep everyone safe.\nWe are in no way downplaying the seriousness of this virus. We also have no idea when it will end. We understood the reason for your cancellation and although it goes against our cancellation policy, we were empathetic and offered you a Sunday date in 2021 with no additional payments required. When you told us that interfered with your religion, we again offered for a Monday-Thursday. We are so sorry that none of those options worked for you.\nWeddings are such an emotional time for everyone and we understand your disappointment. We know that all couples and wedding vendors alike have been thrown into incredibly difficult situations. When what you want to do for your couples conflicts with how you have to run your business--it feels impossible. If we let one person reschedule, we would have to do it for everyone to be fair. We are so sorry, but we simply cannot do that and keep our doors open. We have to follow our cancellation policy in this situation."}, "gmap_id": "0x889297ef32ece5ff:0xf3bd8bb0f4a416a"}

We had approximately 125 guests in attendance, and we fit well in both the ceremony and reception areas. While the weather was sunny and hot, they cranked up the AC in the barn. Also, my granddaughter had fans printed up and passed out, so people were fanning themselves throughout the service in true Southern style. After the ceremony, we walked across the gravel road to the reception area, and dined under the wide open blue skies. Fireflies danced among the rose bushes as evening softly surrounded us, and the stars and twinkle lights added to our celebration. Of course, my granddaughter\u2019s father-daughter dance music selection was the opening theme song of the movie, \u201cPride and Prejudice.\u201d Then, the DJ put on the latest dance music, and the crowd of twenty-somethings danced the night away. The food and bar offerings were greedily devoured. I found the J and D staff kept our needs met unobtrusively but also with a sweet spirit.

It was very hot, though I obviously don't knock the location for that. My main complaint would be that they had to move the chairs from the ceremony area to the reception area. This took about 20 minutes, and left all the guests standing confused in heat. No one came to tell us when they were finished setting up, and we eventually meandered up to the barn where the reception was held. There were also quite a few chiggers (red bugs), at the barn as well. Perhaps this all wasn't to their fault and was resultant of poor planning, though it seemed as though it was.\n\nThe parking was also odd, it was about a quarter of a mile from the venue. They had transportation between places in the form of what was basically a golf cart. Though they took forever to come back and forth, resulting in my girlfriend walking up the hill in heels.\n\nOverall the place was quite beautiful, I hate to give this sort of review to such a lovely place, but this was my experience.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1572798023395, "text": "Hi John,\nThanks so much for your review and the kind words about the overall beauty of our venue. In regards to the seating in the orchard... we actually have multiple seating options available that do not require seating to be moved from ceremony to the reception. We have over 300 chairs, vintage church pews as well as custom made wood benches. In this case it was requested that the same chairs be utilized at both, ceremony and reception, so we did in fact have to move them... which is a job that  requires about 20 minutes and 6 staff members. We do strongly discourage this option, but ultimately it\u2019s the decision of the bride. :-) As far as instructing guest to make their way to the barn, this would fall under the job of a wedding planner or coordinator, not the venue itself. In regards to chiggars, we do keep all gathering areas around the barn and reception area mowed and well maintained, however we do have 40 acres of Bermuda surrounding the barn, so if you got in any of these areas, a chigger or two is very likely :-). Finally, our parking lot is located on site but 600 feet from the barn. We do this as an effort to keep the ceremony & reception area safe, as well as clear of vehicles for photography purposes. A 6 seater electric (2017 Polaris Gem) shuttle is available for all weddings. The round trip for this takes only 90 seconds, of course that time does vary..  Especially when exiting, as we make every effort to drop guest directly at their car.  Again thank you for the very kind words. We hope you get the opportunity to attend another wedding soon!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888a30d338f76721:0xf2771ad745e07a53"}
