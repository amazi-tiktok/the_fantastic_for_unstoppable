Upon entering the clubhouse, I was amazed at the initial set up of the course. My co-worker had to rent some clubs, at which they were very accommodating by giving him a brand new set of Nike Vapors. I had the Coverts 2.0 from the previous year and was impressed at the rentals they provided. We went to the driving range and then the putting green and we were off. Long story short, the course was AWESOME and the view was even better. We found ourselves stopping to take pictures and taking in the view (Which I rarely do on course). What I thought was to be a 6 hr round (because of our relax play at each hole) was a little over 4 hrs. This course is in my TOP 5 best courses I've played in my life, (I've played in the range of 50-60 different courses). I would recommend this course to anyone who enjoys a challenge, but also a forgiving course layout. The scenic views are something out of a movie which as to the relaxation of the game of golf. If you are ever in the area, you have to check out this course.\n\nA big Thank You to the staff there at Cherokee Ridge who were some of the top notch personnel a course can have. Jonathan Watts, a Graduate of the Golf Academy of America Orlando, did not disappoint to the customer service and knowledge one would find at that school.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1626368416363, "text": "Thank you for your kind review!

My worker could have had a cooler head dealing with customers, but an apology was made and the men appeared to be happy that I looked into the situation.

Then I was met at the 18th tee with the staff demanding the cart back, which was apparently late, even though there was no sign and no one told us there was a deadline. We hurried through the 18th and tried to return the cart. Then while unloading, I was met in the parking lot by a manager telling us if we can't have the cart back on time, that we wouldn't be welcomed back. I apologized about the cart and vented my frustrations about the dress code, and the staff was very hostile and unapologetic. The electronics in the cart stopped working on the back 9 holes (which is just the first 9 played again) and the course was overall not very good, with only one par 5 and very short par 4s.

Let\u2019s start at the beginning where the leasing office told me that the gates would be functional in two weeks when I first signed a lease at the end of March. Not only do the gates never work, no security feature on this property works, anyone can drive onto property or walk into the pool or exercise room. I have a gate card that I have never had to use but I will bet if I lose it they will charge me for it.  The hot tub was chained off for months.  But what really takes the cake for me is the fact that after saying all of that about how poor the security is, I called the after hours maintenance to help me because I am a single woman locked out of my apartment (due to my own stupidity, I will admit) and I was told I would not be helped (despite acknowledging that there was probably a charge for such a call) because they would not go to the office and check to see if my lease matched my Id. And before anyone tries to say it\u2019s unreasonable to ask, this was only Between 5:30 and 6 in the afternoon. *And* in order to make a maintenance request you have to log into a password secured resident portal so how in the world can it be justified that my identity could not be verified? Thanks to either a faulty company policy or an employee just not wanting to do his job, I had to spend money on a hotel room for the night.    And also, I was told my the office staff a few months ago that the rent was going up 200 dollars at the end of my lease so yeah, long term rent here at your own risk. I\u2019m sure it is a great place to stay if you own your condo or are renting through a vacation management company.

Incompetent. 3 weeks I spent talking to these people and every single time they acted like they had no idea who I was. I will admit I got denied the first time because of a debt that was due to my ex wife. Took care of it THAT day. Was told I needed to bring the reciept where I paid the collection agency. I did. 45 mins later I get a call saying that\u2019s not good enough and that I have to call the renters Buerau and get it off my record. I did. Had to fax them a copy of the receipt from collections agency. So we get approved but the office tells me that I have to pay a 500 dollar fee plus put down another 1100 dollar deposit then pay the first months rent which is an additional 1100. Keep in mind I\u2019ve already paid 400 to run the application. So just to get in would be 3100 dollars. Mix that in with the fact that the First Lady I ever talked to had a death in the family (which I hate for her) but she doesn\u2019t even transition us to another agent. So we\u2019re bringing in copies of our social security cards, I.Ds, bank statements and places of employment, you know, everything that can be used to steal an identity, and NO ONE knew where our file was. This is 2 weeks into dealing with these people. So finally after literally calling and talking to EVERY LEASING CONSULTANT which had no idea where any of my information was, one lady finally said she would handle our file. This is on a Friday. I wait the weekend and call Monday. The lady no longer works there. What the hell....so I call twice Monday, because no one EVER CALLED ME BACK during the 3 weeks I was dealing with the place, and asked who was our leasing consultant because I don\u2019t want all my bank statements and social security floating around their office AGAIN. The lady said she\u2019d  take over our file......she tells us we\u2019re approved we just have to pay 1600 deposit which imcludes an unexplained 500 dollar fee....after 3 weeks of jumping through hoops I gave up. Couldn\u2019t handle the ignorance or the incompetence any more. Like I said very nice place. Would love to live there but not at the expense of being treated like a stray dog.\n\nSide note; if one club attempts to contact me in resolving this issue it would be a waste of their time and even more of mine.

Please take a moment and read my situation as it will hold truth to what happened to me. First, I Ioved my place and relunctantly was forced to vacate. I rented at Emerald Greens from Aug 2013 through Nov 2014.  I had no problems when I first got there as they (Blake, Stepanie, and the office manager),  were on top of everything but as I remained in place, upon my renewal, things took a drastic change. There are (3) issues I had with the managment and I'd like to share my true views with anyone wanting to rent from Emerald Greens.\n\nI was told originally that the gym had 24 hour access, when in fact, it does not. I was never told the severity of how they (Blake especially), can just come into your home at leisure... for no apparent reason. I was not comfortable with this but they said you signed an agreement allowing us to enter your place at will.  Of course I signed this but never in a million years would I have thought someone would just come into the unit for no reason.\n\nThe reason that impact my move was their \"questionable\" pet restriction policy that I nor anyone else knew anything about.  Upon my move in 2013, Blake told me that the company has a breed restriction (no pit, basically the obvious aggresive breed dogs) and dogs could not weigh over 25 lbs. I never signed anything because I didn't have a pet at the time but I knew I'd get a puppy eventually.\n\nI renewed my contact in July 2014. My daughter, whom is an Auburn Soccer player, gave my her 3 month old minature chiwhawah (under a pound) because she couldn't maintain her.  Since I'm alone, I took the puppy because base upon my understanding from Blake and my conversation when I moved it, we could have small dogs BUT HE NOR THE STAFF NEVER SAID THE DOG MUST BE OVER 12 MOS. I was going to the front to pay the pet deposit fee for having the puppy and the front management told me I was not allowed to have th puppy on the premises. I was immediately assessed a penality fee!  I was told to leave with the dog immediately or get evitcted within 5 days.  I also was told by Blake and the staff that I could place the dog into shelter unitl she reached a year old, and then bring her back onto the premises. Obviously, this was clearly about keeping a good paying customer.  I requested to speak with CEO/Housing Association, basically someone that could make a decision based upon the circumstances.  I was even willing to pay a differ fee to remain in place and keep the puppy. They refused to allow me to speak with anyone but themselves. They forced me out and told me I cannot stay with the puppy. At this point, I told them that I'd just leave. Remember, I just renewed my lease not even a week or so before.  I told them since I cannot stay, I will leave.  Blake told me you cannot leave, you must stay the 45 days and pay us and you will be assessed $2700 penality fee for breaking your renewed lease.  He also said you cannot just pay the rent, you must reside within the property with lights on and everything or I would be in violation. At the time, my neigbors told me they were coming in my condo even when I was not there everyday.  I was getting very scared and fearful because I am not from Alabama, I'm from Virginia, just moved down because of my college soccer player,.  I was very scared.\n\nI hardly stayed there but had to pay the rent and now the penality has affected my credit.  I have never had this type of issue with a company in my life. They took my deposit, not because the place was a mess, it was to off set the difference of breaking the lease. My home was immaculate.\n\nEmerald Green's managment team of Gulf Shores are not good business ethic people and do not know there job and nor do they understand RESPA. They have very little business skill sets. They are very insutling people and are horrible in customer relations.  Do not move into this place.  There are many people that have issues but cannot afford an attorney to deal with it. I could not afford an attorney and they took advantage of me.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a055952e4a357:0xef2c1ada62a66942"}

Very loud, with people, (vacationers and rude renters), running and riding bikes in the hallways. Staff is HORRIBLE! I need to say this again, STAFF IS HORRIBLE! This whole company is run terrible, from the top down.\n\nIf you have children, please be aware that the staff had tried to impose a, \u201ccurfew\u201d, for the kids in the complex while we lived there.\n\nThere was also an incident where an employee that was drunk on the job, is a felon, and had warrants for his arrest WHILE WORKING AT THE COMPLEX, deliberately drove a John Deere Gator in to a group of children, including my son, injuring one child requiring transport to the hospital. Just Google, \u201cemerald greens atv assault\u201d, the story is on WKRG.\nThe BIGGEST thing about that whole situation is, not one person, NOT ONE, has asked if the kids are ok, no apology, ZIP. Even after several conversations in which I mentioned this, still no concern. When I mention that no one has asked about the well-being of the kids involved, I am told, \u201cOkay\u201d.\n\nMost people I have talked with that live, or have lived there, it is usually for one year and out. This complex needs to train staff to care about the residents, and make up its mind as to what it will be. Owned, long term rental or vacation. All three together is a disaster!\nDon\u2019t let anyone say this is, \"just a disgruntled former tenant\u201d.\nAm I disgruntled? Yes. Rightfully so? YES!\nBEWARE BEWARE BEWARE!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a055952e4a357:0xef2c1ada62a66942"}
