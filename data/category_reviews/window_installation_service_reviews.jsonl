We had a couple of other estimates from different roofing companies and we chose to go with blue square roofing and construction because of their quality and warranty. Not only did they show up when they said they were going to, they finished our roof in A-day and a 1/2. They would have finished it sooner had it not started sleeting.  The cleanup afterward was nothing like I have ever seen before!!They raked our yard with a magnet. They also picked up every piece of shingle.  Jeremiah is probably one of the most honest hard working businessmen I have ever met in my life.\n\nWe had to have a 20yr old shingle roof removed and a new roof Istalled.\n\nThese guys were friendly, timely and professional.\n\nWhile the roof was being installed if there were any questions regarding what I wanted, the project manager was ON SITE and made sure to come to me immediately.\n\nThey went above and beyond with customer service.If I ever need a roof on any other structure, this is the company that I am going to use hands down.\n\nTHANK YOU!!!\n\nThe price was only $200 more than any other estimate that I had gotten, however, for that extra $200 I also got a warranty that I could not beat anywhere else. I received new flashing instead of using the old flashing (like the other companies said they would do because it wasn't \"necessary\" to change flashing). BULL HOCKEY!!!\n\nThey removed old copper on my bay window and put rain/iceshield over the ENTIRE window, flashed it, rain dripped the WHOLE HOUSE (Because we don't have gutters) AND fresh shingles on the Window!!!\n\nThey installed rain and ice shield around ALL of my dormers. The original roof did not have flashing in the valleys and this company made sure to do it correctly.\nThey removed rotted decking and replaced it with new.

I'm incredibly disappointed. Our order was managed poorly - the left hand doesn't seem to know what the right hand is doing - and we're still waiting 6 months later for 3 doors to be installed. From this experience, it's hard to say whether I'd recommend Champion again. I like the product a lot, but I'm very disappointed with the progress of this project.\n\nWe were so pleased with Champion before, that we decided to hire them for 4 new doors around our house. January, they came and measured the doors and told us they would be installing the end of Feb or beginning of March (can't remember exactly). They show up and one of the doors is just right, one door is the *wrong* door, and the other two were not measured or manufactured properly. Ok, mistakes happen, I get it. So they tell me they'll order new doors and get back in a month. It's a busy time or something, right? They tell me the doors won't be ready until May. May rolls around, nothing. I start calling in June and nobody knows what I'm talking about, I have to tell the representative what my problem is and she tells me she'll have to contact the local office, gives me her number, and tells me to call her the following week. I call her the following week and she doesn't answer. I call the HQ and the rep has to take all my information again because my record isn't clear to her. I call the local office, nobody answers. I call HQ again, nobody answers. I finally get a call in JULY that *one* door is ready to be installed. \"One door,\" I ask, \"we are waiting for 3 doors.\" The rep is confused. All he has in his records is one door. I'm contacted by another rep the same day who says she got in contact with the local office, who weren't able to tell her whether the door had even been ordered and, again, I had to remind the rep that we had ordered 2 other doors.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1580132983886, "text": "Champion appreciates the feedback in order to improve our customer service.

A week later, we still could not get answers but the loan company wanted a payment because Champion already took $5000 from our loan.

We have called every number we can to talk to someone and keep leaving messages with people at Champion with no response. They have our money, but have done no work.

When I asked what was wrong, they assured me everything was fine. Later, the workers and their boss were screaming at each other over the phone about the correct way to install the windows, the result of which was another working coming to explain the correct way to install and why the windows maybe looked too small. At 4:45, I informed the workers that I had to be somewhere at 5 pm and was already going to be late. They left, and promised to return the next morning at 8 am to finish the installation.

The next day Keith (our PM) came back to make sure things were done as he expected followed by our original \"salesman\" (that term is so inadequate) Kyle coming out the following day to walk the roof and the grounds and write up a final \"punch list\".

The bow in the wall was due to APEX's contractors putting inch of thin set or mortar behind the tile, inch thick!\nThe floor pan was not sealed or glued correctly. This was pointed out to me two other contractors who have given us bids.\nAPEX also did not install the left counter properly so they cut the stone back splash and side splash to try to make it fit.

The install went smoothly, a little over a month after buying. We had metal windows and the guys took the time to cut them out by hand and ensure our new windows went in seamlessly. Instead of just throwing up wood surrounds, they capped the windows with custom aluminum before sealing it all up.\n\nFrom beginning to end, Craig Blair was very patient in walking through everything with us and ensuring we were informed and comfortable.

I first met with Craig Blair on April.  He gave me a quote that same day.  He was very patient and was definitely not in a hurry to leave, even though it was late in the day.  He answered all of my questions.  After I thought about it for a while he came back another afternoon to answer more questions and show the demo window unit to my wife.  Again, very patient and in no hurry to be anywhere.\n\nMade down payment in April.  He said they would install in early June.  That is exactly what happened.  The install took only three days.  They started on a Wednesday and finished on a Friday.  The install crew consisted of three guys.  They were extremely polite and cleaned up their mess each day.\n\nThere was only one major issue.  There were streaks and smudges on every window.  It looked like some kind of sealant that was not cleaned off during the manufacturing process.  I met with the lead installer on Friday morning and pointed this out to him and asked that he clean the windows.  He was very condescending and obviously did not want to clean the windows.  He said he would but I knew he would not.  I went back to work (my wife was home but said she would not enforce the window cleaning)\n\nThe project was finished when I got home Friday afternoon.  The windows looked great but . . . You guessed it.  There were still streaks and smudges on all the windows.  Not wanting to be a pain, I tried cleaning the windows myself.  The sealant was very difficult to remove.  It would not come off with glass cleaner alone.  I decided this should definitely be Blair\u2019s responsibility.\n\nI asked for a meeting with Criag Blair.  We met the following week.  He was very polite and patient.  He agreed to have the windows cleaned and address a few other minor issues.\n\nIt took a while, and to be fair, I was out of town for a week but we finally coordinated on having the windows cleaned.  The crew that did the installation came back out.  They came while I was at work.  My wife was home but declined to be the inspector.  They finished cleaning about 3 PM.  They waited for me to get home at 4:30.  We walked around and inspected all 26 windows.  There were a few touch ups but for the most part they did a good job.\n\nIn summary, I was very pleased and satisfied with the entire process.  I will definitely use Blair Remodeling in for any future projects.  Craig Blair is the best.  I totally trust him and I know that he will do whatever is necessary to make sure I am satisfied.

That trait is difficult to find these days with many contractors, but Blair impressed us from beginning to end. The crew was outstanding and delivered a quality installation in a timely manner that made our house look amazing.\nWe highly recommend the Blair team for your next project.  No wonder they have so many repeat customers!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889163057be33df:0x9d5df5b1f942ec2f"}

Billy is so easy to get in touch with - such a rare quality.

I was majorly impressed with Mickey and the crew. They did a fabulous job on the roof, going above and beyond to make sure that any issue was taken care of. They really take a lot of pride in their work, and it shows.\n\nTheir whole team has been on-point with any concern after the initial install. Billy was fantastic in handling the claim with the insurance company. He definitely knows what he is doing and made everything super easy for us. We are super satisfied with the office and the field staff. They are thorough, considerate, clean and treat you like family.\n\nI highly recommend Blair Remodeling for any roofing and repair/remodeling needs.

The roofer walked the entire roof looking for nails that were backing out (not just in the area of the water stains below, but the whole roof), removing all that he found, sealing the hole and making sure the roof shingle lay flat. Two days after the repairs we had a lot of rain, and no water leaks inside the house.\n\nOnce again, Pickett Construction has made my wife and I very happy, and I will not hesitate to call them in the future.

We were looking for some typical wood rot to be replaced and exterior paint. We also requested an interior paint quote. I think the quote was a bit high for the exterior work, but not so bad that I didn't go with their services. The quote for the interior painting was outrageous, so we opted for another painter. The other painter's quote was nearly $3000 less than the quote from Pickett. We were also having some plywood put in the ceiling of the carport, because the builder used interior drywall in our neighborhood. Pickett gave us a \"complimentary upgrade\" to beadboard instead of plain plywood. This really added a nice touch to the carport ceiling, and was an appreciated upgrade. They only requested 1/2-down to start the work, which we felt was certainly reasonable. They also honored their coupon they regularly have (often in the Alabaster Newsletter, or ValPack). We printed ours from the ValPack website.\n\nWorkmanship:\nThe quality of the exterior work was pretty good. There were a few spots where the painting got a bit \"sloppy,\" but was overall good work. The beadboard in the carport made a great upgrade to our carport, and added a touch of \"class\" to an otherwise mundane area of the house. Unfortunately, due to our unusually cold winter, the holidays, and several bouts with rain, our work was regularly delayed. It took a bit longer than expected to complete, but didn't delay our schedule of listing the house. The little interaction I had with the crew was polite and courteous, though at times the project manager came across as mildly arrogant. Communicating with the PM via email was the best medium, although he sometimes took a bit longer than expected to return messages.\n\nPost Work Follow-up:\nAgain, the delays in returning messages made for a challenge in clearing our post-work \"punch list,\" but this was also around the holidays, so we conceded a bit.  Had there been more clear communication about workday expectations (e.g. workers will/will not be onsite today) this would have made for better overall feeling about the length of the job.\nDuring our home buyer's inspection, they found more wood rot that was inadvertently overlooked by the crew. While I don't expect the painters to look over every square inch of the house (heck, neither did I!), it ended up being a significant portion of the chimney that had rotted out the edge of our masonite siding. One would expect that at least part of that might have been discovered and either repaired or at least alerted me to the potential change in an estimate so it could be repaired. When we approached our PM about correcting it, he gave us a price quote. After paying over $6000 for the original work, this was certainly unexpected, especially with their \"1 year warranty.\" I spoke with Josh, the owner's son who is also in management with the company. He immediately started working with me to find a reasonable solution. I ended up having to pay a bit more, but we did come to an acceptable compromise on the final cost of the supplemental work. In the end, Josh personally stopped by the house to deliver the revised agreement and took pictures of the missed work. It turned out that the rot was more severe than even he expected. He opted to continue to honor that revised estimate and didn't charge anymore. Josh really worked hard to make a relatively displeasing situation wok out well in the end. Josh was absolutely committed to service and ensuring my end satisfaction. He even reached out after the supplemental work was completed to check in on my satisfaction, and knowing there was a bit of a sour taste, still wanted this Google Review. Josh knows what it takes to listen to customer concerns and immediately find a reasonable solution that works in the best interest of all parties. Had it not been for Josh's actions, my 4-star rating would have been a high 2-star, or low 3-star.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888928b42506b8af:0xcb8d4f70d1041df1"}

{"user_id": "103807360235985118981", "name": "C. Gatlin", "time": 1578617837641, "rating": 1.0, "text": "If I could give Window World of Dothan, AL a -100, I would.  I would NEVER refer them to anyone nor EVER use them again.  They are the absolute worst in customer service.  The salesperson is the face of the company and that\u2019s about as good as it gets.   It is difficult to contact them by phone and when you do no one is ever around who has any answers.  The receptionist or answering service must always get back to you, and usually never the same day.  I don\u2019t know the criteria for Window World being ranked as the #1 replacement company in America, but it can\u2019t be based on any contributions from Window World of Dothan, AL, at least not for doors and shutters.\n\nWe contracted with Window World of Dothan, AL on 1 Oct 2019 for 10 sets of outdoor shutters and a front door.  The install should have only taken a day. The install began on 16 Nov in the late afternoon and still has not been completed as of today, 9 Jan 2020.  The individual sent to install the shutters and door obviously didn\u2019t care about the job because the quality of the installs were substandard.  We tried to give him space and let him do his job, but that was a mistake because when we looked closer at the tall shutters they were installed with only 4 pegs instead of 6 (industry standard) and did not place the pegs uniformly (symmetrically) into the mortar, some directly into the brick.  When asked if 4 pegs was a Window World standard, he said it didn't matter.  We also asked if he filled the old holes and he stated \"some\",  which we knew meant \"none\". His defense was to say there were lots of holes in our house.\n\nThe installer completed the haphazard shutter install and departed because it started to drizzle and he didn't want the caulking to get wet. He was supposed to return the next day (Friday) to install the door.  He sent a text on Friday to say he was still on a job in GA and wouldn't arrive until the afternoon. We responded that we didn't like afternoon appointments because he would be rushing the door install the same way he rushed the shutter install and make more mistakes.  He agreed to return the following day in the morning.  Meanwhile, my wife attempted to call Window World, Dothan several times to ask about the standards for shutter installation but no one ever called her back.\n\nAs he was installing the door on Saturday, we let him know the door was not square in the frame.  His ongoing response was to tell us that our house was the reason the door wasn't straight. Once the install was complete we continued to let him know we were not satisfied with the way the door looked in the frame.  As he prepared to install the storm door, he realized the frame had to be shimmed and stated he would return on Sunday to finish the job.  When he returned at 9am we told him that the thresh hold needed to be adjusted more because we could see car lights under the door and feel the cold air. He appeared a little agitated. He became more agitated when my wife asked \"hypothetically\" what would happen if we wanted to discuss the possibility of getting another door. He then said he could fix the door.  My wife asked him if that was the case why he hadn't fixed it in the first place.  He proceeded to tell my wife that she complained about the shutters and every little thing about the door. He then stopped what he was doing and left the storm door uninstalled.  He told her that day was his last day at Window World so he didn't care if we complained.\n\nMy wife called Window World the following Monday  and asked to speak to the owner.  Instead of being contacted by the owner, the salesman was sent for damage control.  He stated he would have the shutters reordered and expedited.  Another installer was sent to correct the door install.  He made some additional adjustments that helped but was still not the quality of install we expected.  It is currently 9 Jan 2020 and we have not heard from Window World about the shutters or the fact that we are extremely DISSATISFIED customers.  Their lack of care, concern, and communication speaks volumes about the organization.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1578694241397, "text": "Mr. Gatlin, we appreciate the time spent sharing this information with us.

Kevin mentioned it would take 6-8 weeks (possibly as little as 3 weeks) but there was absolutely NO communication from Champion the whole 8 weeks. On week #6 half the bill was charged with interest with NO work being completed and no communication on when it would be completed/started. When this was addressed with Charlie (owner) it was ignored and not resolved. There was no mention of us being charged BEFORE work was completed. We called the Champion local office twice with no response. On the 3rd time we called corporate and Damon (installation manager) quickly returned my call.\nThe installation guys were 40 minutes late from appointment time, again with NO communication. I had to call to find out they needed to stop and get caulk on the way to my house. I would think they would have been prepared with the proper equipment prior to the customer's appointment time.\nThe installers were polite and professional, however I brought up some quality issues during the installation process that did not get properly taken care of until they said they were leaving causing them to stay longer and redo some of their work. (Gap in the J-molding, they wanted to caulk the gap, not fix it) Corporate called me wanted me to sign a form stating the job was done even though the installers were still here finishing the job.  When I mentioned the issues regarding some other problems (window & screen defects) Damon called me to come out to resolve the issues.\nBottom Line: Customer service and apologies goes a long way.

We just wanted a person to come by and talk to us about a new sunroom. This phone system service (meaning=the \"trained\" people manning the phones) is highly disorganized! Perhaps it is because of the virus? Leaving messages or even setting up appointments to meet with a representative and that representative never showed is very disheartening. (0 stars for that set-up-an-appt craziness.) Corporate office? You need to get that fixed! Perhaps employ another phone service to answer your toll calls? \ud83e\udd14\n\nFINALLY...after months of calls...we got our Champion reps at our home.\n\nMatt and Charles came to us in East Limestone from the Huntsville office which is by the airport. Having already had sales presentations by two competitors, we knew what to expect in their presentation. They immediately realized we were most interested in quality and price for our new sunroom.\n\nMatt was thorough in showing us the construction of their unique products. He even had samples to demonstrate the sunroom's best attributes.\n\nWe were surprised at the price. Matt was precise and clear on it. One contract, too, one price. Never additional hidden fees. Perhaps we contacted them at the correct time since it is December after all. \ud83d\ude01 Good price for the quality...the sunroom we chose actually can be added to our home square footage.\n\nCharles invited us to come by their showroom. I suggest everyone do this! Seeing several sunrooms already set up truly helps in your decision process versus just seeing magazine quality sunrooms in their catalogs.\n\nCharles even brought us to the back of where products are custom made for every sunroom. These are not kits. We went for the 6in depth walls. Seeing the sun rooms in the office and showroom also convinced us to go ahead with additional products. Charles was not pushy at all. We made these decisions on our own.\n\nBoth Matt & Charles also gave us their personal cell phone numbers and we have called them several times. They have always been available -immediately-. We appreciate this courtesy! (Those 5 \u2b50's for them.)\n\nHaving read 1-\ud83c\udf1f reviews from a year ago...yikes! We decided to see for ourselves and really tested our sales team.

We worked with Matt Jackson to get a quote, but he kept changing pricing every time we asked him to calculate it for us. He lied to tell us about what the windows would look like, and told us the installers were all Champion employees - which they are not. Champion will contract your job out to unprofessional, inexperienced, cheap laborers. Their sub-contractors repeatedly left our house completely open to the elements for hours and even days at a time which led to many issues for which Champion refused to accept responsibility. We spoke to Corey, the install manager, Rob McCauley, the regional manager, and even a national customer service manager - all who insisted the issues we experienced were not Champion's fault. Corey's temper when we involved Rob in communicating our concerns was completely unprofessional. Rob offered to give us a gift card for dinner as a compensation for the trouble we experienced (what a joke!). The national customer service manager threatened me and swore at me when I insisted Champion make the right the issues we experienced.\n\nThis company is full of dishonest, unprofessional, and unexperienced people charging high prices for a product of average quality.\n\nUPDATE IN RESPONSE TO CHAMPION'S RESPONSE: If nothing else, please take Champion's sarcastic response to my feedback as a token of their lack of professionalism. You can see from the reviews of others that our experience is not an outlier, but rather the norm for how Champion operates. Of course we noted our windows had just been replaced - WE SPENT OVER $12,000.00 ON THEM.\n\nCHAMPION WILL LIE TO YOU, SEND SUB-PAR CONTRACTORS TO INSTALL THEIR AVERAGE-QUALITY WINDOWS, AND THEN STEAL YOUR MONEY AND DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MAINTAIN THEIR FACADE TO TRAP OTHERS - DO NOT FALL FOR IT!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626545c36f5ab7:0x6fb3859ed0eacb75"}

We have a home that has 32 windows. These windows were from the original build back in 1999. Over time these windows failed, broke internal components, were loose, didn't stay up and let so much air in between them; it really hurt our HVAC bills. We decided to look at new windows. We went through the hoops and ringers with various window companies in the area and the big box stores. The price ranges were all over the place and the functions, options, features and price points were the driving factors in this big home reno purchase. We called Champion (CW going forward) and had our salesman Whit come out and give his sales pitch. He did a great pitch and was at our house for 4 plus hours. Going over every detail and question we had. He was not afraid to say \"I don't know, but I will find out\" and called ahead to ask with us on his speakerphone right in front of him. He never stepped out to his truck to ask; he just did it right in front of us. We wanted an answer and he went and got one. Good bad or indifferent there was no empty promises or sugar coated answers. We were explained all the finance options and the promo they were having during our consultation. We beat him up pretty good with our wants and needs for the windows. After that was done, Cory then came out a few days later and walked me through the measurement process; again answering my rhetorical questions and others I missed with Whit. He took meticulous measurements of ALL my windows and explained what my casements would be and how they would sit in the frame. I walked through the house with and he asked questions to me about each room as he measured and took detailed notes. We discussed the order that was first taken to verify everything was right...the first time. He explained the install and what was done with that process from top to bottom. As well as what to expect with financing options again. Making this as streamlined as possible. He explained our order, what timeline for delivery was and the timeline of the install process once the windows arrived from the factory. Once our windows arrived in Huntsville, we were given a few choices on the install. We picked the date that worked on our schedule and a timeframe that made sense for the install. Once again, were explained the who what when were and how on the install team. The install team was on time the first day with everything ready and planned out so they could hit the ground running. Jimmy Mashburn and Brandon Clark were the install team and they were incredible. I have OCD about fit and finish and so does this install team. Jimmy talked with my wife so she would get the understanding of the install and what she could expect. He didn't make her feel silly for asking and was very professional with each question. We, of course stayed out of the way, but if either side had a question about a window, my wife and or Jimmy/Brandon made sure both parties were on the same page. They took their time and set everything right the first time. We didn't care how long it took and they were very meticulous and detail driven on each window. They were not in any hurry to just set 'em and forget 'em. It was done right the first time. I'm no installer but I'm a homeowner that bought 32 windows so I was wanting to find something wrong or find a shortcut that I saw...NOPE! I couldn't find anything that I felt was incorrect or not done in a make sense manner. Everything was top notch work. All my old windows were removed and stacked out of the way. Drop cloths were placed inside on each opening to make sure the removal was as clean and clutter free. All of the windows were set correctly, openings were cleaned from past dirt and debris. Professional 100%!! I felt that my money was going to the right company for our home. These are big decisions to make when getting new windows and the value of the CW product met our families need. We are truly very happy with our windows and would recommend CW to anyone!! We are very happy we went with Champion!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1572873361192, "text": "Thanks so much for taking the time to leave this great review.

I welcome window depot to try to reply to this post; might be the only way I can get in communication with them. I will update if we ever hear back or get our windows installed.\n\nUPDATE: Finally did receive a call back (After leaving messages last Wednesday and then again today) and they seemed more than a little peeved I expressed that I was unhappy with their lack of communication. Regardless of COVID as an excuse for slow production, communication of the delay should have been a given.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cba32d0f155:0x1d2354ad7eeb8af0"}

Called back 2 to 3 weeks later and told them that they had a couple of days to figure something out or we would seek legal action.

On 3 July I took my GS350 to have the tint removed from my rear glass and have it replaced with ceramic tint that I purchased from tintzoom online for $200.00. When I arrived the owner and I agreed on a price of $190.00 to do all window with the exception of the left front and left rear (I had already installed it) with the tint I supplied. Having done over 50 tint jobs at a reputable local shop while in college (10 years ago) I know the proper way of installing tint, but being a little rusty I decided to take it to a professional to ensure the tint was removed properly (Steamer or Ammonia and Black Bag). After pulling the car into the shop to start the job I noticed the CARWASH DETAILER with a razor blade hacking at the tint in the rear window. I immediately asked him to stop and asked the owner to take over before he ruin the rear glass defroster. I then left with my ride that was waiting (big mistake) and had him take me to the bank to get cash for the job.  When I returned my car was supposedly ready. I looked at my rear package and it was covered with tint scrapings and my defrost lines were no longer black they were gold (as in no longer working from scraping with a razor). I also noticed that my 3rd brake light was torn to pieces, and there were several pieces of tint left on the window with new film laid on top of it. Soon after I spoke with the manager to inform him of my displeasure with the services rendered. The first thing I asked the owner about was my 3rd brake light and his answer was \u201cWe had to break it to put the film on.\u201d The second was my defroster his response was\u201d We had to get the tint off.\u201d The third issue with this humbling experience was the patches of old tint eft on the window with new tint installed over it, in which I received no response from the owner. My response to the owner was \u201cI am not paying for this,\u201d so he decided to vacuum some of the tint from the rear package tray and reduce the price to $165.00 since he broke my $250.00 3rd brake light. After I still refused to pay we both called the police (Little did he know I was on the phone with a good friend who is deputy chief of police). So between the times the police arrived he decided to rip the tint off the windows and throw my $200.00 ceramic tint in the trash, despite his wife warning him not to. When the police arrived he lied about ripping the tint off and even said I didn\u2019t bring any tint to him and stated that he supplied the tint. After looking at the car the officer asked why is there just tint on the driver side windows, I stated that is because those were the windows I did myself. To end the story the officers did nothing (OF COURSE) and stated it was a civil matter which is probably true. Long story short I am out $568.49 to replace the rear glass to get my defrosters back (plus installation), $200.00 for the ceramic tint that he decided to rip from the window and throw in the trash, and $250.00 for my 3rd brake light the he tore up. PLEASE do not go to the poor established called Customized Auto Detail & Window Tinting or you will receive a humbling experience like mine.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b785508b9fb:0xfffd9e0f9eb61f62"}
