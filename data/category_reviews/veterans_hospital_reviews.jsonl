Other patients in waiting room said their appointment scheduled at 8:30 too. How can he see all these patients at 8:30. I asked how much longer is the wait/ receptionist said all his rooms are full.

I call through the link and she was there typing in computer and didn't acknowledge me so I hung up. Called the clinic and MSA said provider was waiting for me to call her through email link. I have quite a few appointment at this location and Birmingham location. I have NEVER called my providers either the provider or the nurse contacts me first for my VVC appointment. Why is this particular clinic so different and why is there inconsistencies. MSA tried to tell me each dr is different. No its only in this clinic. I canceled my appointment because we way past appointment time. Now why if I come to VA in person I don't just walk in there office at my scheduled time. They or nurse come to get me when provider is ready. Why is it different through VVC.
