So today I tried to register just as I was told to do and it didn\u2019t have an option for Covid follow up so I called the office, explained it to the nurse she said let me call you right back. Ok, I waited and waited, finally someone from CORPORATE called me explaining they didn\u2019t have anymore vaccine to give. WHAT?? She started out telling me well you were suppose to be here yesterday. I stopped her and said hold on , I told the nurse I could come but it would be 6:00 and she told me to come the next day,I even called WEDNESDAY and told them again I could come but again I was told to come Friday!  I didn\u2019t do that on my own! She said well she didn\u2019t have the authority to tell you that. After going back and forth she said she was gonna have to find me a vaccine and it would take her a week! So guess what Iam not a happy camper. I told her Iam in healthcare and I am pretty upset for being able to get it because if their mistake. Am I wrong for this??

Once your insurance company pays its contracted portion, you will receive a statement in the mail explaining the portion your insurance paid and what (if any) balance is your responsibility.

The cough medicine had absolutely no effect and after finishing to round of antibiotics there was no change in my cough and it has only gotten worse. I called up there to see if they could potentially reexamine me. Unlike every other urgent care that I have ever been to they told me I would be charged a copay to be reexamined. If I had known this was their policy I would have gone to an urgent care in Auburn like I usually do as they care more about me getting better than me paying a copay and don't charge one for reexaminations. They did call in a new cough medicine prescription however it is a decongestant even though I have absolutely no congestion symptoms. It was also not covered by my insurance so I was forced to pay out of pocket. I will not be returning to this urgent care in the future. In my opinion it is worthwhile to drive to the Auburn area to see a doctor that can actually diagnose me and make sure I leave happy and healthy.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1510144320436, "text": "We are sorry to hear that you didn't have a positive experience, that is certainly not our goal or intention.

We had the best experiance possible. The CRNP Troy Wilcoxson was awesome! We told our friends about what a great experiance we had, and recommended the establishment to others.\nSo today, December 23 I took my daughter back to get tested for Covid 19, since our test were positive.\nIn my 48 years I have only experienced two other so called CRNP's as bad as the Donna Conway treated me today.\nShe bad mouthed Mr. Wilcoxson in how he practices and the decisions he makes. I pleaded to her to change my daughters prescription over to what my husband and I were taking which is not against the law nothing illegal and she could have totally made me feel better as mother and understand ultimately I know my daughter best, she is not just a math equation.\nEverything I said to her she used words like \"debunked\", when I am the paying customer.\nI was shocked.\nJust because what I was requesting did not fall into her agenda and I pleaded with her, she chose not to make me assured as a parent my daughter is getting  the right treatment. Not to mention she wrote my daughter for an inhailer and no one even listened to her lungs. Using an inhailer when you don't need it can cause more damage than good.\nAfter I stated that fact, she then listened to my daughters lungs and said she sounded clear.\nI am so appalled by her lack of bedside manner and inability to connect with the concerns and needs of the patients.\nOn our previous visit we were invited to sign the kiosk about our experience. Today Donna Conway made sure to skip that option. When I asked the front desk receptionist to please load the kiosk for me it only allowed me to enter 1 as my satisfaction, when I went type the reason why, someone conveniently shut it off and the receptionist could not reload it.\nSo there's that.\nIf this Donna Conway continues to be employed at your establishment, I will make it my daily mission to make sure through ALL of my media connections that people call first and only visit the Care Center when Troy is working.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889046071922300f:0x23b6c7003fb99cdc"}

It was quick, as I was the only patient in the facility. As I waited, they loudly talked about their coworkers and gossiped which I felt was inappropriate with a patient in the waiting room.\nI returned on 9/2 to to get my TB read, I got there at 6:05pm, as the directions said and what I was told was to come before 6:30pm this day but not before 6pm as my TB will be expired after then. I check in, at 6:25pm (no other person ahead of me) I ask how much longer it will be to have it read and she said \u201cit\u2019ll be 3 more minutes\u201d.\nOkay.. why was I not informed on the very specific time when I left on 8/31 or when I got there 25 minutes early vs just having me sit there with nothing being said to me. The lady at the front desk also had an attitude with me asking on why I was not informed.\nTen minutes later is when they called me to the back to read my arm, technically after my TB expired and after the time they told me to have it read by then.\nI give whomever read my arm the paperwork I needed to have signed by the dr or np. I specifically turned the page and let her know only the TB section is what I needed her to sign. In the next room, I can hear the dr or np ranting about how she wouldn\u2019t be signing all my paperwork because I didn\u2019t get the vaccines there and how it was inappropriate. The girl who read my arm didn\u2019t even bother to relay my message.\nI get my paperwork back unstapled and out of order, at this point I\u2019m irritated with the whole experience. I let her know how she should have relayed my message instead of making me seem like I was trying to get over on them, upsetting the dr or np. Also how inappropriate the conversation went with me sitting in the next room and obviously thin walls. She just looked at me and never offered an apology.\nThis may all seem small but to me, it makes all the difference with where I decide to go.\nI\u2019ll just stick with American Family Care in midtown from here on out.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a80695abb303:0x438a521ad0731224"}

And I meet the head Doctor\nAnd he really  cares for the patient he's  with he listens closely to what you say and tell him he has the greatest  bed side manors and especially nice and gentle  . But # 1 young male nurse stood out the most with me on how he could get sumone to talk especially  when that someone  doesn't  wont to talk about how there injurys  surcome about . But I returned to  be checked  for  congestion  . He was so nice whn I meet him but he left the room while I was getting a  breathing  treatment  he had returned  20 min later and suggested that he had meet me before it disturbed me  cause I had never  seen him in my life time and neither had I been eczamend by him ever. But he had asked me was I feeling better I told him yes and proceeded to ask him about getting a  refill on my pain meds he said that I would  have to see the head doctor  for that I replied ok but asked him if he could write me chantix to stop smoking thn he proceeded to leave the room with a yes reply so I was happy to know I would  soon be a nonsmoker  I was just letting  him know about me needing to  quit , and be for I could say thank you he put his hands up in the air and replyed very hastily and snapped at me with these words I will never for get them either ( I  just cant deal with any of your problems  cause I deal anuff with  mine . ) I stopped so sudden and with shock and embarrassment cause I wasnt telling  him  anything about my problems so I walked to my door of the room I felt my emotions in my throat and I new I was fixing to bust into tears cause this doctor had no clue of what\nI went through weeks prior to  my 2ND.\nVisit   he spoke real loud then at me replying dont leave that room and step into the hall way to the nurses desk  and I wasnt goin to the nurses  station  and it struck me that I would be better off if I left and set up an appointment with  the head doctor!! But B4 i opened up the door to the lobby  area  he spoke loudly and hateful (DON'T  YOU LEAVE, YOU GET BACK HERE , IF YOU DONT YOU WILL NOT GET YOUR PRESCRIPTION ) But I was already embarrassed and felt awful and I told him I will just see the head doctor for my prescription and that he had no right to speak to me that way and I would  make sure I asked who was the doctor on duty  so  I would  never be seen by him ever again.  I never received a  apologie from him still to this day and I never did get to see the head doctor . Cause he put a complaint in  on me and the head doctor had a nurse to serve me with a  disclaimer that I was not to come back to any of the emergency  and urgent  care clinics  in   Tuscaloosa   so I still to this day wonder what his complaint  about me that was so extreme for me to be denied service for ever . All I done was leave because iv been physically, ppl and mentally ,emotionally abused all my life even as a child . And he had abused me mentally and emotionally  that it affected me  physically\" but he never took any blame or owed up to the medical  board about what he done ,and acted towards me and what manner he spoke to me . But iam still punished for  his abuse towards me .so I hope no one else has or have to go through what I did tht day . I NEVER WAS ASKED , OR SPOKEN TO BY ANYONE ABOUT THAT DAY .

This business doesn\u2019t take appointments for some reason (because they\u2019re stuck in a 1900\u2019s complacency mentality). Thereafter, I walked into the waiting room and there were only 3 visitors in total (including myself). No surprise there, given the fact that this place is a nightmare. I was rudely informed that I needed to fill out administrative work regarding my visit, and I asked if they already had my file (since I have been here before). They continued to explain that my file was old (it wasn\u2019t) and I needed to update information (not true). Around 1 hour later I was informed that INFORMATION was finalized. At this point, I was the only patient waiting for treatment. After a few more minutes of waiting I was finally called into the Patient\u2019s Entrance. Wow, the holy grail of treating a cold/sinus infection has finally gotten prepared to tell me I need a Z-pack. The doctor proceeded to ask me the same 4 questions 3 separate times.

Normally, if I end up leaving a review it is because I have experienced a dissatisfaction on numerous of occasions. Which, in this instance, is accurate yet again. Main Street is considerably close to my home and therefore mine and my families first stop. However, over the passed several months I have been very ill on-and-off. After being sick for nearly a week, I finally decided to make a trip to just try to get better. I was tested for both the strep and flu. However, both came back negative. This is a typical situation result when I come here. The last several visits I have been diagnosed with a \u201csinus infection\u201d, upper respiratory infection etc. When their PA told me last night I was negative again for flu and strep, with full knowledge knowing I 100% have both, I got incredibly frustrated. I told their PA, after she said it was probably just a sinus infection, that every time I come here that is what they diagnose me with. I have had to pay multiple doctors bills because of their misdiagnoses and having to seek out another doctor to properly diagnose me. To which each time, when I get tested elsewhere, it comes back positive. They said they gave me a \u201cshot\u201d to help speed the pain in my throat, and it is 5:30 in the morning and the pain in my throat is so severe there is ringing in my ear now which has woken me up in even more pain. So, once again I will have to pay ANOTHER doctor to diagnose me with what I know I have. This is incredibly exhausting. I don\u2019t know if it is malfunctioning testing machines or the lack of actual experienced doctors, but the fact that I have been awaken in such severe pain and body aches let\u2019s me know I once again did not receive the treatment I needed. With all of that said, the PA who was there did call me in a prescription for both the flu and strep after I complained I was tired of their diagnosis's continuously being that of a \u201csinus infection\u201d. I know if I let a good 48-72 hours of these medication stay in my system I will get better.

As a former RN, Legal Nurse Consultant, Nurse Investigator and Forensic Criminal Evidence Analyst, I\u2019ve dealt with many physicians and their staff. I arrived in extreme pain from a pulled muscle in my back. I have been covered by UHC since 6/23/18. My cards won\u2019t arrive until Monday. I explained this to the young man at the desk (Luis??) and the young blonde lady who came to \u201chelp\u201d later. I had my membership and group ID in hand and even called United Health Care 5 times in front of them and on speaker for verification. UHC gave them the number to verify the insurance, only they couldn\u2019t complete the process because they had no idea what their OWN tax ID number was! They needed this to complete verification through the automated process. After much frustration, I called UHC customer service back and the kind lady spoke with the man at the front desk DIRECTLY. They insisted they HAD to have the physical card. She explained they only needed verification and there was no more information on the card than what we had already provided (my Member ID number, the group number, and my Drivers license.) However, they DID need their own tax ID to complete the automated process which neither of them knew and neither bothered to investigate further (perhaps asking the doctor?!) Frustrated by their ignorance, she finally suggested I go elsewhere for medical  attention and mentioned for all to hear she had NEVER heard of anyone needing the physical card when they were clearly verifying coverage for me. I will NOT return and rest assured this will be all over my social media accounts as well. I did not appreciate their lack of caring or basic knowledge.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1531758427687, "text": "Maggie, I am sorry that your visit was not satisfactory.

I needed to take my mom to have a COVID test completed bc of exposure. I do not live in Tuscaloosa so this place was close to the hospital. #1 we were there at 8am and the place didn\u2019t open til 8:30am. At 8:30,while standing at the door in a line, the assistant didn\u2019t welcome anyone or give instructions she just started placing signs everywhere and sitting out a stand with paper and a COVID test taking instructions. Because I used common sense I took two papers in order for my mom and I to fill out. Once completed I walked inside to turn in and completely fill out the document. We received our first call to bring back insurance cards. Because I\u2019m from Ga, the receptionist asked for me to email a copy of my insurance card. She said she never received the emails so text her. She assured me that I had the correct email address three times. I had to text her my documents eventually. We took our test and we\u2019re told 24-48hrs results. I went back to GA and my mom took a rapid test at another location and received her results.  Crimson care did not offer rapid tests. Two days later on Sunday the 20th I called to get my results and I was told they did not have them ready or could not find them. On Monday the 21st I called 8 times to speak with someone and 3 times I was hung up on. I finally had received an incorrect email address email from the wrong email address the receptionist gave me. Today is December 27th and my mother still hast received her COVID results from this place. Overall this place needs more training on customer service and delivery during these unusual times.

The doctor then wanted to do bloodwork to confirm some thyroid issues (which is absolutely what needed to be done.) Three days later, I had to talk to three different people to get results, which they told they\u2019d call me about and never did. They told me to come back again for another panel and blood work. Again, I would have to call two days in a row to get my results from that test (they were in the system, but the doctor didn\u2019t sign off nor did he ever discuss them with me). He told me he wanted to refer me out and I explained (for now the fourth time at this point) that I was self pay and was concerned about the cost of a specialist. He told me he could do medication on site and we\u2019d wait for the blood results to confirm what he suspected. He later changed his mind and didn\u2019t feel comfortable treating me, but he also misdiagnosed me, so I was taking ineffective meds. Now, almost two months later, I just received two bills for a total of $1200.00 for the blood work performed\u2014 blood work!

I obviously went to a different doctor and had to pay $110 for the same bloodwork to be done because my new doctor couldn\u2019t trust this doctor.

That's what I would expect an ER visit to cost, not a simple urgent care visit. I wouldn't expect to pay more than $60 to $100 for urgent care. I called the office to complain about the amount they're charging and the person I spoke with was rude and didn't really hear me out. She just kept talking about health insurance and how much they will pay according to my policy. That's not what I was upset about. I was upset about how much you charged in the first place! I will never go here again. Dr. Bobo at EmergiCare is much better & works much more efficiently to get you in and out of the door with the medicine you need to get back to good health without charging you a small fortune.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a84f31d50999:0x977eb94120dbac58"}

You see, I came in Saturday for urgent care, and they told me is need to get a referral from my doctor in 72 hours, and my primary care doctor gave me a paper to bring to your front desk. I tried to take care of it over the phone, seeing as my PCP submitted the referral through the internet, but the front desk girl had \"no idea what to do here\" and kept putting me on hold to speak to someone named Erica. The first time was 20 minutes, then I hung up and called back, because this is something front desk ladies have been able to do at other medical offices. The second time, the front desk girl got snappy with me, explaining that there was a waiting room full of people waiting JUST for Erica. I explained to her that I'd had to receive COVID-19 testing this morning, and I didn't want to risk bringing the paper in, but this was a time sensitive issue, according to the paper this very office gave me. She told me I needed to stay home and wait on hold. I waited another 10 minutes on hold before I got in my car. I came in wearing a mask and explained to the front desk lady that I needed to give her the paper, which took all of like 20 seconds. I asked her if this could have been done over the phone, and she told me OF COURSE. I showed her where I was still on hold on my cell phone, making it over an hour on hold to get to Erica. So, I'd like to thank Erica and the sassy front desk lady for potentially helping to spread COVID-19, by putting me in a position where I either had to come in (despite potentially having COVID-19), or risk getting stuck with a bill I could not afford, due to their lack of time management.

I was skating at the skating rink (thinking I was alot younger than I actually am), fell extremely hard and landed on my finger.  I came to this urgent care at 8:40 p.m and the website and sign said they were open until 9:00. All of the lights and signs were turned off when I walked up to the door. Although the lady at the desk initially saw me I stood out there for several minutes. Finally she came out and said they saw their last patient at 8:30. I told her that I just needed someone to look at my finger to tell me if it was definitely broken and she said they couldn't do it. Honestly I just want her to read this so that she knows how much she let me down.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1553612401447, "text": "Hi Michael,\n\nI am so sorry for your negative experience and we will certainly be following up with our staff and take appropriate disciplinary action.
