They have gone above and beyond every single time. I'm not a crying person but they've made me cry twice. The good cry. The first time: I assume they saw the toy factory and smashed snacks in the carpet or maybe it was my food covered shirt and crazy hair. Either way, they gave me a note of encouragement that every mom needs sometimes with a gift card for coffee. The second time: I requested a larger loaner vehicle which is apparently hard to come by. Along with my 3 kids, my dad is in a wheelchair and I transport him to/from dialysis and we just all wouldn't fit in the smaller one. They greeted me with a \"one tough cookie\" box with treats and snacks galore.\n\nThey are the nicest people and so accommodating. Add uplifting to that mix.

Troy Andrews is that perfect person that you only hope to get whenever you drive into the parking lot of a car dealership! He did not come outside, ever, to hound me. We all hate that whenever it comes time to shop for a car- and they do NOT do that at this dealership! Furthermore, Troy was patient in answering my questions, and always a perfect gentleman!

I told him they could stop and I'll bring in the light myself after buying it cheaper elsewhere. He tells me I will still have to pay $135 for the diagnostic. No problem. He comes back and tells me it's already in. I ask well where is my car? He says they're finishing up. 45 minutes later he comes back and tells me that they put a new light in and it didnt work. Must be a wiring issue he said. So I said: \"So that $135 diagnostic u tried to charge me for wasn't even accurate? Because the diagnostic claimed I needed a new light.\" He never did answer.

Things didn't go quite as we had planned. Our SUV was cutting out pretty bad on the highway. It was getting worse the closer we got to Mobile. I contacted my friend who's daughter lives in Mobile to see if she might know of a service place. I talked with her daughter and she informed me that her husband, Kyle, worked for Joe Bullard Cadillac. She gave me the number for the service department and said to speak with Haley.  About this time the check engine light came on in our vehicle. It was flashing on and off, then would stay lit.\nWhen I spoke with Haley in the service department she asked about the service engine light. When I told her it had been flashing intermittently she was immediately concerned and said we should get stopped as quickly as we could to avoid internal engine damage.  She then helped us get started with finding a tow service. We were 50 miles aWay and had four people so their usual towing service couldn't do it, but she got the ball rolling for us. She gave me her direct phone number so I could call if I needed anything.\nOnce we got to the dealership Kyle helped us get a loaner car while ours was being repaired. Haley kept us informed as they learned what was wrong. Our technician, Mike, came in on Saturday to work on our vehicle because we needed to leave to head back to Missouri on Sunday.\nTo make a long story short...God used all of these people to help us during a difficult time. They made this experience so much less stressful than it could've been. THEY WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND TO HELP US! And, they did it all with a smile.

What I didn't like was that the mechanics were excessively rough with my vehicle. I had to have it towed and the towing company left it at the gate. Christian got me a loaner car, which I appreciated very much. When I picked up the loaner there were 2 guys who were trying to get it started to get it up to the shop. I needed to grab a couple things out of my car so I stopped to do that. For some reason they needed to open the back hatch. I was traveling with my animals so I had a large kennel in the back. I watched them put my seats down (rather roughly) and sling my kennel from the back to atop the back seats. It made me cringe but at this point I needed to get going as I had some stops to make and  I thought surely they knew what they were doing, this is a Cadillac dealership afterall and these cars cost a lot. They will surely be careful... When I got my car back, instead of them putting the vehicle back they way they found it, the kennel was still strown across the back. (As a plus though, it was washed! Which I appreciated since I had been on the road and try to take care of my car!) When I went to move the kennel back in place I noticed that there are scrapes across the plastic sides in the back. Greeeeaaaaaat. But, at that point I was leaving to head back to my home state and couldn't worry about it. It was more important to get home safe. They told me in addition to the battery that I needed new air filters, a rear wiper blade, and the throttle body cleaned, all easy enough for me to do myself. So, now I am here doing said maintenance and when I popped the hood I immediately noticed that my positive battery terminal clip has been broken and won't stay shut. Great. I am now back home, 3 states away. I will be back to the area, and am considering moving my family there but if they don't make this right I will find a different dealership to maintenance at.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1517174513045, "text": "Hi Jami,\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave your review and detailed feedback.

The problem today was a broken window regulator on the rear driver's side.  My wife has been the sole driver of this car.  We have no children in then home.  My conservative guess is that this window has been lowered and raised no more than 10 times in its aborted lifetime.  My wife was told a plastic roller had broken.  A plastic roller in a $50,000 (2004) Cadillac?!  My bill:  $517.23!  I can go back through my invoices and find similar instances of shoddy work and padded bills.  During the second year we owned the car the driver side dash assembly fell off the dash while my wife was driving.  At around the 4-5 year of ownership your service supervisor convinced my wife that she needed to replace all four tires (around 10,000 miles) because they had \"dry-rotted.\" ($800)  I've owned two Cadillac De Ville's prior to this, and have never experienced what has to be either poor construction, low-quality parts, or untruthful service managers.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da8e0caaef5:0xa8eb3c2a1737d68b"}

He offered his help and we told him we were in town to Christmas shop not spend all day at a dealership, we just wanted to try the car on for size. he escorted us inside for coffee and cocoa and went to get the car. we test drove it. we loved it but we were not there to spend all day at the dealership. we left our personal information to be reviewed and were going to shop when Darren notified us that we would be using the cadillac for the day via loaner form approval. we really enjoyed using the car. we Christmas shopped all day and when we returned to the dealership we had been approved for the car with our payments within dollars of request. Jon McCartney had to have been the most professional financial manager i have ever encountered. He was a real person who made us feel right at home and comfortable to speak openly. very friendly and personable. then Roosevelt Harris enters the picture. a gem. a diamond in the rough. so charismatic so joyful and helpful and accomodating. I cannot put into words how much Darren helped to familiarize us with the cue and features. he was so knowledgable of the cars systems. he was an absolute treasure. I cant say but one thing about Joe Bullards team, \"you are doing something right\". I got hugs from everyone when i left. i felt like i was part of a family there. I even got a text message from Darren on Christmas morning wishing us a merry Christmas. i literally spent 2 hrs tops at the dealership and received the most beautiful CHristmas gift I could have ever dreamed of. but the most inportant thing was the environment and kindness that we experienced while there. oh and my son loved the lounge with computers and coffee/cocoa which made his time there enjoyable also. we will definitely reccomend Joe Bullard Cadillac to friends and family and we will definitely be repeat customers ourselves. my only hope is that we have the privilege of having the same staff in years to come. Thank you so very much.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da8e0caaef5:0xa8eb3c2a1737d68b"}
