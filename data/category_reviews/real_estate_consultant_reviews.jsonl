A quick google search finds that you are a newly licensed real estate agent here in Huntsville, and therefore a competitor of our business.

I find it quite troubling that you would try to damage our reputation when my wife and I have worked so hard to build and maintain a 5-star rating over the course of the past 8 years.  We have helped hundreds of local homeowners sell their homes, and collectively saved them hundreds of thousands of dollars in traditional real estate commissions.  Our actual customers absolutely love the service we offer.  And in fact, the agents that we personally interact with also appreciate our promptness and professionalism.  Lastly, I would point out that your leaving a review on a competitor's company is a direct violation of the NAR's Code of Ethics...from NAR...\"REALTORS\u00ae do not attempt to gain any unfair advantage over their competitors; and they refrain from making unsolicited comments about other practitioners.\"\nDue to the obvious conflict of interest of being a competitor, we respectfully request that you remove this review.

Our actual customers absolutely love the service we offer.  And in fact, the agents that we personally interact with also appreciate our promptness and professionalism.

This super woman had us ready to close in less than a month! Cindy works really hard and really fast to get the job done. It was as easy as pie lol. And Pam, this woman is so sweet and lovely but, don't let that fool you. She can get tough if need be to get the job done. We had issues with our builders making MANY mistakes and dragging out the closing date. Pam wouldn't let up on them till they got the job done right! Pam was so caring during the hunt for our home and helped us through the entire process. She was there to answer our questions whenever we had them. She has a great eye for detail and noticed things I never would have noticed when looking at homes. She really took notice to what I like and what I was looking for in a home. She read my personality well. We finally found the home of our dreams (a french country spec home). We were not expecting to deal with problems from the building company but we did. As soon as problems started to arise I thought I would become extremely stressed out but Pam stepped in and handled everything. I am truly thankful for everything Pam and Cindy did for us. I can't wait to get our house settled and decorated so I can invite these two ladies to our home warming party. We would not be in such a lovely home had it not been for these two wonderful ladies holding our hands through the entire process. Thank you so much Pam and Cindy!!!

After you reported the leak on Sunday, May 27, during the Memorial Day weekend, the leak was assigned to a third-party contractor for completion. Regrettably, the shower drain requires a special tool to repair and the contractor did not have such tool available at the time they were on the property on May 27 (the same day you reported the leak). Based on the documented emails and telephone calls between you, your husband (Mr. Forbes) and our office, we attempted to reschedule the shower leak repair multiple times during a time when you or your husband would be present. Unfortunately, due to several miscommunications by the parties involved, this leak was elevated to an emergency status that would allow access to be granted without your presence and/or permission as per the terms of your lease. We entered your premises on June 8, less than two weeks after you reported the leak, to complete the repair by the contractor while being supervised by one of our employees. After we entered your premises, several lease violations were then noted - including the presence of multiple breeds of pets that previously were not disclosed by you or your husband.  We understand your concern about our respect for our residents and their rights; however, the owners of the property also have a responsibility and rights to protect their property (and your home). After an extended period of time not being able to schedule a time when all parties could be present, the owner\u2019s rights to protect the property from continued damage from the leak were enforced - which triggered other property rights issues that we are attempting to work with you for you to bring into compliance with the terms of our lease. We do appreciate your tenancy since mid-May 2018 and apologize that our relationship has degraded in the short time you have been a resident in Alabama. Hopefully, we may be able to better serve you in the future and avoid any further miscommunications or lease violations."}, "gmap_id": "0x88891bec3e7601ab:0xeb291356c63d2968"}

Being a former Realtor myself in Tennessee, I'm aware of the responsibility an agent has to their client.  When we hired Mr. Stanton, we were pleased with his feedback and demeanor.  As time passed the feedback, both from his weekly calls stopping and the review emails from the property viewings, slowed down significantly, however we would still consider it satisfactory.  Throughout listing our property with Mr. Stanton, we provided him with all of the information he requested.  However, 36 hours from closing, we were told that we would have to pay our property pool assessment to the tune of $4700.  It was our understanding this would be assumed by the new buyers.  At first he said that he didn't want to go around and around if we told him or not (which we did upon hiring him), but he was aware of our other assessment, so the logic of knowing one but not the other makes no sense.  As I stated in an email to him, even if we pretend that we didn't pass along the information, he's presented himself as one of the most knowledgable and successful agents in the area with lot of experience at the Gulf Shores Plantation.  How would an expert agent who does business there all the time, not be aware to ask about an assessment that began a year and a half ago, which all units there had.  He then proceeded to tell us that he checked on it and the assessment was non-transferrable and could not be assumed by the buyer, which we double checked with our HOA and that was untrue.  We had to pay it because our agent didn't negotiate that on our behalf in the contract.  We gave him a grace period to do something to make it right and were basically told that it just was what it was.  Instead, Mr. Stanton tried to force the situation/closing like everything was common practice.  Had any effort been shown to correct this or any financial responsibility whatsoever been taken, we absolutely wouldn't have posted reviews on every website we could.  As we indicated to the company before closing, with this not happening, we felt like we needed to let our HOA, others rental services and the general public know our experience with Mr. Stanton and Exit Realty.\n\nOne of their brokers/owners stepped in to call us to see what could be done and apologized repeatedly, saying he believed it was an honest mistake and that it has changed how they will do things in the future.  He said on all future transactions, they will have a disclosure form for things like assessments.  First, I am shocked that's not already common practice as I know in Tennessee everything has a disclosure.  Second, I am glad that this error may have changed how Exit Realty does business, but it was at $4700 of my expense.  We hope this helps anyone who is looking to list or buy in the future and will assist you in assuring the same thing doesn't happen to anyone else", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0546b1066981:0xc327fec7a2544bfa"}

The few times I had any issues, like a small incident with the city dumping tree trimmings where I would park, he was super responsive and helpful in resolving the issue almost immediately.\n\nThe house itself was great and the location was super convenient.  It was a less than 10 minute drive to downtown, grocery stores, and the mall by exit ten, but also a quiet enough neighborhood that I could feel at home at the end of my day.  It was also a two block walk to Lakebottom Park, which really can't be beat.\n\nProbably the best part of my experience with renting from Dave though, was that he is 100% serious about looking out for people who have rented from him.  While moving to a new duty station, I contacted him asking if he wouldn't mind being a reference on a lease application.  He had the reference forms filled out and sent back to me just a couple hours later.

We considered this to be an emergency case and immediately contacted the homeowner. A vendor was approved to visit the property. Upon inspection the tech found no odor that would be related to organic matter. The home was in need of a good cleaning but there were no visible signs of organic matter as well. The water heater was unable to be checked due to no power being on in the home, the tech did check for leaks and found none in its current state. Other issues throughout the home were noted and included in an estimate, the owner approved for all repairs to be made at your earliest convenience. You refused to schedule with the vendor and requested to terminate the lease. The owner approved your request on April 15th, we are currently in the process of closing your account. If you have any questions please contact our office at 844-793-4948, we will be happy to assist."}, "gmap_id": "0x88891985f1bfc583:0xaa6f2e53245f2f24"}

We dealt with several different Realtors over an 18 month period, with the last 9 months being spent working with Donna.  We both feel BLESSED that we found Donna when we began looking in the Foley, Alabama area.  Donna is extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  She was friendly while remaining professional.  She guided us and advised us and was there at every step of our journey.  She made herself available, promptly responded to any phone calls, texts or emails and checked in with us from time to time to be sure she was updated on where we were in our decisions.  We knew Donna worked with people who bought and sold homes in a much higher price range than we were planning to spend...yet, she treated us with every bit as much respect and attention as someone spending 10 times our budget.  I couldn't imagine anyone doing a better job than Donna Fitts.  Only a month after moving into our new home in Foley, we are already utilizing her in another real estate deal and have recommended her to neighbors who are looking to sell their home.  If you need a realtor and are searching in an area that Donna works is.....do yourself a favor and contact her.

It is never OK with me if anyone associated with our business is treating, or even gives the perception of treating our customers unprofessionally.   That will be dealt with immediately.  In addition, I have added my personal cell phone number to our Contact page so if anyone ever has any issues at all, they can call me directly instead of letting any frustration about the process build to a breaking point as it appears happened here.\n\nTo address another point in your review, my company, Listed It Myself, LLC, is incorporated in Huntsville.  My wife Christy and I also live in Huntsville.  For the MLS portion of our services, it is necessary to have a real estate brokerage.  In Huntsville, our brokerage is ListedItMyself Real Estate Group, LLC, and here in Birmingham, our partnered broker is Legacy Home Realty.  We have tried to be as transparent on this arrangement as possible on our website through our blog post https://listeditmyself.com/huge-improvements-to-our-mls-listing-service-option/ and I have also inserted additional links to this information on our FAQ page and our How It Works page.  Either way, if a customer has a problem in Huntsville or Birmingham, they can call me directly and I will work to resolve whatever the issue may be.\n\nIn the more than five years we have been in business, we have taken pride in the fact that we have helped hundreds of very happy customers successfully sell their homes and collectively save millions of dollars in traditional real estate commission.  I know that the hard work that Brandon Harder here in our Birmingham area puts in to marketing these homes is a key factor to their many successes.  Because I know how hard he works for our customers, it makes a review like this more difficult to swallow.

When I initially asked the front desk clerk if it would be okay to pay my 1st months rent,  and since I was there, give her a check for the upcoming months rent. I don't live in Montevallo and the property I was renting was in Alabaster. So since you can't pay rent online, I gave the post dated check so that I wouldn't have to drive back to Montevallo. I was assured TWICE by the clerk that this was okay. Fast forward after I paid my initial deposit as well as first month's rent. They decided to also deposit my post dated check for the upcoming month. Leaving me with an NSF due to the fact that the postdated amount wasn't accounted for in my monthly budget. ESPECIALLY after you already received $2,000 from me within a weeks time. I called and spoke with JOSH who verbally assaulted me and basically called me a criminal for writing bad checks. After he informed me that it's not their policy to take a post dated check and he doesn't know where I got that info from. I LITERALLY GOT IT FROM THE FRONT DESK  CLERK!!!! HE took no ownership, did not apologize, complained about a $50 fee he would have to pay b/c of my returned check and then hung up in my face. The crazy thing about this whole situation is that the check cleared on my end. My bank LITERALLY cleared the check and just charged me an NSF fee. All I wanted was my $30 back. He didn't even have the human decency to listen to what I was telling him before becoming beligerent!! This company is the absolute worst that I have ever dealt with in my life.

I've have tried calling their sales office, I was told to call corporate, I called corporate and got voicemail.\n\nMy house is about 4 years old.  Well out of warranty.  But, most of the poor workmanship appears after the warranty period has ended.  My master bath and entrance to our master bedroom has severe structural problems.  The cracks you see have been re-plastered and painted more than once.  Forget about doors closing properly.  The doors have been trimmed to such an extent that a new door will be required for the bedroom.  The framing issues you may have will not be covered by your warranty and will not appear until a few years after you own your home.  Once they do, you will find yourself spending a lot of money to repair.\n\nIf framing were the only issue, I probably would not write the review.  I never do this kind of thing.  But the electrical was done so poorly that it nearly burned the house down.  The left exposes copper to aluminum high voltage line exposed in a junction box.  The result was blowing out the double oven's control panel.  This resulted in an expensive repair to the ovens, but could have easily resulted in a fire.   Again-- the kind of thing that happens well after your warranty period has expired.\n\nThe problem I have with Woodland, is that their \"quality\" is only skin deep.  They have a great marketing staff, but once your in your house and a year has passed you are on your own to deal with the poor workmanship that lies just below the surface.  No builder is perfect.  But, it would be nice if they built to code.

The sub-contractors don\u2019t keep up with their warranty repairs and Woodland doesn\u2019t follow-up with you after closing unless you are constantly in contact with them. Check my review of Custom Interior Trim to see just how their subs act and treat customers.\n\nTheir warranty team is an absolute joke. They don\u2019t follow-up, they don\u2019t coordinate, and if you aren\u2019t keeping them in line, they just let your items slide off the radar.\n\nThey have shown a complete lack of professionalism ever since we closed. I will admit, we love the house itself. It\u2019s good quality, the design process was fun, and we felt like the options they had to choose from were exactly in line with what we wanted, but the worst mistake I ever made was trusting that they would continue their great service after having closed on the house. If you don\u2019t listen to anything else, just hear me when I say do NOT let them close on your house until they finish everything. It has truly been bad enough that I regret ever choosing them as a builder, no matter how much we do like the house itself.\n\nAnd again, if I\u2019m being completely honest, the staff that they have are nice people. I mean I have legitimately enjoyed dealing with most of their staff, but I\u2019ve also had to do their job for them. I have to do all of the follow-up to make sure people are showing up to do their warranty repairs. I\u2019ve had to coordinate with the warranty department and the subs to make sure they had all of the correction items listed.\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting dealing with Woodland and their lack of support for Warranty customers. I\u2019ve told them this multiple times, but if they would put just as much care into how they treat and deal with Warranty customers as they do with new customers still in the building process, they would be a nearly flawless business. Until then, they deserve this negative review and more. I\u2019ve spoken with multiple people in my neighborhood who can corroborate this story and would say the same thing themselves. We have warned people we know away from Woodland specifically because of this and away from some of the specific sub contractors they use. Horrible customer service, dismal professionalism, and a demeanor that says \u201cyou as a customer don\u2019t matter to us as much as the new build customers.\u201d", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1617991364735, "text": "Blake,\n\nThank you for the kind words regarding your home building experience with Woodland Homes. We are happy to hear that you had a fun experience and enjoyed our process of building. Next, we would like to say that we understand your frustrations with warranty. We are in fact struggling with time lines and subcontractors. At this time North Alabama and surrounding areas are experiencing a housing boom. This combined with the struggles of building a product in the midst\u2019s of a global pandemic have made it difficult to obtain products for some of our customers warranty requests.\n\nIt is also difficult to keep subs motivated when they have so much work to choose from in front of them. This is just the honest truth, and the reality of the world we are living in.  That said we understand it is frustrating to wait on your items to be completed. While it may take us a little longer to complete a warranty item we are getting to all of our customers and completing their warranty requests. In fact, we have even extended specific warrantable items past the agreed upon 1 year term in order to ensure our customers are happy, and have their items completed .\n\nSince we don\u2019t know your full name there is no way to reach out directly. We would encourage you to call your onsite sales person and get them involved to assist you, or even call our corporate office and ask for the president of the company.

The personnel in the home office were welcoming and professional. During the build I hired a home inspector who found major errors with the home.

Upon walking through my home I found basic issues with the craftsmanship that should\u2019ve been addressed by the site manager, if he had completed a walk thru of the home. Once the home was complete a final walk thru was scheduled. I found the same issues as the last walk thru. At this point, if you don\u2019t address the problem it\u2019s often overlooked. I refused to sign for the keys. As a buyer I felt rushed to sign for the keys to the home, that wasn\u2019t ready.

The subcontractors provided poor quality of work. No disrespect, but the attention to detail lacked, for my home. I hope no one has to go through what I did. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s due to the number of homes Woodland is trying to build or is this the standard issue with Woodland across the board. I didn\u2019t want to come off as a complainer, so I asked around my neighborhood and many of us shared the same problems. This is not to bash Woodland. The homes, cosmetically looks great, I think more effort needs to be made to build a better quality home for the price and oversight of the subcontractors is a must. If this doesn\u2019t happen hold the site manager accountable. The warranty department shouldn\u2019t make people feel like they are the problem. The subcontractors need to do their job and provide a quality product.

It actually defies logic that I could desire so much to live there, be impressed with what I saw, and have the experiences I have had. Maybe it is coincidence but I don\u2019t think so. I will simply state what happened and let the reader decide. I have seriously looked at Woodland homes 4 times. The first experience was positive but I was afraid of the road in and out of the area so I decided not to buy. The last 3 times I had resolved that fear and wanted to purchase a house from Woodland homes. The first of these three, I spoke with an associate. He showed me a lot and gave me a price for a home on the lot. He said we had to see his boss. I did so and she literally panicked. She said he gave me the wrong price. I said ok and left. The second of these 3 times, Woodland homes sent me an email with an advertisement for a house already built. It was priced in the range we were looking for. We made an appointment with the aforementioned realtor and spent 30 minutes looking at the home. It had one feature we did not like but we were about to make an offer when she said oh no, this house has been sold. She added, but we can build you one like it on another lot. We spent a couple of hours looking at lots and found 3 we liked. She said she would send us the prices on all three. The result was that the lot we wanted was not available for the house we wanted to build on it and the other two had prices that were 40 to 50 thousand dollars more than the one we looked at. Not exactly the same price...The last time my wife met with a different realtor and got prices for several models one of which was built and the other almost completed. You have probably guessed what happened. I showed up with the checkbook only to find that all of the homes with quoted prices were much higher than documented on the plans provided to my wife. The one we really wanted was about $70,000 more. The other home already built was about 40,000 dollars more than documented on the plans.We left and will not return.

However, if you are looking for top quality and attention to detail, you would be better off with another builder. They build homes quickly - maybe too quickly as evidenced by some of the problems we have experienced.  After living in our home for two years, a light switch in our dining room which was not in use at the time suddenly sparked and popped and caused a breaker to blow.  I called an electrician who discovered that the wiring was barely connected which caused arcing and sparking.  He then checked a few more light switches and outlets to find that about half of them were loose and sloppily constructed.  I ended up paying for the electrician to inspect every light switch and electrical plug in my home. I have also had to replace wiring in the electrical box because of a humming noise.\nWhen you build a home with Woodland, they schedule you for a one day marathon of dealing with the contract staff and their design team.  You must be prepared to make ALL decisions in one day.  Their design center has a limited number of choices and you have no time to research products. Don't assume that they offer quality products, either.  Price Pfister products were their plumbing choice at the time I built my home. Huge mistake.  If I had known how crappy this brand was, I would have insisted on Delta products. That goes for wood floors also.  I chose a \"premium\" product for an additional cost only to find after it started denting and scratching immediately that it was made out of a soft eucalyptus based engineered wood.  I have already replaced half of it with a nice Hickory engineered wood that has held up beautifully- even in high traffic.\nI was not happy with either their ceramic tile selection or carpet choices but had no option other than to pick what I disliked the least.  Apparently, most of my neighbors did the same because we all have the same back splash.

Her voicemail states that it could take up to 24 hours to return call and that email would be quicker.  When I called for brick type it took 3 weeks and I sent an email.  THREE WEEKS!  My fault for forgetting to get shingle type, but now my contractor is ready to shingle my garage.  It has been 24 hours since I left a voicemail.  I have sent 3 emails and left 2 voice mails.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626897a1fd8d25:0x85114f992ebfd966"}
