One of my favorite parts of the day was getting a box of polaroids at the end of the night - along with the film shots later. He can take any space/venue and make it look elegant - even our small backyard ceremony! You can choose a photographer who's style you like, or choose a photographer who's style constantly evolves and adapts with each individual wedding. All the weddings Nick has photographed look amazing, but I don't think you fully appreciate the talent until you see yourself captured by it.

During that time, I texted him to gain an understanding of what the cost would be. He asked a few questions and then never got back with me. Since I had used him on 2 other occasions (most recently 9 months ago) and his prices were reasonable... and this session would be no more work than the previous sessions, I didn't press the issue and figured we would just discuss it later. Well..when I texted him a month before the event to confirm my date, he mentioned he noticed he had never responded to my text regarding the price.  After asking a few more questions he came back with a price of $800?!?!?!??? This is almost as much as I paid for my wedding pictures and they were ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS with tons of editing (much better than any session that we had with Joel). I have spoken with several licensed photographers since this time and NONE of them charge anywhere near this high. Going price for this type of session was $150-450 for a 1-2 hr session and digital photos (Max). Unfortunately this put me in a real bind because now it was extremely hard to find another photographer that was available for my date. Joel mentioned he would come down to $550...but this was still higher than \"average\". This high pricing also was not in line with the pricing on his website. Although he did not have Maternity specifically listed, he had Engagement Sessions for the same length of time (2 hr session and digital photos) for $400 and this was synonymous to my requested session since it would be only me and my husband for a couple of hours. Given that he put me in such a stressful bind at an already stressful time in my life, I would definitely NOT recommend him. I tried to work out the pricing with him to be more reasonable and even explained my issue of having troubles finding someone else this late...but he was unwilling to work with me...even though he knew that it was his fault because he never answered my text regarding pricing 3+ months ago. Do yourself a favor...use someone who responds to text messages and honors pricing listed on their website. At a minimum,  select someone who is willing to take responsibility when they make a mistake...that unfortunately does not appear to be Joel at Yellowhammer. :(", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1562982443833, "text": "Thanks for taking the time to share your feedback.

He assisted us through the whole process helping us select the moments we wanted to capture. He gave us a beautiful video while staying within our budget. He is professional and personable. We had our DJ drop out at the last minute and he assisted us with finding a new one, DJ Scott Blakely was AWESOME!  I highly recommend Joe and Scott and I would definitely hire them again!!! Thank you both so much for helping us make our wedding a party and helping create a beautiful keepsake!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88623f5ac6644e45:0x2d7d8c31505a4dab"}

He thinks  outside the typical box to create videos and images that are unique and memorable. He created a beautiful video of my horses and farm; he used his drone and the camera that lets him move with the horses and not jiggle. He\u2019s very professional and easy to work with. Although I\u2019d recommend him for anything image related, after seeing my video, I think he would be especially great for outdoor weddings or events.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88623f5ac6644e45:0x2d7d8c31505a4dab"}
