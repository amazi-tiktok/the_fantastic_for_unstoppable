I took them home and 2 of the plants have done great but by the following Thursday the third plant had completely shriveled up and died.  It took me another week to get to the greenery to show them my dead plant. When I brought it to the front counter and showed them the plant, they quizzed me on when I watered it and where I put it and then proceeded to tell me it was a very finicky plant \ud83c\udf31 and I stated my other plants were fine and hadn\u2019t had a plant die in 4 days ever.  I suggested a replacement but they just made me feel like it was my fault it died so tough luck.  They were not rude but also not helpful.  I walked away from the counter shaking my head.  I feel like with so many competitors and options of places to shop that in the end helping me and switching it out would have been no big deal at all.  It was a $14.99 plant.

The lady there quickly got on the defensive and stated, we can't take that back in a nasty and rude way.

I told her I have an irrigation system.  She asked me how much water it is putting out, I responded, \"I don't know the exact output yet, but all the other plants are doing well which is a good indication.\"  And that was not good enough for her.  So, I just gave up.  It was clearly going to be an issue not worthy of the stress.
