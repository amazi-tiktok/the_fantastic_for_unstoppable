However Isaiah was as nice as he could be and very much informative. There was not one question (trust me I was full of them) where he didn't have an answer nor give me that dumbfounded look as if I should have known the answer before I even asked. He took the time to explain to me in detail of each and every single question and concerns I had. (Other CBD stores I have went into in the past I was treated right the opposite as they tried pushing their products on me and not even really knowing much about the products. Needless to say I didn't purchase anything from them.) Isaiah not once tried pushing anything on me at all. He simply answered all the questions I had showed me the products as he explained each one to me.  I sure didn't mean to keep him after hours however I am glad he Did Not mind at all and didn't shove me out the door with just anything.

The pickup window I chose was between 4:00 to 5:00 p.m. they sent me a message at 4:00 saying my groceries were delayed. 6: 00 p.m. they send me another email saying my groceries are ready to pick up so I sent my husband to go get them. After 30 minutes of him waiting I called Walmart and the poor department head (which I felt really bad for him) Said that he walked into a mess and he had been working 14 hours that day. I asked him how long he thought it would be for my groceries to come out to the car and he told me he honestly had no idea. I asked him to go ahead and just cancel my order and my husband came home. About 7:00 to 8:00 p.m. I went on to whole foods and placed my order and my groceries were here the next morning.

The cashiers sometimes take this one step further---any complaints we've had about something we've bought (we bought some expired hummus once...we were overcharged once...etc) have been taken care of with a replacement---no questions asked. Also, WF is willing to track down and order items you're interested in. Not only that, but they then tend to keep that item in stock! :) The only thing I can't give a positive review of is their buffet. While there are plenty of options at the buffet---even for vegans, the food just isn't that good. And it's a bit pricey. Twice we have eaten there, and twice we have been disappointed.

By now, it's been open 4 months or so and I will assume has hit its stride.\n\nThe hot bar/salad bar area is definitely below average.  It's been the same dried out meat, sweet potatoes and other southern items ever since it opened and the variety is lackluster at best.  Did I mention the meat is always dried out?\n\nThe labels on the hot/salad bar are not always there and I don't trust the ingredients.  The stir fry obviously contained vegetables that weren't on the label - I believe bamboo shoots.  Coupled with missing labels, the degree of confidence in the food is mediocre.\n\nThe asian rice bowl and mexican food sections are decent as well.  It's a bit disappointing to me that they use dark meat chicken for both places.  Again, the meat did not look fresh either.  At the rice bowl, they couldn't answer questions as far as ingredients for people with food allergies.\n\nLastly, the selection in the actual store itself is significantly smaller than other Whole Foods in Atlanta and Nashville.  While not every special snowflake request can be satisfied for food allergies, their depth and breadth of gluten free products was disappointing.  No gluten free croutons and other limited options are not what I would have expected in a Whole Foods.  The new Walmart neighborhood market had an equally competitive selection for less price.\n\nSo overall, compared to other Whole Foods, this one is.. bleh.  The layout is significantly smaller than the Whole Foods in Franklin, TN and the selection is limited.  It is simply not that impressive for its reputation.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cbabd5191c3:0x16c5e3cca9032ebd"}
