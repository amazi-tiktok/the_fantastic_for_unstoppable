We were in Birmingham at the Sheraton hotel and were searching for a nearby convenience store. It seemed okay initially. Until we went inside...it was horrible! There were some shady looking people inside we noticed immediately but I soon forgot about the people when I saw the condition of this \"store\". It smelled, it was hot, a lot of the food had gone bad. All the beverage refrigerators were hot. Except for the beer, the beer was on ice! There was a food counter in the back where old cooked food had been left out to rot! There was a lady in line with about 10 daycare kids buying snacks, I felt so bad for them. They deserve better conditions. I wouldn't feed my dogs out of this place, it was disgusting! My husband asked the owner why everything was hot and spoiled, he came up with some lame excuse that he has lost $2500 worth food because someone didn't fix his freezers 2 weeks ago!

How it goes from coming in today to never even being ordered is beyond me, but somebody isn't telling the truth. Then the same senior lady remarks, oh yall are the ones from yesterday. No apology for the inconvenience, nothing.\n\nAsked for a manager and explain how we've now made two 60 mile trips. He just shrugs it off saying the ads were made 2 weeks ago and they just weren't able to get it in stock. I asked if we could at least get a raincheck or the $16.99 at a discount. NOPE. \"In these times \" they just can't predict blah blah blah.  I pointed out that in these times, a simple update to apps and websites would remove misleading sales they know they can't fulfill.\n\nAt the same time I was speaking to the manager, my husband was speaking to the butcher about just getting one of the 16.99 lb tenderloins and he says, oh they're all gone, we used them as substitutes for customers yesterday.

I trained with a man named Shane and he conned an elderly lady into purchasing overpriced steaks and stole a few of them when she wasn't looking so he could sell them twice and make extra money. He would spend half the day at a drug house getting high instead of working and then complain about not being able to pay me because we had a bad day.

I am now giving this store a 1 star because  of employees. I guess the nice employees that were helpful and kind are gone. I was in your store today 10/28/20 between 8:30-8:45am. I needed help scanning a pack of chicken because the bar code was split and and wouldn\u2019t scan. I asked the worker managing the fast check out for help and she already gave me an attitude. She said she was the only one there and that I should have taken my things to a cashier because I had too many things. I thought the self check out lines with the long conveyor belts were for that reason and frankly I can check out myself a lot faster and can sort my groceries better. This is a worker who was rude to me before especially during the beginning of the pandemic. At that time I decided I wasn\u2019t going to shop here anymore because she was so rude. Months have gone by and I decided to give it another try.  Sometimes she\u2019s a greeter and when I come in to shop she never greets me doesn\u2019t even look my way. That\u2019s fine I don\u2019t care. But today with her rude attitude i just felt like it needed to be addressed because it makes me not want to shop here again. She fixed the problem for me  but not without complaining. Mostly complaining because she was manning the express check out alone. But no one was  checking out at the time I asked for help. She was wearing  an animal print mask and has medium length hair, older woman. I tried to see her name tag but it was flipped over and her hair was covering it. Sorry for the rant. I usually keep to myself but that was just unacceptable today. I buy A LOT from your store and you may have just lost a customer all together. Also one other woman is rude to me. She\u2019s also older with straight hair and blunt bangs. And smokes. I onlly know because I see her take her breaks by the soda machines and she\u2019s smoking. They have the same attitude. Never kind or friendly, at least when I\u2019m there. If a worker has that affect on a person where it makes them not want to shop in your store, then something\u2019s not right. Sorry.\n\n*****original review******i shop here quite a good bit and the staff is always so friendly. There is one tall, young lady who helps people at self check out who is so friendly and social. I always appreciate her. The produce department is not the greatest though, wilted greens, moldy strawberries, not fully stocked. I cook (privately for a small community) for a living and I always buy fresh, but this store isn\u2019t the best place to get any produce. Some of the bakery bread that I see at the big Walmart doesn\u2019t sell here and I wish they did. If I could 5 stars to staff only I would, but unfortunately, product is just as important.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889227464377463:0x586371779166bb58"}

I live maybe half a mile from this place and I find myself going to other stores just to avoid this poorly run establishment. Where to start? Well, the customer service is a JOKE. I think most of their employees view this place as somewhere where they can cut up, joke around, slack off,and get a paycheck. Most of them should be sent to Publix for a day or two so they can learn how employees should treat customers and maybe how to have a little civilization and manners. You don't get the \"hello sir or mam how can I help you today?\" like you would get at a Publix. At this location you get a \"what you need?\". Also, call me crazy, but I'm not big on stockers and workers walking around with pants drooping so low that their underwear is exposed, but that's common here. Other then that, the store isn't very neat and tidy. Its usually messy with misplaced items all over. The store usually doesn't come off as clean either. All I know is that I go to other Walmart Neighborhood Markets and they are night and day compared to this one and you have to ask why..In my opinion this store is a prime example as to what happens when management doesn't do their jobs and tolerates kind of a no pride attitude from their staff.

The pickup window I chose was between 4:00 to 5:00 p.m. they sent me a message at 4:00 saying my groceries were delayed. 6: 00 p.m. they send me another email saying my groceries are ready to pick up so I sent my husband to go get them. After 30 minutes of him waiting I called Walmart and the poor department head (which I felt really bad for him) Said that he walked into a mess and he had been working 14 hours that day. I asked him how long he thought it would be for my groceries to come out to the car and he told me he honestly had no idea. I asked him to go ahead and just cancel my order and my husband came home. About 7:00 to 8:00 p.m. I went on to whole foods and placed my order and my groceries were here the next morning.

The cashiers sometimes take this one step further---any complaints we've had about something we've bought (we bought some expired hummus once...we were overcharged once...etc) have been taken care of with a replacement---no questions asked. Also, WF is willing to track down and order items you're interested in. Not only that, but they then tend to keep that item in stock! :) The only thing I can't give a positive review of is their buffet. While there are plenty of options at the buffet---even for vegans, the food just isn't that good. And it's a bit pricey. Twice we have eaten there, and twice we have been disappointed.

By now, it's been open 4 months or so and I will assume has hit its stride.\n\nThe hot bar/salad bar area is definitely below average.  It's been the same dried out meat, sweet potatoes and other southern items ever since it opened and the variety is lackluster at best.  Did I mention the meat is always dried out?\n\nThe labels on the hot/salad bar are not always there and I don't trust the ingredients.  The stir fry obviously contained vegetables that weren't on the label - I believe bamboo shoots.  Coupled with missing labels, the degree of confidence in the food is mediocre.\n\nThe asian rice bowl and mexican food sections are decent as well.  It's a bit disappointing to me that they use dark meat chicken for both places.  Again, the meat did not look fresh either.  At the rice bowl, they couldn't answer questions as far as ingredients for people with food allergies.\n\nLastly, the selection in the actual store itself is significantly smaller than other Whole Foods in Atlanta and Nashville.  While not every special snowflake request can be satisfied for food allergies, their depth and breadth of gluten free products was disappointing.  No gluten free croutons and other limited options are not what I would have expected in a Whole Foods.  The new Walmart neighborhood market had an equally competitive selection for less price.\n\nSo overall, compared to other Whole Foods, this one is.. bleh.  The layout is significantly smaller than the Whole Foods in Franklin, TN and the selection is limited.  It is simply not that impressive for its reputation.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cbabd5191c3:0x16c5e3cca9032ebd"}
