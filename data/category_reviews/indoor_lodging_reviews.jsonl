We were on board, but that was before you back-tracked on verbal commitments you made regarding parking passes and check-out time, which resulted in a different total amount due.  We even spoke regarding the refund, at which time you agreed to refund the full amount.  There was a clear pattern of miscommunication and failure to follow through with commitments and we made the decision to make other plans for fear of the pattern effecting our vacation in a more significant manner.  You yourself even admitted that you booked the original before knowing that it was available.  Look, problems do happen.  The difference can be seen in how you respond.
