The guys at Wesco will do their best to help us Gretzky's do the best we can do in order to achieve a welding hobby on a budget. Personally I will not buy any of my welding products anywhere else due to the fact when I walk out of there I know and understand what I spent the money on and have the confidence knowing that it's going to do the right job for me.
