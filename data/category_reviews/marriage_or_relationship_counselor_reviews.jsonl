I have known Danny for more than 40 years; I was a freshman in college and Danny was one of the student organizations officers at that time. Danny showed great leader ship even as a student .   Dr Blandchard inspired me to run for office as a student leader at that university. Danny shows great compassion and allows the client to speak and express themselves.\n\nDr Blandchard has a special knack for allowing the client to relax and give total surrender to his way of asking questions and getting to the bottom of the real issues and then develop a plan to resolve these issues one at a time in such a way that the client does not feel intimidated. The sta dr Blandchard has a special knack for allowing the client to relax and give total surrender to his way of asking questions getting to the bottom of the real issues and then develop a plan to resolve these issues one at a time in such a way that the client does not feel intimidated. The staff at Dr Blandchard\u2019s office is very professional and they always keep matters cup for dinner soo The staff at Dr Blandchard office is very professional and they always keep matters  confidential. Dr Blandchard knows exactly when to bring in other members of the family to resolve family issues and matters. He never rushes a client for a speedy answer that is to say before all the issues I brought forth. Dr Blandchard has a multitude of contacts and ways of helping clients mentally physically and financially. Sometimes clients don\u2019t have the money to pay but Danny will help them anyway. I have total confidence in Dr Blandchard in everything that he does, he is a very strong  Community leader. Dr Blandchard never makes you feel small or unimportant or that your issues are trivial. He makes you feel as though you are closer than A family member.  Recommend Dr. Danny Blanchard as one of the best in his field and would recommend him to anyone who needs help.
