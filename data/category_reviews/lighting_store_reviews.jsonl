When he got there he found out that they don't sell them as a unit like they used to. You have to buy just the motor, so that's what he bought. When he gets it home, he finds out that it didn't have mount brackets so I went up there to get one that does. I was then told that none of the motors come with bracket mounts. I made the comment that he should have told my husband that so he could have gotten it while he was there. It's hot and this is our A/C unit we're trying to fix in the middle of a hot day. The gentleman said it wasn't his job to know what a person knew or not. I told him that he knew more than my husband on what parts come with what, that's when a woman came around counter and said that she was the owner and that I didn't need to talk to her employee that way. I wasn't being rude or belligerent. I just didn't think it would have been that hard to ask if the customer knew it didn't come with bracket mounts, especially if he brought an older model in. This will be the last time my family and I will be back to that store and before today, I would have recommended that store to anyone. Now I'll tell people to stay away.

We had seen print ads for Summer Classics but had never really known much about the product.  Fortunately Cynthia was working the day we visited the showroom.  She was very knowledgeable about the different collections, and quickly gained our trust.  She has a very positive attitude and it is apparent she loves what she does and is very invested in her customer relationships.  We spent almost two hours with her and never expended her patience.  After listening to us and showing us many collections, we decided on the Newport Collection.   While expensive, Cynthia showed us the quality of design and construction of the Summer Classics products;  and we proceeded to order a sofa, two chairs, two ottomans, two side tables, a coffee table, and multiple pillows and bolsters.   Several weeks later we called Cynthia for another Summer Classic solution.  We needed two window bench cushions and she solved the problem immediately, ordering two custom dimension cushions with a Sunbrella fabric unique to Summer Classics!   Cynthia is a \u201crock star\u201d and I have recommended her to friends.   She is a great asset to Summer Classics and we look forward to working with her in the future for further outdoor furniture needs.  I highly recommend her!

However...the Jones Valley stop CSR's had been polite & answered questions...but wouldn't help gather my large quantity of items. I had to gather, lift, & carry them.\nFollowing Spine & Hip injections, this was strain to my back & painful. Afterwards, I struggled walking. The associate permitted me to use their plastic cart. After leaving, I was complaining to myself, as I crossed the street to my car. A lady, carrying Bath & Body bag, crossed as well. I commented about the associates at the store being lazy.\nAs that person went on. I loaded my things & was leaving the cart on the grass.  The lady in the parking area yelled & demanded I return the cart. I didn't fully understand. So, I asked again what she said. She made her demand on me about 3 times.\nI asked her if she worked there? She said yes.  I asked if she was a Manager? She said Yes!\nI tried to tell her about the laziness I was dealing with.\nShe became irritated with me. No peaceful problem solving was enacted.\nShe came hurriedly at me. I asked her to stop. I warned her, she was crossing the line.  She came anyways, within inches of me, calling me lazy, grabbed my cart without my permission, & proceeded to the store, being loud, calling me lazy repeatedly, & told me to never step foot in her store again!\nShe definitely broke the Covid rules, & came to close to me besides, causes me to feel uncomfortable.\nI requested the 911 service & filed a report.\nThe Manager, should have been more professional.  She ordered me to never come back & she don't have to worry.  I don't want to!!!\nAll I can say is remember when shopping at the Jones Valley location, to take help for you, because they are not much help.  And watch out for the Quick Tempered Manager.\nIt's 4 AM & my Spine & hip still hurt.

My shipment is a pallet of 33 boxes of porcelain tile., plus 7 additional boxes they put on the same pallet. The right side of the pallet was coming apart due to the immense weight of the tile . The driver could not move the pallet down the truck. He was not going to be able to pull it up the small slope on my driveway. What on earth were they even thinking?They needed a fork lift. I called Home Depot and they got the Transport company on the line while I was on hold. I ended up being told the transport company needed to take care of this and they would contact me in 24 to 48 hours. Which they never did. I had to call them. On 3/5 Friday I called central transport and they told me the shipment would be delivered on Monday between 11 and 12. They never showed. I checked the shipment tracking and found that they changed it to Tuesday 3/9! I got no call, text, or phone call.So Tuesday 3/9 I message them to find out eta. They said the drivers hadn't left yet and to keep checking they will update me. That never happened.

Called the this particular store literally on my way over there. Young lady told me that indeed they had the sale item which I was inquiring about. I get to the store and spoke with someone worker in appliances I ask him again to verify of what I wanted. He walks back and confirms my injury. Rung me up just to realize he mentioned through conversation of the appliance he thought I was asking of. Which I corrected him and pointed out and literally touched again the same appliances that I wanted. Apparently some way some how after all this confusion. They magically had sold out. So my thinking leads me to believe the person I spoke to on the phone didn't bother to check or maybe something with system either way wasted my time and here's the kicker the way the guy tried to put it was like I could go to another home depot after I already paid. Luckily my bank released this debit transaction. Poor poor salesmanship and somewhere along the line communication is lacking. I hope I can revisit this location in the future without this issue.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb240162a2a6b:0xb64868f9b73224ba"}

First, the people who are selling the appliances do not know much about them. I was told that for installation of my microwave, I needed an outlet in the wall that it was being installed on. Great. I'm good. WRONG!!! The outlet had to be above the microwave.... Something that would have been nice to know, but they could not communicate that properly.\nThen, the delivery/installation people had no idea what they were doing. They were more of a delivery company, not an installation professional. They could not install my gas range. They damaged my microwave. So, really, they weren't even a good delivery company. Home Depot just subs out delivery to the cheapest company....and you can see the quality when your damaged items arrive!\nAnd I pray for you if you have ANY problems with your delivery or installation!!!\nCount on a couple of things: 1) You will spend hours on the phone getting to talk to the right person. Once you think that you have the right person, they will tell you they have to check on something and they will have to call you back. OR, the right person is \"on lunch\" and they will call you back. After giving them ample time for \"lunch\" (3 hours) when you call them back, you will be told that they were \"off today\" but they will return your call in the morning.\nBasically, it's a game of ping-pong and it takes days to get simple questions answered because, obviously, no one who works there wants to actually do anything.\nI can't believe I dropped over $7K in there and they can't even answer a simple question!!!!\nBuyer beware!!!

He was very nasty and rude to me to the point of disbelief. I returned to the shop about a week after picking up a lamp he rewired. I had called earlier and told them that my lamp had been cut off at the top and it now had a crack in it. He and the others in the shop refused to look at it and accused me of trying to get something out of him.  He told me that he measured the lamp when I brought it in; but when I asked him to let me see my ticket with the measurement on it, he refused and said he threw it away.He told me to get out of his shop with the piece of trash not worth $50 or he would call the police. When I initially took the lamp to him, He and the lady in the shop told me what a beautiful antique I had and could probably get $125 for it.  I told him it meant a lot to me and I did'nt want to sell it. Now he tells me that I have a worthless piece of trash and he's not doing anything about the damage his shop caused?", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889197bbf5aaf9b:0xcd92efc9c860806"}
