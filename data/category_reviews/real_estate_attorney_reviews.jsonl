When I was faced with mine in 2019, I was referred to Dani Bone through a coworker and friend that I trusted. I initially hired Dani because I heard he was the very best and he would fight for me. I called and even though they were extremely busy, they saw me right away. After hearing my situation, Dani was honest with me and said, \"You need Sam. \" My case was very complicated having both personal and business issues, assets and properties to divide, custody and other court issues . Sam took it as a challenge. He stayed with me and guided me through the whole divorce process. It was not easy, it was extremely tough but Sam knew how to handle every situation that came up. When going through a 2 yr battle, you need to know and  feel confident that your attorney has your back and has your best interest at heart. I emotionally fell apart many times and he helped me to learn to stand up for myself and it made me a stronger person through this process. All I wanted was what was fair- he got me exactly what I asked for! I was extremly pleased with services of Sam, Dani and their dedicated and caring staff. Amanda, Fredrick and Osha were just wonderful to work with. The whole staff made me feel comfortable and at ease through a very uncomfortable life circumstance.  While the other party had 5 attorneys through the process , I had one.  I only needed the one team- I had The Best with Sam & Dani Bone. Sam was honest, upfront, bold and encouraging. He never had to be ugly or raise his voice in court or trial and never once belittled anyone. I recall him saying, \"It doesn't have to be ugly\". Being a Christian, a professional, a self employed woman, a Realtor and a mother of 2, this was imperative to me. Sam treated both parties with total RESPECT always . That was very important to me.  I did my part and provided the true facts, evidence and proof- he did his part and presented my case with true professionalism , Integrity and no one was disrespected in the process. I would \ud83d\udcaf percent recommend Sam & Dani Bone if you want to be represented by someone who will always have your back and is not afraid to fight for your best interest.

Sam will be honest about your case, talk with you about the possibilities, and develop a plan to protect your best interests. Phone calls/emails are answered promptly and you are made aware of appointments and court actions. Even though my case was regular family law issues, it was treated as a priority.\n\nWhen emotions run high and people play dirty, you need an attorney that will keep you focused. It was nothing short of a blessing to have Sam\u2019s counsel during this time. Sam will listen and use what will benefit your case most, helping you to make the best decisions.\n\nThrough my experience, I learned that Sam is wise beyond his years and holds a unique combination of qualities that make him an excellent attorney. He is a younger lawyer in comparison to many of the veterans in the area, but his expertise speaks through shrewd discernment, both in and outside the courtroom.\n\nIn retrospect, I know that employing a professional, well-versed attorney who gave honest legal advice was a valuable asset to me. My case only involved family law, but I would recommend Sam Bone in every area that he practices.
