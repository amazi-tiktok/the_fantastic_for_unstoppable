Such as snacks and beverages in nice variety.  Kitchen has all you need to prepare meals, though the serving trays were hard to locate ( dining facing island cabinets). There were zip lock bags, coffee. & a plethora of creamer options. There was even a small igloo that worked beautifully to serve ice from during a gathering we hosted while there.  There were decks both off the main level and lower that provided only a  glimpse of the lake but lovely and green woods lined the hill below. The climb down was easy enough, but as it is a very steep lot the return climb back to the house isn't for the physically impaired or injured for certain. Keep this in mind if your group/ family consist of children or those 50+. Table/ work, craft or meeting space took between 30-50% of the space of both the 1st and 3rd floors. Which is great for task or say Bible studies or retreats, but not so much for hanging out during a family reunion or say birthday bash. We needed to use a stash of folding chairs we brought from home, as the inside dining chairs were of a sturdy heavier make, when congregating on the porches. Beds were all twins, mine was worn in moderately,  as I preferred the firmness of the 4 inches on the edge lol. The only draw back I noticed was there was only 1 traditional bath per floor , but a 6 bedroom,  3bath is doable, just something to keep in mind if you are filling all 5 public bedrooms with 14 folks. The hot top functioned well, though the chemical smell that went airborne once the jets were turned on,  set 2 of the 4 of us coughing ( may have had too  much of something in it as it created lots of bubbles/ suds while in use. The most and really only inconvenient thing was having to roll the large trash can up and across the drive and inlet rd to the  dumpster,  if you had a pick up truck or ,like we did with our last bag,  could tie the trash to your door handle and drive up it is easier.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888848c58db4c5cb:0x3063ef150745ff08"}

I'd follow my daddy, and I'd usually find a good stick to carry, and for a 7 year old, that and my imagination was all I needed. At Cameron's, there are so many very large coveys of quail, it is nearly impossible to estimate how many birds we found. The pointing dogs were very good, and the Boykin spaniels were an absolute pleasure to have there to work for us.  Oh, and we can't forget the meals we had prepared for us. Breakfast and lunch were absolutely delicious. The best quail and gravy I have ever eaten. Great family owned and operated business. They made me feel like I was family. I told our guide that that day of hunting was the most fun that I had ever had with my clothes on!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88842cfbefe002fb:0x31e35d3f452bb2b4"}
