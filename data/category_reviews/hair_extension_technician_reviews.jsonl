I want to save someone else from spending money they don\u2019t have.\nDisclaimer: This isn\u2019t to \u201cbash\u201d but to literally to bring awareness to customers about the fraud of this shop.\n\nOn 1/30/21 I went to the Weave Zone in Huntsville,AL to purchase hair for graduation pictures. Graduation is something that I looked forward to because I\u2019ve worked so hard and endured a lot along this journey so I decided to celebrate by taking pictures with a certain look. The look I was going for requires deepwave hair.\nI purchased 4 bundles and spent a total of over $300.00. A day later I ran my fingers through one bundle and it was completely nappy and tangled. (Pictures will be attached)...\n\nThey gave me the run around and of course rude customer service but I\u2019m from New York so that little attitude they gave didn\u2019t phase me at all. I\u2019m used to that.\nThey eventually exchanged it and I went about my way.\nNow it\u2019s time to wash the hair ....\nI do hair and have been using bundle hair for years. The pattern completely dropped and ended up looking like straight hair.\nI called the Weave zone and not to my surprise, they refused to compensate me or exchange my hair just because they exchanged a bad bundle. Keep in mind, all these issues were THEIR FAULT! Lol anyway...\nAs I said, no need to be disrespectful towards them in this review because I\u2019ll let the pictures speak for themselves.\nIn closing, ladies , I\u2019m sure you\u2019re reading this review because you are contemplating spending your hard earned money in order to do something nice for yourself. Please go elsewhere, I highly advise it.\nAm I disappointed? Highly. No one has 300 dollars sitting around but I strongly believe that when you\u2019re dishonest, you won\u2019t prosper. The weave zone isn\u2019t exempt from that principle. Have a blessed day ladies!\n\nEDIT/(2/7/21)\n\nOk let me blast you really quick... first of all, there was no harsh chemical. It\u2019s a rinse where you put the NON-TOXIC RINSE, NOT A DYE, on the hair and simply wash it out. (I\u2019ll attach pictures). Everyone knows what a rinse is. Secondly, as I showed your associate, the left bundle with the red rubber band WAS NOT RINSED!! So how do you explain that??? The crunchy bundle I exchanged was also not touched hence why it was exchanged.\nMy point is, the hair you gave me was NOT DEEP WAVE!!! Does that look like deep wave to you? Cut the foolishness. Your hair is trash and I stand by what I said. All proof is provided. How do you over process a non chemical rinse? Go back and look at the picture with the bundle in the red rubber band that wasn\u2019t touched. You\u2019re still going to tell me that\u2019s a deepwave pattern? You\u2019re missing the point of my review. My point is, that is NOT deepwave hair!!!! Instead of replying to me, go invest in a better vendor.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEmTB_3KhaUQ7683Xy0PWgMNo01TLg694-gwaX=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1612709400886, "text": "Ebony, our hair is 1B.

The hair was BEAUTIFUL, until shampooed on 3/17/19 with Tresemme products, and immediately lost all curl pattern. I was the only one in the wedding party with straight hair, and the bride was so disappointed because that was not the look agreed upon. Nevertheless, after speaking with the owner, Tony, who agreed that should not have happened to the hair, and texting him the requested pictures and receipt, I didn't hear back from him. Perplexed, I called the next day, and Tony placed me on hold for 23 minutes! Giving the business the ultimate benefit of the doubt, I waited and called again the next day. Tony was unavailable, but Keyshonna (sp?) told me she had seen the texts from me, and to bring in the hair, along with the receipt, for replacement hair. She told me to call before coming into the store. I could not make it HSV soon, so I called to inform them.  Tony and Keyshonna were unavailable when I called, but I spoke to Lawrence, who kept telling me to call back because they were moving. In anticipation of miscommunication, I texted after each call, just to make sure! Days later, I get to speak to Lawrence, and he finally speaks to Keyshonna about the issue, who remembered me from bringing up the wedding. They discussed it, and informed me that Tony doesn't remember me, and they won't replace or refund the purchase, since it was worn - which all parties knew based on 1) the pictures sent and 2) each text and 3) each conversation!\n\nAs a consumer, I legit waited weeks and several calls and texts to attempt to fix the issue. It hurts me to even have to write this review, and to announce the customer service practices of this business. However, they made it extremely hard to ignore. As a practicing attorney, I have filed accompanying complaints with BBB and BBB of North Alabama, and have all the time and evidentiary proof to file in small claims court over $245, plus legal costs and fees....which is just sad because all I wanted was some long curly hair, and not another court date.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626bfae2fae3bf:0xd21327a29a38657f"}

Our goal here is to build everyone to a master level stylist, but as with any job, it takes time. I am so happy that you liked your cut.

Unfortunately, what you described above was not what actually happened. As I tried to explain to you and your mother, you had layers of dark brown/black box color all over your head. My main goal is to always keep the integrity of our customer's hair in great condition. We could have easily blasted your hair with bleach and a high volume developer in an effort to remove the dark box color. However, that runs a much higher risk of damaging your hair. Instead, we chose to start with Redken's Pre-Art treatment. This treatment removes all types of things from the hair including, minerals, products, and some artificial color. It also helps to ensure that we get the best possible results from any coloring service as it helps to create a 'blank canvas' on the hair. We did that treatment on you twice, and then brought you back to the bowl to start with a 'soap cap' on your ends. A 'soap cap' is a mixture of bleach (lightener), shampoo and water. This allows the hair's integrity to also be maintained as it starts out much less aggressively removing color from the hair. It was during this process at the shampoo bowl that your mom inquired about pricing. We told her that all our color correction services start at $150/hour. She made the statement that you are 18 and booked the service online without knowing what correct questions to ask. She said you thought you would be able to achieve the blonde hair you wanted on a half price color day, so the total would end up being somewhere around $75. I am sorry for the misunderstanding. Going from a dark brown box color to a light blonde, while maintaining the integrity of your hair, is not a cheap process. It requires time, skill, knowledge, patience, and realistic expectations. Your mom said she would simply prefer to pay for the Pre-Art treatment and the soap cap and you would just leave 'as is' because you didn't want to pay the price for the full service. We never told you that you couldn't achieve the result you wanted. In fact, we told you that we absolutely could get you there! But it would be a process. You are not alone in this process. Anyone who has ever had dark colored hair and eventually achieved light blonde hair can empathize with you. It's not easy, and it's certainly not a 1-2 hour process. Trust me, if I could wave a magic wand and get you there I would. But it's my responsibility to you, as a customer, to do it the correct way and make sure you still have hair on top of your head by the end of it. I am sorry that because of a misunderstanding or miscommunication that it made you want to rate my business negatively on google. My customers are very important to me. I apologized over and over before you left to both of you and tried to explain this process and why it was so important that we do it the right way. I hope this helps to clear up any confusion about what happened on our end. I want you to be happy with your hair, and I want to help in any way I can. Please feel free to contact us and I will work with you on getting your hair color to where you want it to be. As I was more than willing to do at your initial appointment. Take care!"}, "gmap_id": "0x88893ff6535421f5:0xe467b9c2cd19892e"}

Jennifer and Morgan were very accommodating, and both of my girls got haircuts. They were so kind to my girls! I was so impressed with Lavish that I went back a week later to get my hair cut. Jennifer actually listens to what I want then shapes my hair into that style. I've had my hair cut twice by Jennifer since July.
