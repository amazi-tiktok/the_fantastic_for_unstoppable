Otherwise most of the benches are in the sun.\nOverall the place wasn't too messy considering it is hard to get kids to not throw things on the ground. It was mostly just bottle caps, juicebox straw wrappers and napkins. If they added a few more garbage cans it would help. Especially one by the exit.\nI thought the restrooms were in decent shape. Again considering they are mostly being used by kids. And every time we've been there, staff members did do a walk-through and spot cleaned them, so that's nice to see. The restrooms are unmarked, so that is a bit confusing but I think they did it to make it more gender neutral. Still some kind of sign would be a good addition because the kids can't easily tell where the restrooms are.\nIf you go in the morning, there is a bit of a playground subculture where some people congregate together.
