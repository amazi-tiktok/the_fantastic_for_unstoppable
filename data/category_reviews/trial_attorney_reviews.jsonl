In addition, when she did not get all the information she wanted about the case--attorney client privilege exists to protect the client--she asserted defamatory statements in a public forum. When the client is noncompliant, or is unwilling to pursue certain avenues of a case, the mother of an adult child becomes irritated by outcomes rather than considering the reason for the outcomes. Perhaps one should remember who the client is and that Mom's and Dad's can't make adult children act in a manner for which they want despite the desire to pay for representation.

In the span of only four years, she has untangled three complicated estates which overlapped one another as the decedents were also one another's heirs.  Her counsel has been very helpful to both our dying family members and to those of us left behind. Dee processes all the legal twists and turns of an issue and  straightens it all out to protect the interests and liabilities of the decedents, their heirs and the estate representatives. As the trustee to one estate, executor to another, and administrator & realtor for the other estate, I have had to rely heavily on Dee's continued counsel and guidance, which has been impeccable. Staying on top of complex matters, while grieving the loss of family members, can get tricky and overwhelming at times, and important documents can be missed. But with Dee's wonderful paralegal, Debbie, always on top of everything, I never worry that I will make a mistake that will injure someone. Debbie calls and texts me when I need to sign documents or pay expenses, and she keeps me and the process up-to-date and always moving forward to closure. These two women have guided and walked our family through the most complex time of our lives, and I recommend them to everyone I know who needs a really sharp estate attorney with a smart, on-the-ball paralegal. I must add that if there is a time you need an attorney to fight for you, if you don't choose these ladies, just pray that the entity you need protection from hasn't chosen them.  As nice as they are, when it comes to protecting their clients, they don't play.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0e0edc682359:0x33450141cdb7c545"}

While my charges were from 2017, I was not arrested until 2019 because I was sent to the hospital on the date of the offense instead of jail and diagnosed with Sudden Traumatic Shock exasperated by alcohol.  Being arrested was completely out of the norm for me.  I did not know where to begin, what to expect, and was consistently imagining the worst possible outcomes and scenarios.  Based off my charges, my bail agent highly recommended that I contact Mr. Crumbly for counsel.  I had an initial meeting with Mr. Crumbly within a week from the first time I contacted him.  The initial meeting did not take longer then an hour and during that time Mr. Crumbly was able to explain all my available options to include representation options, payment options, court expectations, and expected timelines.  Perhaps the most beneficial thing Mr. Crumbly discussed in the initial meeting was the overall stress of the situation.  He told me that it was human nature to imagine the worst possible outcomes and to not worry about that as it was him and his teams job to make sure those outcomes don\u2019t happen.  He was absolutely right and ,during the entire course of my case, I constantly imagined the worst possible scenarios; however, I always made myself think back to that initial conversation with Mr. Crumbly and remembered that is why he is there.  After that initial meeting, Mr. Crumbly and his team handled everything for 6 months up until my court date with the Judge.  Before I even had to go before the Judge, Mr. Crumbly had secured a deal with the DA for me to enter the Pre-Trial Intervention Program (PTIP) and have charges dropped following the completion of the program.  I was more than happy to enter PTIP as it took all uncertainty and stress off the table and I was able to hold everything going forward in my own hands.  As of May 2020, I have successfully completed the PTIP program and am currently working with Mr. Crumbly on having my charges expunged.  I am very pleased with the services I have received from Mr. Crumbly and his team and would highly recommend them.

In addition, I was uninformed of all the specific issues pertaining to Alabama State Law as they apply to a DUI charge especially, with respect to possible fines, imprisonment, unknown future adverse impacts, or establishment of an unfavorable permanent criminal history. The level of stress in my daily life was extremely high, to say the least, due to this situation and these concerns.\n\nI was referred to the Law Office(s) of Russell W.

When I explained I was busy I was asked if I would speak with him over the phone. I agreed and I was transfered to Mr. Crumbley.  After listening to me explain my why I left the review and my account of my interactions with Mr. Matt Wisda, Mr. Crumbley asked me several questions.\n1. Would I consider removing my review?\n2. Would I consider moving it to Mr. Wisda\u2019s webpage?\n3. If he (Crumbley) were to fire Mr. Wisda would I then delete my review! I said no.\n4. Was there ANYTHING he (Crumbley) could say or do that would result in me removing the review? To which I responded \u201cNot ethically\u201d, because I felt he was trying to \u201clead me\u201d into asking for a monetary resolution.\n\nDuring our discussion Mr. Crumbley stated he was not at all happy about Mr. Wisda\u2019s conduct. And that he was considering actions (including termination).  He asked once more if there was anything he could do To get me to retract the review against \u201cCrumbley, Blackwell, & Wisda Lawfirm\u201d.  I explained to him that when I researched Divorce Attorneys/Firms I based my decision in part on the reviews of his Firms website and information regarding the lawyers and therefore would not consider removing the review. We said goodbye and I hung up.\n\nI spent that day wondering if he would call again. I just knew \u201cIT\u201d wasn\u2019t over.\nSo this evening I checked on my review out of curiosity...and wouldn\u2019t you know it there is this long drawn out explanation that it was I who was misinformed etc.  Never once mentioning any unethical behavior on behalf of Mr. Wisda!\nI want to SHOUT from the highest rooftops what a sleazy slimeball you are! Shall I post more? Shall I post information Mr. Wisda freely disclosed to me about a clearly VERY SENSITIVE divorce and custody battle where the children involved had been...!\nYou disgust me!\n\nI retained Matt Wisda to represent me for my divorce.  I feel he acted unethically.\nI contacted his office after receiving an invoice for services that were not rendered. When I followed up with an appointment a few days later not only did he begin by talking about another case he had been working on (this was the 2nd time he mentioned details of this other party's case!) but he also presented me with an official Settlement Agreement\" that clearly stated me and my spouse had both agreed to - WHICH NEITHER OF US HAD!\n\nWe never went through discovery at all! No mediation - nothing!\nThe entire document looked copy and pasted, and all of the assets and then some were to be awarded to me!\n\nMr. Wisda was trying to fool me into thinking he had been hard at work on my case and that I was entitled to everything when in fact he hadn't done anything. Additionally It was never my intention to try take my husband to the proverbial cleaners. I just wanted a fair settlement.\n\nI didn't even look at the \"Settlement Agreement\" he'd drawn up while at his office. I had already decided to sever our business agreement and told him so.  I asked when I could pick up my remaining retainer and he said it would be about a week.\n\nWhen I went to pick up the monies, enclosed with my check was an invoice of almost $700 for the bogus \"Settlement Agreement\" that had been drawn up without consultation or discovery.  Coincidentally the new invoice showed just one line item for the preparing of said agreement which was dated after the phone call I mentioned above.\n\nI immediately drew up a letter refusing to pay and insisting I be refunded.  Additionally in the letter I called him out for trying to fool me and get paid for it. I emailed this letter and received a response early the next morning stating they would immediately refund the that money, which they did.\n\nI am leaving this review to make others aware.  In our consultation meeting he told me his practice \"is like a game to me.\"  And because  conducting his business in such a way, I feel, is an abuse of his power as an attorney and is extremely unethical.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1528493792927, "text": "We deeply regret that your experience with our office did not meet your expectation. We work very hard to not let that happen. Having said that, you say that you received a \u201csettlement agreement\u201d that indicated you and your husband had agreed to the settlement terms when, in fact, you had not agreed. You also say that this agreement was put together without doing any \u201cdiscovery\u201d or any \u201cmediation\u201d. You initially hired Mr. Wisda to assist you in negotiating an uncontested divorce with your husband\u2019s lawyer. In fact, you produced, for us, a \u201csettlement agreement\u201d created by your husband\u2019s lawyer when you hired Mr. Wisda. That settlement agreement had already been prepared absent any \u201cdiscovery\u201d or attempt to \u201cmediate\u201d. It was clearly the intentions of both parties (and their lawyers) to settle this matter, if possible, without costly litigation. This type divorce typically does not involve \u201cdiscovery\u201d (in the traditional sense) and most certainly doesn\u2019t involve \u201cmediation\u201d. In these type matters we simply go with settlement negotiations to the extent we are able, which necessarily includes \u201csettlement proposals\u201d. Also, in this type situation, both parties tend to agree that they know what the assets are and their values are not in dispute.\n\nThe \u201csettlement agreement\u201d your husband\u2019s attorney prepared, and gave you, was just like the one Mr. Wisda gave you. In reviewing your husband\u2019s proposal it is noted that it also includes language stating that the two of you \u201cacknowledged and agreed\u201d to things that you had not already agreed upon. In other words, both lawyers settlement agreements included the very same language in that regard. In fact, most paragraphs in all settlement agreements are full of language such as \u201cthe parties acknowledge and agree \u2026\u201d. This language is included to satisfy legal requirements and applies to you ONLY AFTER you have actually read it, agreed to it and signed it. It is not intended to mean that you have already seen it and agreed to it. And, it is NEVER INTENDED to deceive. Your attorney, Matt Wisda, did exactly what your husband\u2019s lawyer did with respect to that language.\n\nAs far as the \u201cattempt to fool you\u201d is concerned: you received an itemized statement of the charges. You received two billing statements. The second of those two seems to be where you objected. That statement involves the \u201csettlement agreement\u201d. You were dissatisfied with that charge and objected to that bill and, although you had NOT notified him of your desire to terminate him until after that work was done, we refunded every penny to you of that part of the bill. And your objection, as much as any we can tell, is founded on your belief that it included the \u201cbogus\u201d settlement language indicating that you and your husband had agreed to the terms that you had not agreed to.\n\nWe strive to handle cases the way our clients direct us. And, while the services you received were not satisfactory to you, Mr. Wisda DID NOT bill you for services not rendered. His conduct was not unethical. His ability to communicate effectively with you, I will agree, must have missed the mark. For example, we are not sure how, exactly, you did not understand that the \u201cacknowledged and agreed\u201d language in the settlement agreement did not mean you had both already agreed to that agreement. That was no more the intent of what Mr. Wisda provided you than it was the intent of what your husband\u2019s attorney provided him. It was merely two lawyers doing their jobs and adding the language that was going to be necessary at some point, in advance. Perhaps THAT is why it looked copied and pasted.\n\nWe would encourage ANYONE who is dissatisfied in ANY way, with ANYONE in our office, to meet with any of us. WE ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE to meet with that person and do everything we can to alleviate their concern and fight for your cause. Your case matters to us. And, YOU matter to us. Best wishes moving forward during this trying time.\n\n~ Russell Crumbley & Matt Wisda"}, "gmap_id": "0x886214b5eb6aa54b:0x60d777fdf93ee41a"}

I had never been in any trouble before so I wasn't sure how to go about things when the public defender asked me how I wanted to plea.. she told me to plea guilty and pay the county for a class that may or may not get the charges dropped. After getting some much needed advice from a kind correctional officer outside, I declined that plea and decided to plea not-guilty and seek out my own legal counsel. I found Mr. Crumbley's office and the charges ended up being dropped/dismissed. Him and his team, even the front office, they were all excellent. Couldn't have asked for a better outcome.

As soon as he walks in the courtroom you should know that you will be taken care of.

Dean replied within 5 minutes, and with great interest in my inquiry! Asking questions i hadn't thought of in order to fully understand my status & give the most accurate reply.

I had multiple questions ranging from money to get my stitches removed to whether I needed to obtain a police report and wanted only to speak to the staff member in charge of my case.

He contacted me multiple times to explain my options & offer opinion if I desired. He was truly in my corner for me.

When I believe I will not be able to reach a positive outcome, I make it my policy to decline the case in order to avoid setting unrealistic expectations for the injured person.\n\nOut of respect for your privacy I will not share the details of why I was not able to represent you in this public forum, but please feel free to call me at (251) 265-1000 and I would be happy to offer further explanation.
