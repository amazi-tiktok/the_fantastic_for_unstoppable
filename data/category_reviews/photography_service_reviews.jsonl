She didn't even get any pictures of the bride and father dance, none of the wedding favor's table, or food table.  All those pictures came from family who took their own pictures and sent it to the bride. The bride was very upset because of the money she spent to capture her one and only wedding day and to be told that most of the pictures were destroyed only after she kept hassling the photographer for months. Nothing was destroyed, she just realized that she was doing more eating, smoking and drinking and didn't have enough pictures.  Thank god family and friends were there to help capture the moments.

Nothing was destroyed, she just realized that she was doing more eating, smoking and drinking and didn't have enough pictures.  Thank god family and friends were there to help capture the moments.

I couldn't be happier.  She also offered our family and guests a discounted rate for family pics while we we were in town.  We plan on coming back in a few months, as we just found out we are expecting and want her to capture the start of our family.  If we can, we plan on coming back every year and doing family pics.

NO!  We had to contact her numerous times after weeks.  We never got our final pictures.  Eight pictures!!!  We got an entire wedding album in two weeks!!  So after three weeks we got a refund.\n\nAmy McDaniel is extremely unprofessional, rude, and as I stated the pictures were nothing special.

I bent over backwards for this session and even added a bubble bath at the end. My studio is packed with props and outfits for babies but creativity is challenging when you spend the entire session trying to get dogs to sit. She mentions a contract but she never received a contract so I'm not sure where that is coming from. I explained the timeline to her in person and that I am visiting my parents in Washington State while my mother has a tumor from her breast removed. Her images were going to be two days later than the verbal timeline but she didn't care. I would hope that people could show a little more compassion during this time but there is no pleasing this client.

I contacted her over two months before my baby would arrive, to see if scheduling would work for a newborn shoot. She responded with an email of her package pricing and the services provided. My wife and I felt we could work with her, so I replied letting her know the package we wanted, and if she would be able to also do the maternity shoot for my wife. I made attempts to contact her via phone for a conversation to fully understand her process, and communicate what we were looking for. Getting her on the phone was nearly impossible. The failed attempts were due to her workshop held in Canada in late April. I made additional calls, with no success, and no capability of leaving a voicemail, as hers was full. My only other option was to send another email. She replied a few days later in between her workshop with one available day in May for the maternity shoot. She did say it would be difficult to fit my wife in for the maternity, but would try. My wife and I initially agreed to the date, and Amy sent an email with an invoice. Throughout this whole interaction, no phone conversation took place. I paid for the maternity shoot in full since the date was about 3 weeks out, and placed a deposit for the newborn shoot. I did this to make sure we could get on her calendar, despite still not talking with her. After I paid her, I still was not able to make contact to coordinate the maternity shoot. I also made her aware that we live in the metro Atlanta area, and would be driving to her. Due to the lack of communication, and not being familiar with the Auburn area, her studio, caused my wife and I to cancel. Again, not being able to get her on the phone to communicate this, I texted her to about a week and a half prior to the maternity shoot to cancel. I asked if the balance I paid could be moved to a larger newborn package, and she was pleased to do so. Fast forward to June 14, I contacted her to let her know the exact date our baby would be born, understanding that we would finally have a phone conversation. Still no success on that front. She responds with one date for the newborn shoot that did not work for my wife and I. I then asked if she would be able to do the shoot on a different day, and that too did not work for my wife and I. It wasn't until I sent her an email letting her know I wanted to cancel everything was when we finally spoke on the phone. I let her know I wanted all my money back and explained the reasons why. She offered no apology, no option, only another date, that still did not work. Her only response was to take it up with PayPal, so I did. I never write reviews of this length, or do review at all, but Amy brought this on herself. She texted me 3:50 AM, then again at 5:03 AM, clearly upset about the outcome of the PayPal dispute. If she did not decide to harass me, and move on, I would have done so as well. There is always 2 sides to a story. I disclosed everything to PayPal, also citing that I was not provided any contract, offered three dates, that did not work, and minimal communication from Amy. Writing all of this took time I did not want to give do so, but having worked with multiple business owners and professionals from different industries, Amy lacks attributes of a business owner. Primarily that of being ethical. Doing research provided me insight on what Amy's true passion is, and that is holding workshops. He lack of availability is due to the abundance of workshops she is scheduled to hold. If she disclosed this material information to me from the very beginning, I would have made the decision to work with her or not. There are so many workshops planned for the remainder of this year, as well as 2020, both domestically and internationally. It's also clear that workshops are her passion, when 100% of her positive 5 star reviews are from workshop attendees.

I was more than professional and when he cancelled his maternity session I was more than happy to let him transfer that money to his newborn session. This is after sending pictures of all of my maternity gowns and giving him several dates for his maternity session. They simply didn\u2019t want to make the trip to Auburn. I was more than flexible by giving him 3 available dates for the newborn session. Baby hasn\u2019t even been born yet! His assumptions about workshops are false.

The photographer was very nice, however when we received our pictures, every single picture was in soft focus -- we could only order 2 pictures and were very disappointed. THIS IS WHERE THEY EARN THEIR 5 STARS. The manager and then owner worked with me and was very apologetic. They offered to accommodate us for a family shoot if we were ever in the area again. Luckily, 2 years later we were (this past July). I contacted them in January. They booked us with April, who was amazing. She drove all the way from Gulf Shores (2+ hours) for our shoot.

We were a little nervous taking a gamble on an online appointment, but as soon as we met our photographer Dannie, as well as the owner, we were excited and ready to have fun.  It is obvious all the team members enjoy their work and give each family a special experience. Dannie was wonderful, he is kind and funny, and recommended several things for us to check out on our trip.  He had a great plan of locations and poses, but also let our children come up with ideas of their own, and those photos wound up being some of my favorites. I purchased the package with the flash drive, our photos were mailed within 48 hours and the drive was in our mailbox when we arrived home just as advertised. The photos came out just as I hoped, Dannie really did a great job of taking great shots that captured our family having fun, which was exactly what I wanted.

He was exactly what one would want in a beach photographer: relaxed but upbeat, patient, fun, very aware and watching for a moment to grab a great picture. Our family had 2 two-year-olds so getting the shot wasn't always easy, but Crisco managed to snag some amazing shots, as well as keeping both the little ones entertained and laughing. (Seriously, my boy hates people and Crisco had him throwing his head back in laughter.) When I saw our pictures for the first time I was in tears at how beautifully they turned out. My father is a professional photographer and we agree that not just anyone can take an amazing picture no matter how much the camera or editing software costs. Crisco can.

During that time, I texted him to gain an understanding of what the cost would be. He asked a few questions and then never got back with me. Since I had used him on 2 other occasions (most recently 9 months ago) and his prices were reasonable... and this session would be no more work than the previous sessions, I didn't press the issue and figured we would just discuss it later. Well..when I texted him a month before the event to confirm my date, he mentioned he noticed he had never responded to my text regarding the price.  After asking a few more questions he came back with a price of $800?!?!?!??? This is almost as much as I paid for my wedding pictures and they were ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS with tons of editing (much better than any session that we had with Joel). I have spoken with several licensed photographers since this time and NONE of them charge anywhere near this high. Going price for this type of session was $150-450 for a 1-2 hr session and digital photos (Max). Unfortunately this put me in a real bind because now it was extremely hard to find another photographer that was available for my date. Joel mentioned he would come down to $550...but this was still higher than \"average\". This high pricing also was not in line with the pricing on his website. Although he did not have Maternity specifically listed, he had Engagement Sessions for the same length of time (2 hr session and digital photos) for $400 and this was synonymous to my requested session since it would be only me and my husband for a couple of hours. Given that he put me in such a stressful bind at an already stressful time in my life, I would definitely NOT recommend him. I tried to work out the pricing with him to be more reasonable and even explained my issue of having troubles finding someone else this late...but he was unwilling to work with me...even though he knew that it was his fault because he never answered my text regarding pricing 3+ months ago. Do yourself a favor...use someone who responds to text messages and honors pricing listed on their website. At a minimum,  select someone who is willing to take responsibility when they make a mistake...that unfortunately does not appear to be Joel at Yellowhammer. :(", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1562982443833, "text": "Thanks for taking the time to share your feedback.

Unless you are in a hurry, look elsewhere", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1578078597457, "text": "Thank you for sharing your experience with us.  We're sorry that the final results of your scanning order did not meet your expectations.  We pride ourselves on giving each order personal attention and all of the work we do is done in our Birmingham location (in the historic Avondale neighborhood).\nWe recall your order very clearly.  You chose our PROOF quality (700 ppi) for your slide scanning order, which our lowest resolution (and lowest priced).  We also offer ARCHIVE quality scans (1700 ppi) at a slighlty higher cost.  Our scanning service, whether Proof or Archive level, includes the utilization of dust removal software, which can remove superficial debris and blemishes on the scanned images.\nOur technician specifically noted the high concentration of dust on your slides before scanning your slides.  Prior to scanning your order, our tech  attempted to manually clean each of your slides by hand to remove the dust and lint you described.  Unfortunately, dust and lint are often stuck to the film itself and may not be removed except by rewashing or physically wiping the film with a chemical solution.\nWe are generally unwilling to do such aggressive cleaning, out of fear we might damage our clients irreplaceable originals.  More often, if the condition of the originals is so bad that our usual cleaning and post-production are insufficient, we can do restorastion to the scanned images.  This digital retouching is not inexpensive, but for extremely valuable or badly deteriorated images, it is often the best option.\nAgain, we're sorry to hear you were not completely satisfied with our service.  We would welcome the opportunity to regain your confidence."}, "gmap_id": "0x88891a5120593795:0x418ab9e005e5647d"}
