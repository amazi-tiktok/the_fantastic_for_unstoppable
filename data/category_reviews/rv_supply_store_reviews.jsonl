I was told 89 cents a lbs and that I should have a 20 or 30 lbs tank on my RV. I should have known better than to choose Bankston at this time since the manager on the phone acted like it was such a hassle to give me the total price for both tanks. (After all the trouble he went through for the total.) I was told it was 19.28 for a 20lbs tank and 28.32 for a 30lbs tank. Which sounds reasonable, so I didn't bother to check anywhere else in town. When I arrived today, I was greeted by a professionally dressed man asking if I needed any help. I responded I need to get my propane tank filled and to get my brakes checked. I then pulled around to get my tank filled and was told it would be next week before they could get to my brakes. No big deal I thought. so I go inside to pay and the total came to 53 and some change. I confronted him about the quote I was gave over the phone and he immediately got defensive and started to explain why I was being charged more. Since I was interested in doing more business with them with my brake problem, you would assume that he would do what was necessary to make things right. He might have took a small loss on the propane but would have simply made it up in the outstanding labor charges. When you quote someone a price you stick with that price to make your customer feel valued. I really felt like I was nothing but in the way and a hassle to them as soon as I pulled onto the lot. Bankston Motor homes is less than a mile from my house. However I will make the drive to Coldwater RV center in Muscle shoals for any future service or maintenance I need for my RV. Last time I was there before I made my RV purchase they were very helpful and took the time that was needed to explain to me the different types of water systems I Inquired about and what would better suit my needs.

Daryl, Janet, Johnny, and Paul are the most caring, thoughtful, and thorough people I have encountered in a long time, even well after the sell!

Johnny was there to help me get turned around and back on the lot.  Being late in the evening and after closing they allowed me to set up my RV on the lot and spend the night until I could get a tow truck the next morning and find a rental truck to pull my RV home.  Johnny was very helpful during the whole ordeal.  They made sure I had the necessities I needed to get through the night.  The next morning Johnny came to me and offered to take me to get breakfast if I wanted.  Daryl personally stopped what he was doing to give me a ride to pick up my rental truck.\n\nThe entire experience at Bankston Motor Homes of Warrior was top notch!  I left feeling like family.  I left the lot to go spend the weekend camping to break in my new RV.  Johnny called me Sunday evening to check on me and make sure I made it home safe and that I didn't have any issues with my RV.\n\nI cannot say thank you enough, nor say enough good things about these folks!

I tried to buy from this dealership, had my financing in order, drove two hours to the dealership.  They would not take the time to complete the paper work that day, would not let me take the unit with me, told me I was required to take a four hour class.\nI understand for new owners needing to take this course.  I live in a RV full time to travel for work.  I am very familiar with the maintenance and  operation of a RV.  I even accepted they wanted to keep the RV for a few days to make sure everything worked properly.  They still would not sit down and complete the paperwork with me but wanted me to give them a down payment.\nFYI then person who walks into your dealership is your CUSTOMER.  You are not doing them a favor to sell them a RV. When I asked about ordering a different RV,  which was the RV I really wanted they said oh it will take 6 weeks.  in fact they had two coming within the following two weeks.  They would not even discuss with me ordering one for me.\n\nBUT I went to BAMA RV in Dothan Al.  They had me a unit ordered the day I called them it took a week and half to have the RV ready for me!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1462651327730, "text": "Here at Paradise RV Sales in Warrior, Al. we strive to satisfy each and every customer to the best of our ability. We have set in place a very strict set of Company Policies that we follow to ensure each and every customer receives a camper that has been  thru our Service Department for a complete pre delivery inspection which consist of more than 75 items, including appliance checks, plumbing checks, electrical checks, sealant checks, proper slide out operations, installing a 12 volt battery and many more in depth inspections. This takes the better part of the day but insures that the customer can leave with confidence that everything is in working order. ( the prospective buyer  does not have the option to waive the inspection, it is required by the Manufacturer and Paradise RV Sales) We also like to walk thru the camper with the customer  after the pre delivery inspection to make sure the customer is satisfied before departing with their new camper.  ( this ensures that the customer has no surprises when they get home) As with any business we ask for earnest money to engage into a transaction and start the process, taking the camper off the market for sale, doing a pre delivery inspection and ordering Loan Contracts from a Bank. If  a prospective buyer refuses to sign an agreement to purchase with a minimum deposit for earnest money then we cannot move forward with a purchase.As a Company whose goal is Customer Satisfaction we Reserve The Right Not To Sale to any Prospective Buyer that Refuse to abide by our Company Policies.\nSo to all of our Customers and Non Customers Paradise RV Sales would like to take this opportunity to wish  you good luck in all of your camping adventures."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889046c6bd8ab1b:0x11963b5991c52291"}

Daryl and Janet did not want to sell us the camper without the customer walk through. I wanted to skip the walk through. They insisted if we were going to buy, the walk through was required.

They really wanted us to have a good experience with their product and had our best interest in mind when they basically refused to sell without me or my wife going through the tutorial. Now I can honestly say I'm glad that we purchased from Paradise RV. My new trailer brakes that were installed the day before failed to work.

(1) We could not even see the work they did or did not do until we paid in full. (2) The work they did was SHODDY. After all that time, they left a 6\"x2\" hole under our shower faucet. A HOLE in the shower! They didn't even do the work on the sway bar/tow area, stating, \"Uh, I didn't know what to do, so I didn't do anything.\" But, of course we had to pay for whatever labor cost they assigned to the undone work. (3) After getting our camper back (a few months into the year they had the camper) we discovered 2 new things had broken while at their facility (kitchen pin lights and kitchen ceiling fan) and of course we were responsible for the repair.\nWere they capable to do of the repairs? Yes, I really think so. But I have to conclude that they have no motivation to complete the repairs in a timely manner, no pride in their work, poor communication between customer service and the technicians... Too many complaints and too long of a story to tell.\nBOTTOM LINE: I will never return to Madison RV for work to be done on our RV.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886265139d9efc09:0x1032975312b6a4cc"}

The reason we bought is we liked the camper we found, Frank was very generous with the deal, the entire staff were very well informed.  I have been in sales and I was absolutely impressed with Madison RVs and the people.  They have earned my business and my referrals for life.

So, I gave them a call expecting the same problems, however, after speaking to Frank; I could not believe that we had a real honest conversation.

I was sold not just on the competitive pricing, but on the authenticate relationship between buyer and seller. We bought our first travel trailer in March 2019 with peace of mind my family are in good hands at Campers Inn. The service team is outstanding as well!
