I contacted her over two months before my baby would arrive, to see if scheduling would work for a newborn shoot. She responded with an email of her package pricing and the services provided. My wife and I felt we could work with her, so I replied letting her know the package we wanted, and if she would be able to also do the maternity shoot for my wife. I made attempts to contact her via phone for a conversation to fully understand her process, and communicate what we were looking for. Getting her on the phone was nearly impossible. The failed attempts were due to her workshop held in Canada in late April. I made additional calls, with no success, and no capability of leaving a voicemail, as hers was full. My only other option was to send another email. She replied a few days later in between her workshop with one available day in May for the maternity shoot. She did say it would be difficult to fit my wife in for the maternity, but would try. My wife and I initially agreed to the date, and Amy sent an email with an invoice. Throughout this whole interaction, no phone conversation took place. I paid for the maternity shoot in full since the date was about 3 weeks out, and placed a deposit for the newborn shoot. I did this to make sure we could get on her calendar, despite still not talking with her. After I paid her, I still was not able to make contact to coordinate the maternity shoot. I also made her aware that we live in the metro Atlanta area, and would be driving to her. Due to the lack of communication, and not being familiar with the Auburn area, her studio, caused my wife and I to cancel. Again, not being able to get her on the phone to communicate this, I texted her to about a week and a half prior to the maternity shoot to cancel. I asked if the balance I paid could be moved to a larger newborn package, and she was pleased to do so. Fast forward to June 14, I contacted her to let her know the exact date our baby would be born, understanding that we would finally have a phone conversation. Still no success on that front. She responds with one date for the newborn shoot that did not work for my wife and I. I then asked if she would be able to do the shoot on a different day, and that too did not work for my wife and I. It wasn't until I sent her an email letting her know I wanted to cancel everything was when we finally spoke on the phone. I let her know I wanted all my money back and explained the reasons why. She offered no apology, no option, only another date, that still did not work. Her only response was to take it up with PayPal, so I did. I never write reviews of this length, or do review at all, but Amy brought this on herself. She texted me 3:50 AM, then again at 5:03 AM, clearly upset about the outcome of the PayPal dispute. If she did not decide to harass me, and move on, I would have done so as well. There is always 2 sides to a story. I disclosed everything to PayPal, also citing that I was not provided any contract, offered three dates, that did not work, and minimal communication from Amy. Writing all of this took time I did not want to give do so, but having worked with multiple business owners and professionals from different industries, Amy lacks attributes of a business owner. Primarily that of being ethical. Doing research provided me insight on what Amy's true passion is, and that is holding workshops. He lack of availability is due to the abundance of workshops she is scheduled to hold. If she disclosed this material information to me from the very beginning, I would have made the decision to work with her or not. There are so many workshops planned for the remainder of this year, as well as 2020, both domestically and internationally. It's also clear that workshops are her passion, when 100% of her positive 5 star reviews are from workshop attendees. Amy I truly hope you use this as a learning opportunity to improve your business model, and just stick to doing workshops, or fully disclose how you work.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1561641320879, "text": "This gentleman sent red flags from the very beginning so having a phone conversation with him was definitely out of the question.

I was more than professional and when he cancelled his maternity session I was more than happy to let him transfer that money to his newborn session. This is after sending pictures of all of my maternity gowns and giving him several dates for his maternity session. They simply didn\u2019t want to make the trip to Auburn. I was more than flexible by giving him 3 available dates for the newborn session. Baby hasn\u2019t even been born yet! His assumptions about workshops are false. My family will be on vacation on the exact date that he wanted which is why I always advise my clients that we both remain flexible because we never know when babies are going to make their appearance into the world. My passions are my own family and newborn photography.  Workshops are how I put food on the table.

Most of the one star reviews below have to do with making an appointment, do yourself a favor and NEVER make an online appointment with them. Always call to make an appointment and make sure you request a specific photographer so you know you have a good one. We called today and made appointment with Amber at noon and when we showed up we got started immediately. We have made online appointments in the past and they never work out well; long waits, poor service. Amber has been great with our kids and she takes fantastic photos.\n\nAlso know going in you have to take like 100 photos, and it takes an hour to an hour and 1/2. this was very frustrating for me in the beginning especially if we only wanted one photo, but as long as you know beforehand you can plan for it.\n\nAs far as the facility goes, they have a play area for children, clean restrooms, great scene changes / props / background, and it's air-conditioned. If you're thinking to yourself you will just use competition in the area, there's not much. A lot of photographers want to take outdoor pictures which can be very hot and only one scene.\n\nWe bought a rather big package today and it was about $350.. Ouch! So lastly let's talk about pricing strategy. The cheapest way to go is get a single photo for about $20, which comes with about 35 prints (one pose). Not a bad deal and your pretty much guaranteed to get a great picture because you'll have like 100 to choose from. The catch is there's 100 professional photos of your family and you're bound to like more than one. So to get the most bang for your buck, I recommend the very first package that gets you all the digital prints. I believe it's the package with 6 poses + ALL the digital ones and it's around $70. Get home and post all those photos to Facebook and you'll know you made the right choice.\n\nOnce you pay, all your pictures are printed and ready to pick up in about 20 minutes. Same day service is a huge bonus! Specialty items however do take a few days (books, calendars, canvas).\n\nFour stars because there are some real shortcomings here, however if you go in with a strategy, you will definitely end up with frame worthy pictures that will make you smile for a long time to come.\n\n--> If you found this review helpful please give it a like!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPc6plN6DpWDIoHlmlRv2EAZITkZabf9Ybw4wVT=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhpJ6KMthBqfr9HVTCQqj-Rj4eeH-6mTgyM79d=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHs0_PV1Gctz345AFbgZIKFNhAAQ33oCG7ojGD=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOaXLfgsiBrm02DfC_qJXfzX5LkbclJ9cJ0Qma1=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2F4u_xOMh9bYF1qOoHvpO-M2EBWNpN4hhc-UL=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGwFLnczKFpUdZCSgNa4QPriOixtO0j1tet04g=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqdPW96QvP9--4nKIcub34KVsWZyESDnMAcfc2=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3zTGVHOoQ3h8OYRzGqcHUOf3KtyG0P61j3Iuv=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2c6debc5a42f:0xcab5e9c5166fba5d"}

I made a comment saying \"I like this picture, but do not like the lighting but I like this one.\" Her reply, \"Cameras have lights! That's normal.\" Her tone was very condescending. When we were doing our newborn photos we asked what other pose options we had as far as poses, backgrounds, seats, etc & her reply \"You mean besides what all I've already done?\" \"NOTHING\". I've never been treated like that before. I honestly wanted to leave, but since my mother in law was paying for the portraits I did not want to cause a fuss. I had my father in law & mother in law with me & my 2 children & we all felt the same way that she was very rude. We did ask for different poses, etc but in my opinion when you are spending your hard earned money somewhere then it's the businesses job to uphold at least a customer service professional attitude. That definitely was lost during our experience. They may have gotten money from our visit this time, but we will not be returning.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2c6debc5a42f:0xcab5e9c5166fba5d"}

Yes.... they know that they are overbooked but they can't tell you they are or they'll lose their job. They are overbooked because half of the appointments are made from a call center. True...Its wrong but let's be real. If you have a large group, you can't possibly expect to walk in and out in 30 minutes.It takes that long to look at the pictures. Here's another something about the employees that most of you aren't aware of. Keeping their job is based on their SALES average which has to stay higher than $110. This is something to take into consideration when you only show up to spend $15. Please don't mistake that they do appreciate your business but having session after session spending only the bare minimum means their SALES AVERAGE is well below $110 and now they may not have a job next week. THINK ABOUT IT! How often have you stepped into one and seen a new face or your favorite photographer is gone. That would be why. Them trying to force pictures and products on you is them fighting to keep their jobs....That's the only reward that they get for selling $600 in photos. NO PRIZE.....NO PAT ON THE BACK....JUST  ANOTHER  STRESSFUL WEEK OF FIGHTING TO PAY YOUR BILLS. Yes... they can play with you kids, make them laugh, and get that perfect picture but believe me when  I say that they are stressed out.

One lady pretended as if she didn\u2019t hear me so I got louder so the other lady said an hour, which wasn\u2019t true they were 2 hours late taking my son\u2019s pictures and I was pissed by this time because I scheduled his appointment according to his sleep schedule and since they started so late he begin to cry because he was exhausted so we only got in a few good pictures. Their customer service was in very poor taste because even though they were not on time, they did not offer any type of discount to correct their mistake because a broken printer has nothing to do with your camera because they were still working so there was no reason they should have been 2 hours late taking my son\u2019s pictures. Another thing, the props they use with the kids need to either be washed or thrown away and new ones need to be purchased because they looked gross. On top of that when I went back to get my son\u2019s pictures they had ordered some of the wrong prints in the wrong sizes or not the correct prints at all so I still have to go somewhere else to have more pictures printed out which means I have to spend more money.  I am very disappointed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2c6debc5a42f:0xcab5e9c5166fba5d"}

During that time, I texted him to gain an understanding of what the cost would be. He asked a few questions and then never got back with me. Since I had used him on 2 other occasions (most recently 9 months ago) and his prices were reasonable... and this session would be no more work than the previous sessions, I didn't press the issue and figured we would just discuss it later. Well..when I texted him a month before the event to confirm my date, he mentioned he noticed he had never responded to my text regarding the price.  After asking a few more questions he came back with a price of $800?!?!?!??? This is almost as much as I paid for my wedding pictures and they were ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS with tons of editing (much better than any session that we had with Joel). I have spoken with several licensed photographers since this time and NONE of them charge anywhere near this high. Going price for this type of session was $150-450 for a 1-2 hr session and digital photos (Max). Unfortunately this put me in a real bind because now it was extremely hard to find another photographer that was available for my date. Joel mentioned he would come down to $550...but this was still higher than \"average\". This high pricing also was not in line with the pricing on his website. Although he did not have Maternity specifically listed, he had Engagement Sessions for the same length of time (2 hr session and digital photos) for $400 and this was synonymous to my requested session since it would be only me and my husband for a couple of hours. Given that he put me in such a stressful bind at an already stressful time in my life, I would definitely NOT recommend him. I tried to work out the pricing with him to be more reasonable and even explained my issue of having troubles finding someone else this late...but he was unwilling to work with me...even though he knew that it was his fault because he never answered my text regarding pricing 3+ months ago. Do yourself a favor...use someone who responds to text messages and honors pricing listed on their website. At a minimum,  select someone who is willing to take responsibility when they make a mistake...that unfortunately does not appear to be Joel at Yellowhammer. :(", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1562982443833, "text": "Thanks for taking the time to share your feedback.

We got our boys six months photoshoot done with her including my husband, our fur baby and I. She neither guided us for any poses nor I got a single picture of my boys. Without even looking at our pictures, I paid money in full as I understand we all are struggling at this times. I even requested her if we can get us in again for the boys pictures again yet she hasn\u2019t responded. I couldn\u2019t send out my family any holiday pictures as there aren\u2019t any pictures of them alone. Very disappointed with her service. My husband who never finds a fault in any person, made a comment about her being a lazy photographer. I hate to write a bad comment about anyone but this was so special to me for being the first time mom. I wish she would\u2019ve understood that and worked with us with ideas and suggestions. Also I clearly mentioned to her that I\u2019m trying to her pictures done in Beautiful Alabama Fall Foliage but that didn\u2019t happen as well. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1606137619680, "text": "I have emails and messages to show where Ms. Upadhyay was told the time her session started, how long it would be, the fact most areas were still green but might be changed by her desired session date, (she had a specific timeframe she wanted and didn't want to wait) as well as the fact it was better if the children sat up for the session. She insisted on wanting them asap and then sent me a photo of the twins sitting up. Then at the session, that they arrived late for they took awhile getting kids dressed, mom getting her shoes on etc.. she told me they could NOT sit up. So I explained to her and her husband that the children had to be leaned against them or they had to be holding them and I would focus on just the child. I will NOT take photos of ANY child and put them in harms way just to get a shot. They both were told this and I still took photos of just the boys together as well as each individual child with their parents holding them. So I am not sure why she is saying she didn't get a single picture of the boys.  I directed them in every pose and even asked if they wanted different ones where she indeed asked for extra poses and we did them. They went well over their scheduled shooting time of 45 minutes, as I had a babysitter and know how much I paid them and I checked my camera data to see the exact shooting time. I never once rushed them and stayed longer, even though they were late cause I knew she wasn't happy. She complained the entire time that the boys wouldn't smile and I tried, she tried and dad tried, the boys wouldn't have it. (kids will be kids this happens often with my own kids too) She has beautiful images of her family and she downloaded them all before she complained to me. As stated on my website I can not guarantee children will smile or be able to do any specific poses as kids will do what they want to do. I asked at the session if they had any other things they wanted to do after I was done with my poses and she said yes, I did them and then we were done. Not once did she mention she didn't like the location or any poses I suggested or did at the session. I feel I was far from lazy accommodating their wants and needs as well as making sure not only her twins were looking her dog was as well. I do my best but again can not guarantee smiles, I wish I could.. but in this case even mom and dad couldn't get the littles to smile. :("}, "gmap_id": "0x888916102edfe53f:0x82e178074a54dcb7"}

We're sorry that the final results of your scanning order did not meet your expectations.

You chose our PROOF quality (700 ppi) for your slide scanning order, which our lowest resolution (and lowest priced).  We also offer ARCHIVE quality scans (1700 ppi) at a slighlty higher cost.  Our scanning service, whether Proof or Archive level, includes the utilization of dust removal software, which can remove superficial debris and blemishes on the scanned images.\nOur technician specifically noted the high concentration of dust on your slides before scanning your slides.  Prior to scanning your order, our tech  attempted to manually clean each of your slides by hand to remove the dust and lint you described.  Unfortunately, dust and lint are often stuck to the film itself and may not be removed except by rewashing or physically wiping the film with a chemical solution.\nWe are generally unwilling to do such aggressive cleaning, out of fear we might damage our clients irreplaceable originals.  More often, if the condition of the originals is so bad that our usual cleaning and post-production are insufficient, we can do restorastion to the scanned images.  This digital retouching is not inexpensive, but for extremely valuable or badly deteriorated images, it is often the best option.\nAgain, we're sorry to hear you were not completely satisfied with our service.

The price list was so blurry that we could not read it and it was not on the website.  The pictures of our newborn granddaughter were on a very busy, multi colored quilt which did not highlight our granddaughter.  We selected a photograph from the limited selection that we wanted to purchase for our home.  After meeting and looking over the photographs, we called for pricing.  \"Lisa\" who answered the telephone was asked for pricing.  She inquired how we were related to the baby and stated that they were not trying to 'hide\" the pricing.  I told her the price list was blurry and we did not infer that they were hiding anything.  We told her that we were interested in one photograph to which she grumbled \"only one\" and asked what size.  I told her that we would like to see a price list but we only have 45 minutes left to order due to the deadline.  She curtly stated that we had \"one week\" to call or decide on an order.  Unfortunately, it took us this long with our work schedules to take time to call about the price list and have everything ready to place an order.  However, we were still within our allotted time frame.   We told her that we were interested in pricing on an 8x10 or larger since we were not sure what sizes they offered at this studio.  She barked out the prices for an 8x10 and a 5x7 then demanding to know what we wanted to order.  I told her that we would hire our own photographer rather than order from her since she did not sound like she wanted to me a sale.  Sadly, we did not order from this studio due to the unprofessional staff on the telephone.  My husband asked who we had spoken to so I called back and asked \"Lisa\" if there was someone else or a manager that we could speak to and she replied that she was \"the owner\".  I thanked her and hung up.  She was snickering, barking, and making other annoying sounds during the conversation to which the children in the car commented how rude and nasty she was in both phone calls.\nApparently, this studio does not need our business or yours since the \"owner\" can rudely talk to customers who want to order even one photograph.  We were looking to order a large 16x20 or 24x36 photograph of our granddaughter but we could not get information on the larger sizes when calling to inquire over the phone.\nThe photographs were not tasteful, nor well laid out to compliment a baby.  If you are looking for artist, skilled photographs it would suit you to look further than this studio/photographer.  Walmart would be able to offer you same level of artistry with better customer service.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d48b4cf7d5547:0x103762639cfa006f"}
