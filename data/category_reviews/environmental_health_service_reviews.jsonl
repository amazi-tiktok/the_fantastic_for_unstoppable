Second spraying comes around and same thing- earwigs inside every day. This time when we contacted them (2 weeks ago), they ignored us. They also didn't call when they came to spray the second time so if hadn't been home, he wouldn't have been able to get inside or in the backyard. We signed a year contract and I'm not sure what it would take to get out of that. But signing a contract should have been a signal they were bad.

There was jewelry rearranged, purses opened, and a ring was lying in the hallway by the kitchen. We were very confused because the only person who had been in our house that day was the exterminator. We looked through our belongings and came to find that a Michael Kors watch was missing (est. $225), Apple T.V (est. $100+),  jewelry (est. $600+), and cash. We are not explicitly accusing anyone of stealing, but we have high suspicions because the exterminator was the only one in the house that day.

I live out of state, but used them for my second home in AL.  I specifically asked them from the beginning to put my primary out-of-state home address as the billing contact.  For years, they would conduct the service and send the bill to my primary address out of state.  I always immediately paid for their services via credit card over the phone.  For my annual ant and terminate inspections this year, I just happen to call them to schedule things, and they said, \"we closed your account because of failure to make a payment.\"  ???  I told them I never received a bill nor knew there was an outstanding balance.  I asked what the billing address was...never got a straight answer.  Eventually, the phone representative admitted to the possibility that Bama may have sent it to the AL home where the service was being performed.  Also not true, because my mom lives there and sends me all bills that come to the house.  The phone rep even had the nerve to say \"we were sending the account to collections.\"  I never even knew there was a bill due!  And they obviously make no attempts on their end to keep in touch with the customer.  That was issue No. 1.  Nonetheless, I immediately paid the outstanding balance and that issue was resolved, despite Bama's sloppiness and failure to communicate.\n\nIssue No 2., they have an absolutely unconscionable provision in their agreement that says something to the effect of, \"Customer must give 30 days written notice before getting out the the Agreement.\"  The very next sentence in the Agreement says, \"Bama may cancel the contact without notice at any time for any reason.\"  What?!\n\nBesides the fact that such a provision would never hold up in court if there ever were a dispute, it is a completely onerous clause.  They're not selling gold, they spraying chemicals on the ground, for goodness sake.  No need for such an unfair clause.  I asked the representative for a reason for such an unfair clause.  She responded something to the effect of, \"we need that in there for customers who don't pay.\"  What????  Well, in my opinion, such language is waaaay over broad for such a limited scenario as nonpayment.  Anyway, I refused to agree to it, Bama Exterminating refused to change or delete it, and we parted ways.  I signed up the same day with their competitor, who actually ended up being cheaper...and more organized as well.  I have been happy so far.\n\nThere is a fine line between a mom and pop operation and a sloppy operation.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888603267877fefd:0x2a05ac8851bf106c"}

In my case, they made several mistakes and refused to admit to or even rectify their own mistakes.  I purchased my home four years ago and it came with a termite bond with Bama Exterminating.  This year (2014) they mailed me a contract to sign regarding that termite bond with dates listed from 2012 to 2014.  In essence, because they made a mistake and did not have me sign a contract when I purchased the home, they were trying to get me to agree to terms for the previous years to cover themselves legally while disregarding the legal issues for the customer.\nI called their office manager, Kim Ousley, to inquire about this contract and she was unable to explain why I was receiving this contract four years after the home purchase and why the contract had a start date listed as 2012.  After getting frustrated with my questioning and being unable to answer the questions posed to her, she hung up the phone.\nThen, I spoke with another employee, Mr. Bridges, who did manage to explain at least why I was receiving this contract at the time I did.  However, he did not see any issue with me agreeing to terms, in writing, that were two years in the past.  He also did not see any issue with Ms. Ousley's behavior even though she was unable to explain their contract and hung up on a customer after getting flustered.\nSo, there are a serious of problems here that are all the mistake of Bama Exterminating and the company refused to rectify their mistake.  First, they should obtain a new contract when homes are sold for the new owner.  They failed to do that in my case.  When they realized their mistake (in 2012), they continued to let the contract go unsigned.  In 2014, they mailed a letter and a contract dated for 2012.  In the letter they stated they could not renew my termite bond UNLESS I signed the back-dated contract.  This seems reasonable except the mistake was on their end and I shouldn't be required to sign things I am uncomfortable signing and they refused to fix it.  I offered to sign a current contract but they would not do that unless I signed the back-dated one.  Finally, the way the office manager, Ms. Ousley, handled the call was unfortunate.  If she did not have the proper information or could not communicate effectively with the customer, she should have found someone else to help rather than hang up the phone on a long-term customer.\nIn sum, there were multiple errors made this company and even after I offered to sign a current contract, they refused to fix their mistake or even take responsibility.  I would not recommend doing business with this company until they refine their business practices.  There are many more companies that offer the same type of services and will offer better customer service.\n\n***Update - I hired their competitor for half the cost yearly and I would suggest doing that.  From what I have learned about pest control, Bama Exterminating is using older bait stations which is why they need to come service them four times a year.  Companies that use more modern equipment are lower cost because the stations need to be serviced less often.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888603267877fefd:0x2a05ac8851bf106c"}
