I asked about prices for the procedure and inquired about getting an implant down the road. The lady I spoke with gave me a quote for everything including the bone graph required to have an implant done when healed. The price she gave me was $415, I do have dental insurance, but it still seemed lower than I was expecting. I asked her again to make sure I heard her correctly and wrote down everything she told me. Well I get there this morning and the Dr comes in to go over everything they are going to do and then another lady comes in to go over pricing again and get my payment info. She informs me that she saw the quote I was given in my notes, but she didn't know where the other lady had gotten those figures because they were not correct. She informs me it was going to be $992 for the exact same thing I was already quoted the much lower price of. I told her that I was not paying that price so she does some figuring on the computer and tells me $650ish without the bone graph to which I replied, I'm still not paying that price, she needs to go talk to the lady who quoted me the other price. She walks out for a few minutes and comes back in and says the other lady is not there today, but they can do everything but the graph for $476. I declined that price again and told her they should have to honor the price I was quoted, especially if it was in my notes. She said they could not do that, that it was just an estimate. Well I'm sorry, being quoted one price weeks ago only to get there today and it has more than doubled, is not an estimate to me. They never said it was an estimate, they specifically used the word quote! Needless to say, I am still dealing with a broken tooth because I refuse to pay more than double what I was told it was going to cost me out of pocket.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a83fef37800d:0x51e8a2ea70656792"}

The Dr. did have good bedside manner in my opinion, however, my daughter did seem to have some unusual extreme swelling even after 48 hrs  following the instructions of icing the area etc. I\u2019m not absolutely sure why this occurred but the office has been emailed and I\u2019m still awaiting a response. I have a rare genetic disease that unfortunately my daughter has the gene for and if not carefully watched certain medications given can turn the gene into the disease. I wasn\u2019t informed what type of medications they planned to give her prior to the procedure when I asked to know the nurse seemed to have an attitude and reluctantly told me to come back to see. While back there talking about the list with the doctor the incompetent nurse proceeded to start my daughters I.V. Instead of at least waiting until we had finished determining if the medications were indeed okay all while rolling her eyes. Which was so disrespectful I can\u2019t even imagine how such a person in a field of care could show such disregard but I guess that\u2019s how she was raised to be. I\u2019m not sure. However, there are two office staff members that are always most helpful that sit on the side. The lady at the front when you walk in was not very thorough she didn\u2019t make sure I had the cost information prior to the day of the procedure in writing (I had to ask for it as well as the code explanations), she also didn\u2019t make sure my daughter had an excuse for school but did offer one to the Caucasian lady that came in after me just not to me for some reason \ud83d\ude12. However the lovely lady on the side provided what I needed which I am most grateful for. As I said there are good staff members it\u2019s just probably half good, half bad but the doctor was nice 50% of his staff I would say need some serious retraining and empathy towards others if they are going to stay in that field or look for another industry where care isn\u2019t essential.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886213520971870f:0x1444005ad0a93d19"}

His arrogance and lack of empathy made for terrible bedside manner. After removing all four of our 16 year old daughters wisdom teeth on July 3rd, she was in recovery longer than anticipated. I waited patiently until I was called back to sit with her. She apparently hadn\u2019t  tolerated the  Anastasia well. They released her to be taken home while her eyes were literally still rolling back in her head as the nurses walked her out. Over the long holiday weekend, dry sockets formed. I realize this is something that sometimes happens and isn\u2019t necessarily the fault of the surgeon. My daughter was in agony, with pain medication doing nothing to dull her pain. When I called the after hours emergency number, listed on the discharge instructions sheet provided to us, they were completely useless. I seriously don\u2019t even know why they have one. I was rudely told twice, once by the after hours staff member who answered the phone and again by Dr. Hudson himself to \u201ccall the office during regular business hours to schedule an appointment. \u201c  At that point, I debated going on to the ER, but decided to have her at Dr. Hudson office as soon as they opened the following morning. We arrived 15 minutes prior to opening, signed in 2nd, only to be \u201cworked in\u201d to the schedule. While my daughter sat in the waiting room in misery, no urgent attention was shown. When we were finally called back, dr. Hudson examined and packed a bottom socket. My daughter did not receive relief as the dr. and his staff insisted she would. She kept trying to tell them the pain was coming from the upper socket which Dr Hudson and his assistant would NOT hear of, nor would he even look at.  They told us repeatedly she was wrong, and the pain she felt wasn\u2019t coming from the upper socket, bc it was basically unheard of to develop an upper dry socket. They also repeatedly tried to get us to leave,  saying she would feel better in 15-30 minutes. I finally stated that I wasn\u2019t leaving with her until I knew she was relieved. Dr. Hudson then SHOVED his hand into the top of her mouth asking \u201cis THIS where you\u2019re uncomfortable?!?\u201d She grimaced and moaned in pain and tears flowed. Even I began crying just watching the scene. I absolutely was in shock and disbelief at what had just happened. Then, he stepped back and admitted it appeared to be an upper dry socket. He also admitted he couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d packed an upper, and that he didn\u2019t know that he ever had. Once it was packed, she did get relief from the pain within a few minutes. I suppose Dr. Clint Hudson is an adequate surgeon so long as the patient doesn\u2019t have any complications from the surgery, and if the complications aren\u2019t rare or unusual. If there are complications, better hope they only occur during regular office hours. Since there is no way of knowing beforehand if these will occur, I\u2019d suggest finding a different oral surgeon. I believe in giving credit where it is due, and there was an assistant who works for Dr. Hudson named Micki who was very sweet and sympathetic. On the flip side, another who I believe name was Jan was as rude and uncaring as the Dr. himself.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886213520971870f:0x1444005ad0a93d19"}

I'll be sure to follow up with another review once my surgery/recovery is complete!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626f79490dca35:0xff5cd4e83e04e39e"}

My appointment for surgery was 1:00pm. I didn\u2019t get called back until about 1:45pm. No big deal since I cleared my schedule for the rest of the day.  About 4 days after my surgery, I started experiencing numbness on my top left gum. I called and I asked to speak to Dr. Bannon but the representative gave the phone to his nurse, Natalie. This happened twice. I called on Monday 2/10/2020 and Tuesday 2/11/2020.  Since I couldn\u2019t speak to Dr. Bannon, I asked if I could or would have a follow up appointment. Natalie stated that they do not typically do follow up appointments on wisdom teeth so she didn\u2019t book me a follow up. I understand he is busy and may not have time to talk with patients. Also, I respect all nurses but I would have like to have spoke to the surgeon  at this point who perform my surgery because I am in so much discomfort with this feeling of numbness. I am worried that I could have nerve damage and I want to have a piece of mind speaking to Dr. Bannon. Today, 2/13/2020, I stood firm with my request and book an appointment to speak with him. Another representative booked me an appointment for today at 3:30. I will provide an update once I see Dr. Bannon.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626f79490dca35:0xff5cd4e83e04e39e"}

Otherwise, I had a somewhat satisfactory experience at the office.  Reviewing my options was not on the Dentist's agenda.  He deflected any talk of pulling the bad tooth and replacing it with a partial bridge.  I asked for more info about pulling the tooth, cutting the bridge and installing a partial removable bridge...and he left the exam room.   Later, after talking more with the receptionist, I learned that I should schedule for an early morning appointment because the later the appointment, the more chance of something occurring. (?)  The procedure the oral surgeon recommended  was decidedly \"NOT\" conservative, as he had stated.  'General anesthesia' and 'conservative' do not belong in the same sentence. Believe me.  I'm board certified in anesthesiology.   General anesthesia is dangerous at best.  Who would be administering the anesthesia?   Cutting and lifting a mucoperiosteal flap and drilling into my mandible to remove the infected tooth as advocated by the Dentist because of an overlying four tooth bridge was not without danger and fear on my part.  Also, he didn't want to adjust or use Lovenol instead of my daily Coumadin dose during the operation.   Drilling into a 73 year old man's bone is not on my top ten in popularity.  This was to be the fifth major procedure I was contemplating on this area, which was the original site of a bone cyst.  I've had bone graft, a $4185.00 bridge placed, and other horrors.  I asked for a long lasting solution and my choice of a partial bridge after cutting the bridge to remove the bad tooth, and installing a partial bridge was not in his best interest apparently.  I discovered that a general dentist can do this procedure, which was my first, and still my only choice.   I have scheduled this procedure with a dentist and my insurance will cover it, unlike the $725+ that I would have to pony up for the oral surgery.  My health insurance company, United Healthcare  would pay for the oral surgery procedure but would not pay for the anesthesia($725). How am I supposed to undergo bone drilling and extraction without general anesthesia???\nP.S. I went back to my old dentist, who opted out of UHC because they weren't paying for his work.  Figure that out.   He did a great job.  His name is Dr. Matthew Gibson, on County Line Rd in Madison, Alabama.  It cost me but  I made it through the procedure quite well and am going to have my partial bridge placed.  Good luck to all who venture on the treacherous terrain of health care.  If the insurance company doesn't get you, the \"health care provider\" will. Get a second opinion and garner professional level advice before embarking on any procedures.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626f79490dca35:0xff5cd4e83e04e39e"}

The office is very nice, VERY efficient (we were in an out within an hour), and the Dr. himself seems attentive, and even called to check in on us that evening. My problem is with the post-op info - or lack thereof - from the nurse who helped my husband to the car.\n\nShe handed me a single sheet that mostly covered medication schedules and dietary restrictions, a pack of gauze, and 4 prescriptions. I have no knowledge of how to care for oral postop things, but my mom's a nurse so i know these things can go smoothly or horribly depending on the patient's choices after surgery - behavior that is usually informed by the advise of medical staff, since the general populace is presumably ignorant (safest assumption). I asked if I needed to replace the gauze as soon as we got home, and was about to ask what all he needed to avoid doing. The nurse quickly said, cordially but also sharply such that she cut me off before i could ask, \"everything you need to know is written on this sheet\" and told me to call if I had questions. Well, long story short he ended up using a straw and doing a few other things I had no idea he wasn't supposed to, because i didn't //know// those were things i needed to ask about, and the sheet made no mention of any of them. I am now unsure how much of his pain is a natural consequence, and how much is our fault. So now we're keeping an eye on, questioning every symptom, which is stressful for both of us.

During that time, the intent was to keep my teeth and gums as healthy as possible. Regularly scheduled deep cleaning worked. However, my doctor retired and the new staff had different ideas. The regularly scheduled deep cleaning was no longer an option, and within a couple of years my teeth deteriorated to the point where it was embarrassing to even smile. The new staff recommended extractions, at first only a few teeth. Ultimately, they planned to extract all my teeth and do implants. I agreed to have the first three teeth extracted. That was the beginning of a horrible time for me. After the extractions I bled profusely and was in a lot of pain. For two weeks I continued to bleed on and off. I was frightened ,I could not eat, and I was miserable. As time passed it didn't get much better, and I was not myself, as I was normally very outgoing and talkative, but now became very uncomfortable around people. The staff then recommended extracting the rest of my teeth and doing implants. But I was afraid of what might happen after the last experience. I thought, \"if I bled so profusely from 3 extractions, how would my body react to all my teeth being extracted\". The thoughts going through my head were all scary and uncertain. I sought out other opinions, but did not have a good feeling with anyone. Finally, in late 2016, I met with Dr. Sam Nizam. When we met, I immediately felt the connection, and I was comfortable. Dr. Sam listened to all my concerns attentively. I knew the qualities in a doctor that I was looking for and Dr. Sam had all of them. Dr. Sam sat me down and explained step by step what he recommended and how the procedures would be done. He was so calm and confident, and did not sugar coat anything. He explained that I needed 26 extractions, and why. He explained that I needed bone grafting for the implants to take, where he would need to do the grafting, and why. He explained that I needed a sinus lift, and where and why. Also, he showed me visually on the computer and pointed out exactly where my implants would be placed, to have the best chance of success. He explained how all procedures would be done at the same time. I was still nervous about the whole process, but I had total confidence in Dr. Sam and agreed to schedule it as soon as possible. It was February, 2018. I was in surgery for 5 1/2 hours. He performed all the work that he had explained to me. I went home, knowing I was in good hands and that I was going to be fine. But I was just a little nervous, thinking I might bleed. Dr. Sam prescribed pain killers, which I took that night and went to sleep. I awoke after a peaceful night sleep. My bleeding was the size of a dime!. I had minimal pain. I stopped taking the pain killers. I went back for a follow up. Dr. Sam was pleased with the results and so was I. No pain, no bleeding, the implants (all 11 of them) all took. I now have new teeth. I can smile again. I can speak without fear and embarrassment. At my daughter's wedding I was able to proudly smile and laugh all night! Dr. Sam gave me my life back! I am myself again! Thank you!! I will always be grateful to Dr. Sam for the incredible work he did, that now gives me the chance to enjoy life as I had not been able to do for so long. If I ever have a problem, even though I now live many states away in New Jersey, I would not hesitate to make the trip. I recommend Dr. Sam highly . He has been blessed with a tremendous talent and gift to help people. I wish him all the best,and pray that his success helps thousands more like me in the future. - Linda K", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXOD5MDeQykhOWyJzNjQ_ZTNsvFxMngiU7Owt6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2b3cc3f973f1:0xa4ac2f65d2cc478d"}

The procedure was quick, but that is not saying much considering the entire office was clearly in a rush which made more sense after the receptionist informed me they were trying to leave at noon that day. I got my boyfriend home and about an hour later he went to remove his gauze and noticed they had FORGOTTEN TO REMOVE TWO OF HIS TEETH. We had to go back and thankfully we had about 20 min to spare before they closed. Not once did they say out loud they forgot anything, they just quietly whisked him back and seemed to want to keep everything hush hush (again, trying to leave early). They never even apologized to us for the MAJOR inconvenience of having to be put out again, to have another surgery after the one he had an hour ago.\n\nAfter 2 months of waiting, any time I called to inquire about our bill or to get a break down everyone was extremely rude.
