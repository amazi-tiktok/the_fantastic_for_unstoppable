I looked far and wide on the social media sites, visited at least four different bike shops in and around the Birmingham area. I found Chris at Guntersville Outfitters and was expecting something close to what I had experienced at the other retail stores.\n\nI was in for a very pleasant surprise. Some background is in order. I was an avid cyclist many, many years back. I had gotten away from biking as my interests took me to other hobbies. I rode occasionally and then not at all. I still have bikes I bought new back in 2000 and 2002. Then about 5 rides ago I rediscovered why I loved mountain biking so much.\n\nNothing is quite as peaceful and at the same time as exciting as gliding through the woods on your bike and seeing the beauty of nature unroll before you. So reinvigorated and re-energized I began looking for my next bike. Kind of funny how technology had changed what I thought was top end back in the early 2000\u2019s.\n\nEnough about the history. I also have a passion for genuine, sincere customer service. I love the person who knows what to say and when to say it. Who asks about you and your needs. Who listens \u201cbetween the lines\u201d at what you are really saying or asking about. I found all these qualities in Chris at Guntersville Outfitters.\n\nHe responded to all inquiries quickly and thoroughly. He asked the right questions to understand my needs. He made recommendations based off his experience. I could not make it to his store until the weekend. Boy was I excited. Like a kid in a candy store.\n\nWhen the weekend came I made the drive to see him. He greeted me by name as soon as I walked into his store. What followed was a very insightful demonstration of two bikes. We talked about the pros and cons to each. The benefits to me of one over the other. I never felt pressured. Never felt rushed.\n\nI had a folder with at least a dozen used bikes that would have saved me money. While deciding which one to buy, I was able to watch and listen to Chris engage with other customers also. He was consistent and professional with each one. My mind was made up. I purchased my new bike from Chris.\n\nI followed up with him to let him know about my first ride. He was quick to respond to my text with well wishes and an offer of any further assistance. I am very pleased with the service, the price and the overall value of the transaction. It is not always about the money you could save or the distance you might have to drive. It is about the relationship you build.\n\nThank you to Chris!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889f8d66617b291:0x7940dfc270a90cab"}

When I asked the status of my bike, at first, he didn't know where my bike was located, I had to point it out to him. Then when I asked why my bike wasn't fixed yet he said, \"we have a lot of bikes\" and he shrugged. Then I asked him how long it would take to fix and he said about a half hour. So basically, he's telling me in 47 hours of a working week they couldn't get a 30 minute bike job done. Even if he had exactly 94 bikes this past week that each took a half hour to fix I still would be skeptical. Had to ask myself, \"Why should I wait around another 30 minutes while he does a lazy poor repair?\" But he did recommend to avoid riding the bike not to cause any further damage, \"Ya think?\"! No hustle no dedication. Go here if you want to be treated like your time and money are not worthy.

After talking with Ben, the manager, I was pretty impressed with the business and the level of knowledge and technical skills the staff demonstrated.  I was impressed enough that I returned last week with my Canyon for a much needed tune up and preventative maintenance.  JT and James took a lot of time with me to ensure that they fully understood what I wanted while simultaneously inputting their maintenance advice to absolutely ensure that my servicing plan was exactly what I needed.  I valued their advice because as part of my service I wanted new cables, chain, front disk brake (slight warp), and new wheel bearings.  They agreed with the cables and chain but went out of their way to straighten the disk brake and clean, inspect, and re-grease the bearings, which of course wound up being a much greater value for the money, at least on my side of the deal.  I have around 100 miles on the service and the replacement parts and the service adjustments and tuning are perfect. These small things combined with the quality of the final product earn Trek Bicycles of Auburn a great deal of trust from me, which in turn ensures that I will make that tedious drive every time I need service for my bike.  Additionally, for new bike purchases and bike accessory needs the store has many bikes on hand and nearly every accessory that one should want or need.

Although a novice at the beginning, I was helped to find a bike that would meet my needs.  I was not oversold.  I was fitted both in terms of how I would ride, my budget and my overall enjoyment with the sport of trail / mountain biking.\n\nWell three bikes later, two for my daughter and one more for me, and I am still extremely satisfied with everything the team does for me and my daughter.  I have upgraded to soft tails and happy I have done so.  James Bros does an excellent job of keeping my bike(s) operating safely.  I cannot stress the term \"safely\" enough.  If you have loose or worn out parts, you are putting your life in jeopardy on the trials in the area.  The staff at James Bros makes sure everything that goes out the door is ready to ride - safely.\n\nEddie and Raleigh offer sound, professional advice.  They do NOT try to sell you something you do not need.  They DO make sure what you ride is safe and enjoyable.  They listen to you.  Really listen.  They find price points and products to fit your needs.  James Bros does not sell \"cheap\" products.  They offer solid value for the money for quality bikes and service.  If you need something they do not have in stock, they will find it.  They will service it.  They will back it up every time.\n\nOne example of how they help.   I needed a locking device for my new soft tail.  Eddie could have easily sold me what was in stock or even ordered a cable set.  However, that is not really what I needed.  So, he  suggested going a big box building store - Lowes - get a long length of plastic coated cable, a good lock and make the custom cable I needed for transporting and storing the bike in my truck.  Problem solved.  And he did it knowing he could have sold me a short cable set that would NOT have met my needs.\n\nEach time I stop by, I am greeted as if I were an old friend.  That is how they treat everyone.  I would like to think I am special.  Perhaps.  But they treat everyone as an old special friend.   There has been more than one time when I have arrived near closing time when the team went ahead, took the bike in, and had it serviced before the end of the next day.  Eddie even came in when the shop was technically closed to help me with a part that was misbehaving.\n\nOverall, I want to make sure folks know James Bros is a well respected bike shop.  If you need something, they will find it and help you with it.  Regardless of your skill or budget, James Bros will work with and for you.\nThank you for many years of a happy biking.\n\nSincerely,\nDanny Butler", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3957860c0f1:0x11d9dc83b7f994c3"}

The thing is like a jigsaw puzzle! They didn't charge us to assemble it AND, the company is big on giving to the Active Duty a Military discount...

I ordered a 1851 Colt Navy .44 caliber steel frame revolver from them and I couldn't be happier. Great price and I received it within 1 week. The transaction couldn't have gone smoother!! It's an absolutely gorgeous piece and a great price. I tried to order the same revolver from dixie gun works and after one month it still hadn't shipped so I cancelled the order. Shipping was fast even with a nationwide firearms and ammo shortage as well as the pandemic crisis.  I could not be happier,  I will order from them again.

No Thanks LG Outdoors!\n\nUpdate: Received a response from LG Outdoors and they pretty much played the blame game on bots buying up all the Primers. At $419.99 for a box of 1000 Primers is a ridiculous price. Normally primers are $0.04 each and with this price, it makes it $0.41 each. Just shows human greed from a company. Understand there is a shortage. Maybe hold off on selling Primers until supplies come readily available and go back to a reasonable price. I yes I have not bought from this company and never will.

I received a notification that they had primers in stock, so I went to place an order. They were asking $315/1000 for Federal small pistol match primers and $250 for Federal large rifle primers. These normally go for about $50 and $40 respectively. They are 100% trying to take advantage of people due to the shortage. Between this and the fact that they are probably one of the worst reviewed companies I've ever seen I can't believe anybody gives this place a dime. It'd probably be less painful to burn the money you were going to give them and throw yourself down the stairs.\n\nEdited to add:  Your response is laughable. All the reputable stores (Midway USA, Natchez, Brownells, Cabelas, etc.) are still selling primers for regular price. They just sell out as soon as they get them in stock so you need to have in stock alerts set up and be ready to buy immediately. You look even worse for trying to justify being a price gouger.\n\nEdited to add again:  I see you've changed your response from justifying your price gouging to now claiming there is some coordinated effort to attack your company.  I personally don't know, nor have I communicated in any way with any of the other reviewers.  If you think reviews from perspective buyers who opted not to buy from your company due to shady business practices are irrelevant, then you are a complete moron.

The only reason you have any chance at all buy some is due to the fact they are priced at the low end of the market price, any lowered and they sell out instantly before you even get a chance.  So is it better not to be able to buy any at all, or is it better to be able to pay a little more and just buy enough for you immediate needs.  The public sets the price they are willing to pay.  When the goods are priced lower than market, they are gone instantly ad most people never have the chance to buy any at all.  More often than most people realize the market price for some things is far below cost and dealer and distributors end up selling them at a loss.  The good must continue to move, it does no good to eave product on the shelve that doesn't, it gets discounted until it reaches the market price and ten it will finally sell and if that is below cost we have to eat it.

I ordered an item from Amazon. an air purifier. It was sent \"adult signature required\" in error by the warehouse. That is different than \"signature required\" shipping. Adult sig required  means no changes, no address change, no local UPS store pickup. LG outdoors tried to change it on Thursday. I tried to have it re-routed and couldnt. Saturday delivery was not even an option. I had no way to sign for the package without taking time off work. I could only pick up from a UPS hub that was over an hour from my house so I had UPS return the item. The item arrived back to them on Friday. On Tuesday I told them to just send the item back via regular shipping. A man from customer service and I had a pleasant conversation about this on Thursday. This week Shelly has been in. On Tuesday she said she was waiting on the warehouse to respond to their emails. Today which is Wednesday I sent another email asking for an update since I was suppose to hear back by end of business on Tuesday. Shelly told me they were still waiting on the warehouse and I should hear back by the end of the day today. I told her that is exactly what you told me yesterday. She then said they were waiting to hear back from me on if I wanted a refund or return shipment. I told her that we had emailed yesterday about just sending it back and that everything she has told me so far has been a lie and all seems repetitive. Shelly then raised her voice, changed her tone to a very condescending one. After you all made an error and I still was patient and tried to work you, you give me the customer and attitude and hang up the phone? So yes. #$%* you just give me a refund. I even called back to give her another chance. She answered the phone with an attitude. Look at their feedback on amazon and on here. It seems Shelly has been losing more business than her services are worth.  Their negative reviews are increasing according to their amazon profile. 20% over the past year and now 28% over the past 6 months with less reviews being left. My advice is to close the doors on Shelly or close the doors on your 20 year old business. I will work with you to correct an error and we tried that until she got involved.

Although the gun came quickly and sales staff is friendly the owner himself seems a bit off balance.  I am active duty military stationed in AL and when I went to pick up the rifle I showed my military ID and my AL concealed carry permit.  The owner wanted a copy of my USMC orders bringing me here to AL and when I stated that is not something we generally carry on our persons, he stated it was federal law. When I questioned him in an attempt to get a better understanding of the law and using as example in the last 18 months I have purchased weapons from Walter Craig, Gulf States Distributors, and Gander Mountain in Montgomery with no requirement to furnish a copy of my military orders, he no kidding exploded!  Literally told me to get the (f-bleep) out of his store and he would charge me for a restocking fee!  This was one of the most insane and oddest moments I have ever had in a retailers shop.  This experience is difficult to describe in believable terms and was rather off putting.  As far as I could tell he was the only angry person on the premises.\n\nI was able to talk to his sales staff and they explained that it was his policy.  I understand that and the information upfront would have been extremely helpful.  I want to comply with any reasonable store policies and would have had I known this was an issue for the owner.  In the end my wife was able to email me a copy and I completed the transaction.  His salesman saved the purchase and I truly believe he is a sincere and helpful person.\n\nHaving said all that I really think purchasing from this establishment is a mistake and I wish I would have walked after the verbal assault and string of profanities.  If you do decide to venture into his place of business be careful; He appeared genuinely angry (which should concern any responsible gun owner), completely narcissistic, not open to any conversation that would question his authority, and is armed!  This man went from 0 to 100 in a nano-second over an issue that I still can\u2019t quite figure out.  Could be he is not a fan of the Marine Corps or the military in general...hope that is not the case and he was just having a bad day but I won\u2019t trust him with my business again.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1482593794721, "text": "We have an A+ rating on the BBB\nhttps://www.bbb.org/us/al/wetumpka/profile/sporting-goods-retail/lg-outdoors-0463-90021317\n\nIf you want true reviews of our company then please check out our reviews at resellerratings.com where we have over 3,726 reviews with an average of 4.72 out of 5.\nhttps://www.resellerratings.com/store/LG_Outdoors\n\nWhen we send out our customer satisfaction emails we use Reseller Ratings.
