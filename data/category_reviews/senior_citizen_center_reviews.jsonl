I had the opportunity to meet both Amy & Jeremy. Amy runs the Florence office while her husband operates Huntsville. They both really take the time to match the client with the best caregiver to not only meet their needs but personality too. Amy strives to make sure her employees can reach her anytime day/night, holidays, weekends etc. Everyone is very helpful & easy to work with. Taking time off is never an issue. Everyone works together to ensure coverage is met. I had an unexpected hospital admission at 3 in the morning & calling in to find coverage at that hour wasn't an issue. I was hospitalized for nearly a week. Amy was so supportive. Never had I had such an attentive boss. I can say for my part that I view her as not only my employer but also a friend.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d493c39927ddf:0xd5aaa5fa60c354"}

As with most long term care facilities, staffing adequately to meet the many diverse needs of the residents is very challenging leaving front line workers to be responsible for too many residents. When staffing is \u201cshort\u201d or inadequate, you will learn that management tells staff to \u201cJust try to keep them dry and turned.\u201d I put that in quotation marks because that\u2019s what I was told by the DON and ADON when I worked there. What it meant was skip showers, bed baths, getting residents up out of bed, etc ; in other words -Do the best that you can. Very hard work but somehow we, the staff would get more than the \u201cminimal\u201d done because \u201cwe cared\u201d!  The best co-workers and team players I ever worked with in long term care were at Hatley Health Care. The administrative staff, however were difficult and caused many nurses undue stress. The DON and ADON were always looking for a fall guy or a way to blame others for nursing errors or mishaps. Never once did they ever realize that it was the two of them who were at the root of any problem. If the ADON told us something to do and it ended up causing problems- she would simply deny she ever said that to us. The politics of the facility is their REAL DOWNFALL there - which leads to the staffing shortages and loss of experienced nurses. But it is as if they thrive on it! Family owned and managed - they do things the way they want to and are happy to do so. The level of care is good but it\u2019s the nurses and nursing assistants that make that happen despite upper management. The Administrator is young, smart and a real go getter whom I like very much. Once the DON and ADON retire, I believe things will improve with staffing. So there\u2019s hope!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ec88192e0d825:0xf3459a73d9cddc9c"}

They can very easily rectify matters, but so far they refuse to do so. It has to do with the beauty salon.\nIf you\u2019re loved one wishes to get their hair done they may make use of the in-house salon. There is a form that the person responsible to pay the salon charges fills out. You may leave a credit card on file and you may opt to just have your card used whenever the resident wishes or be asked if you\u2019re in agreement with your family member having their hair done before being charged. This is so that a family member who is losing their mental acuity doesn\u2019t decide to go get their hair done too often, which was our situation, and we stipulated on the form that we\u2019d like to be contacted first.\nHowever, our card was charged several times with no permission request beforehand. To the tune of approximately $500.00. With our busy life we didn\u2019t catch these charges as they were incurred. Once we did see them, we called and got them stopped.  To their credit, The Blake admitted they were in the wrong. However, it has been over a year of requesting the fraudulent charges be reversed or having a check sent to us. We\u2019ve been in touch with the beauty salon, patient representatives, the facility manager and a regional manager. We\u2019ve allowed each person along the way ample time to make it right, sometimes two months before we call again, but no resolution is ever forthcoming. Now, they\u2019ve stopped taking our calls.\nWe will now pursue this with our credit card company.\nOur family member passed away in May of 2020, so they are no longer a resident. I would hate to think that is the reason we now are not even getting our phone calls answered.\nIf you\u2019re wondering why our family member passed away, it was due to the virus. We were told she was the only one in the whole facility to contract it. A subsequent email from The Blake that was emailed to families of the residents claimed to have zero cases of the virus at The Blake.\nI suppose no place can be 100% above board at all times, but these things concern us.\nPlease don\u2019t misunderstand us. We realize the virus is strange and can effect some and not others. We have no ill feelings in that regard. These things happen. But we would love to be treated as well as we were when she was accepted there.\nWe have no other complaints.
