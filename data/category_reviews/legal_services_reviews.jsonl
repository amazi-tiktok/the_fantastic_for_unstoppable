Everyone has the right to post something negative online so this is a safe space for you to vent.

We tried to reach out to you three times by telephone to figure out what it is that you were upset about but you refuse to answer the phone and actually talk to us.  I guess you are busy working on your complaint to the attorney general\u2019s office and the Alabama State Bar (both of which we welcome you to file by the way - that is your right).  So, let me get this straight - you were visiting Alabama from Texas and you received a speeding ticket. You waited about a month and contacted our law firm to ask for help in handling the ticket.  We responded immediately, gave you the care and concern that you were seeking, went over the process with you and your options.  We quoted you a very reasonable fee and told you what we could do in order to resolve the case.  You told us that was too much and you were going to pay the ticket and move on - obviously that would not be based on our suggestion because we ALWAYS try to avoid a conviction for our clients (and we are a traffic ticket defense law firm... that you contacted for help).  Presumably, before you paid the ticket, you attempted to communicate on your own to try and get the ticket resolved (which every defendant out there has the right to do - only most people would do that first before contacting us but I guess that didn\u2019t occur to you).  You then called us back and were upset because you resolved the ticket on your own\u2026allegedly - after checking, it is clear that no resolution has been entered into the state system.  We love you man - but whatever it is that is troubling you has nothing to do with us - we hope you get whatever it is straightened out.  As for the frivolous complaints you have tried to threaten us with to the Alabama Attorney General\u2019s office and the Alabama State Bar - bring it on.  We fight like hell for ourselves just like we fight like hell for our clients.  And another thing you may want to keep in mind - the goal of resolving a traffic ticket is so that you have no conviction and presumably no public record of it.  But, you sir, have done a great job of creating a public record of it for whatever reason and for the entire world to see.  Best of luck to you.  Joseph C.

If I personally have an issue with a business, I usually contact the business directly and try to resolve whatever it is that is going on.  Businesses don\u2019t get to make things up or hide behind fake names on the internet - I am as transparent as it gets and all of my actual clients know this.\n*I have been practicing law for 16+ years and have successfully resolved 17,000+ charges for clients over that period of time.  I am a man - through and through - if someone has a problem with me, all they have to do is explain what the issue is and if I have made a mistake, then I am glad to admit the mistake, apologize and fix it.  That is the measure of a man.\nAnyone that knows me and that I have helped knows that I am not a hack, a liar or deceitful - far from it.  If only a successful law practice could be run with a paralegal through text messages - but as you would know if we actually represented you, when someone hires us they are able to text us (and our clients LOVE this option), email us, they get a link to schedule an appointment (at a time convenient for the client) to talk with my staff, they also get a link to schedule an appointment (at a time convenient for the client) with an attorney and also, get our direct dial so all they have to do is call us with a question or issue or to schedule a call with anyone that works for me or an attorney (myself included).\n* You don\u2019t get to the level we are and have the impeccable reputation across Alabama and the country that I have by \u201cpromising everything but delivering nothing.\u201d  Close to 100% of our charges we handle are ultimately dismissed - if that is \u201ccookie-cutter law\u201d then so be it.  Apparently, our clients love having their charges dismissed.  We have the utmost interest in defending cases - our actual clients know this.  Every single time we speak to a potential client or go over case resolutions with our clients, our goal is to develop options with the ultimate goal of having the charge(s) dismissed.  Once we have options on the table, we go over those options and our clients get to decide how to proceed - we don\u2019t force anyone to accept any offer on the table and are always available to continue fighting, take the case to the next level or have a trial.  It is our client\u2019s case and they get to decide.\n* Wow - in your review you said, \u201cI expect this kind of lying, duplicitous BS from the cops and the government but not the people you pay good money to represent you.\u201d  Really?  You expect the cops and the government to lie?  What a sad, sad worldview you have - which explains the many false statements you made while hiding behind a fake name.  I practice law to relieve human suffering - period.  No other reason.  I love people - even the people that choose to post random diatribes attacking me on the internet.\n*I invite anyone reading this or looking for a lawyer to Google my name (Joseph Kreps) and review the info about me and my law firm and all of the great work that we do throughout the State of Alabama for clients located all over the world.

Dismissal is wonderful! Best possible outcome.

I spent 10  hours in jail thinking my life would never be the same again once these charges  permanently stained my record. At first, I figured there was no point in hiring a lawyer  considering the fact that I was caught dead to rights. I was caught speeding. I was  caught with open container. I blew a .11 once I got to the station. What further proof  would they need to charge me with a DUI? How could I possibly get out of that? A  month went by and I still hadn't hired a lawyer. I got to thinking about it and I figured I  would try and find a good DUI attorney to at least provide some good advice before  entering my case single handedly. I then did some research, and happened to stumble  upon Attorney Joseph C Kreps' YouTube videos online that explained what would  happen if I were actually charged with these convictions. They were so enlightening that  I couldn't help but give this guy a call to see if he could help with my case. I gave him a  call & after getting my information & case details\u037e one of the first things his secretary  mentioned was that they may be able to get the sentence reduced to a public  intoxication. I was astounded, thinking there's no way. I was caught dead to rights. I'm  going down. No doubt about it. I then decided to pay the fee and to hire Attorney Joseph  C Kreps' as my DUI Defense Lawyer (not NEAR as high as what I was quoted from  other firms). His very helpful team then guided me through the process of completing a  series of tasks that would help my case. I completed a questionnaire and a few other\nsimple tasks that would, in fact, turn out to help my case tremendously. A month later, I  was scheduled to arrive in court on a Wednesday. On a Monday afternoon prior to my  court date, I received a phone call that explained to me that I wouldn't need to show up  in court on Wednesday and that there was a high possibility that my case was going to  be dismissed. I was absolutely thrilled. How could this happen? I was caught dead to  rights! Two days later I received a phone call and an email from the firm saying that if I  completed a level two CRO, 20 hours of community service, and paid a $600 fine plus  court costs, that all charges were to be dismissed! My entire future was left in the hands  of Attorney Joseph C Kreps, and I couldn't have put it in a better place. I now have no  DUI charges and no open container charges on my record. I'm telling you from  experience, this man and his firm are the absolute best DUI Defense Firm you could  possibly hire for your case. \u00ad If you have a DUI pending \u00ad Stop what you're doing \u00ad Call  this firm.

We don\u2019t want any trouble with you - you know that - but if a review is posted with false information then that is not fair and everyone would agree with that.  We certainly appreciate your comments and your feedback. We always love and enjoy any type of feedback.  We \u2764\ufe0f public criticism of our firm because it allows others to see how we handle our business and how we respond and most of all, it causes us to step back and fully analyze a problem or situation to see what happened, where we can improve and it gives us a valuable opportunity to reach out to a client who is clearly hurting and offer support in whatever way we can.\nWe never claim to be perfect and certainly don't want anyone to think that we are perfect.  As you know, Brooke, we did not represent you. \u00a0We represented your partner who is going through the immigration process in the United States of America. We take great pride in the knowledge and the experience that we have over the last 15+ years in handling and resolving 13,000\u001e+ charges all over the State of Alabama. When I was made aware of these issues, we reached out to you to try to resolve it within hours and on the next business morning 7-18-18.  When we did reach out ASAP, you went on and on and then hung up on us before we could even talk.  We tried to call back to no avail.  I personally tried to call back to no avail.\nThe first and most important thing that I would like to point out is that BOTH of the actual client\u2019s charges were DISMISSED.  And it wasn\u2019t just a \u201ctraffic ticket\u201d.  He had 2 charges one of which was failure to obey police/fireman.  Immigration is a difficult process and who knows how this could have seriously impacted his immigration issues - that process and system is ALWAYS CHANGING as everyone knows\u2026 but it shouldn\u2019t impact him now because we got BOTH OF HIS CHARGES DISMISSED \ud83d\ude09!\nAs to the class that was required of him, we are sorry that his time was taken from him in order to do that - our main concern was and is his immigration status and getting the charges dismissed.  His completing a class while his lawyers worked through issues beyond anyone\u2019s control seems like a small price to pay to continue the long and difficult process of becoming a legal United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Citizen.\nIt is important for anyone reading this to know that we did email you the DISMISSAL disposition of BOTH CHARGES back in March 2018... and heard not a peep out of you until this review surfaced almost 4.5 months later.  It is baffling.  We love deeply and dearly every single one of our clients and their friends and family including your partner and also you, Brooke. \u00a0We still love you no matter you might post about us.  This is the truth because our love for our clients and our love and passion for our work and the system is not dependent on how others think or feel about us because we know the truth and our love is our love no matter what - it\u2019s just who we are.\nI invite anyone reading this or looking for a lawyer to Google my name (Joseph Kreps) at any time and see all of the great information about me and my law firm and all of the great work that we do throughout the State of Alabama. \u00a0I stand by my work and the work of everyone who is on my team.  We love what we do because we love people and we love to help people - it\u2019s why I am alive and why I was put on this earth and called to do this type of work.\nMuch love to you, Brooke, and your partner.  If you change your mind and desire to speak to me then I am always here and always willing to talk.  If you or any family members need our help again in the future, please let us know as we would be honored to assist and help you with anything that comes up.\nJoseph C.

They are last ditch efforts after a criminal defendant has been convicted and their appeals denied.  Statistically they have some of the lowest possibility of success in the criminal justice system.  The only thing Eversole Law ever promises anyone is that we will do everything we can to help our clients in any way we can.  And Mr. Richardson, Steven Eversole did not represent your brother, but another attorney in the firm.   You should know that.  Either way,  Mr. Eversole has has great success filing Rule 32 and other post-conviction relief measures for clients, but nothing is ever guaranteed. In 2014 Mr. Eversole himself overturned 287 life sentences and over 2000 years sentence in one case.  In 2013 he overturned a sex crime conviction with life time registration  with an out-of-time Rule 32 Petition in a 26 year old case.  In 2015 Mr. Eversole overturned a several year old drug conviction with another out-of-time Rule 32 Petition.  And again in 2016 Mr. Eversole overturned a 2010, 20 year sentence on a drug trafficking conviction that released our client 15 years earlier on a post conviction relief measure.  And these are just a small accounting of his success. He has won appeals in both criminal and civil matters and been highly successful in both trial and appellate matters in hundreds if not thousands of cases.\n\nHere is just a sampling of Mr. Eversole and the his firm's success: Admitted to practice in All State and Federal Courts in Alabama: \u2022All Alabama State Courts, \u2022Alabama Supreme Court, \u2022Alabama Court of Appeals, \u2022Northern & Middle District of Alabama.

We chose Tim since he was  a member of our legal plan to represent us in a civil case. After telling us that the plan would not cover our case, we paid Tim a $2500 retainer. During this time Tim would be proactive and mail us copies of whatever documents he would send or file with the courts. I looked over our legal plan and found that his charges should have, in fact, been covered by our plan.Our legal plan's counse determined that this was so and advised Tim of the same. Since being notified that his time would be covered by the plan and  to not use my retainer for covered charges, I stopped getting any correspondence from his office. No copies of any documents,  no phone calls, no more updates, nothing. Tim never even told us that there was a hearing for summary judgement. The  only reason we found out was from a copy of the order from the  court, itself.  After the hearing, we found out that Tim didn't even argue our case as we had discussed. We eventually lost our case. Tim didn't even bother to notify us until over a week later. When asked about our options, Tim determined that he no longer wanted to represent us and referred us to another attorney who wouldn't even return our calls. When asked about the refund of the $2500 retainer, Tim put us off for over 6 weeks until he finally acknowledged he was trying to \"come up\" with the money. Our legal plan counsel had also been contacting him to return our retainer without further delay. Throughout this time and during our case Tim would never initiate contact with us. We had to initiate contact with him. Even then, it would take anywhere from a week and a half to a month before he would respond.  Tim eventually decided after 46 days that he was no longer going to refund our money despite knowing that his charges were covered by our plan. I have yet to get a breakdown of how my retainer was spent, much less anything else. I would never refer him to anyone. Now he is running for circuit court judge.

However, I looked it up and the alleged offense for which I was arrested CANNOT be expunged under Alabama law, though I plan to litigate that issue when the time is right.

If you do not receive the advice you need with any law group(s) I would suggest Legal Aid. Legal Aid response is much quicker. Also, legal aid will listen.

I will be back in touch with you before end of week.\" That was the kinda responses I got for every email I sent. She never got back to me or had time for my case. After several phone calls to her office, where you cannot get a live person to answer. I finally got a phone call back which I did record. I asked for an itemized statement which she claimed she doesn't give those. I asked it I could speak with the legal assistant working on my case she claimed she doesn't have those. I asked how much I had left in my retainer so I would have proof, since I didn't trust her at all at this point. She wouldn't give me a number but claimed I had plenty left that she doesn't charge much for anything. After I fired her she sent an itemized statement claiming I only had a couple hundred left and it would be mailed to me. I have filed a BBB complaint and a dispute with credit card company. I have not received anything from her and this was months ago. Do not hire this lawyer.

They also had a video you could watch & it really impressed me because they were so family oriented.  I made an appointment for a free consultation.  I was very impressed by the attention I got & the answers I received so I retained them.  They told me I could call any time I had a question or didn\u2019t understand something.  Well believe me I called with questions all the time (early in the morning or in the evenings) and even sent emails, lots of emails and they had answers for me & quickly.  If they didn\u2019t have an answer they researched it and got back to me.  They fought for my case and fought hard.  They were very thorough and knew what questions to ask the opposing attorney.  I received everything I asked for and more.  I couldn\u2019t be happier.  The whole staff at The Rose Law Firm, LLC was there for me.  If I had to do it all over again to hire an attorney, it would definitely be The Rose Law Firm, LLC\u2014100%.

What more can you ask? Price 8/10 I've used other attorneys in the past and shopped around too. The rates here fall about the middle of the range of all attorneys in town. Considering their expertise I feel like they were a bargain as I've found (and used) attorneys who were obviously not as talented or knowledgeable charging double the retainers. Results 10/10 I asked for a lot and they delivered, not much else to say. They came to every hearing, deposition, and finally my trial very prepared and polished. Thankfully they were very aggressive in arguing for me and in moving the case forward or I think the other side would have dragged their feet forever. I'm very happy with how everything turned out.

We don't charge by the child, only by the case and it's complexity, and I apologize that there was somehow confusion in that regard. We always strive to keep our costs competitive and our hourly costs are generally the same or lower (up to 40 percent or more in some cases) than firms with similar experience as us. There will always be someone who will do the job cheaper but that comes at a cost as well. Our attorneys go to specialized family law specific training and only practice family law every day and it does make a difference, especially vs. someone who does little family law, is newer, or does whatever kind of legal work comes along.

Our goal is always to minimize your stress as much as possible by completing cases as quickly, efficiently, and painless as possible under any given circumstance, and though we did try to do just that, I can understand your frustration at the entire situation you were put in to begin with by the opposing party. Unfortunately, as you witnessed, we do occasionally run into an extremely uncooperative opposing party who wants nothing more than to make the process more painful for everyone and who is intent on dragging the process out by any means necessary even if that means making serious allegations that we have to defend the client from. Although I really hated to lose you as a client right at the very end of your case, I\u2019m happy that we were able to take care of almost all necessary litigation for you including depositions, temporary hearings, the entire discovery process, and a settlement conference. I\u2019m glad to hear that someone else was able to pick right up where we left off and take care of the last steps for you in order to finish up your case. We have also been in the position many times wherein we\u2019ve taken over for another attorney and have been able to finish things relatively quickly due to most of the work already having been done, as it was in your particular situation.  Again, I\u2019m very sorry that the process was made so unnecessarily painful for you by the opposing party. That said, if you ever need support, if we can help you in any other way, or you just want to talk about all of this in more detail, please feel free to call us on our cell phones as we\u2019re always more than happy to answer your call.

Although we\u2019re all human, I personally would not easily excuse or have faith in any attorney that forgot a file even if it didn\u2019t have any outcome on your final case disposition. I have very high standards for myself and anyone that works for me and I can assure you I would have dealt with this former associate had you made me aware at the time. Regardless, I sincerely apologize. Although forgetting a file was totally out of character for him, I hope you can take some solace in the fact that he is no longer with the firm and has not been for over 5 years.  Although many years have passed since your case, you might recall that I was dealing with a life-threatening medical issue when you hired the firm and was not able to take your case on myself and thus the reason you used my associate at that time.  As far as multiple attorneys are concerned, I assume you are referring to our collaborative approach to law. We often have a primary and second chair attorney on a case working together. While this doesn\u2019t affect the overall cost of your case, the benefits to you can be immense. For instance, though all our attorneys are great we will use each attorney\u2019s greatest strengths to your advantage, so if someone is a better writer or researcher they might be assigned to that portion of your case. In addition, when it comes time to strategize on your case, instead of one attorney coming up with a strategy, you might have three or four working out the best strategy though you will only get billed for the time of one. In effect, you get the knowledge and expertise of multiple full-time family law attorneys for the price of one. This is something most firms can\u2019t offer. I apologize if this process wasn\u2019t clearly explained at the outset of your retaining of the firm. I will make sure that going forward we outline the process in writing to make it easier for clients to understand. Thank you again for your input, if you\u2019d ever like to talk about this in further detail my office door is always open and my phone on."}, "gmap_id": "0x88891b96bb3bf559:0x75ea9f559fa010f1"}

I will start with not being notified of canceled meetings and court dates. Actually I got a call one time canceling a meeting that I wasn't even told I had. Was informed by the defendant about a court cancelation and then a few days later received the letter from my attorney with a post marked date after my court date. The firm had to postpone my last court date because my attorney had another client that had a case to carry over from the previous week. When I questioned Mrs. Rose about hiring a new attorney and putting her on my case she told me I hired the Rose Law Firm not her.  With invoices showing her reviewing my case and me being charged for it I asked her why there was nobody from the firm there to represent me instead of me having to postpone again and her answer to me was \u201cyour case may not have been tried anyways \". You are charged for each email to and from as .10 of an hour unless there is an attachment and then it is .20. If you have a meeting scheduled and they have to cancel then you are charged for them to call and tell you. You are charged for them to park for court. Over a year and a half and all that has been done is cases postponed, deposition, emails, phone calls, 4 or 5 subpoenas, and a temporary order  that had to let my son live with his mother until another court date could be scheduled and I promise people would not believe what  I have paid for this service. Was told I would get a special setting for my case in order to get this done and now have found out the court  date scheduled for 4 months later is not a special setting and will most likely be pushed back further and cost me several thousand more dollars. I could go over the 4000 characters very easily with the way my case has been handled by this firm but if I can save one person from this problem then the $20,000+ will not have been ifor nothing.\n\nPS.....the firm has withdrawn from my case without letting me know and now I am just out those many thousands of dollars and have to start over with a new attorney which proves this firm cares about one thing and it is not your family.

Involved in a case that had never been before the Alabama Courts, we had no idea if we should fight or roll over and (pay)dead.  I am far from being a quitter but sometimes you feel that there is nothing or no one that can help you and the ones you care for. Sometimes it seems that the Justice system is anything but just. This is exactly how we felt all the way up to our final hearing. We new we were going to need an intelligent and thorough attorney. We researched and asked people who we should use and was referred to Mark. We went and talked with him and he took our case, but told us he couldn't promise anything. He told us that he would do the best he could, and that was all we could ask for. We just wanted what was fair and felt it was worth the fight. After trying to go to court without an attorney and seeing how that was going we just knew we had to have representation. Our finances were extremely tight and we worried that it might just all be for naught. It seemed the law just didn't have anything to protect us. Mark Gober searched and searched and found cases in several other states that supported our side, and gave us some hope. Still we were concerned that it could go either way. We even were concerned that the truth was not going to come out because everyone kept saying that it was all irrelevant. Even with all of the negative things we were hearing  we stuck it out and kept fighting because we felt that it mattered. We wanted our case to maybe help someone else in the future. Mark surpassed anything that we could have expected when we got in the courtroom for our final hearing. We were amazed by how thorough he was without even having to bring every detail into it (which could have taken a lot more time and cost us a whole lot more money). I could not believe it when he actually got them to admit things on the stand that showed exactly what was going on. Justice was truly done as much as it could possibly be thanks to Mark. This was a case for me of right vs. wrong and the good won out. Thank you so much for all that you have done for our family. You are a wonderful attorney and we will definitely tell everyone we know or talk with how hard you worked for us.
