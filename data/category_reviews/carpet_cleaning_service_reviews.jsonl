We cannot clean rugs with pet urine in the home as you do not want your hardwood floors to get wet.  In our facility the rugs go through many steps to be cleaned properly (dusting machine, submersion bath, centrifuge, hung in drying room and then any fringe is repaired).

It smells and looks great and Steve worked very hard to clean thoroughly and comply with requests.  He was also fair about giving me the best price he could.  A couple of things I would say could be improved - Steve was not provided anything by Chem-Dry to put under my heavy sofas to protect the legs since those could not be moved out of the room.  In the past, the company we used had some plastic squares.  Steve used plastic grocery bags from Target that I provided him and one faded the red onto the carpet but it is in an obscure place that is not noticeable.  Also it would seem ideal to have 2 people working the job vs. one because of better control of the long hoses, etc. which dripped some moisture and dirt from someone else's house onto my hardwood foyer.  Not preferred but not a big deal either.  Also, I signed the paperwork at the end without reading the words written, just the price.\nLater, my husband read it and asked me why the work was not guaranteed against the stains coming back, etc.  I plan to call and ask them about that.  Hopefully the stains won't come back so a moot point.\nI would recommend just the basic cleaning plus any pet stain treatment for rooms that might have pet soiling.  The basic formula is supposedly with baking soda and that is truly all natural.  There were options to buy two add-ons in the cleaning formula - an anti-microbial spray and a scotch-guard product.  I opted out on these 2 and don't think there were beneficial.  In fact have read that scotch-guard can be harmful to health.\nAlso, if you are expecting this service to have very little moisture after cleaning, not really so.  Even un-pet-treated rooms needed overnight to completely dry to move furniture back and my cleaning started at 11:00 am ish.\nHave a great day!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1553714008857, "text": "Susan, Thank you for your comments & for choosing Huntsville Chem-Dry to serve you.  We always strive for 5-star reviews but we welcome the opportunity to learn & improve from other reviews.  Your input is very valuable.  I want a take a minute or two to clarify a few things.\nIt is standard that we provide plastic tabs for furniture legs so I am embarrassed to hear that we did not have them on the van that day.  Plastic bags are not acceptable & I apologize for the inconvenience.\nWe run one man crews on the van to help keep the cleaning costs lower for our customers.\nOur paperwork & signature is an agreement confirming our price before the work begins & our agreement that we will do everything we can to remove stains but we cannot guarantee complete stain removal.\nWe do have 3 packages to choose from, our Basic Cleaning, our Stain Fighter Package & our Healthy Home Package.  Our Chem-Dry proprietary cleaning solution is called The Natural.  It is not like baking soda but it is a Green-Certified cleaning agent.  It is a wonderful product that does not leave a dirt attracting residue and has amazing cleaning abilities while still being safe to drink (tastes awful though)!  Our Stain Fighter package consists of co-applying the stain protectant (another Green-Certified product called PowerGuard) with the cleaning.  Scotchguard is a brand of protectant that is toxic but we pride ourselves on using safe products for the home.  Re-applying stain protectant is very important to extend the look of your carpets.  The original protectant wears off over time with vacuuming and normal activities.  You mentioned that yours is fairly new so it's always good to re-apply once a year on average, this will make cleaning up spills or muddy paws so easy on you in between professional cleanings.  Most companies spray some kind of protectant on the carpet after cleaning which creates a crusty top layer.  Our co-application of the protectant allows us to protect the entire carpet fiber, not just the top.  Our Healthy Home package is the combination of the cleaning, the protectant and an Ant-Microbial pre-spray which removes bacteria in the carpet (especially if there are pets).\nResults can vary with drying times in carpet depending on how dirty it is and what kind of carpet it is.  2-3 hours is average but we run our cleaning machine until the carpet is clean without soaking the carpet pad & we use a powerful extraction method for the best possible results.\nAgain, thank you Susan for your recommendations & please let me know if I can help in any way.\n\nTara Outson\nOwner, Huntsville Chem-Dry"}, "gmap_id": "0x88623e0338d7b62b:0x9436b519d7638670"}

It smells and looks great and Steve worked very hard to clean thoroughly and comply with requests.  He was also fair about giving me the best price he could.  A couple of things I would say could be improved - Steve was not provided anything by Chem-Dry to put under my heavy sofas to protect the legs since those could not be moved out of the room.  In the past, the company we used had some plastic squares.  Steve used plastic grocery bags from Target that I provided him and one faded the red onto the carpet but it is in an obscure place that is not noticeable.  Also it would seem ideal to have 2 people working the job vs. one because of better control of the long hoses, etc. which dripped some moisture and dirt from someone else's house onto my hardwood foyer.  Not preferred but not a big deal either.  Also, I signed the paperwork at the end without reading the words written, just the price.\nLater, my husband read it and asked me why the work was not guaranteed against the stains coming back, etc.  I plan to call and ask them about that.  Hopefully the stains won't come back so a moot point.\nI would recommend just the basic cleaning plus any pet stain treatment for rooms that might have pet soiling.  The basic formula is supposedly with baking soda and that is truly all natural.  There were options to buy two add-ons in the cleaning formula - an anti-microbial spray and a scotch-guard product.  I opted out on these 2 and don't think there were beneficial.  In fact have read that scotch-guard can be harmful to health.\nAlso, if you are expecting this service to have very little moisture after cleaning, not really so.  Even un-pet-treated rooms needed overnight to completely dry to move furniture back and my cleaning started at 11:00 am ish.\nHave a great day!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1553714008857, "text": "Susan, Thank you for your comments & for choosing Huntsville Chem-Dry to serve you.  We always strive for 5-star reviews but we welcome the opportunity to learn & improve from other reviews.  Your input is very valuable.  I want a take a minute or two to clarify a few things.\nIt is standard that we provide plastic tabs for furniture legs so I am embarrassed to hear that we did not have them on the van that day.  Plastic bags are not acceptable & I apologize for the inconvenience.\nWe run one man crews on the van to help keep the cleaning costs lower for our customers.\nOur paperwork & signature is an agreement confirming our price before the work begins & our agreement that we will do everything we can to remove stains but we cannot guarantee complete stain removal.\nWe do have 3 packages to choose from, our Basic Cleaning, our Stain Fighter Package & our Healthy Home Package.  Our Chem-Dry proprietary cleaning solution is called The Natural.  It is not like baking soda but it is a Green-Certified cleaning agent.  It is a wonderful product that does not leave a dirt attracting residue and has amazing cleaning abilities while still being safe to drink (tastes awful though)!  Our Stain Fighter package consists of co-applying the stain protectant (another Green-Certified product called PowerGuard) with the cleaning.  Scotchguard is a brand of protectant that is toxic but we pride ourselves on using safe products for the home.  Re-applying stain protectant is very important to extend the look of your carpets.  The original protectant wears off over time with vacuuming and normal activities.  You mentioned that yours is fairly new so it's always good to re-apply once a year on average, this will make cleaning up spills or muddy paws so easy on you in between professional cleanings.  Most companies spray some kind of protectant on the carpet after cleaning which creates a crusty top layer.  Our co-application of the protectant allows us to protect the entire carpet fiber, not just the top.  Our Healthy Home package is the combination of the cleaning, the protectant and an Ant-Microbial pre-spray which removes bacteria in the carpet (especially if there are pets).\nResults can vary with drying times in carpet depending on how dirty it is and what kind of carpet it is.  2-3 hours is average but we run our cleaning machine until the carpet is clean without soaking the carpet pad & we use a powerful extraction method for the best possible results.\nAgain, thank you Susan for your recommendations & please let me know if I can help in any way.\n\nTara Outson\nOwner, Huntsville Chem-Dry"}, "gmap_id": "0x88623e0338d7b62b:0x9436b519d7638670"}

I'm not quite sure what went wrong, but the owner, who answered the phone, was brusque and acted as if I was wasting her time... although I spent less than 3 minutes talking to her and only inquired about 2 things. I have a medical condition that makes it hard to speak quickly or process the speech of others, maybe that's where we got off on the wrong foot. Anyway, I tried to ask about the price for one room and a couple of other spots throughout the house. I was confused when she told me the price would be $135, as the website says a living room is $55. I asked her about it, and she told me the minimum is $135. That would have been fine (even though other companies I've called either do not have a minimum or have a smaller minimum), but the attitude behind the comment was if she was talking to a clueless employee rather than a potential customer. Wouldn't you get more customers if you spoke pleasantly and said something like, \"I'm sorry about that. Although we'd like to serve as many clients as possible, because of our high quality service, our overhead to come out for less than the price of 3 rooms wouldn't allow us to stay open for business.\" rather than \"No. There's a $135 minimum.\" in a rather snotty and abrupt tone? Because I had wondered why they weren't listed with the BBB, I asked if they were considering registering with them. I actually wasn't planning on asking about that, but I needed a minute to think after the first part of the conversation went so poorly. Things only got worse. In the same 'you're an idiot, leave me alone' tone, she said \"All that means is that you paid them a yearly fee.\" So after this friendly and pleasant interaction, I told her thank you anyway and hung up. I'd work on my customer interactions if I were this business owner. Who knows, maybe she was having an off-morning, or maybe my voice reminded her of someone she didn't like.

The proper protocol plan that you told my wife you were going to follow was not followed. You set bags of contaminated items on our personal items in a separate room.

Yes, I was upset because of all of this.\nAs my wife explained to you in the beginning,  she is highly allergic to mold. So, when I saw contaminated items drug through our living room and placed on our non contaminated things, it upset me. I even took pictures of it. I'm sorry your feelings got hurt, but you ruined our things and wasted our time.\n\nWe have now discovered that more things were ruined in the bags they carelessly packed. A bottle of shampoo was thrown into a bag where it broke open and poured onto my daughter's $300 camera, the bible she received from us at her Baptism, and many other valuables. That was just one bag. The amount of loss from this company is beyond a money value.

I met with Rick and his wife at the beginning of August for them to run air sample tests on my parents house. They ran the test in 4 rooms, and called me 2 days later with the results.  When Rick called me he said that the levels of Stachybotrys were among some of the highest indoor levels he had seen in his 15 years of experience. In addition to the phone call I received an email from him with the results and a message stating that it was very dangerous for anyone to enter that area without protective gear on. He also insisted that we allow them to come back out and test 2 more rooms in the same area. He and his wife came back the next day, August 11th or 12th, to run the other 2 tests. WE STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE RESULTS FROM THOSE TESTS THAT WE PAID FOR 2 MONTHS AGO. We have asked for the results multiple times and the only answer my Dad got was that the tests came back ok.\n\nBefore Paragon Industrial was hired to do the mold remediation, I spoke with Rick and his wife about their protocol for removing contaminated items as to not cross contaminate the other rooms and items. After talking with them at length about how they would do the job, I felt comfortable with the protocol and encouraged my 80 year old father to go with their company.\n\nThey told my parents that they needed to run the air scrubbers upstairs and clean the air ducts first. Why would you clean upstairs before you remediate the toxic black mold downstairs? That doesn't even make sense. The mold should have been remediated first, then the air ducts, and last the air scrubbers.\n\nWhen they came to start the remediation THEY DID NOT FOLLOW ANY OF THE PROTOCOLS THAT THEY HAD EXPLAINED TO ME IN DETAIL BEFORE BEING HIRED! As far as erecting containment barriers, they put up some plastic sheeting with duck tape that began peeling off of the walls and door the same day they were put up. The air conditioning vents were not sealed off and the unit was not shut off while they were ripping moldy Sheetrock down. Also, they threw everything into black garbage bags from the contaminated room and threw it on top of our furniture in the living room causing CROSS CONTAMINATION. There was also moldy Sheetrock strewn down the hall where they drug it out! They explained to me that the Sheetrock would be taken down in small pieces, bagged and sealed before being removed completely from the house.\n\nMy ELDERLY father called to tell us what was going on at the house and I told my husband to go make sure things were being done like they said they were going to do them. When my husband, Sean, got to the house he found a huge mess! EVERYTHING HAD BEEN CROSS CONTAMINATED! My husband was in shock at how careless they were being because he was concerned about the impact it would have on my health! We had recently found out that I have lesions on my spine, unusual rashes, peripheral neuropathy, daily debilitating migraines, and chronic sinus infections ALL caused by exposure to black mold. My husband had to leave me alone in bed after being released from the hospital to come over to the house to find out what was going on. That is the reason he reacted the way he did, because he is genuinely concerned about the health of his wife! Any man who saw someone doing something that would bring harm to his family would react the same way!\n\nMy father called Rick and released him from the job the next day. He was supposed to return some of the money that my dad had paid upfront, but of course that has not been returned. My parents paid out almost $4000 for them to make a grand mess out of everything!\n\nSince then my parents have had a professional air conditioning company come check the air ducts upstairs that were supposed to be cleaned for $900 and he showed them that they had only been wiped out a couple feet. He inquired about what was paid, and couldn't believe that they paid for the service!!!\n\nI would keep going if google would allow me more characters.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1509138999688, "text": "Like your husband, your recollection of events is inaccurate.\nThe work upstairs was a completely different Indoor Air Quality Issue.

I have had my carpets/rugs/furniture cleaned in my house by Steam King since 2011. I will agree that the initial cleaning is expensive due to payment for pretreat and protectant, however once the protectant is applied your first cleaning, they will come back out and clean the carpets for only the price it costs to reapply protectant. I have 15 stairs, 3 bedrooms and an area between the rooms and they pretreat/scrub stains, clean carpet, reapply protectant and sanatize for 109.

It is now Jul 2021 so now I am posting here:  I really did not want to leave this review as I really liked the technician that worked at my house as a person.  And I am not requesting that anything be done to make things right.  I am good at this point.  The job that was done on the tile floors was good (with one exception noted later).  What makes me unhappy is when I have to do work to clean up after a job is done.  I was a bit bothered right away when I noticed that the technician was leaving boot prints everywhere he walked on my hardwood floors on his way to the tile floors he was cleaning.  I didn't say anything as he was just starting, and I thought maybe it would be taken care of.  He worked hard and did a good job on the tile floors (with the one exception I will note later).  Once he was finished and was removing the corrugated water line and the machines, rancid smelling water was spilled in some areas on my hardwood floors.  Also, while pulling the corrugated water line out of the house, he pulled it around the corners of a room scuffing the baseboards.  I had to put my foot between the baseboard and the line so it would stop hitting the baseboard.  This prevented it from doing any noticeable damage.  He did bring in a wet mop and attempted to clean the hardwood area but did nothing more than smear the rancid smelling water around which dried leaving a VERY noticeable film on the floor.  I had to clean a fairly large area of the hardwood floor twice to remove the dried, rancid water and most of the smell.  As noted above (the one exception) I also mopped the tile floors he cleaned with vinegar and water as some of the quarter round in the tile floor area had filth on it and I figured some of that floor probably had some of the same rancid water on it.  The rancid water smell stayed in the house for more than a day.  The second cleaning of the hardwood floors and time got rid of the rest of it.   My bet is that the machines and/or the water line contained the rancid water from other jobs.  I really hate leaving comments like this, but it is probably important that the company be made aware of these type of issues for training purposes.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626c9eeb4ff555:0x1c3ae99102e6b228"}

And you bring up a great point about our pricing compared to traditional carpet cleaners. It is true that we are not the least expensive carpet cleaner in Huntsville, but our patented cleaning technology does provide a better long term value. The difference is our certified zero residue cleaning process. We will explain: with traditional carpet cleaners, soaps and detergents are combined with hot water extraction to clean and sanitize carpets. And although this is a tried and true process, it has a big problem; it's impossible to get all the soap and detergent out of the carpet. And this soapy residue (which can feel a little crunchy under your feet after drying) ends up acting like a dirt magnet which results in spots and traffic lanes reappearing. But with the Zerorez patented process, we do not use soaps and detergents to clean and sanitize carpets but instead a revolutionary, and completely non-toxic, solution called Empowered Water. This process results in a zero residue cleaning, and without residue, carpets stay cleaner, longer. Additionally, they feel softer than you can imagine. Thank you again for your business and fantastic review! We look forward to seeing you again."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626c9eeb4ff555:0x1c3ae99102e6b228"}

Because of time restraints, I decided to hire a cleaning service to come in to deep clean before moving in. I explained to the owner that I needed my home deep cleaned and move in ready.

I had to go behind them to ask questions like: \"Did you clean the top of the cabinets, did you wipe down doors, did you clean the windows,\" etc. because it wasn't being done. As I inspected the kitchen, I noticed dried food stuck on the cabinets, dust on top of the cabinets, which I asked them to go back and clean -same experience in the bathrooms. One of the last tasks was mopping the floor. As one lady mopped, I noticed a small puddle of water on the floor, so I wiped it up. I looked at the white napkin in my hand and it was gray. Yes, she mopped my bathroom and kitchen floors with a filthy mop. I brought it to her attention and the second lady mopped behind the first one with another dirty mop. I seriously thought about asking the ladies to leave early, but I overheard one of them talking on the phone (at work) telling the caller that she was trying to make some money and would be home soon.

I knew something was wrong with this man when he walks into the house and my dog starts to growl and bark and her hair started to stand up on her back the moment Mr. Jeff walked into my house. This man is extremely rude, very unprofessional, disrespectful, no customer service at all.I ran across this business because I was going shopping with my mother And saw the advertisement for carpet cleaning services on the side of an SUV and decided to hire a black owned business. Trying to support my community. I decided to go ahead with Jeff carpet cleaning services because he was black owned. From the moment I got on the phone with Mr. Jeff he was rude and nasty with a very unprofessional tone. He gave me a ridiculously high quote \u201cvery high even among the competitors in this area.But I decided to stick it out with him because I understood why I was using this business. So I begin to recruit my family and friends to come over to my house the day before the services are supposed to be rendered and remove all the bedroom furniture out of all the rooms that were I discussed with Jeff. We stayed up all night removing four bedrooms into the hallway, a kitchen and a dining room.  The day the services are supposed to be rendered, three hours before Mr. Jeff was supposed to come out to my house to clean my carpet he calls me and tells me he will not be able to clean my carpet due to the fact that I did not purchase the stair cleaning. Something he could have told me the day he came out to the house and I refuse the stair cleaning. He wait to the day of my appointment to call me and let me know very rudely and disrespectfully that he was not coming out to clean my carpet because of this. When I express my deepest concern about this matter he was very rude and very very nasty. I told him that his services were no longer need it I hung up the phone in his face and I contacted another carpet cleaning services that offer same-day service and they were $60 less than what Mr. Jeff was trying to overcharge me for four small rooms of carpet and one stairs.

The bathrooms were NOT cleaned, refrigerator wasn\u2019t cleaned, cabinets were not cleaned, dust and spider webs still remain in certain areas. It was so much that I discovered that wasn\u2019t cleaned. I literally had to clean my house myself.  I do want to say that they did clean my baseboards and the plantation blinds. When I notified their office and sent pictures, they asked if I wanted them to come back out. My reply was NOooooooo. You have already shown me how you clean. So she did take off the $180 up-charge.

I had my  rental house flood and it was the worst experience of my life using Serve Pro of Tuscaloosa.I had to call them 3-5 times to even go to the house to get the clean up  process started.Kept being told they was going out to start and when contractors went to give me estimates on repairs there would be no one at the house working on the clean up.They have lied to me several times about my property.Told me several different start and finish dates.They left drying fans in my house 7 days running after they had already cut the drywall and  insulation out. Drew one of the sales guys made up stories about the situation, told my tenant I had told him things when I hadn't even talked to the guy yet and told two different things ones to me and my tenant .I asked Drew why he did this and let him know I would be calling the office and  he proceeded to call my tenant a couple of times and send me a  6 page text over the situation which I found very unprofessional . When I called to complain about this Jacob the owners son took  up for the actions, was rude to me, did not listen to me and acted like I was bothering him.I was told my cabinets needed replaced when they did not. They pulled the vanity out of my master bathroom that did not need pulled out to begin with  without cutting the caulk and when they pulled the vanity it caused the mirror in the bathroom to fall on the sink shattering my mirror and busting my sink in the bathroom and tried to blame it on the heat in the room.I called  David the head of the construction department several times asking a start date and was told no repairs would be started  until they had 18 thousand upfront, Half the cost, and to ask my adjuster to call  his cooperate office and have Fed Ex deliver it to them.I asked my adjuster about it and he said that they did not that money upfront and was beyond shocked I had been told that.They still have their little lock box on my door a week after I told them I will not be using their services anymore, I have called four times to ask to have removed.I have called and asked  three times to speak to the owner of the franchise and got no response. The office staff is not friendly, they have horrible attitudes and make you feel  brushed off.  Brandy the girl in the office is very rude and  blows me off and acts like I'm a bother to her when I call to ask to speak to a manager or owner  . This is the most unprofessional company I have ever came into contact with in my life. And I strongly suggest people think  twice before using them for any reason. You will regret it if you  use this company, trust me on that.They thought since it was an insurance claim they would  take me for a run and rob me and  my insurance company blind and have caused me nothing  but a headache and  added stress from what happened to my home.\n\nChelsea\ndon't know how to reply to you  but this way. I too have a  job.

But then everything got very confusing. We didn't know what was going to happen or when. Then they came in and packed all of our things up, first our clothes and no one told us to keep out any clothes. So we had no clothes blankets or pillows by the time they finished. There was 2 rooms that just had to be cleaned but they threw out our beds and furniture and took out all the carpet. We put notes on two closets and put don't enter.. I found the notes in the floor when we returned. They packed up everything and took it with them but nothing was cleaned it was just in the box they had packed it in.\nThey told us they we're going to clean the duck work, it was not cleaned, the ceiling fans were not cleaned nor were the blinds. We have had to just  about replace everything  we own plus we had use or own  money to eat at the hotel for   for over 2 months. Being nice is great but we had to many people telling us different things..it took a month after we got to come home before they started bring things back. It made difficult to cook. We had to buy new pots just fry an egg.\nWhen they finally brought things back they were very confused about everything because the young guy and 3 woman that packed us up were fired. They didn't seem to know what was ours and what wasn't.  There are quite a few things missing.  Some of the items are antique and can't be replaced.  The thing is these items problem  went to someone else  and they just saw it was old and not there's. Maybe I need to go check the thrift store.  I didn't think this was going to be easy but this has been a nightmare. I have items that have tags on them, but they didn't take them or clean them. My blinds still have soot on them and it is not easy to clean. They we're supposed to clean and check or duct work , not even touched. And we saw the check our insurance sent them and that was way too much for this mess.

For two weeks, we checked every\nday, no workmen.  We were assured we would be back in by Christmas.  We went through three Project Managers, and\nthree different set of drywall and painters.  The first painting crew stood on my washer and dryer to paint the\nceiling in the laundry leaving dents and scratches.  We had stored the liquor from our bar in tubs in the garage,\nas Servpro would not remove alcohol from the home.  Apparently the painters had found it and consumed a great deal\nbefore they were removed from the job by Darin Ingle.  They also got paint all over our floors so Servpro brought\nin commercial scrubbers which removed the finish on all of our floors.\n\nTo shorten this story, I will cut to the return home.  We finally returned to our home in early March with work still\ngoing on, Painting and damaged floors. The first night home the water under the sink of my brand new cabinets\nflooded the kitchen.  They had to send in dryers and a plumber who said it was not hooked up correctly and\nreworked all of the kitchen dishwasher and sink plumbing. They sent in a professional flooring company  to assess\nthe floors. Their solution required us to move back into a hotel for at least a week so they could clean, reseal\nthe tile and recolor the grout.\n\nThe only thing that saved this project was Darin Ingle who arrived on the project in February.  Darin was sent in from another state to resolve the\nproblems at the Montgomery location that included our home.  Darin took the reins, brought in new crews and came\nevery day to ensure the work got back on track and that it was done correctly.  Darin's arrival was months into\nthe project and while we have never sued anyone, we were on the verge of doing just that to get another company\nto come in so we could go home.  I am not sure if Servpro's executives realize that Darin not only saved our project,\nsaved them from a lawsuit but did an amazing job saving their reputation.  I would only call them again if Darin Ingle handled the job.\nBecause of Darin, I am giving Servpro a 2 star rating and Darin a 5.\n\nAn update to my review.  I was contacted by Mr. Bowen, an owner.  Mr. Bowen was determined to do something to do something for All we had been through.  He offered to send in a crew or something.  While his offer was appreciated, we had already fixed many of the issues and did not feel we could ensure another work crew I agreed to think it over and get back with him.  The one thing, as I explained to him, that distressed me everytime I went into the laundry was the dents and scratches on the tops of the washer and dryer which he eagerly agreed to replace.  With much of manufacturing shut down for long periods, appliances are in short supply.  However, Mr. Bowen and Darin Ingle were able to replace order And have new ones installed.  My frustration is no longer renewed when I walk into my laundry room.  My thanks to Mr. Bowen for reaching out and making this a better experience, and to Darin Ingle for making it happen.  It is good to know they cared to make things better.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1600260211243, "text": "Hi Judy, I am one of the owners and I am terribly sorry to hear about your experience.

This was not the $125 interior detail, just a $12.95 interior cleaning. Not sure what that was to include but since there was an attempt to clean the window and vacuum, I assume that was included. We removed all items from the car to make this easier. On our SUV, the carpet appeared vacuumed in some areas and \"untouched\" in others. On our sedan, the trunk was not touched. We left empty compartments open for vacuuming/cleaning; that didn't happen. On both vehicles, the seats were not vacuumed.  The interior side of the windows had streaks and smudges. We won't go back.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88621257eb4fc911:0x30d2bc60e10a06b4"}

I spoke with Brittney on the phone to get details of the work included and to make the appointment. To sum it up, everything except the engine! I made the appointment and wednesday was there at 8:30am as scheduled. No one was there. At approximately 9 am employees showed up and took my car. Inwas told that the credit card scanner wasn\u2019t working so I would need to bring cash.\n\nAt 430 i called and was advised my car was done. When i got there I spoke with the man cleaning the exterior of my car. I asked if they cleaned the trunk jambs as I noticed a large deposit of mud when i got groceried the other day. He said yes. I then waited about 10 minutes for my car. I watched the man open the trunk and then wipe the trunk jambs...?\n\nIt was an overcast day and the car looked good... until I got home. My chrome exhaust was still black (i rubbed with my finger and it comes off), the fuel tank door was dirty (once again my finger lifted the dirt there), large spots on the chrome grill looked untouched, large spots on the lower door panels were untouched, smears on the windshield,and spots on the rims were untouched. I paid and their CC machine did work... amazing.\n\nI have pictures and videos of all things I mentioned.\n\nI was going to just leave it alone but knowing I paid $200 for a half a$$ job didn\u2019t sit well with me.\n\nI have to say the interior was GREAT! A little excessive with the oils but you can tell they took their time and got everything looking sharp!\n\nOn Friday i called and got Brittney on the phone again. I asked for a manager and she said she would relay a message for me. I told her I\u2019m calling to complain about the detail I got... she asked for details and i told her everything. She called back a few hours later and advised that the owner/manager said i can bring the car back. I advised that i didnt have all day to leave my car to be washed and waxed again. (I highly doubt it was even waxed as there was so many spots that were unwashed... the wax would have stuck to it). I told her honestly the interior looked great and id be ok with paying for that service but need to be reimbursed for the remainder. She basically told me that wasnt an option and that thisnis how the manager handled things. He doesnt talk to customers and just has her. I explained that im offering to pay for the work that was done correctly... most customers would just want a total refund. However, if she cant authorize that and the manager wont even talk to me to settle the issue, ill just have my CC company cancel the payment.\n\nI feel sad for Brittney as im sure she is put in this situation often.\n\nMy advice, stay away.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88621257eb4fc911:0x30d2bc60e10a06b4"}

There was cleaning product pooled in my cup holders. It looked like they had just sprayed it on in places and never wiped it off. My dash and console was all spotty, and covered in a mix of dust and cleaning spray. They did not open my hatch and vacuum the back. The front was vacuumed but not well. There was a tone of very fine loose dirt  on my from floor mats. It looked like it came from the inside of the shopvac they used to vacuum the car. I can't believe they use a shopvac for this. I have leather seats, and they did not so much as wipe them down. My back seat had dirt in it from where I had sat a pair of boots. It's still there. There are little spots all over the outside of my car. I suspect that is from the spray wax they put on. I'm not sure.\n\nThe worst part is, my car has an odor now. It smells like body odor.

First of all, the package was 124.00!!! So right off the back I'm thinking they MUST be excellent at their job. I was sadly mistaken! I dropped the car off in the morning after making an appointment online. I asked the guy on duty about what time the car would be done. He said \"about 1pm\". I was cool with that. So I left and went to run errands. Around 1:30pm I called the place to find out the status. The woman who answered the phone put me on hold for over 5 min so I hung up and drove to the place to see how things were going. When I got there there was an older woman complaining about a previous job they did to her car. I just remember her saying \"someone owes me 10 bucks to fix this\". Anyway, one worker sees me and says \"would you like to see your car?\" I said yes and followed him into the garage. The car STILL had the dark brown stains on the carpets! Before I can point it out he says \"I couldn't get it out. You should try dying the carpet.\" I was upset because the car also looked like they didn't vacuum well... if at all! Then there were dirt spots on my back window. The door jams were STILL dirty! The tires were dirty and the front bumper!  I ran my finger on both and lifted black dirt from those areas! They uses the wrong cleaning material on my middle console that caused paint to come off. I was very upset and dissatisfied snice I left it there for almost 6 hours already! I asked to speak with the manager. I told him this was no where near a good job for that price. After some deliberation, he agreed to knock off 25.00. This was a bit of a relief, but honestly, that was a 50.00 job (at best). THEN... about 2 hours later, that woman calls me back and says \"your car is ready for pickup\". I told her I already picked it up. She said \"oh I guess I called the wrong person\". I'm so annoyed with this place! They are so unorganized. Save your money and go elsewhere where they do a job that fits the amount that they are charging you. This was a waste of time.

Paid for tile cleaning and grout sealing. Crew had to come out 3 times in one day to attempt to fix and finish. First, they forgot to seal the shower that we paid $90 for them to do. Then, we noticed a film all over every single tile that would not come up; Technician did NOT allow the tile and grout to dry before spraying grout sealer..Then, did not wipe off the excess grout sealer, just left it all over each and every tile. 3rd trip out of same day to day to try and fix it, they used every chemical, scrubber machine, everything they had to try and get it off, guess what, didn't work. So now, my grout is wet UNDER the sealer, which never had proper curing time, because they did not let the grout dry before applying, and my tiles have giant stains, splotches, blobs all over every single one because they did not remove the sealer from the tile after spraying the grout. And on top of it, one of the technicians decided that no, all of my white grout was actually completely stained before they got here that's why it's dark (Not because it was wet, which was the case)..He ended up arguing with me and cursing at me.

They are already 50% more than competition for normal service. Deodorant or other add-ons will double the price.

Didn't make sense so I asked and couldn't get a satisfactory reason why the hard surfaces were so much more expensive, except 'that's our price, that's always been our price.' Well these prices just don't seem reasonable to me. Otherwise, can't fault the service.

Couldn't be easier. House only one year old. Rep on phone was not polite and not accomodating. When we arrived back after he completed work, there was zero change in the way the carpet looked, we found pins on surface of carpet that a good technician would have found. zero evidence of any cleaning. Called company back. Asked for another rep to come back and they said original rep had to. Company CONTRACTS for their work. Never recommend and never use again.\n\n****ADDITIONS OR RESPONSES after owner response. The Rep referred to was not your wife, but the \"contractor\" that he said he was doing our carpet. Your wife (or person who scheduled our cleaning) WAS friendly on the phone. If you do not use contractors perhaps the \"technician (rep)\" shouldn't tell us that.  The stains and lackluster was noticed BEFORE we put any furniture back into the home. Plus, the guy who did the cleaning REQUIRED that we pay prior to the work and to him not the office. Not used to paying prior to work and wont again. Nothing I have said is intentionally false or misleading.  Still highly disappointed in work and don't believe in luck but do thank you for the intended kind ending comment.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1601404614366, "text": "UPDATED 10-1-20 after another false claim by Stacy. For anyone reading this....please visit our about us page on our website...https://www.goprosteam.com/about-us/   as you can see Cams' picture and bio are listed and have been on our website for years. Stacy, this is tiring to say the least.  Let me fill you in on a little nugget of information...the technician is not only our employee he is my stepson, so I think we know a thing or two that goes on in our company.  I mean for goodness sake Stacy...we have company vans with our logo, company name, address and phone number plastered all over it with an expensive van wrap...do you think any company is gonna let a \"contractor\" drive their company vans?  They are not, so again, either you are confused or making this stuff up for whatever reason you have...not sure...maybe you are just having a bad week...still no reason to dump all over us. The reason you were required to pay upfront is because both you and your husband were leaving the house, this is company policy..otherwise if a customer stays they pay after work is completed.  Also...if Cam left a busines card with our logo all over it, it says his title \"OPERATIONS MANAGER\".  We have already asked Cam about his experience with you, as a matter of fact the only communication he had with you was on the phone when he called to ask a few directions to your home while he was on the way...you were not even there when the cleaning intially started, your husband was...so no Cam has no reason to tell you he is a contractor.  By the way....you did not pay Cam, he carries a credit card reader that is mobile, you were charged by my company...would you like to see a copy of the receipt?  Ive been more than nice to you over this but you keep making false claims.  Again I appreciate your business but please stop this...it is making you look foolish.  Once again we wish you all the luck in your new home.\n\nHi Stacy.  This is Matt Lowery, co owner and founder of Pro Steam Carpet Care.  First let me say it is unfortunate that you feel the need to leave such a false review of our company.  Secondly here is the url to our about us page on our website  https://www.goprosteam.com/about-us/  as you can see it has Cams' bio on there and states he is our OPERATIONS MANAGER, not a contractor so let me clear some things up for you.  Firstly...the \"rep\" on the phone is my wife and gets compliments daily on how helpful, resourceful, nice and educated she is, the \"rep\" that cleaned your carpet and furniture is an employee and has been employed with us for 8 years with zero complaints, only praised because he cares.  We are a family owned business and have been for 30 years.  Secondly...you claim we \"contract\"  for our work....sorry but that is false and misleading.  We do not use contractors..we use employees.  We refused to send a different technician because your husband called us approx 4 days after the job was completed and after you had moved in due to a \"stain\" reappearing.  We were more than happy to reservice your carpet at no charge but the technician who originally cleaned your carpet was already familiar with your carpet and had absolutely no problem in returning to satisfy you....I found it odd that your husband called back and canceled the reservice of your carpets.   We do have before and after pics of your furniture, they are like night and day and cleaned up perfectly.  If I am able to post the pics to this response I will.  I do however have a suspicion that since we performed the carpet cleaning BEFORE you moved in that during your moving process there was probably some soiling that occured....this is common, however it is still unfortunate you feel the need to leave a 1 star review.  We agreed to return to reservice your area and you refused.  We are a good, generous and honest company with many certifications and one of the only firms that is insured in the area.  We appreciate your business and wish you luck with your new home."}, "gmap_id": "0x88f5952399cc1ad9:0x87abb5071354d46d"}

I had friends stuck at my house during the height of COVID-19 with their 2 dogs.  Four animals in an 1100 sqft house for 7 months.  You get the picture.  Guest just left last month and I am still trying to clean up after all have left.  So I decided to refinance my house.  Then I received a call that my home needed an appraisal for my refinance.  Ok, no big deal, except the appraiser would be here in 1 week.  I needed my carpets cleaned FAST.  Panic set in when ALL my normal carpet cleaners in Newnan were unavailable until after appraisal date.  So, I searched for companies in LaGrange and read the reviews.\nPro Steam seemed like the best option.  I called and Ali was able to get me on their schedule same week.   Price was affordable, in my budget and primarily fit my time constraints.  Cam arrived on time, went over the house and was very thorough.   I really appreciated how quick Ali was able to get me scheduled due to extremely tight timeline. I was amazed that the products they used smelled refreshing AND DID NOT bother my sinuses at all!!!   That is saying something because glass cleaner will make my nose burn.  My carpets look like new, all the little \"oops\" stops are gone, house smells AMAZING.   Cam was here about 2 hours and I was able to continue working while my carpets were cleaned, even had a few calls and no issues at all with noise.\nSo, if you are looking for carpet cleaners, this local owned company is AWESOME!!!

I love that the owner (Godfrey) and his longtime manager (Russell) personally come to your home and are the ones doing the cleaning. They really care about customer satisfaction and take their time doing each step right. We recently put our house up for sale and called MaxCARE to schedule a whole house carpet cleaning. Our 16 year old carpet looked so bright and clean that, I kid you not, one person told the agent showing the house that they were surprised we did not mention in the MLS listing that we had recently replaced the carpet. WOW!! I highly recommend this company!! Their prices are hard to beat and if you find anything lower, you'll probably get what you pay for. They are always on time and extremely professional because again, you are only dealing with the owner and he cares about his business and his reputation. They take their time and make sure they go over stains and high traffic areas more than once. They also gave us chocolate chip cookies when they were finished!

First, you play phone tag with a person for a day then they want to come and measure each square foot of carpet to be cleaned which required me to drive 30 miles to the home,which in the end was a waste of time.

Charging attorney fee rates is ridiculous, you're cleaning carpet for 2 or 3 hours without going to law school for 6 to 8 years. In my opinion he just didn't want to do the job. Also wanted like $1.15 a sq. ft to clean tile with over 500 ft. to be done. Again, it ain't that difficult and those prices must be from New York or Cali.

Until I found Clean Supreme, burning the car was the only option. Because of the situation, regular detailing was not sufficient for us. We needed someone with experience in this area. After talking with her she immediately reassured me that she could take care of the problem, since she has experience with rodent infestations in hoarder situations.
