This in spite of numerous requests for it.\n\nQuestions I had about my order status received responses of \"It's a small job\" so it is not at the top of their priorities, or \"We've had problems because of COVID-19\", or \"Your job is probably in powder coat\".\n\nLast year they said the order would probably be delivered in mid December 2020. That would have made delivery 5 1/2 months after the order was placed. Promised responses on status & drawing did not happened.\n\nI expressed my displeasure with my experience with them after waiting for nine and one half months to get what I ordered.  Their response was to cancel the job and refund my deposit.  I received the refund check - taped to the inside of the mailing envelope. Apparently they can't handle constructive criticism.\n\nOverall a terrible experience and I don't recommend this company.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886215db7a41bf5b:0x4b1dbbd94a7b06fc"}

They called back the next week while I was at a job site and unable to place an order.  I asked them to call me back later or the next day and was told \"No.  You'll have to call us back.  We're busy.\". I gave them one more chance when I left a voicemail on the 7th of August.  This was one of two times my call went through.
