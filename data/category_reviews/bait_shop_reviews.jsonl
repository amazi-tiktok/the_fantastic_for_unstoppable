They have great coffee the best I've found in Cullman. Again though the attitudes have made my visits undesirable and I'll be going there less now.  Another example has been when I get wings or chicken strips or even a hamburger they dont ask if I want condiments that generally go with the food but they will ask everyone around me if they want sauce or lettuce and tomato??? I am in Cullman for work purposes and when I found this place it was like a little hole from home and I fell in love but that has since deteriorated a bit and will be visiting less. :(", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889c8a1afbce07d:0xa6bfd7eb7184cef5"}

Also maybe add more variety of lunch menu items.
