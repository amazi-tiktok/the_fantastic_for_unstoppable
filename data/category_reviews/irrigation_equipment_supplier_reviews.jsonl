They showed up late (without calling) to give me an estimate, and then showed up unannounced the day they came to work. But then things took a surprising turn..\n>   They were hired to fell one tree and heavily trim the lower branches of another. To save money and to give me a project involving strenuous exercise, they were not required to do any cleanup work. When they asked about my cleanup plans, I mentioned using my ATV trailer to move the debris to the street for pickup by the city. At their suggestion I moved the trailer into the work area. Suddenly the logs and branches magically found their way onto the trailer until it was full, with the remainder piled neatly nearby. Despite not being paid for it, they worked hard to minimize the cleanup work remaining for me, a fat 74 year old retired soldier.\n>  It was also interesting and entertaining to watch their tree climber work. He knew exactly where and how to make cuts to have the pieces fall right where he wanted them. And while 20+ feet up into the tree being trimmed, he asked me over and over what else I wanted cut. He never suggested being done until I was satisfied.\n>   Finally, when the work was done, they did a last minute walk-around to check for any tools left behind, and to pick up more debris so I wouldn't have to.\n>   The team's work (and work ethics) more than made up for the early communications problems.

I asked/called (repeatedly) for a rep to come out and get with me to get an estimate, I wasn't even sure it needed to be pushed at all I just assumed given my gate size. I wanted someone, a supposed professional, to tell me what they thought. However, after just simply driving by quickly out front of my yard they surmised (and didn't actually call to follow up) that they wouldn't be able to service my yard. It must be nice that you have plenty of business that you can not only turn away potential new customers but also treat them poorly with poor follow through and lackluster effort. I understand the eb and flow of your operations and how you can't push mow entire yards. I wasn't sure that it required that and if it did I would of possibly still been interested in the front yard being serviced which can be completed with a riding mower. You should evaluate your business operations and how you portray the business as a veteran ran organization (with I'm assuming good order and discipline, integrity, and work ethic) because I don't see that in your company right now.\n\nAgain to be clear your representative that \"stopped by\" rolled by for 20 seconds (we are all working from home and I watched him) and surely couldn't have gathered a full sight picture. Which is weird because I asked  your office rep if I could safely talk with him (at distance) and was told that wouldn't be an issue, clear lack of follow through there as well. Also, I was interested in other services your company might have provided but in light of this entire process lacking professionalism and follow through I wouldn't be confident in ANY work you could provide.

We went out a couple of weeks later to work on leveling the area and realized that all three tree stumps were still there. I have sent an email and called and left a voicemail, and have heard nothing back from the company. I understand that companies get busy during this season but they responded rather quickly to secure the job and aren't responding at all now to complete it and it's quite frustrating.

Called a few of the top rated companies on google and could not get a call back. Then Tahj and Pedro rolled by the house one day and handed me a pamphlet. I called them up and Mike responded quickly. Amanda at the office made the scheduling and transaction a breeze. Tahj and Dan started work promptly the day of the project and hammered out most of the clean out before lunch. After lunch Eric and Pedro joined the team and the entire crew finished the job. In 10 hours they had completely cleaned out and dug-up/removed the weeds and 12 over grown bushes from the front, back, and side beds, removed 5 stumps, cleaned out an over grown play area and had taken out 2 dying trees. By night fall, they had the yard mulched and ready for phase 2 - replanting in the spring. The following morning Tahj dropped by to mow the grass and edge the entire property, just as he had promised. You can tell Tahj gave a damn, and treated the place like his own. Eric brought the knowledge and had no problem answering my questions about plants and things while they worked. Pedro kept them honest, while Dan provided the laughs. As a veteran I appreciated that from all the guys. The price was fair for the work performed and worth every penny to us. Thank you guys for your service and for the service. Look forward to the next few phases in the coming months.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1573819430173, "text": "Mr. Nimmo, thank you so much for this review!
