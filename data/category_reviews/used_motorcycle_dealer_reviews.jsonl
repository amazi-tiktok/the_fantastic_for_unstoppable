After pickup I was charged the $100 and told they don\u2019t straighten handlebars! I called and the service manager was unwilling to either refund the $100 or straighten the handlebars. He even refused to admit they charged me for straightening the handlebars and read the receipt which said nothing about my handlebars. I know what I was told would be done when I was quoted a price, they ripped me off. I would HIGHLY recommend not doing business with these crooks!\nUpdate: In response to the owner\u2019s reply... Your service manager was unprofessional and argumentative, repeatedly talking over me during our short conversation. I asked to be transferred to \u201cthe owner\u201d because I thought you\u2019d actually listen to a customer\u2019s complaint, but I was told you were not there and I quote your service manager \u201cI am the only one you\u2019re going to deal with\u201d. Sadly he was right because I still haven\u2019t received a phone call from you to hear my side of the story.\nI\u2019ve heard stories about how you treat your customers. I\u2019m just glad I learned my lesson on a dirt bike repair, not a purchase. Fortunately was only overcharged $100 but that\u2019s enough to lose my business and spread the word for others to go elsewhere.\nDon\u2019t just take my word for it Mobile, I suggest you ask around before you do business with Hall's.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1550615121188, "text": "We regret this customer feels this way about his service experience.  It is our company policy to not straighten handlebars if they are bent due to the structural damage that has been caused, for the safety of our customers.  Safety is our utmost priority and we were upfront that we cannot straighten/bend damaged handlebars.   We suggested to replace the handlebars, which was declined by the customer.  The only charges, stated in the customer's receipt, was for the replacement of front tire, oil change, and safety inspection.  We offered to repair the customer's damaged forks, triple clamps, and handlebars and unfortunately, those repairs were declined."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4c55fd1ea6e1:0x29463d3329c58ec4"}

I was told they would charge me to look at it if they could not submit a warranty claim to Honda.  This is lack of basic customer service.  If you want your customers to come back you take care of them.  Take care of your customer and they will take care of you.\n\nLater still, I wanted to trade in my paid off bike that I purchased from them for a new one.  They told me if I wanted to trade in that they would \"give me a good price\" for my bike because I bought it from them and I'm buying another.  Great!!!, or so I thought...  They offered me about 80% of my motorcycles KBB Trade in Value.  80% of Trade In!!!

My original review was a bit critical, due primarily to my lack of experience working with dealers when buying a new bike.   Let me elaborate:\nDealership:  Original review was that this was a typical Harley Dealership,  however after visiting a few others out of the area, I would say it is above average.  Welcoming staff with good selection of bikes and gear, an overall comfortable environment to shop.\nFinance:  They definitely did not mess around with offering a solid interest rate out of the gate.  The finance person was great, explained all the numbers and answered all my questions.  The application process was easy and overall enjoyable.\nPricing:  Spot on pricing with MSRP.  Standard doc, destination fees, however there wasn\u2019t an additional mark up on the price.\nSales:  This is where the deal fell apart. Another dealer offered to include the new riders course ($250) and deliver the bike for free ( a little over 50 miles ).  Being my local Harley dealer and a member of the same owners group,  I thought this might be standard among the three shops. It was not.   When I asked if they would do the same, the answer was \u201cno\u201d.  Asked if that was a deal breaker, I replied yes and that was the end of that until I posted my review here online.\nA different sales person contacted me and tried to make the deal, unfortunately I was still annoyed and never really gave him a chance to try to work it out.\nOverall, I have no reservations giving this dealer a 5 star review after shopping around, the majority of the process was smooth and enjoyable.  After all is said and done would I go back and try again, absolutely.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1621743788893, "text": "Very sorry to hear this, Ropa.

The GM reached out to me quickly and decisively and solved my most recent problem.  I was really impressed with what he said about his commitment to making the quality of service at Heart of Dixie as great as the quality of shopping and sales.\n\nORIGINAL POST on 10/15/2015... Loved the \"bike purchase\" part--5 stars.  Bought a brand new Vrod Muscle in 2011 and a new Road Glide Ultra in 2012.  Unfortunately, like so many other businesses out there, once you buy they forget all about you.  I'm speaking specifically about service--1 star.  The quality of service is fine--4 star, but the speed of service is what kills the rating for me--1 star.  Waiting two weeks on a regular basis to get your bike back is crazy.  That's been my experience on multiple occasions.  Counting today, five times, I've discovered problems as I'm about to go out of town on a ride.  They've been completely unwilling to work me in and help out so that I could make my trips.  Today was a little different.  I tried to get through to service and left messages beginning a 4 pm and now they've closed and still no call back.  I've had much better luck on service with Rider's Harley Davidson in Trussville.  Interesting to me that both stores are owned by the same man.  I've heard it said that the easiest customer to get is the one you already have.  In this particular case, I'll have to decide if the \"joy\" of owning a Harley is worth the aggravation of getting it taken care of!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1445528061992, "text": "Hi Bob, We're very happy that we were able to get this fixed for you.  We greatly appreciate your business and strive to make your Harley-Davidson experience here at Heart of Dixie top notch.
