Now honestly Huntsville, I have met my share of rude people, but I cannot and I will not saying I'll make such a comment towards the two nice ladies who works at Easy Money which is located at 4820 University Drive. I don't understand why their ratings are only 2.7 which is ridiculous! From my personal experience Shenikka and DeDe are the most kind and humble hearted ladies I've met and we've been living here almost one year now. We all know that when you go into an office or business you expect people to become magicians but they work in customer service. And there are some very rude people that can come and expect whatever the situation is it should automatically be okay for them to adjust but it doesn't work that way! You have to be very kind to people if you want them to be kind to you. You have to be humble when you want someone to help you and you would get the same treatment in return. So don't be fooled by this low rating that you see on this Google app because it's not true. These ladies will work with you any kind of way they can and is done without prejudice. So when you go into this store you can ask for either of them and I guarantee you they will be nice, they will be kind, and they will be very understanding of your situation and if they can help you they will. But don't go into the office or any business with a bad attitude oh, because of you bring me a bad attitude you may get one in return depend on the situation. So be very nice and kind to them as you want them to be to you. Don't say something bad about someone just because you had a messed-up situation that could not be fixed so you want to get back at a person by giving them a bad review it doesn't work that way. Be nice and kind and you'll get the same results in return. laser doing a real good job I appreciate you and keep on doing what you doing because you doing good work for this community that's so need you. And if corporate does not appreciate you for the work that you do then maybe they should come and switch places with you to see the type of situation that you deal with everyday because I think you all are doing a hell of a job and from my standpoint from what I see with my own two eyes, keep doing what you doing because your proof in the pudding of good customer service and what it's about. If if corporate does not appreciate you just know that we do parrot God bless you keep up the good work and I'm praying for your safety there it is terrible crisis that we are now in but only temporarily.

After using the \"esurance\" site searching 'car insurance', we chose Allstate, and were contacted by them immediately. The agent we spoke with, Olivia, was fantastic! After taking down all the info, we had a detailed quote, with various coverage options, e-mailed to us within minutes. While talking with her the following day about these options, she patiently answered all our questions and clearly conveyed information. Because she was so professional, upbeat, and intelligent, we decided that this is exactly the type of person we wanted to work with. So, besides the car insurance, we decided to move ALL our insurance (Car, Home, and Wind) over to her at Allstate. Buying Insurance is a complex process and never actually 'fun', but it is far more pleasant if you are dealing with an agent and Agency you have confidence in!

Prior to being with State Farm, I was with Allstate in Spanish Fort.\n\nI loved State Farm when I had them in Tuscaloosa, and decided I wanted to be back with the first insurance company that I loved. So, I switched over at the end of December 2016, and my policy started in January 2017. Well, in January 2017, not even ONE FULL MONTH into being with Rick's agency, I wrecked my car... and 3 other cars. I hit a car, which then hit a car (which they totaled out) which hit another car. 4 car, $29,000 wreck, apparently.\n\nOf course I was freaking out they would drop me - I hadn't even been with them an entire month! But they didn't. They had faith in me, and they kept me. And, they fixed my car! I was worried it would be totaled but it was fixed, good as new. I'm still driving it today. I also have renter's insurance through Rick and his crew.\n\nA special shout out to Heather Smith, who is AN ABSOLUTE LIFE-SAVER. She has been able to constantly answer my questions and has been so incredibly personable. I feel like we could have Thanksgiving together and it wouldn't be weird. She is such an asset to Rick's office. When I email her or call the office, I get an automatic response and having someone like that on your team who is such an effective and efficient communicator is absolutely invaluable.\n\nRick, Heather, and the entire team have been absolutely wonderful to work with and have taken great care of me.

I have been a customer of this agency (policies including homeowner\u2019s, multiple autos, and a boat) for approximately 5 years.  I had a claim due to a flash flood damaging a vehicle.  The claim process was a nightmare, mostly due to working with virtual/out-of-state adjusters (something Bryan\u2019s agency was apparently unaware of).\n\nIt took over a month to get the claim settled - currently on day 34 and the claim is still open.  The car was eventually totaled on day 22, but later Allstate decided they would rescind that decision and repair it (after I had purchased a replacement).  Later, they changed again and totaled it.\n\nOn day 13, I emailed the office manager and asked that Bryan call me.  I understand the agency does not directly deal with claims, but they can assist and advise where necessary, especially when the process is a bad experience for their customers.  Instead, his office manager called me, provided no assistance, and seemed surprised that Allstate does not have auto adjusters in Birmingham (where this agency is selling auto policies).\n\nAccording to the multiple solicitation emails I receive weekly, customer service is very important to this agency.  I have emailed Bryan three times and asked that he call me as stated above.  As of today (day 34), Bryan has not called nor contacted me outside of solicitation emails trying to sell me additional products and services.\n\nI eventually had to file a formal Department of Insurance complaint against the company and the agency.

I just noticed a $2.00 \"Installment Fee\" on my bill allowing them to make automatic monthly withdrawals from my account to pay my monthly car insurance bill. When I first signed up for insurance I was told if they had to mail my bill it would be a $2.00 monthly fee and the auto withdrawal from my account would be at no charge. NOW there is a charge. I am sure L.M. saved millions by not mailing out their bills if you consider postage, envelopes, printing costs and labor. Did I see a reduction in my insurance? NO. I called and asked the C.S. Rep about this charge and she said it was only recently initiated and all customers are being charged. She also stated if I wanted a bill mailed it costs $5.00/month. I think this is another example of corporate greed. Having the funds come from my account is not labor intensive, it happens automatically so what is the reason for any charge? I for one and sick and tired of being nickled and dimed for the sake of corporate big whigs wanting a bigger yacht or more expensive car or whatever.  I am in the process of looking for another insurer.

Everyone at this branch is a DREAM. They are SO sweet, so willing to go out of their way to save me a dollar on my plan, that I can't imagine switching for life.\n\nAs I learned recently, State Farm is a mutual company (no shareholders), which is a different type of insurance than many other companies, and it absolutely shows in the pricing and the customer experience. It's like the credit union version of insurance (I think! I'm still new to the concept). I know not everyone will get the lower price, but if you haven't tried, seriously give these ladies a call.\n\nOLD review: I'll be honest - I haven't met the agent, and I haven't spoken to anyone in the office at length. But to me, this simply speaks of the efficiency this office is working at. If I have an issue, boom, done by the front desk. Taken care of. Five minutes or less. Need to make an extra payment?

I am a first time homeowner and you would think that in the insurance business, most agents would be quite adept at offering some really good information regarding protective countermeasures that your home would benefit in having or some good tips on how to help prevent certain problems with the home.  Sure you could Google the information, but then what would be the use of having a \"certified and expert insurance agent\" like Holley if he refuses to answer questions.  Overall, I would either find another agent in the Farmer's Insurance community or I would simply keep shopping around.

Keri helped us navigate the claim adjuster process with ease.  After our roof was repaired and we closed the home sale, Keri was able to transfer our homeowners policy to a rental policy for a very brief period of time before we then closed on our new home.  Keri then transferred the renters policy back to a homeowners policy.  Keri handled our paperwork issues without delay and kept us fully informed of our policy status.  Keri even sent us a handwritten card for our thirty-third wedding anniversary which was signed by her as well as Mr. Poole's staff.  Keri has been a blessing to us - Mr. Poole is lucky to have her.

My husband and I began looking for our home to purchase in August 2017. After we decided on a home and were under contract I contacted Gabe for a quote. My husband and I decided that since we will be moving in a few years it was best to keep our current insurance-- we've never had any issues with them. We closed on our home on Oct 24th 2017. I noticed in November that our homeowners insurance never got paid (the seller paid 1 year at closing). I contacted both my insurance company and our mortgage company. The mortgage company had the incorrect insurance information and the two exchange information. In the meanwhile, Gabe showed up to my home and told my husband that I had contacted him to change insurance companies and had him sign an application--3 weeks AFTER we closed on our home. Now, why would an insurance agent that I contacted be going behind my back and having my husband sign paperwork? My husband trusts what he said and signs the paper, we just wrote it off as just for it was for quotes or something and never thought of it again. A couple of weeks later, I get a letter from our mortgage company stating that we had previously had Alfa insurance and that it was our responsibility to cancel our policy. Now, I never received a single letter from them-- I had no idea what my policy number even was. They had received a check and cashed it WITHOUT ANY KIND OF PERMISSION. I called Veterans United to find out that Gabe took it upon himself to get my PERSONAL loan information from my lender and added Alfa insurance to our loan-- we never signed any kind of paperwork when did this. I called Gabes office-- who could not care less about the issues I was having. The secretaries were VERY disrespectful and nasty. Then Gabe called me and was even worse. He was saying that he had text messages saying I wanted insurance-- which was not true. And said that this was my fault and that I had contacted him and I must have forgotten. I had to take this all the way up to the district manager and it took 2 months and I'm currently waiting on my refund check. Remember how I said the seller paid at closing? Well, that amount was less than what our current insurance is-- and since we've closed there is no way to get the hundreds of dollars difference back from the old seller so we are out this money because of Gabes actions. We never received any kind of apology and they take no responsibility. I would steer clear of Alfa insurance-- especially Gabe Martin.\n\n**** there one only one review of Gabe Martin-- from himself. Since I've given this very honest review magically there are multiple positive reviews. FAKE!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88926eb102cb9f25:0xa08cd89fd8078a60"}

We were solid paying customers and paid 6 months in advance the entire time we had the policy. My wife and I just merged bank accounts...so we contacted our agent and had the account switched to the merged account since we were planning to close the other one out... Allstate told us it was taken care of. Not True! - So we realized something was wrong when we got a notice (which was the 1st notice we had received) stating that our policy coverage had been terminated because of failure to make payment. We called the agent office and informed them that we had received the notice and apparently the amount of time it takes for the bank account changes to take place didn't kick it into effect until they had already tried to auto draft the payment from the wrong account and therefore instead of calling us to let us know, they just sent us a letter after the policy was terminated. So at this point I called to discuss with an agent on the Friday when we found out to see what could be done  because we were supposed to be going out of town and currently had no insurance coverage... I spoke with a very polite office admin in which I asked her to see if there was anything that could be done.... in which she obliged but she informed us that she would need to call the underwriter and make sure they were going to reinstate the policy, which we didn't think would be an issue because we had not had any accidents/accident claims while we had been under the related policy. So we get a call back about 2 hours later that the underwriter was not going to reinstate the policy because during the term of the coverage, my wife had made a claim to have a cracked windshield replaced in which she asked the agent before making the claim and was told that it would not go against us in regards to our policy or premium because it was part of what was covered under the policy that we were paying for. We asked them to see if there was a manager or agency owner that could do anything to correct the situation but apparently our local office manager was on vacation and the other branch managers that were supposedly contacted either weren't really contacted or didn't care because we were never contacted again and ended up having to find a new insurance coverage through a different agency. This was probably the worst I have ever been treated from a customer service standpoint in consideration that we are always good prompt paying customers and the fact that our bill not getting auto-drafted was attributed to Allstate's screw-up and then we weren't notified until our policy had already been cancelled and then they used the most petty excuse to not re-instate our policy.

I would recommend them to everyone just for the customer service, but to add to it is the much cheaper pricing for our auto insurance. I had previously priced around and finally enrolled with Geico. After some time I started getting calls from Christine in this office, trying to speak with me and give a quote for State Farm. As my busy days moved on the messages remained unreturned, until one afternoon Christine left the price quote in the voicemail. When I heard the amount I took a break at work to return the call and see if it was real.

They have this amazing lady name Katrina Prince, in the Anniston, Alabama location. When I very first signed up, she helped me make sure I was getting the coverage that I needed. Each year, when its time to renew, I call, but each time I encounter someone other than Mrs. Prince, it always ends up a problem, and me about to cancel and go to another company. Then, I end up either asking for or emailing her, who in turns always corrects the problem, and get me signed right on up. So, I have just decided that, I will contact her when its time to renew each year. Each of my friends with Direct also agree. She actually treat you like a close friend or family member. I have never felt rushed or forced to accept something I did not want. I have had cheaper rates offered, but I think the level of care Mrs. Prince shows to the customers keeps us there. I believe if she left, we would also.  I DON'T THINK THEY GET ANY BETTER THAN MRS. KATINA PRINCE.

I have advertised this particular branch to friends and family because of how well my wife and I are treated with the branch customer service. I have never felt a company or business care so much for their customers the way Jenna Mack\u2019s branch does. I tell Susan, my favorite representative of the Jenna Mack- State Farm branch all the time that the branch would be in a tough position if Susan didn\u2019t work there. I was living near Ozark when I started doing business with State Farm, but since then, I have lived in Birmingham and Dothan, Alabama. Now, my wife is travel nursing and we travel all over the Southeast. My business with Jenna Mack\u2019s State Farm branch continues today, not because it is in a convenient location for me, but because I will never find the same customer service or satisfaction elsewhere. When I began shopping for a new insurance provider, they were the least expensive, but since the day I began my business with them, I have not compared or questioned any of the prices for the policies I have because the customer service cannot compare. I know that I am receiving the best rates and policies the company has to offer because my representative, Susan, keeps me informed and tells me what I need to know. If there was any advice I would give to anyone, it would be to give this branch a chance. The moment you do, you will kick yourself for not having them in your lives sooner.

This was the same in this case. We bought a beachhouse in Gulf Shores and our normal insurance company back home wasn\u2019t able to insure the home being so far away. We were recommended to a whitehaven by our realtor for their service and pricing. Honestly the pricing was good but I can not say the same for the service. 9 months ago we had to file a claim for our tile roof that was leaking from a large storm that came through and tore off some of the tiles. 9 months later I\u2019m still trying to get the insurance holder to finish the claim their own adjuster has suggested to fully replace the roof due to the inability to match the tiles. Normally I\u2019d have it fixed myself but no one has been able to find suitable replacements that would even fit. Whitehaven has never once called to check on the claim nor offer any advice nor assistance with getting this completed. So we still have a beautiful beachhouse with a roof that has patchwork to prevent the leaks and reasonable cost insurance that\u2019s absolutely no good. Be careful what insurance you go with ... you just might need it one day. Also be careful who is your insurance broker. Whitehaven is quick to give you a quote and setup the insurance but absolutely no assistance when you really need them.

I put a stop payment on this last bill for the exact amount, which is required to stop the payment. What did they do? After bank stopped the draft, Wiggins agency dropped the amount down, after 6 months of fighting, to original pre half million dollar amount. Then ran it through again! Went through, of course, because it was a diff amount. So now, in addition to being overcharged since November, they have now taken money on insurance I no longer want.

Michelle's  sweet face popped up with  State Farm.\n\nShe has been so responsive even though i know she is busy.   She texts which I really  prefer.  With the same  deductibles on my BMW X5 diesel,  VW JettA diesel and old Jeep  CJ7 she managed to save me over $400.00 every six months.  That's close to $1,000.00 every year!  Real money \ud83d\udcb0\n\nThat is partly because State Farm has a niche for  older vehicles that can be classified as antiques.  My jeep is being  restored and the classification saved me quite a bit.\n\nI am a combat veteran but USAA has gotten ridiculously  expensive if you aren't married and apparently if you have more than 1 vehicle.   I am so  happy with  State Farm and Michelle.  She was so patient and I  felt like she was a long lost friend and she didn't hurry me at all even though I called her back far after she was closed.\n\nThank you for a great welcoming and outstanding  rates that blew the competition away!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1612808978984, "text": "Welcome to Alabama Van!

I also wanted to know why the amount was 100 instead of 80.. I advised Mr. Johnson I just called over the phone, and it had just advised me that it was 80 he rudely replied \u201c because it ain\u2019t got your reinstatement stuff on it that\u2019s 20 dollars\u201d . He proceeded to huff and puff due to me asking him a question so I then asked what was on my policy he ignored my question and went on to say \u201cyour policy ends this month and you just now asking what\u2019s on your policy?\u201d I then advised him it changed from 40 to 60 and needed to know why because I need something very basic... Mr. Johnson then stated LaQuinton messed up my policy by removing features that\u2019s needed and doesn\u2019t know why he did it because I have to have roadside asst. I advised I didn\u2019t need or want it I have it through my phone company he then said I can\u2019t remove it so you gotta pay it. The tone and approach was definitely off with him and I advised him it\u2019s a way to say everything being rude to loyal customers isn\u2019t the way I advised him I come up there every month and have never had any problems with anyone being rude until now and I will be seeking other places to get coverage at. I made the payment that definitely wasn\u2019t a issue I just had questions about my policy but him being rude and nice nasty just did it for me I won\u2019t be renewing in August..

I left the office after paying my down payment WITH insurance binder in hand, which told me that I was to be paying one price every month. I get a bill from State Farm and it is $77 MORE than the auto binder Lyndsey handed me. I tried to call Lyndsey, and I was promised a phone call back because she was busy. Hey, it happens. I'm busy with a life, too. But after waiting all day and the next day with no return call, I figured I'd just call customer relations. They couldn't even tell me why she gave me a binder with one price and I receive a bill with another price. So, CR put me in contact with this agency.  The little witch AT THE AGENCY (I can't remember her name) who was supposed to be helping me, HUNG UP IN MY FACE!!  I refuse to pay AND beg someone, too. I have been with State Farm before and never have I felt like a second hand citizen like I have by this agency these past couple of days.

First I was dealing with a girl that we will call C. She was sweet. She helped me start up my policy and because I was alone on this, I was new to everything. She assured me that everything would be okay and that things would work out and they did.....for a while. My bill fluctuated so much and at one point they managed to withdraw from my account twice with in a three month range and overdraft my bank account, see C knew I wouldn't have the funds for this stuff until a certain date and I was told by another rep at this office that  my stuff couldn't be withdrawn from my account on the day that I wanted. It had to be there way. I never saw, spoke to, or emailed with the representative in this office \"Rebekah brown\" instead I was shuffled over to another agent we will call her L. L took care of most of my stuff and because I didn't want the automatic withdraw she decided that it was OKAY for me to call in and make my payments. On the last day dealing with this particular office, I dealt with another agent and by then I had enough. I told this agent \"I do not want to speak to you do not call me back, I do not wish to deal with you, I am not going over anything with you.\" and this was because SHE wanted to change everything in my policy or do this and do that and this and that. All I wanted to know was WHY I was being charged 100$ more than what I was being charged the first go around. Now because of this office I AM WORKING with another agent and trying to UNWIND all the mess that was created by this office. It has been an absolute disaster. Here I am 3 months out from this agency and the new Agent is STILL cleaning up the mess created. Heck, at least I know who I am dealing with because they actually interface with their people, don't switch their people from agent to agent, and actually RETURN phone calls when they say they're going to call back. - Moral of the story - You want a faceless Rep? Go to this agency. Want someone who messes up the policy's and manages to make you pay for it all in one fell swoop? This is the one for you!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb2b2183000b5:0xb3c29c7861dfc9bd"}

I actually switched from Otto Brewer's office to her's because I THOUGHT she was a good agent. State Farm as a whole has been nothing but a nightmare since I began dealing with them. I just started my policy this year with them. The 1st month, I made my payment over the phone with the 1st office. I asked the secretary then if this payment would be automatically debited from my account each month so that I wouldn't have to worry about that payment. The 2nd month rolls around and I get an email and a statement in the mail about late payment and policy cancellation. I quickly call the office and ask why. The secretary explains that she never got my authorization to draft my account, so they didn't. So, I make the payment, and voila! same thing the next month! So they assure me they will get it right, but I say no, I will just call in each month and make my payment. Low and behold, THEY DRAFT MY ACCOUNT!! I had just paid the premium 2 weeks prior because of all the confusion, so twice in one month I paid them! Oh no, I only allot one payment a month for you all! So I request a refund and to switch to a new office. Instead of them just reversing the payment, they cut a check and I have to wait 7 days to get my money back! This really fires me up, but I remain a loyal customer to them and go to Tyna Carter's office! And she does me the SAME DARN WAY! I call and ask why did they draft my account when they were UNAUTHORIZED TO DO SO! Sadie answers the phone and is so very rude! I say hi Sadie...no response...\"This is T....Lewis\"....still no response. So I tell her my issue and she STILL DOESN'T SAY A WORD! I have to say hello after 2-3 minutes of silence. She then says, \"Umm, you didn't authorize us to take this payment huh?\" Sounding sarcastic and then says hold on. Mrs. Carter comes to the phone and tells me that I did sign an authorization for them. I say no ma'am I didn't, as a matter of fact, I told Raven, Sadie and the guy from the customer service line that I DID NOT WANT STATE FARM BACK IN MY BANK ACCOUNT! I told Sadie when she took my payment that I did not want them in my account because I had previously had issues with them doing that correctly. Mrs. Carter kept going back and forth with me until she saw the error, which was the info had just been transferred into the system and not changed when I asked them to upon changing to their office. She says that she could issue a refund that wasn't a problem, because AGAIN I HAVE PAID THEM TWICE IN ONE MONTH, but she NEVER ISSUED THE REFUND! In fact, the transaction is no longer pending in my account, they have taken it and not tried to reverse it. My guess is the hag cut me a check once again! I AM DONE WITH THIS SCREW UP OF A COMPANY!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a568ce24a79:0x8de56f76968b06ed"}

He made me feel like I was his only customer, and it was refreshing getting to deal with a local agent rather than the remote 800 number services I was accustomed to.\n\nI had them do a quote, and was greatly surprised at the amount of coverages I could get for home and auto.  Pricing was very competitive, and I was able to obtain extraordinary coverages, along with umbrella, and discovered they can provide coverages for my business as well.\n\nThus far, I've had a great experience and would encourage others to consider using this office for your insurance needs if you're in Baldwin County. This group seems to truly care about taking care of you and getting you set up with what you want for a reasonable price.\n\nHighly recommended!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a6937f7f9e637:0xe398eccd24a31f91"}

I called to discuss being cancelled for filing too many claims. She insisted on an appointment, claiming she could fix the problem. I arrived at the appointed time. When I got there, Candi was interacting with someone on a social level who had a new baby and pretty much ignored my presence. Eventually, the secretary said Candi had an appointment elsewhere and she left the building. She referred me to some guy who was brand new at the insurance business and only wanted to talk about being a star college football player. I eventually left after wasting around 30 minutes of time, even though Candi was the one who asked me to stop by in the first place. I was already doubtful she could do anything about the situation and I was eventually proven correct. Since then, I have had nothing to do with Candi or State Farm insurance and never intend to do so again. There are lots of State Farm agents in the area. My advice is to steer clear of anyone who would invite you to their business at a specific time and then spend that time playing with someone else's baby.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862684529559de3:0xc54c9762e359643f"}

Apparently I'm the only person who has ever been told \"we're just roadside.\"\n\nI just hope... that now that I have someone's email and direct number, that we can get through this....\n\nNow, on a previous claim, they had NO issue doing a claim when it was something against me.\n\nI also wanted to ask a simple question, but unfortunately, the person answering the phone acted like a full-stop barrier. They kept on focusing on a different claim, and would not even let me speak about this one.... that I FINALLY got started/a claim number for.\n\nI had to waste more time, drive down there to the office, to ask my question. My question had a short simple answer when I got there. It didn't have to be that complicated.\n\nVicki (sp?) always treated me right (within AAA's policy at least), but as a whole, AAA's insurance product just plain stinks compared to other policies I had in the past. Vicki is why I give AAA 2 stars instead of 1. I think she was trying her best.\n\nState Farm, who I came from, even though they accused me of false odometer every year (I work from home), they at least gave me a claim number when I called, and they ultimately covered things in the end, like glass, which AAA doesn't cover at all.  I keep learning of things with AAA that are not covered, or just under-insured...\n\nThe ultimate irony is, the Missouri AAA was sitting there accusing me of the false odometer thing too... the very reason why I left State Farm. I even ended up going down to the Acton Rd office to drag someone out to the car, so they can look  for themselves. On a modern car, you can't fake the odometer reading like you can on an older car... this is a 2017.\n\nSeems like every time I need AAA for something, even if it is simply to update phone numbers, it's unnecessarily difficult.\n\nTrust is important, and I need to be able to trust that my insurance company will handle things without argument, in the policy, and that the policy is sufficient for incidents like this current one.\n\nI'm frustrated, stressed out, and didn't need all that added on to the fact that a potentially uninsured motorist just rear ended me....", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888dc22ad272885:0x2371f9313aac4f4"}

Now after a month of proving I never lapsed I get a letter again stating I haven't had auto for over 2 months and they are charging me back charges due to Allstate: Cody Coffey in Centre telling them with multiple letters that my insurance was cancelled and there was no current insurance. Now I am having to write a letter, send in by email, mail, fax, online proof along with my current provider doing the same thing and proving I had this as of day of cancellation. Then to top it off they stated they cancelled me in the letters when I clearly have all proof also that I cancelled. They make it extremely difficult if you leave. I never again will go with these people I don't care how much money I can save. Very HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! They sucker you in on price with homeowners then jack it up where its more than anyone.

I even had the adjuster admit that it was covered in hail damage. The bottom line is the agent didnt even care to talk about it. He avoided the homeowner and I, and wouldn't even return a phone call to listen to what either of us had to say. That shows me that he doesn't care about his customers.

The other insurance company has been hard to deal with but Tom and his team are taking care of everything for me. The other company even told me that no insurance company will get a rental car the day of an accident. I told him that my insurance agent had me in a car in less than 4 hours. That's service and the way you want to be treated when an accident happens. I should be able to get my vehicle back in about 2 weeks thanks to Tom Barnard staff and State Farm being so awesome.

I was suppose to have a woman (adjustor) named Tiffany to come look at my vehicle to see the damage and to consider it fixable or totaled right.  Right okay. She never came. Instead I receive a phone call from her with little questions just license and if I drive the car. That was simply responded to. I had no chance to speak to her at all she quickly ended the call with a \"Thank you. Bye\" *hangs up*\n\nWell even though I was not at fault they denied me that same day she hung up on me. I was NEVER told anything about that and she took a whole week for a piece a paper stating \"This is not denying your vehicles repair\"\n\nOkay cool, we called to go further into it. We had to speak to someone higher because after calling the adjustor 5 times with no answer.\n\nThis man named David decided to argue about the situation and not giving us information we needed week before about the vehicle being denied its repair with no logical explanation of why. He also said that there is no option. I have to pay 500 deductible  and pay the repair cost too!? I have never heard of paying a deductible and paying the repair cost too.\n\nThere is a lot more to the story but that's the short version and this is to warn y'all about accidents.
