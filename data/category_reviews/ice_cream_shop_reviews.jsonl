I visited Dreamcakes Cafe with my mother and sister for afternoon tea. It was such a special day for us because we planned afternoon tea right before they accompanied me to shop for my wedding dress! The staff knew this and were so excited, kind, and encouraging.\n\nWe made our tea selections a few days before our event via email. Kallie was wonderful about responding on email. We had to sign a contract prior to the tea and she made it very easy to do so. When we arrived to the cafe, our tea table was set up with everything we needed: teacups, utensils, saucers, even fresh flowers! The set up was stunning and the food was delicious! I highly recommend the pimento cheese sandwich with peach jam and the macarons!!\n\nDuring the tea, the wait staff made us feel so special. Someone was always by to ensure we had everything we needed, refill cups, etc and all of them were SO polite, friendly, and knowledgable about tea selections. My sister had a gluten and dairy allergy and they made sure she knew what she could and couldn't eat and even brought out a special cup of chicken salad for her.\n\nThank you Dreamcakes staff! You made this such a special day for us. The thought and time you put into the details of our tea was noticed and SO appreciated. It was perfect from start to finish. Hope to see yall again soon... we will be back!!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONY-oJn9BWzuTdb2Fi3h6atL79YWPl-U63vkJQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPHHd3s1HgC_MYEB8GlhgLV96Lk0wjV05Aiz7P=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1626716965329, "text": "Thank you so much Erin!

It is a quaint little ice cream shop nuzzled in a small shopping area off of Rainbow Drive.. when they are actually open. Beware: if you want rolled ice cream, you HAVE to call prior to making a trip there. Myself, along with others I know, have made trips for the roll ice cream delicacy just for them to not be open.. might I add, with their refined COVID-19 hours. It is great to be open over the weekend, however I thought they were supposed to open on January 8th, 2021 after being closed since late November- early December? It is kinda dumbfounding to be closed over Christmas break when most everyone is off of work, kids are out of school, and people are out shopping. Now, COVID-19 has hit businesses hard, but it shouldn\u2019t be an excuse after excuse for your misconceptions. If you haven\u2019t been opened in sooo long, what are you guys doing with the financial reprieves in which come as relief packs due to COVID-19? I\u2019m starting to think you all have forgotten you own an ice cream business. These people, not exactly sure who is responding to reviews, but for every complaint or substandard review, there is a clap-back. No apologies for what they have done, if there was an error, etc. What a bad way to do business! There are key attributes you never do as a business. The customer may not always be correct, but they think they are in their reality. It is CRITICAL to never disagree with the customer, as this makes them angry and argumentative. It\u2019s not in anyone\u2019s best interest to call a customer out for being wrong, don\u2019t focus on the negative.. just like you people are doing. It is very important to establish interpersonal relationships by being business owners with your customers. However, the prices for ONE roll or milkshake are okay-ish, but you could still blow out an entire paycheck on a family outing for ice cream. They have clap-backed for their lack of hours claiming they do not have enough money to pay employees to stand around. Now, I may be wrong here, but I am pretty sure this is a family-owned, local business. The only people I have ever seen working are the owners and their daughter. So how does it account for \u201cwe CAN\u2019T afford to pay employees to sit around all day everyday with no customers coming in\u201d? I think it\u2019s the laziness of these business owners to not feel like running their business. From what it sounds like, business used to be booming. But they, over time, have significantly cut their hours more and more down, they do not engage the public (in Facebook posts) like they used to, they used to have specials & giveaways, and they were more prominent overall. I understand COVID-19 affects everyone differently (and while you might have had exposure,) it shouldn\u2019t be 2 months worth of not opening. Let me save everyone some time: there is no telling when this shop will open, if they ever open again. I have a hack to share with you guys! To save time AND money, simply google a rolled ice cream recipe. You are able to find countless recipes on Pinterest or by googling how to make it. You are to mix together, or blend, the add ins of your choice, mixed with heavy cream and sweetened condensed milk. If you order any kind of special rolls from this place, be sure to note what all is in them. Pour the mixed up/ blended mixture out on a baking sheet and stick into the freezer for a few hours; from here, you can cut strips into the flattened, frozen mixture. You can then roll it up with a spatula. This is guaranteed to save you more time and money rather than dealing with unreliable, fickle small spot shop this one happens to be. I am ready for you to respond to me, you guys have nothing on me or the success I protrude. I hope you guys learn one day, how to build relationships with customers, how to be reliable in your words, and how to properly run a successful business before you guys close for good!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1611698903170, "text": "Thank you for your feedback \u2764\ufe0f"}, "gmap_id": "0x888a3b7928c7d20d:0x1d1d68bd08f659b8"}

No way a family of 4 much less 5 or more could come in and get a treat w/o spending $50 plus. Also the rolled ice cream is nothing but tastless frozen cream. I ordered the strawberry and they put ( I swear to it ) a half of 1 strawberry in the cream and chopped it up to where the cream would have a pink color to it. Its absolutely tasteless. They put MAYBE 3 or 4 oz of cream on the table and roll it and charge for some over 8 dollars. I think mine with the half strawberry and nuts was 9 dollars. My son ordered a rolled fruity pepple with strawberry pop tart and they put a half of a plastic TEASPOON of fruity pepples and maybe 1/4 of a pop tart in it. I understand a business has to make money as I own my own business as well. But I also know that u have to be fair and give customers what they paid for. This is almost like robbery. Lol. Seriously. I was in there when a dad let his 4 children order then his wife , then himself and the total was 78 dollars. That was him and his wife and 3 children. His jaw about hit the floor. I know mine did. So many other GREAT chooses that give MORE for your money and the prices are literally half of what this place charges. As far as the staff they are great.

We value every customers opinion although we can\u2019t please everyone. I do find it very strange that within a hour of you making this review you also gave another bad review to another local ice cream shop... As far as your $9 strawberry roll with nuts is concerned, that is NOT CORRECT. A basic roll is $6.00 plus .50 per topping. Which would make your total $7 plus tax. With strawberry rolls you get FRESH strawberries on the inside and on top, we also add strawberry syrup unless requested other wise so I\u2019m not for sure how your rolls came out tasteless with just a little pink tint.As far as the amount of \u201ccream\u201d that goes on the table it makes 6 rolls and fills up a 12 oz cup.. Also our rolls are $6 not $8-$9 unless you add 4-6 topping..\nTo address the  1/2 of plastic teaspoon of fruity pebbles in a roll that is DEFINITELY NOT CORRECT. It\u2019s not even possible to put 1/2 of a spoon. We actually put 2 full spoons. I mean it is a roll not a bowl of cereal. To address the pop tart issue we do have to spread and roll the ice cream (not sure if you\u2019ve ever tried to do it) but it would be IMPOSSIBLE to roll with a entire pop tart inside. We do add pop tart on top as well JUST LIKE we do the strawberries. We use fresh fruits and good quality products at our store. We have people literally drive from all over for our ice cream and LOVE IT! We have several REPEAT Customers the come every week and sometimes even twice a week. But You\u2019re always welcome to address any concerns you have directly to us at our store location or of course leave a review like you chose to do. Hopefully you can find somewhere that can satisfy your every need as a business and you don\u2019t see any jaw dropping when hearing a price...\nSo we do apologize \u201cMr. Weird Guy\u201d\nWith you being a business owner as you say in your review I\u2019m quite shocked at how many compliments you have on line but didn\u2019t express any concern in the store. As every business owner knows we appreciate the chance to correct the problem before going on line leaving a review that clearly has nothing good to say other than we have good staff! Although I do appreciate that. Hopefully if I ever visit your business whatever it may be my review will be much more satisfying \u2764\ufe0f\nBe blessed and have a awesome day!\nP.S as far as our prices being \u201calmost robbery SERIOUSLY\u201d\nWe actually give back to our community more than you can imagine and we do this for FREE.

Being a lover of bubble tea and working for a bubble tea store at one point I was so excited to learn that there was an Ice Queen in Columbus,GA as well! I\u2019ve been there multiple times and while the tea/tapioca pearls are a hit or miss I still go because I like that they don\u2019t use powdered Thai tea, to my knowledge anyways. I also enjoy one girl who seems to always work there and is very friendly and nice( I don\u2019t know her name but she is short and always has hoop earings). I recently went there with my friend (a HOUR and about ten minutes before they closed) and ordered our typical drinks with the tapioca pearls and was told that they didn\u2019t have any. Disappointed because that is one of the biggest reasons for a BUBBLE tea, they did offer strawberry and mango popping boba (which aren\u2019t our favorites due to it being a Thai tea and my friend doesn\u2019t enjoy them at all) and I nicely told them never mind. The girl that was working gave me a really rude/nasty look that almost makes me not want to come back because of it.( this same girl has helped me my first time coming to this location and her friend was behind me and she was very, VERY distracted by that).

If you get the chance, go to Taco Tuesday. You won't regret it. In fact all the food is delicious. An order of double fries or nachos goes perfect with a D&D session.\n\nNigel has the uncanny ability to bring fun wherever he goes. He's set up the cafe to accommodate nearly any genre of nerd from retro gamers to hardcore tournament competitors. He's also constantly working to improve his business and make sure everyone that walks in the door has a great time. He also runs a pretty dope YouTube channel called Nerd Torch TV.\n\nThe store is organized and managed extremely well. There are several rooms dedicated to different types of gaming. There is a room for tabletop games, another for rhythm games like Guitar Hero or DDR, and other rooms dedicated to console games. There's even a PC built for gaming. Multiplayer games are very popular and this is a great place to find people that love to play Smash. I don't think I've ever been to the cafe when there wasn't someone playing Smash or Mario Cart. There's a great community built up around the cafe as well. All of the cafe members are invited to a GroupMe chat where you can get updates on events or just chat and hang out.

First, we all know that Covid has happened and I've given this place chance after chance this past year in hopes that maybe, this time things would be different. Today, I'm just done. This place has weird hours 7am-8pm. So you can choose, do you want breakfast or do you want to make yourself late. That's why it's always empty in the morning for rush hour. Then, they rarely operate the app. Oh, they will tell you it's \"down\" but then, you'll have an employee like I got today who quickly replied yes when I asked if that was done purposely. She said they were \"short-handed\" The only way you could order was to go through the drive thru, all of the drive ups had signs that said \"Sorry :-( Drive thru only.\"\nSo, I gave it a chance anyway seeing as my order was being taken by someone outside to make me feel like I was at chick-fil-a ...\nI waited through the line, which was wrapped all the way around the building, it moved fairly quickly. I thought well nothing else is working for them, so maybe this is a good thing. Got to the window, was given the wrong amount to pay but after fumbling the young lady got my order correct and took my card. Then, while waiting for receipt, I was again offered the wrong food this time, but what looked like a perplexed manager of sorts. Almost as if she wanted to argue for a second, how could I be the wrong car, lol... Um, yes, I managed to jump line in my car. Eyes rolling, then I was finally given my order and it was lukewarm, my tea was watered down and my food was not good. Now, I know it sounds like I'm being a total @ss but honestly I'm not, see this happens at this location ... all... the... time! I've waited forever for food at the drive up and then been handed food that a 10 year old could better prepare. I'm not sure if it's an employee retention problem, a management issue, or just simply that no one here cares. One would think, after a nice renovation that management would put in a little effort. I can honestly say, I have lived in Pelham for 13 years. My kids grew up coming to this spot after ballgames, late night snacks, etc and the food was always good. Not sure why they even redone this restaurant because it has been horrible since day one of their new re-opening. Anyone who eats at Sonic normally goes for the drive up. I could care less about the drive thru or the inside. Also, was great because you could go at 10pm at night for a treat. Whoever is running this location needs to do better but I for one, have given it my last go.

The staff was very uninformed on the menu & what options they no longer carried. We went in & I ordered a family size tot for my family & it showed on the ordering screen \"family tot\" with the appropriate price. I paid at the order box & our food came out quickly, but in a smaller bag than we were expecting. I asked the waitress about the family order of tots & she said it wasn't an option & so she gave me a large size order. Instead of asking if I would like a refund or a different size tot, she said she would ask her manager about it. She came back about 30 seconds later & said the manager refunded the difference & she walked off before I could say another word. I feel the waitress & manager were extremely rude for not properly informing us & giving us an option for something different. I never even saw the manager since the interior \"eat in\" area is just like ordering outside in your car. The staff needs better training & the store needs a better manager instead of the one they have! They need a manager who acts like a manager instead of hiding behind wall & making the food runners do his work for him. The manager should have personally come out to explain the situation to us & try to remedy the problem!
