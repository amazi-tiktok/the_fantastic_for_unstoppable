So, I called Jake's trailers today and talked to the owner(or at least that's who he said he was) and explained my situation to him. His first question was, where did you buy it from and I told him a dealership in Tennessee. His response was, \"then you should take it back to the place where you bought it\". The place I bought the truck(with the bed already installed) was a car dealership, not a CM distributor was my response. You will have to work it out with them, not my problem.

Mike and Trent are truly professional when it comes to the care and maintenance of your vehicle. Their repair shop is organized and well maintained. Trent came and picked up my truck and delivered to their shop with care. They immediately started the repair and was amazed on how fast they completed the job. After they removed the transmission and before putting it back together, Mike took the time to show me each part, the part that failed, and what parts he was going to install. He also make recommendations on upgrades and suggestions on the care and maintenance on the vehicle after the repair was complete. While removing the transmission and re-installing it, Trent inspected the vehicle components to ensure that any or potential problems were identified along with repair recommendations.\nThere was no stress and at no time did I feel they were pushing for un-neccessary repairs. I can say that they truly \"have your back\" on repairing your transmission.\nThey are like doctors, they want to do a check-up on my truck in two weeks to ensure that everything is operating properly with no leaks. The one year warranty is awesome, but I believe that because of the correct and  proper repair, I won't have to bring it back in for any warranty work.

When Mike could get it running & get it properly diagnosed it was a problem that needed to be repaired elsewhere. He charges a $75 flat rate diagnostic fee as you were told prior to leaving it.
