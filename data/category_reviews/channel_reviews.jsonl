The bridge here is actually quite cool and a tad bit steep!  It offers a fantastic view as you drive over or boat under it!  I am super surprised there aren\u2019t more photos or posts of this area - guess I\u2019ll have to kick it up a notch the next time I\u2019m out this way!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a2d012213cce7:0xfeef1f7a426e2398"}
