They were not able to schedule the repair for nearly a month due to company manpower issues.  Parts were covered but labor was not.  AON charged more per hour than my local HVAC and autobody shops at $112 per hour.  Their service techs did a good job repairing my softener, but broke all the pipe half clamps that secure the pipes to the wall, and did not replace them.
