Our experience quickly went downhill as it took 2 months for them to replace the front bumper and radiator. When I got my car back the front right headlight didn't work. We later figured out the headlight unit was cracked and they didn't find that worth telling us. We fixed the headlight on our own. A couple days later there was a leak under the car. We figured out it was the antifreeze reservoir. So we took it back to Lynch and they filled up and said it would be good. After bringing it home it leaked again so we took it back only for them to do THE SAME THING. Filling it up and claiming it was fixed. We ended up having to make two more trips leaving the car there for multiple days each time. After the fourth time of taking the car and Lynch being completely bewildered by the leaking of antifreeze we decided we are not wasting any more of our time with them. As if the incompetence of the workmanship wasn't enough, we had the misfortune of working with Dennis. Dennis was extremely rude and unhelpful. On one occasion while I was asking Dennis about a charge on the invoice he handed it to me and started walking away.

I was a previous customer and had a great experience, so when my vehicle suffered damage from a piece of plywood flying out of  a pickup truck I naturally wanted to go back. I expected the front skirt to be repaired as easily and as great as before. While the skirt was repaired, my vehicle suddenly had other things not working that was working prior to my body repair. Bottom line is I feel like I was given some song and dance about the situation. Dennis, who was apparently the manager of the operation, has absolutely no customer service skills. He argued with me and made sure I knew how wrong he thought that I was. There's really no sense in airing the argument here because all that will happen is a rebuttal post stating I was wrong again. Dennis heard Christian music playing on my radio in my van and while not directly saying it, he insinuated that I was not acting as a Christian. No where in the Bible does it state that Christians are to be doormats and be trampled on or even taken advantage of. I feel me calling him on a situation is completely appropriate and not ungodly. I also feel like him using the \"I'm a Christian too\" card to try to make his point was highly inappropriate. The problem at hand was not about being a Christian or not, it was about why something else going wrong with my vehicle under his care. I never felt like I got a satisfactory answer. He set up for us to have it looked at next door, but it seemed way too coincidental that the exact thing Dennis suggested was wrong be wrong and it would be about $1200 out of my pocket. Upon further investigation on my own, what was suggested isn't accurate. That would have been a lot of money to spend for something that wasn't truly broken. I also found it super odd that the following day, a Saturday (when the center is closed) another employee called me on my cell from his cell to discuss what was wrong so he could make it right. Red flag! I never returned this Individual's call. Business should be done during business hours and also not on someone's day off on their private phone, especially if you've never talked with this person. I couldn't help but wonder why this happened. Was this guy covering for himself, did he know why a part mysteriously and suddenly went bad in my vehicle? Had Dennis been this was with other customers and he was building a case against him? Either way it was wrong and no way to do business. The only redeeming individual there was the lady at the desk. She ran that place great! She made her customers feel welcomed and most important. She helped to the extent that she could. It's ashame she couldn't have been in charge of fixing my vehicle. One final thing that comes to mind has to do with the insurance. It was a road hazard claim. My agent asked that contact be made directly with his office and not the main 800 number. It took so much for me to convince Dennis to speak with my agent directly. Eventually, He was able to speak with the office and get the ball rolling. He was not thrilled with this. I just kept being told that they were an authorized agent for said insurance. I really felt like if I had gone in as a private pay that my quote would have been different. I was told several times that because of some of the damage to the vehicle that the quote may not be accurate. Amazing. When we had to pay the bill, it was down to the penny quoted. The quote included new fog light bulbs. if I'm not mistaken, and all that supposedly happened was they needed to be plugged back in. Where did that portion of the quote get dropped? I just don't know. It is possible that I did not understand the quote because it's not broken down for easy understanding. I am certain of this, my vehicle left Lynch Collision with a function not working that had been working. I am also sure of this: I will not be back to Lynch Collision as long as Dennis is there. I may reconsider should there be management changes. I do not know. It was a very disappointing experience.

I contemplated purchasing one of the PDR kits on Amazon and attempting the repair myself...  Then I thought better - \"Let a professional do it right the first time...\"  So glad I did!  For the price of a cheap PDR kit on Amazon, Alabama Dent Repair removed the dent/ding better than I ever could have hoped to.

Jeremy, also provided superior customer service with his immediate response time to my call on last minute notice, with Jeremy even coming over to the shop, even a little earlier than, their usual business hours to accomodate my busy schedule.  Thanks to Jeremy and his amazing skill & workmanship and his business listed above that also performs paintless dent remove service, I was literally in-and-out in less than 30 minutes with a brand new car.

Two supervisor called me to talk with me and was all nice but wanted me to give them a call and when something did come up no answer . They raised the price up and was about to put savage parts on from junk yards!!! Then broke my truck down of unnecessary parts , sent me 3 pic of my truck where the damage was and made a mistake and included pic of a Durango include with mine in the estimated online where they dropped the ball at so they could total my truck out. $7,500 their price after I was haggled on what should be fixed or not. The under part that I was told would be looked at by Geico in Macon under and told me that everything would be fixed and even sent a wrecker for it. When I saw this scam I sent for my truck to be taken to another shop of my choice in Trussville where I live at and the price dropped to $2500 . What\u2019s the use of having insurance for 8yrs without any incidents and was deem not my fought and still getting the run around but I guess it\u2019s just a moody thing then , I have a 1,500 rental car limit that I pay for in my and JY told me that it had to be back today mon 2-26-18 or they wasn\u2019t going to extended it til the next day when my truck will be ready I\u2019m the am, how about I called jay (sup) while I was at the shop because they needed to ask him something and he told me he was going to call them and did.

In addition I am the treasurer of a local credit union and we have used Alabama Auto Clean when we needed to sell a repossessed vehicle. They always do an amazing job cleaning the vehicles and I have always been happy with the services they provide. Unfortunately when I recently had my Yukon XL detailed I left the trailer hitch cover and another item in the third row seat. Again they did a great job with the detailing but the items that were left in the car were missing when it was delivered back to me. I am not sure if Ricky is still there but I wasn't able to talk to him at any point during this visit. It is a shame that someone would take items from the vehicles they are responsible for but when I asked about the missing items I was told they were not there. Just the hitch cover is $115 plus the body shop cost to paint to match the Yukon. I am sure I can find another detail shop that is honest and does as good of a job.\n\nThis issue was resolved - Ricky saw my review and, as I expected he would, corrected the situation. Since they do remove everything from your vehicle prior to detailing I would recommend not leaving anything inside.
