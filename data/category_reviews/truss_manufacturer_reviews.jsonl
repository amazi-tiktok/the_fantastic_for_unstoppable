I called 11/20/19 to get a lumber package delivered to save some time. I knew it would be a bit more expensive but more convenient. Delivery was quick and early 11/21/19 unfortunately delivery is at wrong address 100 yards from where it should be and about 15 boards were incorrect. Still no biggie just let them know and I would think it would be taken care of. First call was 8:40 am. Left a message for Dino with another salesman and on his cell phone. Second call was about 12:30 pm, third call was at 3:00 I was told he was still with a customer. I asked the person on the phone to please tell him so that I could hear him answer I needed a call back today, and he did. 3:30 pm Dino calls I explain 15 boards were to be pressure treated and the delivery was in the wrong spot (address) I was then argued with that I didn\u2019t order pressure treated I wrote down the prices quoted and if it wasn\u2019t p.t it was expensive white wood. He put me on hold when he came back to the phone he said the contractor that came in and paid told him the location. I explained it was all done over the phone and there was only me. Where he described is exactly where I told him to put it. Unfortunately that\u2019s not where it was put. He said he would call me back and get it straightened out. No call back, so 11/22/19 I called and left a message with a nice young lady for the sales manager.(I was told his name is Jason).No call back!! I go to see if the package has been moved that afternoon. I have pressure treated wood but package not moved. So much for convenience. Now I will have to pay someone to move the wood.
