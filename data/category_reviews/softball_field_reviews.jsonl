The seating arrangement was great, there was plenty of room for people who brought their own chairs and tent to set up shop. Even though this place is off the beaten path for us it is in an ideal location to play team's we normally wouldn't play.Living in extreme North Alabama, it seems to have potential to draw team's from Tuscaloosa and western Mississippi(it's always a plus to see action from new teams).\n\nThe only knock I can muster is they could provide a little more shade in areas away from the press box.\n\nIn summary, I would highly advise and recommend that if you have a chance to play in a tournament at this park to do it.
