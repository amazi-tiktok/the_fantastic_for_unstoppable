Definitely not who you want to trust with your issues and problems. THEY DONT CARE!\n\nBack story: First appointment, my fiances mother wanted to make sure I gave them the right insurance cards in order because she said they got misfiled in incorrect order last time and it took them over a year to fix so I told that to the receptionist when I got there and she snarkly responded \"I doubt that\". To which I responded... \"No it wasn't a question \"if\" ...it did..\". Then I was filling out the paperwork for my fianc\u00e9 and she said that he needed to fill it out hisself . With his condition he can't do that so I told her that was the whole reason we were there in the first place, and that he couldn't. She was super rude and snarky and judgemental the whole time. So we had to leave to find him an appropriate writing utensil he would use and he finally signed the papers. Fast forward to this time:\nHe has a 2:00 appointment, we arrive at 1:40... we sit all the way til 2:30 thinking Dr. Schwartz was just running behind. Then he comes out at 2:30 and calls a different patient back... so I ask Dr. Schwartz when my fianc\u00e9's appointment time is to which he says he doesn't know, so I go to the desk and ask and she tells me it was at two... but that he was running behind.. but she neglected to mention any of this for the fifty minutes we waited. So then my fianc\u00e9 asked how much longer it will be for him then, and she said thirty minutes.. so we decided to leave and go get coffee.. We come back in only twenty minutes and see the previous client leaving when we walk in. She came out the door and said \" Dr. Schwartz came out after he finished with his client and you weren't here and I was \"unsure\" if you were coming back so I went ahead and gave him his next patient. To which I responded... No you told us it was thirty minutes til he would be seen.. so we left and came back in twenty. She just kept blaming it all on Dr. Schwartz when all of it was literally her lack of professionalism that caused this whole scene. She never told us he was running late, nor apologized. She never told Dr. Schwartz what she told us about him being able to see him in another thirty minutes... like I have never in my life witnessed such carelessness and unprofessional from a \"professional\" practice. So Dr. Schwartz didn't even end up seeing my fianc\u00e9 even though we waited approximately an hour and a half. And he missed work to not even get his appointment due to the vendetta this receptionist had against him. Take your time and money elsewhere!\n* She is the receptionist with box colored black hair btw. Don't even know her name.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886268c45f34bca3:0x7cd870430f227283"}
