They also have events every month like taekwondo championships and movie night. I been both of them and is really fun. Children can go to movie nights without their parents but the instructors will supervise them and is really fun. The championship is for all ages and for all belts. They take place in a school other than theirs because it is small. They are socially distant and if you don't feel safe doing in person, you can do taekwondo in home on zoom. Can't give the zoom code meeting for reasons but if you join, they will tell you the meeting code and instructions.
