She then threatened to call the police.\nI\u2019ve never in my entire life been treated so rudely by a person in customer service. I\u2019ve been in customer service for more than 25 years and wouldn\u2019t hire this woman to take out my trash!!

She then threatened to call the police.\nI\u2019ve never in my entire life been treated so rudely by a person in customer service. I\u2019ve been in customer service for more than 25 years and wouldn\u2019t hire this woman to take out my trash!!

The drive through was closed today so I entered the store (not wanted to go inside trying to keep my husband as well as I can) the cashier, when I asked,  told me the pharmacy  was closed I asked to speak with the manager. The shift manager  can out and I asked him why the pharmacy  was closed he said someone  in the pharmacy tested positive  for COVID-19.  I told him I must have my husband's  prescription because  he could end up in the hospital  without it. His answer  was that he didn't  know when the pharmacy  would open back up and they were having the store cleaned  tonight by a professional cleaning  co. So what is a person to do if they depend  on a medication that they have a prescription for and can't  get it from the co. they have trusted to fill that prescription? The shift manager at 4:10 PM Tuesday  answer  was to call the doctor and get a new prescription sent to another store. I guess he doesn't  realize how difficult  it is to get intouch  with a doctor and a doctor at that time of day. Wouldn't  you think that the owner of this pathetic excuse  for a pharmacy would have had an emergency  plan in plan? We have been dealing with this Virus  for many months and a company this large should have a disaster plan in plan for just this type  of scenario. Pathetic. Everyone of my friends  has had a horrible  experience  with this store. We are going to flood the social media sources and expose  this company for who they are. They care nothing about the people  that keep them in business it's  all about money to this owner. Would you not think that they would close the whole store if someone  tested positive for COVID-19 I mean do they think that the virus decides to stay in one area of the store. Do they think that people  don't  go in there and touch products  before they go to the pharmacy. Just an example the bottom  line is money not care. Even Sonic  hamburger restaurant in Leeds Al. closed completely when one of it's employees tested positive and they sell burgers. The Walgreens in Leeds Al. Is absolutely  the worst pharmacy  in Leeds. You would think if they cared they would have had a disaster plan in place and they could have contacted all patrons that have life sustaining medications of the situation and where they could pick up their medication. There are many other drug stores  in Leeds and the surrounding area. I encourage  everyone who has had a dangerous experience with this co.to stop using  them and contact the head office.

I have been a loyal Walgreens customer for at least 20 years, and have used Walgreens on the east coast, the west coast, and in between.  I\u2019ve never had any issues with any other Walgreens as I have at this store.\n\nTo begin with, I\u2019ve experienced phone wait times for up to an hour.  I just gave up on calling\u2026I go directly to the pharmacy and wait to speak to the pharmacist.  I take a lot of meds, and there are times I have to personally request the pharmacy to fill certain prescriptions, as Walgreens online won\u2019t allow me to electronically file certain scripts. Luckily I\u2019m not far from the pharmacy, and driving over is no big deal for me. If you need to talk to someone in the pharmacy, just save yourself the frustration of calling.\n\nI used to be a Job Coach, so I didn\u2019t just want to hate this pharmacy\u2026I wanted to understand what the problem was (is).  The problem is, they are always extremely busy, and maybe understaffed.  There have been times I have visited the store when there were at least 15 cars in line for the pharmacy; the line being wrapped around the building.  In addition there were also times where there were up to 10 people in line at the pharmacy.   I\u2019ve sat and watched the employees working, and they are all working like crazy.  Nobody is on their phones, no one is standing around talking\u2026they all seem to be working just as hard as they can.  In addition, I\u2019ve always been treated with the level of kindness and professionalism that made me a loyal Walgreens customer many years ago. When I\u2019ve been there I\u2019ve heard the phone ringing constantly.  But In the pharmacy employees\u2019 defense\u2026they are so overwhelmed with customers in the store, no one has time to answer the phones.\n\nWalgreens, if this pharmacy is understaffed, help them find some more employees!  There are a ton of people who depend upon this pharmacy for their medications.  Help this pharmacy to be better!\n\nSincerely, an extremely loyal Walgreens customer.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccea8b57332c1:0xcebb8fff287cdf42"}

We went to McDonald's and ate in the car, then came back through the drive thru about 20-30 minutes later. She was very aggravated to see us again. She got another girl (white girl with long, curly hair) to come tell us that they had just received it (which is bull-the doctor sent it immediately) and they were about to close, so they couldn't fill it. I absolutely believe they just wanted to go home, so they made up a story in hopes that we would just go away and come back in the morning, but we actually live 30 minutes away. We wanted to grab the prescription while we were still in the area; otherwise, we would have chosen a pharmacy closer to us. I wish we would have. Now my sick son has to wait another 30 minutes to an hour before he can go to sleep in his bed while we go back to the urgent Care, get the prescription transferred, then drive to another pharmacy.

It was a little after 8am today and I was picking up my husband's medicine that required (2) IM needles to administer.  I always have to ask for these everytime. These people know it's a vial of medicine that I have been getting for months and months now and yet they never say do you need needles with that? So like all the times before I ask for needles and was told by a nice fuzzy male red headed pharmacy tech we have no needles. I said yet you sold me medicine that requires needles and yet you have no needles to sell me. The pharmacist lady obviously overheard our conversation and chimed in that CVS and Walgreens have been contracted to give the Covid vaccine to all nursing home people so all of their needles will be going to that. She then informed me that I could go to and I quote \"Mom and Pop\" drug store and they would be able to help me with the 2 needles that I need. I said my prescription card is CVS caremark and you send me mail telling me if I shop anywhere else but you, that the prices will be higher because I'm not using you and yet you sell me medicine I can not use because you have no needles. She said covid vaccine is our top priority right now. I said wow I thought the customer would be your top priority. She said you obviously dont understand the importance of this. I informed her I do. I'm a healthcare worker but what I dont understand is I've been asking for these needles long before a vaccine came out. How do you sell me medicine but no means to administer it. Is that what you tell people with their insulin. I'm changing our pharmacy to another pharmacy (NON CVS and NON Walgreens).

Submitted the photo with our application but it was denied due to the size of the head being too large. So we had to retake the photo at walgreens again and PRAY we get our passport in time for a very expensive trip. If we do not we will have to expedite new paperwork and this will all be due to walgreens not resizing the photo correctly. We asked for a refund which they would not give.

He responded with only a cold stair as if I wasn't allowed or supposed to be there.\n\nI had an arm full of stuff to purchase and he wasn't at a register when I approached so I unknowingly sat the items at the wrong one. When he eventually sauntered over instead of helping me move the items to the correct one, he just pointed and approached it and staired at me while I moved everything. I didn't mind having to move my stuff but, in my eyes, proper customer service would dictate the employee assist in moving everything because I had no idea I was at the incorrect register when I sat the things down. He also was not wearing a mask, even though there is a sign on the doors saying \"masks required inside this facility\".\n\nAnyway, maybe I'm just being petty, but it just irked me the wrong way, him with his superior attitude and all. In the grand scheme of things im sure my contributions won't be missed, but treating people in the manner he did me will eventually lead to more people never returning. Management of this facility should probably look for some workers with at least a small amount of pride in their job. I get its only a fuel station attendant job but all jobs, especially ones dealing with the public, should show a little pride in their work and make the customer feel welcome.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb12361814833:0xb348a71835c8e91f"}

Horrible customer service, rude and in my entire professional career in the automotive industry pumping fuel 5-6 times a day, I have never been treated like dirt or degraded in such a humiliating way.  I prepaid for my fuel among other things and in my haste drove away only to realize I did not pump fuel.  I immediately went back, however the pump was either reset or another customer took advantage of the free fuel.  I went back in to ask for assistance, hoping when meters were read and fuel was out of balance, or someone had reported the situation.  A shorter, middle-aged man with a thick accent would not allow me to ask a question, finish my sentence, much less explain the situation.  I was not looking for free fuel - simply there is nothing we can do. From the moment I spoke, he screamed, yelled, repeatedly exclaimed, \"it's not my fault, it's not my fault!\" and would not allow me to continue.  He belittled me and spoke down to me as though I was trash, with multiple customers waiting in line with their jaws dropped in disbelief.  I simple gave up, gave him $10.00 to prepay for fuel (again). But he continued his tyrant and I had to ask several times for my receipt before he finally handed it to me.  At that point, I wanted my receipt, my new purchase and to leave.  If this gentleman is the manager or owner, I certainly have lost respect for him and absolutely refuse to visit Exxon in Saginaw, AL. A little common courtesy goes a long way.  As I stated, I wanted nothing for free and someone else benefited from my loss, fine, they are better for it, but to be treated as I was, while spending money at his store is a true testament to the type of business he runs.

One of the technicians here stole half of my prescriptions. Now, I'm from out of town and this was my first and last time using this Walgreens.

I thought, she must be tired because she didn't look too good. I paid for my medication and walked out of the pharmacy. I went back to my place and noticed half the prescription was missing! I thought that's strange half my medication is missing and I just left the pharmacy that's never happened before, so I assumed it was probably a mistake.  When I finally got in contact with the pharmacy, I explained what happened and a woman responded saying she needed to check their records. After a few seconds she comes back on the line to tell me their counts for the prescriptions were accurate and she couldn't do anything about it. I said, I will come up there with the prescription bottles to discuss this! Then she proceeds to tell me she's the Pharmacy's Manager. At this point, I was getting upset! I told her this pharmacy charged me FULL price for a months supply of prescriptions then only gave me half of it. I told her, I had to pay out of pocket for this and I want to be reimbursed.  She continued to say there's nothing she could do.  Well, that's just too bad, because for a \"Manager\" not to even attempt to investigate  problems when a customer is genuinely upset and telling the truth about a bad experience just baffles me. Why isn't this manager more concerned that a technician took someone elses medicine from the pharmacy's safe and then falsifed records to get away with it?! She's kept saying there's nothing she could do. Really?! Why don't you fire the employee, so this doesn't happen again.

I told her I would wait since I had already been waiting 30 minutes. She apologized and said OK and then 35 minutes later I was still waiting.

While that is unfortunate and a direct reflection of ownership... the worst part of this gas station is that no one appears to have the slightest clue as to that the hours of operations are... the hours on the window clearly read \u201c24 hours\u201d yet when I stopped by at 11pm they were closed... odd, yeah you\u2019re right.. next time I stopped by around 10pm and asked the cashier about that and she mentioned a change in store hours to where they are going to be closing at ten... low and behold I show next at 9:45.. they are closed and the cashier who was at the register wanted to have an attitude. The conclusion is this. The people who work there are lesser than human beings. Management clearly has no clue what\u2019s going on.

I take one prescription a month which is a schedule three or four narcotic I believe. I go to my doctor and he writes my new prescription every 28 days. I take two a day which equals 56. I drive almost two hours to this doctor and live in a rural area that never has this medicine so I always stop at this Walgreens and every time they tell me they can\u2019t fill it until the next day or I have to wait two days even tho my doctor schedules my next appointment on the exact day my medicine runs out. For example I got my prescription filled there last month on 2/5/20. Went yesterday after my appointment to fill my script for this month which ran out yesterday. Waited in traffic and in line for over 20 minutes only for the cashier to tell me she can\u2019t fill it until tommorow. I didn\u2019t even waste my time explaining to her that I couldn\u2019t turn around and drive two more hours again the next day or that my medicine ran out yesterday so technically I could have gotten it filled two days early as per the narcotic laws. I\u2019m not sure if she dosent pay attention to the quantity and counts thirty days or she just dosent care to actually read the directions on the prescription. This is also a medicine that if I don\u2019t take it causes extreme withdrawals so I ended up having to drive 30 plus miles out of my way and wait two to three days for another pharmacy to fill it. Got home and called and asked them via the phone if I was eligible to get it filled yesterday and the lady said yes. Needless to say these people don\u2019t understand that some of these medicines are people\u2019s lifeline and they don\u2019t understand the danger and inconvenience of having to drive all around the country and risk your health all because they can\u2019t take twenty seconds to read a prescription look up last day it was filled and count 28 days. Drove 30 miles to another pharmacy keep in mind another WALGREENS pharmacy and they told me I could have gotten it filled Sunday. Done with Taylor road.

CARD SKIMMER ON CREDIT CARD MACHINE AT THE REGISTER INSIDE THE STORE.\nWhen I used my debit card at this store on July 17, 2018, I was required to enter my pin # two times- once at the beginning of the transaction and again at the end of the transaction. I Asked the cashier why I was required to enter my pin twice and she quickly looked away nervously and didn't respond. I then turned the machine and looked closely at the side where cards are swiped. The machine appeared to have an overlay that had been mounted to the credit card machine. When I looked up, the cashier looked away quickly and would not make eye contact.\n\nThe following day, July 18, I began to see fraudulent charges posting to my bank account. I reported the charges to regions and was told by the bank manager that it appeared that someone had cloned my debit card. Regions is opening an investigation into the fraud.\n\nTO THE OWNER OF THIS STORE-\nYOUR EMPLOYEE (white female with brown hair, approx late 30s to 40s) that was working the register on July 17, 2018 around 1pm is a thief!!\nIf she stole from me, she'll steal from you and the rest of your customers!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1535659187270, "text": "Thank you Erin for your review.

And if they run out of any change at all before you check out, they will take 10 minutes to restock their drawer instead of continuing to take customers and getting change as needed.

They told me that without the receipt is couldn't get back my $40 but only $15.00. I was ok with that but as I began looking around for a tooth brush and orange crest toothpaste, I noticed the cashier staring at me every isle I went down with her arms crossed. I asked her if the was a problem, she ignored me. I then picked up my things and walked to her as she walked behind the counter and asked again politely was there a problem and she just stared at me. I asked her to call the cops bc I was doing nothing wrong and this was not good customer service.\nSecondly this is the 2nd time I've delta with the black female manager that never says anything to me. The time prior I went at midnight once my husband was asleep and bought a card and bottle of wine. She apparently called the cops bc I sat my stuff on the floor looking at cards and she felt uncomfortable.\nNeedless to say nothing I mean nothing was done wrong yesterday on my part or the time before. Apparently in Auburn Al if your in a \"convenient store\" longer than 30 min, your up to no good. For god sake that's a vacation for me with 16m old twins at home and a 5 yr old and a husband who acts like one of the children. I want this lady fired and the female officer who left bruises on my arm bc I walked to the other side of the door and she also called me fat and said I looked 6more pregnant.  I will get the report on all involved and add this to this crappie cvs store bc I sure wouldn't want my family or friends in their treated in such manner. Oh and someone please fire this manager. She looks like filth and doesn't do her job and is apparently racist.\nTy", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2e8d7250b37:0x7182d43be77b6958"}

He told me that he can do it that all I needed to do is ordered the parts. So I did. So I called made an appointment to bring the truck down. Took it down on Thursday by Friday even it was done so I go pick it up. Everything seemed great going home then the following Sunday going to storage unit an all at once it felt like the brakes was grabbing and released but than I was hearing a noise. It happen so fast I made it to the road to pull off and got out to look. That's when I saw the rearend streaming hot. So I got someone to come get it to take it back. So I hauled it down and called the next day to let him know what happen. Had lots of people thats worked on them. Little farther away. They asked me what it done when it happen and they asked me how many pinion threads was showing so I counted and they was probably an 3/4 of an inch showing so they said that he over tightened it. Well the guy at South auto told me that it was a bad bearing in the kit that it would cost me another 200 or so dollars to be fixed so I've done been tho two different people rebuilding it. Put over $1000 in it already so therefore he wasn't holding his word either. So I just picked my truck up and told him I'll look at it myself bc I don't think it's much I hope. Well come to find out on my carrier bearings are hammer marks instand of pressing them on he used a hammer and beat them in so now Ive gotta put another set of bearing all the way tho the hole rearend. Costing another 100 dollars and free labor bc I'm doing it myself. Taking it apart and looking at it the outer pinion bearings is gone but worth me not driving it far I'm praying that I can clean everything up bc I'm not seeing alot of metal in it so hopefully it will be good after I get it fixed. JUST CANT TRUST ANYONE ON THEIR WORDS.

Packaged foods, on the other hand, seem to be a bit cheaper than, say, the store inside the courthouse but it's not really enough to keep me from driving the little extra distance to the Publix at Twickenham Square.\nThe cozy atmosphere and neat meeting space upstairs, though, may be enough to counter-balance the slightly higher prices and not-so-awesome coffee--and a warm Spring day sat outside with a cold cup of iced tea and a fresh-made sandwich can't quite be beat.\nSo all-in-all, if you don't mind spending a bit more and not getting Starbucks-quality coffee, you will get a cozy, unique atmosphere great for a refreshing time on your own or with friends.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b56a1fd3df7:0xd805f6cc220b76af"}

I asked the male customer kindly to please wear his mask properly. He told me \"to mind my own business and that I got up on the wrong side of the bed!\" He was rude and self entitled. The cashier said nothing and wasn't wearing hers properly either. There were others as well. The cashier or someone should have asked them to either wear it properly or leave the store. This not happen. This is unacceptable during a pandemic. A pharmacy not enforcing their own rules. I believe much of this is politically motivated. Management and or any employee should report customers that do not wear masks covering the mouth AND nose should alert management immediately and tell them to wear it properly or leave the store. Personnel who do not wear masks properly should be fired or severely dealt with. Did any of these employees receive any training about the severity if COVID-19? Do they even care about not endangering their customers? Why should I ever enter that store again? All of this is unacceptable and not following CDC guidelines.

They even threatened to put a family member in jail for no reason. just because they have bad attitude problems with the customers.bavoid this station at all costs.

Bad treatment in a mixed neighborhood. Avoid the problems here and go down the street where the customer service is excellent. The owner really needs to get rid of this young white guy in there working. He is throwing customers out of the station for no reason at all. This happened several tens mes and i have witnessed it. He is very prejudice toward people of color and the people are going to get a good lawyers and sue the station for this. If any harm comes to my family members there i am going to get some lawyers and sue the owners because they are responsible for what happens on their property and they are also responsible for their employees actions on the premises of this property. Dont be do prejudice in a mixed neighbirhood because all the business is going to the station down the street and that is why this station is so empty. We need to know who the owner is and i hope he sees this because this young white guy is opening up the owner to all kinds of lawsuits and the owner needs to take care of this because this young white guy and the old white lady with the glasses is driving all the owners customers away. Be careful when you go in there because it is just way too prejuduce and this station shiuld be shut down before they hurtvor deriously harm someone because they are already doubg this with the owner not around and no body diing anything about this.

Other times those medicines that did have street value, were handed over to me like candy. Some of the employees also were not aware of basic pharmacy policy, upon which I had to remind them of.

So I bought the cola fizz and ask the cashier who told me her name was Tammy. Then I ask Tammy how to contact the manager she looked behind her at the blonde from the food area who shook her head no and Tammy said she couldn't give that information out so I ask what the blonde employees name was and she tried to say she didn't know it.

I have had just a few minor negative experiences during this time. Most of the time I was comfortable with the service. Today was a different story. I called about an hour before they closed to finalize 2 scrip. orders. I called at this time because I had tried several times in the past week and today to get thru to someone on the phone, but had too long of a hold time each time. I thought it might be less busy at 7pm. The woman who answered, who I believe was the pharmacist on duty, had a disrespectful tone a couple of times during the call. I mentally excused her then drove to pick up my orders almost immediately. When I arrived the assistant, who was one of the distasteful encounters I've witnessed in the past, was working the drive thru. I told her I needed the pills cut in the required dose which I'd gotten done many times before without problems. It usually doesn't take very long to do as well. I went to wait across the lot when I saw a multitude of cars arriving at the drive thru right before closing time. 15 or so minutes had elapsed and it was closing time by that time so I decided to drive back over to the window to pick up my meds. When I arrived the tech ignored me for about a minute or 2 and then she mouthed something to me without the microphone and immediately walked away out of my sight. I could not make out what she said, of course. I continued to wait patiently. Within that time the pharmacist walked over and in a scolding tone told me to tell her ahead of time I needed them cut. I informed her I did not because I was informed in the past not to do that because I must pay for them before they are cut. She then continued her scolding by telling me \"Well it's just so late.\" Omg...are you not still open for business when I arrived 15 to 20 minutes prior? And it doesn't take that long to cut them. And I would of done it sooner if I could of gotten someone on the telephone without a long hold time every time I called! That response was rude, unprofessional and unfair and I did nothing wrong. How dare her and that tech or whatever she is treat a good customer this way. I have always been fair and courteous to the staff. I have already found another pharmacy and will pull my business out of there tomorrow.

I told her I was leaving to go to Florida at 9am the next day. I then asked \"why is it taking so long after you ordered it to come in? She said it's because it's a narcotic. So I went on to Florida.

Mr. Witten  was rude from the start. When I explained about the return he cut me off with a terse \"calm down.\"  Had he let me finish he would have known that I wanted to see if they carried the actual item I wanted and I could do an exchange. However, I never got that far because Joe followed up with more mature declarations of  \"it's not my fault you got the wrong thing\" and \"I didn't do it\". So now I am just looking  wide-eyed and gape-mouthed at this pudgy man getting all worked up over a return for SKIN MOISTURIZER.  Mind you,  the item was unopened, still in the original packaging, with the receipt and was within the return period and this guy is giving off all kinds of micro-aggressive vibes like I have done something wrong. I felt super uncomfortable as the store was full of people who could all hear this man lose his composure over a return.  He asks for my driver's license TWICE  which I understand if a receipt is not present but again, I had a valid receipt. When he  finally gets around to processing the return Joe gives me a CVS Gift card and tells me it's a money card. I have never returned anything to CVS before so when I ask him how to use it he admits that it can only be redeemed at CVS.  I point blank ask him why he didn't process the refund per the original method of payment  (my bank card) he smirks at me and says \"alright, alright, I said I would take care of it.\"  He then processes the return to my card but botches the transaction and ends up having to give me a partial cash refund.\nI will NEVER, EVER, EVER  go to CVS again! It is my opinion that Mr. Witten  needs to be terminated  but at the very least he needs some time away from that store to undergo re-training. As long as he is employed with the organization they will not get one dime of my money.

My coworker offered to go in and pay for the gas so I asked him to grab a can of dip.  He came back out and I realized they gave him the wrong can. He went back in and asked them to switch it , and they wouldn't.

I politely asked the other cashier to switch my dip and he explained that the \"laws for Mapco \" stated that he could not exchange it once it left the door. I just politely asked if Mapco laws were different than those in the rest of Alabama. Once I realized he was not going to make it right I left the can on the counter and told them to keep it.

In spite of having 8+ years history of purchasing insulin and supplies in the computer, due to not having an active Rx (we can't have an active Rx at every pharmacy in town \"just in case\" our insurance-dictated regular pharmacy is not accessible at that moment of need), the pharmacy tech gets to decide, based on personal bias/mood, not to sell the only safe method of delivery of insulin (which is now prohibitively expensive without insurance) to a type-1 diabetic who has a documented history of his need for that medicine.  Diabetes does not go away! Once insulin dependent, always insulin dependent!  A pharmacy tech just decided she wants a customer to either use dirty needles (infection risk, tissue damage, increased pain to use) or go without insulin and let his blood slowly turn to poison and kill him.

When I was called back to pay one of the meds was almost 50 dollars than the coupon rate. When I questioned the price the Pharmacy Tech rolled her eyes and started popping her gum in my face. The Pharmacist then said I told him I had the coupon but did not give a card, Good RX is an app, so i didn't get the discount. So i showed the tech the coupons and she told me she didn't need them she could just do it herself. She told me that it would be another 10 minutes and when I questioned why such a long time to change the price they refused to fill the medicine and returned my paper prescriptions. I asked to speak to the store manager and was informed by the Tech that he was not there so at this point all i could do is leave.\n\nOnce home called back to the store to get the pharmacist and technicians names and licences number. Well the store manager answered the phone. He then preceeded to tell me that he could not give that information until I told him that it was a matter of public record and that if it was not posted in plain view that they were committing a crime. So when he finally gave me the pharmacist's name , Charlie, i filed a complaint with CVS and the state pharmacy board.\n\nAlso I called around to 2 other CVS stores to check cash prices and found out that he was going to charge me more than the other stores.\n\nIt is no wonder that BCBS of Alabama will no longer deal with CVS.\n\nI would avoid doing this store at all costs in the future.

No, \"I'm sorry\", no engagement at all.  They finally told me they would order and to come back in two days.  I went back in 3 days later.  The pills are now in stock, but nobody had filled the remainder of my prescription and the system was still showing that it was completed.  The person working the counter was helpful and apologetic, but when the Pharmacist came back, she said \"we don't manufacture the pills, so it's not out fault\".  She obviously missed the training for customer service.  This was the fourth time I was told the prescription would be filled and it still wasn't done.

It's a pharmacy, first and foremost in the business to take care of a patient's needs by filling doctor prescribed medication for sick people. That alone should mean the employees will be kind, considerate, and have the patient's best interest at heart, which requires a certain level of customer service skills. I can honestly say, this is by far the WORST customer service experience I've ever had, in ANY industry! From the pharmacist herself to the tech working the counter, they are the rudest people I've encountered! My particular issue began with a refill which I called in back in August. Once I received a text that it was ready for pickup, I drove over to collect it, only to be told once I got there that the RX was not ready and the drug was not in stock. The tech argued with me about being notified that it was ready until I showed her the text message and then she had nothing to say. I was then told they would call me when the drug was back in stock and my RX had been filled. Three weeks went by and no word so I drove back over to check on it. This time, I spoke with the pharmacist who literally could not be bothered with my questions about when I might be able to get my prescription. She said it was ordered from the 'warehouse' and that they would call me when it came in but if I didn't want to wait, I could go somewhere else and get them to transfer the RX. I opted to wait. Huge mistake! Yesterday, while picking up 2 other prescriptions, I inquired about my refill on backorder. I explained everything that had taken place thus far to the tech and gave her my previous RX bottle for informational purposes. She checked on the computer and said 'this RX has already been filled.' And so I say to her, no, as I so painstakingly explained, it was never filled because you were out of the drug and could not fill it and I've been waiting for you guys to call me when it came in. Immediately she became combative! Then she tells me that, yes, they have the drug in now, BUT, I can't have it because 'oh look, this refill expired a few weeks ago.' Umm. No, it didn't 'expire,' it's been in your system awaiting the restock of the drug! She very rudely tells me that I'll have to go see my dr (and pay the $30 copay,) and obtain a new prescription. What? I'm in disbelief at this point. And when I asked if she heard any of what I had said to her previously, she began talking over me saying it's not their fault because they're all new and training and learning the rules and I'm out of luck! And that she would be happy if I took my prescriptions elsewhere! DONE! Not to worry! WALGREEN'S will never get my business again for anything!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886213531c24638b:0xa635a2eff497a769"}
