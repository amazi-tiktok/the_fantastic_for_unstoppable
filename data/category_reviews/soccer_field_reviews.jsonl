I travel to the Birmingham area for work once a month and was looking for a gym/box that has hours on Sunday.  I had heard some not-so-great things about a few boxes but I hadn't heard of Forge Fitness/ CF Shades.  Not only is CF Shades the only place with Sunday hours, but they were above and beyond wonderfully welcoming when I showed up unannounced during their open gym period.  Upon first glance, the gym was very clean, which is not very common among CrossFit and Crossfit-inspired facilities.  The owner, Rich, jumped up from a staff meeting and gave me a tour and after learning of my CF history, invited me to use any and all of their space as well as invited me back through my duration of stay while in town.  They have an awesome workout space out back with a platform, squat racks and a rig and the running course around the building is super safe.  I also met coaches Caleb, Josh and Rebecca who were all very accommodating and friendly.  When I returned for a class, Rebecca coached and I really appreciated her attentiveness.  I'm a CrossFit coach in Denver and because I move relatively well, I tend to get left alone - but I love being coached when I drop into new places and Rebecca was great.
