And also you not being a customer or ever been a customer, legally you can't post reviews. But besides all of that. The hood never flew off the vehicle period. You were obviously mis informed. I personally explained to the owner of the vehicle what happened and how it happened. One more time, the hood latches broke on the hood while I personally was closing it. Properly closing it is putting your hands on the front of the hood at the latche and pulling and pushing it downward until it latches. Hoods are opened and closed here all day everyday. The vehicle is a 1993 model trans am. Someone had just put new shocks on the hood that were obviously wayyy too stiff period for a hood and also on a aged fiberglass hood that had already had the brackets jb welded previously. Its kind of common sense if you put boards under the middle two sides of the hood and pull down on it something is going to or will give. He needs to go after who installed the shocks on the vehicle not blame someone in which someone else's ignorance caused it to break. You are wanting to put the blame on the wrong issue, its not that it broke its Why it broke in the first place. You calling me a crook is obsurd especially when we've never had any dealing whatsoever. And also with this customer in particular he was told the wrong price initially and we had already pulled his transmission and was bringing it to the back for breakdown when it got noticed that it was listed as a 4l60 and was a 700r4 which is a $250 or so price difference. I told the secretary about the change on the build sheet and to not call the customer to change his price since we had already began working on it and he was told a lower price. Someone else probably would have called the customer and tried to get the money back on the build but I ate it because he was told wrong and we was already in the process of getting it done. I deal with everyone/everything this way. I take full responsibility every time for my or someone at the company mishaps but not someone else's. I hope you or yall understand.

I would appreciate a courtesy call and a reasonable plan to fix the issue, let's see how long that takes. Unfortunately, today will have to walk home. I will continue updating this post...\nThe second day, 1st thing in the morning I got the call. One positive aspect about this Shop is that they keep their eyes on the rates and reviews. Looks like the previous owner messed up very bad with customers and the new people at the shop are trying very hard to fix the bad reputation. By phone, I got a fair enough excuse of why they did not call me yesterday and they have a plan to fix the car issue, which btw should not cost me a dime because the transmission rebuild is still on warranty...", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1547565189309, "text": "Thank you for taking the time to give us a review. This store is under new ownership. We have been here since June of 2017.

I received a call from them about a problem they were having with a vehicle. We took the time to find out what the manufacture required to fix this issue. Plus we had seen this problem before.

We sent the parts that were needed and a few days later they returned have the parts and said the car was repaired. OK... I don't know what he did but I do know they did not fix the car they way the manufacture suggested. Burke the owner originally paid with a check. So I had him a check cut for the returns which he cashed the next day. Then my business office tells me he canceled the original check he used to pay for the parts. I called and he told me several times he would come by and pay for the parts. This was the first couple times he lied to me. Finally I drove to his business and talked face to face where he gave me some excuse why he did not have the funds but he would pay tomorrow. It was always tomorrow. I would pull up and he would run and jump in his car and drive off like a coward. Even his own employees  said he was a layer. So do yourself a favor and find another repair shop.

I brought my BMW X5 there to have the water pump replaced. They replaced the water pump, but damaged other parts on my vehicle while doing the repair.

I called to check on my vehicle later that evening, and Yvonne said that her technician was having a hard time installing the water pump and that they had to charge me an extra hour worth of labor. Who fault is that? I told them no way, so they only charged me the $360 that I was originally quoted. However they did mentioned that my car needed 2 more repairs and quoted me $563 for one and $440 for the other. The $440 repair was for a hose that was damaged while they were changing the pump. The hose cost $40 from the BMW dealership and they said it would be 4 hours of labor, which didn't sound right for a hose. I called 3 other independent shops and was quoted $130 for the same repair parts and labor. The $563 was for a hood latch and cable, the parts at dealer are $80. Yvonne also said it would be 4 hours labor. I called several independent shops and was quoted $200 for parts and labor. I guess 4 is there magic number. When I asked Yvonne to double check those quotes all of a sudden she wasn't able to find the labor rates in the system. How did she come up with those figures initially?

We actually charged less labor to install the water pump than the labor guide prescribes.  We also told you about another coolant leak that you say we caused, but we did not; you also declined that repair.

I provided the part. I picked it up Monday. I could not leave because the battery was dead. Never had that problem before. RED FLAG.\n\nThe mechanic there said something ridiculous to me about all the car batteries in their lot going dead since the hailstorm, or something to that effect. I guess I'm a stupid woman and would just accept that ludicrous statement as truth. RED FLAG. He jumped me off quickly, and left me there with my hood up. ANOTHER RED FLAG.\n\nThen we figure it out. My boyfriend noticed my brake lights were not going off. There were pieces of one of my brake light stopper in my floorboard. The other stopper is just missing. These are the parts that keep your brake lights off until you hit the brake.\n\nSo now my brake lights were draining my battery. I had no issues with my brakes or battery when I left it with them. The truck obviously had made it to their lot after the repair, but then the battery died. Any person with half a brain can see what happened here.\n\nI contacted the owner, who defended his techs, but offered to \"fix\" this problem IF IT REALLY HAPPENED. Unfortunately I do not trust this shop to touch my vehicle at this point. I have not even driven it enough to know if the crank shaft pulley was installed correctly because I am waiting on brake stoppers from Nissan.\n\nHe seemed angry that I would question his \"integrity\"... WELL WHY WOULDN'T I?\n\nSo $113 later, my two cents: Save yourself the hassle. I was married to a mechanic for 24 years... and some of them do this to women who they assume will not know any better, so they will bring their vehicle back to be \"fixed\".... It's not surprising to me that these guys have a \"Ladies Day\" ... I bet they get a lot of repeat business. I did notice among all their suspicious 5 star reviews the few who did have a complaint were also women. Maybe they assume we need a man to TALK to a mechanic. Or they think people like me will see that they are \"Christian\" business and expect them to NOT SCREW ME over.

Not only was this gentleman highly knowledgeable about my needs but recommended other business that provided a plethora of services that saved me hundreds of dollars.  Even though they could have easily convinced me to buy parts from them, they listened to my problems and needs (for my car of course) and EVEN THOUGH THEY WOULD HAVE MADE A SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER PROFIT they directed me to the places i needed to, in order to save money and accomplish the needs of my car.\n\nI was completely gracious of their honesty, friendliness  and professionalism so it came to be of no surprise when their labor cost for my car's need was UNDER 175 DOLLARS than the cheapest place I could find in all of Tuscaloosa (I called and or spoke to 17 different auto shops that could handle the job i needed).  This along with all the other amazing traits of this company left me incredibly happy.\n\nAs a customer I could not ask for more or better service because THEY REALLY ARE THE BEST.

I was told to come back that Saturday; May 2nd so that a mechanic can look at it. I went that Saturday and had the lights repaired. That same Saturday night my entire driver side taillight went out. I knew they were closed Sunday but I called just in case I could leave a voicemail to give them a heads up about me coming in on Monday; May 4th regarding the taillight. May 4th they tried to repair the issue however ALL of my lights started malfunctioning. They tell me to come back that Wednesday; May 6th so that their mechanic can look at it. They gave me a work order stating that they are working on diagnosing the problem in case I got pulled over for no brake lights, reverse lights, headlights or turn signal. They proceeded to pull my vehicle through the shop and when I got inside it I noticed an airbag sensor that was not there before. I asked John if he could have it cleared out and he said that he would have the mechanic do it on Wednesday and that it should be no problem. I then attempted to turn my AC on (which was on while they were working on it but John said that he had turned it off) but the AC wouldn't come on. I get out of my vehicle and ask John if he could have the code cleared because I felt that it was messing with the operation of my AC and it's been 90\u00b0 lately. John then tells another employee named Skyler to come clear the code however the code does not clear. During this time the owner comes and introduces himself and asked me and another customer if we were being tended to, the other customer stated that he was already tended to then I stated that I was being tended to and pointed to my vehicle. The owner then leaves to never return again. They then proceeded to turn the vehicle off in hopes of resetting it however at that point the vehicle would no longer start. John then told me that I needed to leave and that I could return Wednesday to have their mechanic look at it but at this point, I had no dash lights, interior lights, exterior lights, no AC, no radio, no power steering, and sensors going off. The vehicle would no longer start up. I started to get upset, John claims I brought my vehicle in like that which is 100% untrue, I drove it in with no issues other than the driver taillight but I was unable to drive it away. I defended myself and vehicle over that statement then John pulled their doors closed while several employees including a manager/ assistant manager watched. I ended up having to call the police (because I had no clue what else I could or should do). The shop then claimed that I had a bad battery and that was the result of all of this however when they put a brand new battery in there it did NOT fix all the problems, the vehicle did start up and it did have headlights but that was it. After me refusing to tow my vehicle away and almost 2 hours later Mitch (I believe the manager or assistant manager) then offered to let the vehicle stay and have their mechanic look at it on Wednesday May 6th. May 6th, I went to go pick up my vehicle and John was working the front desk, they tried to hand me my keys in the lot hoping I would just leave immediately but when I asked for a full detail work order on what all had been done to my vehicle, I received attitude and was told that I should be happy that they fixed it for free and that they don't document all the work that's done on vehicles. I sat up there until I received a work order (over 30mins later) but when I received the \"work order\" it stated, \"gave customer a battery and replaced 10 fuse\". I told the mechanic that that was not a detailed work order but I was told that was all I was going to get. I do not believe that they would have fixed the damages their employee, John, caused to my vehicle if I did not have 4years of documentation from the one and only other mechanic I've been to, video footage from my own vehicle and computer readings from my Vivint smart security proving the condition of my vehicle.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e9b414671032d:0x29e4a24dd6f16484"}

You should look it up. With that said here is our reply to your review.\nI am sorry you are having an issue after the repair but an engine replacement is just that, the engine along with any extra parts that we felt were questionable and they are listed on your invoice. There is not an ECM on your invoice. Please keep in mind that there are several other things under the hood of your car that can also cause future problems. Unfortunately we are not able to detect a component such as an ECM, starter, alternator, Oxygen Sensor, Injector and so on that is about to go bad, it is just impossible. Your vehicle is 11 years old and does have 175,000 miles on and usually parts and components will begin to fail and need replacing after 10 years. This ECM is not covered under warranty because we did not replace this part and it does not come with an engine. I have copied and pasted some information for you that came from a site called my mechanic explaining the ECM\u2019s function to your car. We have ordered the ECM, as you know, and as soon as it is installed and the car is test drove we will call you.\nHere is some information that I pulled from the site \"My Mechanic\" that may help you better understand an ECM's function.\nThe engine control module (ECM), also commonly referred to as the engine control unit (ECU) or powertrain control module (PCM), is one of the most important components found on virtually all  vehicles. It essentially functions as the main computer for many of the vehicle\u2019s engine performance and drivability functions. The ECM takes the information from the engine's various sensors and uses that information to calculate and tune engine spark and fuel for maximum power and efficiency. Erratic engine behavior also indicates a bad or failing ECM. A faulty computer may cause the vehicle to intermittently stall or misfire. The symptoms might come and go and not appear to have any sort of pattern to their frequency or severity. The ECM plays a vital role in engine performance. Any issues with it can cause major problems with the overall functionality of the car."}, "gmap_id": "0x8888e1ecf9f042b3:0x2b83686c18294477"}

My P30 Step Van was towed in to get a refreshing and almost had to be towed away. I heard their ad on the radio, gave them a call and found out they service Cintas vans. I spoke to the owner Matt on the phone and he assured me that he was the place to come to and he would take care of me. I told him what I wanted done, I also left a list with the most important to be taken care of first (fuel tank leak and master cylinder replacement) with the receptionist. I mentioned new tires but didn\u2019t decide what to install, but he did, and installed them without my consent. Later he said he thought that\u2019s what I wanted \u201cthe cheap ones.\u201d He decided to do what he wanted and void my concerns (that I spoke of on every visit). I was charged over $400.00 in parts (radiator, v belt and lug nuts) plus labor @ $74/hour added without my consent nor were they spoken of when I made payments in person. I was charged ($35.00) for an air cleaner that he had left from a previous vehicle and promised that he wouldn\u2019t charge me for since I was getting so much work done. That Monday of week three, I stopped by to realize no work had been done over the past 5 days and I immediately stopped the work and told them I would be back in the morning to pick up and pay off balance. Next morning I waited over and hour for the motor to be pressure washed like he promised it would be done yesterday by lunch. While waiting he then decided that he would for free replace the master cylinder and patch the fuel tank leak with a $6.00 putty instead of replacing the tank like I asked on day one. All while repairs being done there were no actual receipt/list of parts and labor but guesstimations made until I made final payment. After I reviewed the receipt just before I paid the remaining $1,400+ balance I had to request that Matt break down and fix the double charges on receipt (I was so angry that I missed a few issues on the receipt). A week turned into a month and if I had not stopped the work there\u2019s no telling how long it would have taken to get the van back. Now I\u2019m weeks behind schedule on preparing for the van for body work and getting it wrapped.   The total cost was $3,863.68 and $1,417.25 of it was labor. I felt robbed and played.

A MAN BY THE NAME OF ROB claims he replaced the part totaling $650.  He then claimed he started the car and the engine failed.  Any MECHANIC WITH HALF OF A BRAIN KNOWS THE SYMPTOMS OF A BLOWN MOTOR...BLACK SMOKE MEANS MAJOR ISSUES HEKNEW THIS MOTOR IS BAD AND HE JUST WANTED A FREE CAR BECAUSE I CANT AFFORD TO GIVE AWAY $650 FOR NOTHING. This shop IS very expensive and NOT ONLY THAT they are shady and don't tell you what's really wrong with the car. They let you drive and break down again only to tell you that another part broke.

How do you go from I have no record of you and we haven't done anything, To full knowledge of everything including the price stipulations that I put on the repair? I am not broke. But there is a set value for this vehicle. I am not going to over invest in a cheap truck. Yes I dropped it off, yes I set a price that I was willing to spend on it. I can buy one for that with free shipping on ebay. Or from Shorty on 22. The truck in question was not something I was restoring . It was for sale. You don't spend a lot on vehicles you are selling. You do however have to repair them. A phone call would have been great. The only thing that was wrong with it was a sheared roll pin. It cost me about $2.00. I think $398.00 would have been fair pay to install a $2.00 pin. I did it myself. PS I changed it to 3 stars Happy? Who said I need charity? I needed a phone call so I would know to go a different direction. That was the part you guys failed on. It is ok you didn't want to do the job. I did leave my number with the young man I left the transmission with. I asked him to call when ready or if there was any problem. I would say that your business not being willing to do the work counts as a problem, wouldn't you? PS I have a pretty good lawyer as well. I have been sued before. I have him on speed dial.

The fact that some key parts needed are unavailable for this particular vehicle is no fault of his or ourselves or speak to the skill and talent of our technician, nor the honesty of our business. 4) After we communicated to your son we could not source parts needed, we agreed to remove the parts we had already installed and did not charge his any labor for this authorized work.\n\nWe are disappointed to find a review not based on your own experience with us a customer.

I brought it in promptly Monday as advised after I dropped it off a guy named Lee explained to me what they were going to check out and give me a call. 3 days passed and still no call so I stopped by and I was asked by a mechanic what do you want and why was I there if I haven\u2019t received a call from them (rude as possible). I explained to him that I was concerned about my transmission and he stated that he test drove it and it has lost reverse so he has to get it up on the rack and then he will call me when they figure it out. Day 4 mike calls and ask how do you start your truck I told him I usually start it with the key. He said that he needs me to come get it started so I went up there and waited for over an hour for Mike to show up. Finally he shows up and he tells me to get it started and he doesn\u2019t know anything about motors he is a transmission specialist. Mike diagnosed the problem as a bad starter I had to wait for a mechanic to take off the starter. While I\u2019m searching for a starter Mike calls and tells me that they are leaving  for the day and they need me to lock up my truck and put the starter on so he can get it fixed. So I finally make it back with the new starter and I had to pay  a mechanic to come meet me at the truck and install it only to find out my bolts are missing. Therefore, I call Mike he doesn\u2019t answer my calls. As a result,  I had to call a tow truck company Friday morning so I wouldn\u2019t have to deal with an unprofessional transmission company.   John and his team of real mechanics from Southern Transmission diagnosed the issue when it rolled off the tow truck which was loose battery cable and truck started running immediately.

Purchased a used vehicle from this dealership in May of 2020. I was sold when I was told that my vehicle had an Auto Nation warranty of \"90 days or 4,000 miles.\" Sounds great doesn't it? Well after being hurried along in signing paperwork so the vehicle could be mine I was very happy with my purchase. However, less than a month later, and still well within my \"warranty\" coverage period I got a Christmas tree of lights on my dashboard. I was told to take it to its dealership and from there I could then make the claim. When I called to make the claim, Auto Nation's warranty service said there was no vehicle with my VIN in the system. I then called the manager there who told me, \"I never signed any contract stating I had a warranty and it doesn't matter what I was told because it isn't in writing.\" I realized the manager was right about this however, I was being told one thing then they intentionally rushed me through signing paperwork so that I wouldn't catch that I never signed anything for my \"warranty\". The deceptive methods of these people shows that they are talented at one thing and, one thing only and, that is lying to people. These people are clearly slimy and cannot be trusted, save yourself the hassle and do not purchase a vehicle from here. Learn from my mistake, don't come here.

As we were on vacation the shop kept us updated on everything that was going on. (A part was having to be ordered from out of state) The original quote was $1,000 which I was OK with because they wanted to do a transmission flush as well. For the amount of work and parts I was happy with price. They called about half way through our week long trip to give us an update and the shop owner stated he would have it done before we got back or worst case senario, the day we got back. He also stated he thought it would be a bit cheaper, about $950, well that's great. No problem there! So the day we got home he called and said the car was finished and that he was able to do all the work for $860!!! He very well could have charged me the $1000 and I would have gladly payed. He instead did the honorable thing and charged me what it cost him! Also, very clean shop!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1553791759458, "text": "Thank you, John!

We almost made the deal twice. After making our down payment and payment requirements very clear, the sales persons involved went to get approval. When they returned, the vehicle had been discounted, but they added a \"fee.\" That's the only thing he would say, \"a fee.\" They were trying to deliberately be vauge and, in our opinion, dishonest. After discussing their \"fee,\" we never actually achieved full disclosure. We were told the vehicle was at a different dealership within our city and we could go there to finalize the deal. They said that they would call ahead and we should just go over there. Our credit had already been run multiple times, and we had received approval from the credit company. With this in mind, we went to the other dealership location. As we arrived at the other location, they hadn't been given all the details as we had been led to believe. So the process began again, running in circles of double talk and running our credit again... We left at closing time and expected a phone call the next day to complete the deal... That has yet to happen days later. I used to have great respect for Greenway Automotive. It appears that Greenway has only taken over these dealerships at face value, and the same crooks that were already in place are still running things just like they always have. Avoid Greenway Honda in Florence, AL, and Greenway Chevy in Muscle Shoals, AL, if you are planning to make a deal on a used car.

I know it's all to protect them from liability suits. What ever happened to trust, recommendations, honest opinions? Every answer to every question seemed will rehearsed. Two days later my alternator goes out! Maybe a coincidence, but it seems like everyone I put my trust in the professionals, things start going wrong with my car. Don't trust mechanics, lawyers, maintenance individuals, had one of them tell me, \"if we fix it too well, we'll be out of a job, always have to leave something for another day.\" There's no real honest people in this area, not anymore. Bureaucrats have got their fingers into everything. Law suits are the \"American Way!\" So you can't really blame them to avoid taking responsibility for their actions. I know what my part costs, they were going to charge me nearly $500 in labor to loosen and tighten bout 6 bolts? A little extreme, they did an estimate but I never got to see it, I asked to see the defective part, but was given the excuse we would have to put it back on the lift. Since it wasn't on the lift, they had no plans to fix it!\n\nAllen from Phenix Firestone called, his only concern was why I was so critical of him. I thought that was clear, but this was the second time I took this vehicle there for the same issue, the first time I was told nothing was wrong with it. In any case in order to resolve the problem Allen stated, \"we're not working in your cars anymore!\" I guess I hurt his feelings?\n\nI used to love taking a vehicle to Phenix Firestone, always felt like they were looking out for me, always trusted them! Now I get the feeling I'm unimportant, it's really changed over the years!\n\nEnough said hope you all have a great holiday I'll be home fixing my cars!

I dropped my 2005 Nissan Titian off to have some recall work completed, diagnostics ran, O2 sensors replaced and an oil change.

I woke up in the morning and the car was not there. I talked it over with my roommate and we agreed i should call the police. Long story short, I tried calling Nissan to let them know the situation. I left several messages, tried calling my appointed service tech, sent an email and even had a conversation with the online chat. This happened Wednesday night- Thursday. I finally received a response, via email, stating my truck was finished. Total cost was just over $300.00. The recall work was covered, the cost was for the rental. All of the work I requested to have completed was not finished. The invoice didn't even reflect my request, the issues my truck is having or why I brought to them.

His staff is the same way. Each time I went into the shop they made me feel comfortable and at home. I actually quite enjoyed going there. They scheduled me a follow up appointment for 2 weeks, to ensure all their work is in perfect order.\n\nI would recommend Transmatic to everyone.

He also make recommendations on upgrades and suggestions on the care and maintenance on the vehicle after the repair was complete.

I can say that they truly \"have your back\" on repairing your transmission.\nThey are like doctors, they want to do a check-up on my truck in two weeks to ensure that everything is operating properly with no leaks.

So, if an auto center changes your brakes in 30 min but the book says it takes 1.5 hours, then the shop charges you for the extra hour as an extra rake. Now, I do not mind paying the extra as long as the quality matches. This shop may do quick work, but it is not at the quality I am paying for. Poor value given, and they would not make it right either. Basically the repair guy did not remove all the necessary components (like a radiator) to save some time and shoved the water pump in at an angle.\n\nI will never use them again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888c4e6e0b99431:0x62babd6da353f44f"}

They fixed both and stuck to fair estimate.\n\nI wouldn't do business with them now after my last experience.\n\nMonth 1 & 2\nOur car needed a new engine. The shop owner wanted to get an engine from his supplying junkyard. He missed one that became available. This process took about 2 weeks before we decided to find an engine ourselves which he was not happy with but agreed to. He said they could have it put in within a 3 day period. The engine company we bought from needed it done in 10 days for warranty purposes. Griffith used all of the 10 days to because other cars came in front of me while we had to wait on engine. They finally got it in and started but had to send to dealership because the car went into anti-theft mode and wouldn't start. We had to actually arrange the drop off to the dealership ourselves. I feel like we were running his business for him because he was almost never there. The employees even mentioned that problem in passing.\n\nMonth 3\nWe become worried after not hearing anything from dealership or Griffin for about 2.5ish weeks. I had to contact dealership for them to tell me that they told Griffin that the car needed a major fuse panel that could be $1200+. I called Griffin to tell him I approved the install because we really needed the car. It's month 3 folks!\n\nIs it Month 4? Getting close anyway.\nWe had to go ourselves to the dealership to confront them about not getting to our car. This should be Griffin's job. The dealership says that the part didn't fix the problem. Car still doesn't work. We decide to give up because the car needed another part for $2400 to \"maybe\" fix. We decide to just give up. Dealership is trying to get more money from us even though they didn't fix the problem. Griffin is trying to put that on us. We said we would pay for his time, but does this seem fair? Griffin himself might be a knowledgable mechanic, but he is a rookie business owner with no organization or management skills of his people.  He wasted a huge amount of our time (3+months), money ($6000+) and stressed my wife and I to no end. We are going to have to scrap our car with a new engine that doesn't run.\n\nThey do good oil changes and put a muffler on another car we brought, but he also made me pay for the part up front which shows bad business to me as well.\n\n* FINAL RESULT\npaid griffin $1400 because the car ended up not working out. He said he made no money and it would have been $2000 if it had worked + whatever it would be to charge AC. When we walked in to pay he didn't even recognize us. My wife and I talked to this guy several times in person and on phone. The waiting area had mice running around too FYI if you are scared of them. After that we went to the dealer shop that had our car and basically gave it to the tech working on it. he paid for the dealer work and gave us a little cash. When we went to clean the car out I noticed that the driver seat leather looked very dirty and worn. Griffin said he was sorry.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888c4e6e0b99431:0x62babd6da353f44f"}

I needed to carry it to the dealer to verify its a transmission issue because they don't have the tools they need to verify it.

When your vehicle originally came to our center it would jerk and not even move, after diagnosing the obvious transmission issue we discussed a low mile used transmission was the best option for your budget and overall goal of repair.. The original repair was done in April and has been fine until now.  You came back to center for an issue that I agreed is there however the codes being set were manufacturer codes that could not be read by our computer. My recommendation was to have a dealer scan to diag said codes to determine if in fact it was in transmission at which point it would be taken care of under your warranty.. I take a lot of pride in what we do here and would never not repair a vehicle under warranty. In fact in your case with it being a used transmission from a supplier I wouldn't be out anything to repair your transmission if that's the issue. The supplier of your transmission under the warranty would have to provide a replacement unit and compensate our shop for the issue because of there transmission falling prematurely . Again I completely understand your frustration but there is a reason for the instructions given and it certainly wasn't to not honor a warranty. It was simply to gain more information to submit a warranty claim to the supplier to replace the transmission if again it was found to be faulty.. I'm here to fix your car if you choose and I hate you see this issue that way especially after our last discussion and you was completely on board with all of this."}, "gmap_id": "0x88890d1deccb77e5:0x17a125c8ec95a1e0"}

In March of 2018 my transmission gave up in my truck. My family had been using Aamco Trussville since the doors opened, so obviously I would trust them with mine. In July my truck started making noise one morning, next thing I know it had locked up tight before I could even react. Could not even turn the crank with a socket and all the spark plugs out. I called Aamco in Trussvile just to make sure it couldn't be the trans they had just \"rebuilt\" . I was assured that there was no way a transmission failure could cause an engine to seize like that and they would be happy to price me some engine work. Being in the auto industry myself, I decided I woukd price and engine and install it myself eventually since I had another form of transportation to get me by. Well here I am in Jan. of 19, still in warranty. I have pulled my motor and behold, the transmission is locked up tight, WILL NOT TURN. Motor turns fine now that it is disconnected and has great compression on all cylinders. I contacted Aamco Trussville to tell them my situation and was fully expecting them to be gentlemen and fess up to their mistake. As soon as I mentioned it was out of the truck and I could bring it down for them to see, I was told it would not be under warranty because I pulled it. The only reason I pulled it is because we were all under the assumption (including Aamco) my motor was locked up. They are now saying they are under new management with new staff and can't take my word for someone else that was in the previous staff telling me what they did. Well, Aamco of Trussville is Aamco of Trussville.I just want my truck back. My wife is a stay at home mom and Ive been driving her only form of transportation lately. This is a strange position for both of us to be in, I understand that. But whats right is whats right. I work hard and am an honest man.

It wasn't something that happened often, but this car is known for transmission issues once it gets high in miles; currently I'm at 167k.\n\nPerry, the service manager, was able to take what little information I could give him about the problem, give me a basic diagnosis and ask me to drop it off so they could look at it.\n\nI dropped it off that evening and the VERY NEXT morning he called, said he could reproduce the problem, find the faults and proposed the fix.  No surprise to me, it did require a complete service on the transmission but they were able to resolve the issue within a day and a half.  For additional peace of mind, the repair came with a warranty that's good at any AAMCO.\n\nI can't imagine taking it to any other shop though.  These guys are friendly, fast professionals.\n\nThe car is now spinning like a top and I could not be happier with my service.\n\nThanks guys!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890d1deccb77e5:0x17a125c8ec95a1e0"}
