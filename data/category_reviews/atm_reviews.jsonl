She then made the situation worse by making a sour look on her face and the tone in her voice was VERY hateful My friend's said they heard her gossiping to that employee and the customer after I left, so loudly she could hear and she was going through the checkout isle in front of the bank .

How ever out of the blue they tuck the overdraft away and told me I have done to many over drafts and I could over use the over draft again in 30 days. OK fine after 30 days I got in a tight spot due to covid19 Palmer Toyota said we could only work every other day to lower the risk of getting covid but I still needed food and gas and rent even if they didn't charge a late fee it still had to be paid but can't overdraft.so after the 30 days the overdraft still is not working they said oh well it's going to be 60 days not 30 nope after 60 days still no overdraft once again I ask them why then I was told oh it's going to be 90 days for a cool down nope still no overdraft so once again I asked why no overdraft and was told oh it's has to have a full 6 months for its cool down. OK FINE! well even after that still no overdraft so again them why and they say I have to resign up for overdraft then it will finally work after 24 hours. Well still no overdraft after 6 days so again I go and ask why no overdraft and now they are telling me I can never have overdraft there again due to how many overdrafts I have made like a year ago. Like I said I needed over draft due to moving in are first apartment we needed everything so yes I used overdraft often they ALWAYS got there 30 dollar overdraft fee and the were always paid back and had a positive balance the following week we just had are first child so it would really be nice to know if I need to use overdraft I could but no giving them 30 dollars is not good enough for this joke of a bank. And also at the time I started a new job at Toyota as a tech so I needed overdraft to help get tools I did not have new apartment first child new job but now no overdraft with no warning and nobody knew at that bank why all I was told was next month next month them clown don't know anything.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb26a955faee9:0xad3ac7132af6dd59"}

Absolutely disgraceful to handle business in this way in the middle of a pandemic where so many people are financially stretched.

The website read that I'd receive it within 5-7 business days, which I was okay with, but my biggest concern was when I read that it was being mailed to an old address I had connected to the card; which is a very, VERY bad neighborhood. So around 11pm I called customer service, and they were able to cancel the request (thank God,) and stated I needed to go to my local Regions branch to change the address and request new, so I did.\n\nThe wait was a little longer than expected, but I'm not one to complain. I typically do not leave reviews, but the woman who assisted me, Roxie Kitchen, was phenomenal and deserves the recognition! She not only helped me update my address and request me a new card, but she also assisted me with setting up a savings account, and gave me several options to help me build up my credit score, since I am looking to purchase my (first) own vehicle by the end of the year and I currently have no credit.\n\nWe had some complications, but despite it all she kept a positive attitude and was very helpful, informative and sweet; it was just like talking to a friend. She welcomed every question I had and was able to give me a clear answer and explain in detail what everything was.\n\nIf you live in Troy, or just passing by in need of a visit, definitely stop by and talk to Mrs. Roxie.

As i moved up the line i looked back and saw that the line stretched to the outside door and customers were getting impatient.

I am not sure if it is just the person that we dealt with or the entire credit union.  We made an appointment to do an auto loan and it felt like the initial person that helped us at the Clanton branch talked down to us the entire time. We had to leave and get some additional documentation, which was fine, but we were not given all of the information that we needed. I had called to double check to see what we needed and so it was ready when we came back to the branch.  When we came back to the branch a couple of days later I was told that we did not have everything that we needed. On top of that, the person that was supposed to be helping was not even in the branch that day and she had passed everything off to another employee.  I understand that sometimes you can't be at work but the reason for her absence was apparently planned weeks in advance. She had made an appointment with us and we expected to meet with her since she knew the entire scenario.  We did get the loan done, and I am very appreciative of that and the employee that helped us the second time, but it was much harder than it had to be! Once we were done with the loan we, again, did not get all the information that should have been passed to us. We were informed that insurance was going to be force placed on the loan if we did not provide proof of insurance.  We got insurance on the vehicle BEFORE we even went to finalize the loan. If the proper questions were asked at the time of closing by the lender then this all could have been avoided. I hope our future encounters with this credit union are better.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a02d73d38f:0x5ef92c7502dd2817"}

I didn't mind having to move my stuff but, in my eyes, proper customer service would dictate the employee assist in moving everything because I had no idea I was at the incorrect register when I sat the things down. He also was not wearing a mask, even though there is a sign on the doors saying \"masks required inside this facility\".\n\nAnyway, maybe I'm just being petty, but it just irked me the wrong way, him with his superior attitude and all. In the grand scheme of things im sure my contributions won't be missed, but treating people in the manner he did me will eventually lead to more people never returning. Management of this facility should probably look for some workers with at least a small amount of pride in their job. I get its only a fuel station attendant job but all jobs, especially ones dealing with the public, should show a little pride in their work and make the customer feel welcome.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb12361814833:0xb348a71835c8e91f"}

I preceded  to the register to pay for my items while the person kept yelling at me.. I told the cashier let me pay for my items because I have to go to work. She grabbed  my items and threw them in the trash and said this is her store. If this person was a manager it explains why the store have poor reviews and act unprofessional.

I've been a loyal banker with Wells Fargo for 3 years and they treated me as if I were insignificant today. I spoke with the manager because of a situation where my fiance went to deposit money in my account (as he has many times before theough the ATM and with a teller) because im at work and he was told he couldn't. The option wasn't there with the ATM either. So I called to inquire on if the policy has changed or of the ATM was no longer offering the option. I was told they have no control over who deposited at the ATM multiple times as if I were an idiot and then told that the policy changed in May (ever think to notify customers when policies change?). I was told he could deposit a check or money order but to deposit cash would be fraudulent. When I pointed out his tone and the fact that he was talking down to me he continued with \"so you called over something I have no control over and I told you I have no control over and your upset because I can't control it, is that correct?\" That is very riderand condescending. II wil be closing my account and banking else where as soon as possible. No wonder this branch only has 3 stars. He is a poor excuse of a manager and exemplimes customer service at it's absolute worst. He refused to give me his name at the end of the call but thankfully I document everything and when I don't I always do my recon and research. A little trick I have learned working in customer service the past 10 years is record every conversation. Unfortunately I didn't start recording in the very beginning of the conversation when he said his name, as I did not expect the call to take such a turn. So I only have the last half of the call on record. That's ok though, I will still be going through the proper channels to let Wells Fargo know what poor service I received. It is unacceptable and they deserve to know how their employees are treating their customers so that it can probably be addressed and handled.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0e119f3a5a27:0xaf86bc955e2df069"}

I went to the rural king in Chester Pa and saw an equipment that i wanted to purchase for my business. Spoke to a rep there and he told me that I can apply for their business credit card though redstone federal credit union. So i applied on Sunday 05/18/20. On Monday a Melissa Wilson called me back and said the credit card was approved but she need to open a membership for me first to finalize everything. She took my basic information and said I'll received a docu sign by the end of the day. I got an email from Melissa on Tuesday night saying that the underwriter needed 2 year of business tax returns, a utility bill, a mortgage statement and a selfie of myself with me holding my ID. I thought the last request was a little strange but I submitted everything anyway. Got a call from an underwriter on Wednesday and this is where I think she just dont have a clue about what she's doing or is extremely racist. She asked me how far was rural king store was from me? I told her about an hour plus. She then ask why I close two credit cards in 2019. Told her I had two credit cards from the same company so I requested that they combine the credits from both cards on to one and close one, which they did. And that i didn't close the barclay card. I was an authorized user on the barclay card and the primary user close the card that's why why it appear on my credit as close. But I went ahead and open up my personal barclay card in December of 2019. She then ended by saying well I'm not satisfied with the two cards that were closed, and there's a fraud alert on your credit and this seems like fraud. I told her yes I place a fraud alert on my credit so that no one can open up fraudulent account in my name. A fraud alert will tell a company to give me a call and verify its me before opening up a new account. People do that all the time. She said well this seems like fraud. I told her you have my ID, Mortgage statement, utility bill, my social security number, phone number that you're talking to me on matches the phone number with the credit bureau that's on my fraud alert, my 2 years of business tax return with my business name and my home address. I have a 732 fico score and a 80/100 dunn and Bradstreet score. I have all the credentials needed for approval. Credit, income, etc. But all they saw was a driver's license of a beard black guy, that have a fraud alert place on his credit and two close credit cards that one of them he requested to be closed and the other was close by the primary card holder. And the scary part about this entire situation is the young lady that told me all this is an \"underwriter\". An underwriter who's racist or an underwriter that don't know that it's legal to call the credit bureau and request that they place a fraud alert on your credit and give them a number to place on your credit to have potential creditors call you and verify its you before opening an account. Also an underwriter that don't know that if you become an authorized user on one of your family members card that entire card history gets transferred to your credit history. And if the person closes that card it will also close on you credit profile.

Well, long story short, I paid it off and then was told, \"I'm sorry, we cannot loan you any money at this time.\"  One, that old loan should have been charged off during my ex's bankruptcy ages before. Two, that loan was charged off.  It was not shown on anyone's credit report.  Not mine nor my ex husbands.  Regardless, I will never do business with them if I can avoid it.  They tried to do the same with my brother.  He told them if it was not shown on his credit reports he would not pay and he walked out.  I am sure this has happened to more people.

That is one reason I kept asking for the manager, to speed up the process.

I asked to write info on a piece of paper.\n\nThen he obviously did not know how to dispute charges, again asking for help. Now Angela gets up to go assist him.

While checking out she says \"oh yeah\" or something of the sort. She walks away, comes back with cup while telling me I'd left it. Glad she cleared that up cause home invasion had popped in my mind. It is a Cars cup after all. I apologize to Trussville PD explaining false alarm and hang up. That's a joke, they have me blocked. Anyway, I thank her a bunch, tell her how happy I am to have it, 4yo says \"thank you\" cause he should. I'll allow note taking just this once. We leave, I hear something fall off car.

(Walking in regions) waited 10 mins to even see a teller due to them being busy(3 customers 2 tellers) yeah that was sarcasm.  When it was finally my turn I told the cashier I need to cash this check. She responded ok I need your LICENSE  to which I provided while I signed the back of the check. Of forgot to mention this is a $25.oo check. She asked if I had an account with regions I responded no mam. She said you are aware their is a service fee on checks if you do not have an account with regions. I said no I didn't know that, that's weird. I said how much, she replied 2 dollars (not much it seems but when you struggle to make ends meet that $2 means a lot) she said yes it's just our policy \" EVERYONE GETS CHARGED THE FEE IF YOU ARE NOT AN ACCOUNT HOLDER\" I said ok, my bank doesn't do that. When I write a check to someone they cash without having an account with my bank it bc that's their hard earned money. She responded \"well the only way I cannot charge you is if the check HOLDER gives permission to WAIVE the fee. So naturally I was pissed off. I said how is it you can say that it's a mandatory fee and EVERONE GETS CHARGED THAT FEE IF NOT AN ACCOUNT HOLDER, but if the check HOLDER called and said it's ok to WAIVE the fee. That literally makes no sense! She replied in a smart tone \"well why don't you just deposit it to your wells account. I said I'm almost out of gas and just figured I could cash it here being less than a mile from my house. I said fine just cash it I'm on my way to work. I will be visiting the branch manager of regional manager tomorrow to see exactly why they say it's mandatory but it can be waived? I'm in customer service I know what it's like dealing with the public but that was uncalled for rudeness. I will recommend everyone close their account bc my friend did the day I told her what happened she said she had no idea they did this when she paid ppl by check and was outraged.

First time experience at this location. There were several cars in drive thru so I thought it would be quicker to go in (I only had one deposit to make).

I really didn't  know what to do when I walked in. I asked the customers sitting if they were waiting for a teller and they said yes so I noted who was in front of me and stood and waited. One customer got frustrated and left so now two in front of me. Two more came in and walked ahead of us and I kindly said that we were waiting for a teller, too. They were nice, one left and the other sat down and waited. The two in front of me were there because they had wrongful credits to their account so they would be a while, too. They all said that the wait was common at this location. I stood there for 20 minutes before I finally got waited on.  The teller was nice and started to chat with me ( I was in a hurry, on my lunch and frustrated) and there was was still one person behind me. I told him that I was in a hurry and had already waited 20 minutes to please just deposit my check.  He then tried to tell me that I could have used the machine outside and or gone through the drive thru (he was still very nice). I was not. I told him I thought it would be quicker to come inside that I had never waited this long with just 2 people ahead of me.  He said that he thought it was normal to wait at all banks.  He stayed professional but I know I made him mad at the end because his smile went away. It wasn't his fault. Evidently they have a new policy that you can go to any teller for anything, opening an account, lost card, wrongful credits to your account, all of which take a long time so if you want to cash a check or make a simple deposit then don't go inside.

I arrived early and they were mowing and weed eating all around the parking lot to the salon which wasn't open yet, so I parked at the nearby bank at 7:30 in an area where other cars were parked and it had a covering overhead, which helped with the sun, and I also used the space at the end- the furtherest parking space from the door. Well, when the employees started coming in there was one lady that wouldn't stop staring me down as if I were a member of Al Qaeda waiting to rush in and rob the bank, and looking at me extremely rude. She stared me down all the way until she got to the door to unlock it and then just stood there with the door open staring at me more (smart thing to do if you think there's a security risk going on). I didn't think much of it because I was minding my own business and eating a biscuit and looking down at my phone most of the time. But then I look up again and she had an entire clan of people looking at me (employees who had arrived and were standing outside of their cars in the parking lot); she was looking at them in the parking lot as if they shouldn't try to walk into the bank because me, *the possible big bad mean bank robber* might try to rush them. I'm a person sitting here waiting for a business to open and I've actually sat in the same exact parking spot 5-6 times before without any issue. Once I realized what was going on I saw a man walking over to my car and I rolled down my window, and I explained to him what I was doing and that after using THEIR ATM I was just waiting on a business to open. He then said that they just weren't sure what I was up to.\n\nI will say, just based on this incident I am so glad I am not a customer of your bank.

I've tried to be patient, understanding that they are a smaller institution and lack the systems and experience of larger institutions but it finally became too much to tolerate.  It's been a comedy of ineptitude, bad systems and offensive behavior.\n\nMy account was originally a solo account and we added my wife to the account when we got married almost 30 years ago.  The Credit Union kept losing or failing to acknowledge that document.  I must have added her as a fully authorized user and joint owner on the account over five times through the years.  Once, they wouldn't allow her to pay off a loan saying she wasn't authorized to make payments on a loan we took out together.\n\nMy children have each been stranded out of town with no access to their cash when the credit union froze their accounts suspecting their travel meant fraud.  In each case, the credit union was notified prior to their trips and they still locked their accounts.  In each case, it was over a weekend and they were unable to remove the block until a business day.  One child was in New York City with no cash for food, taxi, subway.  The other was in Minnesota.  Our only choice was to wire our kids cash via Western Union.\n\nOur accounts have been compromised at least 3 times where someone other than us had an AmFirst issued card with our account information and gone on shopping sprees.  In each case the onus was on us to prove we didn't make the purchase, and we had to wait for weeks to be refunded but the credit union refused to give us any case information so we could bring charges against the criminal or even go to police.  They said the fraud was against them, not us.\n\nA fraudster gained access to our son's account and he drove to America's First to report the problem.  They refused to lock his card saying they couldn't verify he wasn't making the out of state purchases as he stood there in the branch.  He stood there with the banker as they watched purchase after purchase drain his account down to zero.\n\nThe final straw was me taking a cashiers check from my investment broker to deposit in my Americas First account.  It was a sizable check but not the first time I'd moved funds between the accounts.  AmFirst said they would have to freeze my funds for 10 business days to make sure the check was good.  They said they had never seen a check from Merrill Lynch and didn't know what to do with it.  I said they could call my broker to verify.  The banker then accused me of attempting felony fraud.  She didn't know if it was a real check and even if it was, I could cash the check then drive to my broker to remove the funds.  I was stunned.  After a 35ish year relationship with Americas First, I'm suddenly going to start passing fraudulant financial instruments?\n\nNo more.  I'm done with them.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918fc831ef2df:0xcd34d9945e29099e"}

They're pretty great out there. Anyway, a couple months ago I attempted the Foley PNC (only because it's a lot closer than GS) and what a change! Although, there's usually only one or two employee(s) working the window and/or counter, but they're super friendly and always acknowledge me when they're busy. Makes me want to continue going to this branch.\n\nOriginal post:\nPulled up to the drive through today about 1:45 pm and I was the only one there. I saw two girls working behind the computers at the window. I assumed they were busy dealing with other customers. Cool, I'll wait. What's not cool? Neither of them even acknowledged I was there. I work in customer service and if I'm busy I'll at least say \"I'll be with you in a moment.\" Most people are okay with that, I'm okay with that. Alas, I didn't get that from them. I sat there probably close to five minutes. Another car had pulled into the slot to my right about four minutes after me and sent in the container. She wasn't waiting very long before the lady with the name plate where the first letter was a J grabbed her container, then finally made eye contact with me and dispensed the drawer for me to put my money into for my car payment. Imagine my frustration when she acknowledged this woman that pulled up about four minutes after me. I let J proceed with the other customer, but when she went to put in my payment I just had to know why. I mean, you'd be curious too, right? Her reason was it isn't personal, but she didn't see me sitting behind the gigantic window that's directly in front of her face. Yes, she was behind a computer, but several times she moved from behind it to place some receipts into the bin underneath where the containers come in. You can't be that oblivious when there's a window there. Unless.. dare I say it? You choose to be. It was quite amusing for her to think I would believe that horrible excuse. If your employees are that unaware of your customers, as J stated, then maybe they should be retrained a little better. To have employees that have such poor customer service skills looks bad on the company as a whole.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0de3cbc213ab:0x1dfb0a6388992bb4"}

I went to the rural king in Chester Pa and saw an equipment that i wanted to purchase for my business. Spoke to a rep there and he told me that I can apply for their business credit card though redstone federal credit union. So i applied on Sunday 05/18/20. On Monday a Melissa Wilson called me back and said the credit card was approved but she need to open a membership for me first to finalize everything. She took my basic information and said I'll received a docu sign by the end of the day. I got an email from Melissa on Tuesday night saying that the underwriter needed 2 year of business tax returns, a utility bill, a mortgage statement and a selfie of myself with me holding my ID. I thought the last request was a little strange but I submitted everything anyway. Got a call from an underwriter on Wednesday and this is where I think she just dont have a clue about what she's doing or is extremely racist. She asked me how far was rural king store was from me? I told her about an hour plus. She then ask why I close two credit cards in 2019. Told her I had two credit cards from the same company so I requested that they combine the credits from both cards on to one and close one, which they did. And that i didn't close the barclay card. I was an authorized user on the barclay card and the primary user close the card that's why why it appear on my credit as close. But I went ahead and open up my personal barclay card in December of 2019. She then ended by saying well I'm not satisfied with the two cards that were closed, and there's a fraud alert on your credit and this seems like fraud. I told her yes I place a fraud alert on my credit so that no one can open up fraudulent account in my name. A fraud alert will tell a company to give me a call and verify its me before opening up a new account. People do that all the time. She said well this seems like fraud. I told her you have my ID, Mortgage statement, utility bill, my social security number, phone number that you're talking to me on matches the phone number with the credit bureau that's on my fraud alert, my 2 years of business tax returns with my business name and my home address. I have a 732 fico score and a 80/100 dunn and Bradstreet score. I have all the credentials needed for approval. Credit, income, etc. But all they saw was a driver's license of a beard black guy, that have a fraud alert place on his credit and two close credit cards that one of them he requested to be closed and the other was close by the primary card holder. And the scary part about this entire situation is the young lady that told me all this is an \"underwriter\". An underwriter who's racist or an underwriter that don't know that it's legal to call the credit bureau and request that they place a fraud alert on your credit and give them a number to place on your credit to have potential credit call you and verify its you before opening an account. Also an underwriter that don't know that if you become an authorized user on one of your family members card that entire card history gets transferred to your credit history. And if the person closes that card it will also close on you credit profile.

Sometimes 2 or more are talking and they have to see you, yet won't straighten cart to let you by. One pulled up & blocked a short narrow little isle they had created which I was in the middle of and paid no attention to me and  she was on cell phone. I was trapped and asked her to excuse me..She was not friendly...Maybe I have bad luck with timing re: produce people...But they just seem to have no awareness or care that people are trying to get by.
