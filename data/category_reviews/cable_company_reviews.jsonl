We had difficulties and getting anyone to do anything about it was near impossible. Customer service was rude as was one of the Techs sent to the house.

Went to the store only to find out boxes would not be in ghe store until the 22nd.\nCalled customer service, no problem, we\u2019ll send one out. Box arrived, no instructions nor remote. Hooked it up with assistance of customer service, had picture for 5 minutes then went black screen. She made a same day apt for me.\nTech arrived, gave us a remote, worked awhile and got one channel working. Said it could take a day for everything to come up. Ten minutes after he left it went black screen. Several calls later got another apt. 8:30 at night I called because it was 2 hours passed the apt time. Told it was still opend. Told him to show in the morning. They called me at 9:23 pm when I was sleeping and since I didn\u2019t answer the phone they cancelled work order.\nMade another apt and it was cancelled for some reason.\nGot connected with a supervisor in SC who got me a 5 pm apt. Tech showed up 10 to 5, said it probably needed rebooted, thst had been done numerous times. I told him he was supposed to bring a new box.\nDidn\u2019t have any, off to the store 10 minutes away to get one. After an hour I called and cancelled my service.\nI\u2019ve been thru way too much in my life to be treated like this.\nBottom line-\n-Customer Service is there to make you feel good. They can\u2019t do squat\n-Supervises are there to tell you stuff to appease you and get you off there back, basicly lie to you.\n-The techs that came in my home had no purpose being here.\nAs for me and my family, we choose books.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888d385b97c0906d:0xd92d2cc80054e9db"}

Very poorly managed store... Other customers had waited 30 minutes or longer... Called activation number that night... Very friendly rep and had my phone activated within 15 minutes....
