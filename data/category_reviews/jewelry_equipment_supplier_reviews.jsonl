He was giving the prior customer the same attention that he was hoping to give you. We did have a shortage of staff today due to illness, I apologize. I am also sorry that you did not realize he was helping someone else, I am sure you would have understood had you realized such.  Congratulations on the arrival of your new granddaughter that is such a blessing! Again, I am sorry that our engraver could not get to you sooner.

My husband had purchased my ring and I brought it in to get resized. That was my first visit and it was okay. They said to give them at least 5 days but I should receive it back sooner. 2 days later and they called back! I was thrilled! I was surprised how quickly the turnaround was. I left but the ring was too snug. I brought it back and the entire time the young lady was assisting me she seemed like I was a nuisance. Very unpleasant and I just couldn\u2019t wait to get the heck out of there. Again, they had a very quick turnaround and when I walked in not one word was said to me. I walked up and I almost spoke first but I wanted to see how long this would last. FIVE employees there and not one spoke a word to me. When I got up to the counter still nothing was said.
