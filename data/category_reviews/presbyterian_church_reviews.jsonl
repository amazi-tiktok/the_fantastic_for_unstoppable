More than a passing thought.  Using your whole mind.  Not being swept by emotion.  Serious consideration.  What difference would it make.  And several dozen other questions were answered for me.  A building is just that.  A building.  But the people I've come to know have become family.   The kind of family you can call when life gets hard.  Or help another when crisis erupts.  Most of all, the people are well grounded in grace.  Grace is key to this community.  It's a safe place to be yourself.  No pretending to smile when things are a wreck.  It's one beggar telling another beggar where there's food.\nThis  has been a place of learning.   Not mere data.  Truth.  The kind of truth you chew on, mull over, and wrestle with.  Truth that forms character. Strengthens convictions about what matters.  Learning to love your neighbor...even the one who steps on every raw nerve... not in a 'gut it out' sort of a way.  Loving that neighbor because it's in you, really in you, to love.  Truth that transforms.\nOak Mountain is a great place to taste and see the God of the Bible.  Real goodness, love and peace.  Not just a Sunday morning event with the typical sermon and songs. (Although they are top notch.)  But, you could just as easily find excellent teaching and music on the Internet.  We were created for community.  Community with the Creator and with each other.  Community full of grace and truth.  I never realized how starved I was for these.  Life is tough, but now I'm fed. And do my best to help others find the same.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88893d7429662b09:0x56ee7b7de9022f1e"}
