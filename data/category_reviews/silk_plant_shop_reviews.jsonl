I feel that I should be able to pick out  a picture of the flowers and container that I would like to purchase, pay for it, and have it delivered. When I order an item, let's say a new chair,  I can see a photo of the  chair and know what I am paying for ,and when it arrives it should be the chair I ordered. I don't like paying for something that is NOT what I ordered. While I understand fresh flowers may need to be substituted the arrangement should resemble the photo. Flowers should be similar and the container should be exact.  A container should not be in a photo on the website if it is not \" in stock\". This is false advertising. Each individual florist probably doesn't have what is pictured on the Teleflora websites.\nI called the florist and expressed my concern and followed up with an email with pictures of what I ordered and what was delivered.  I ordered a beautiful sturdy white wicker basket with flowers and what I got was a cheap multicolored Easter egg basket. They substituted the basket and after I complained they were willing to offer me a credit of $2.50. What a joke!  I will not use this florist in the future for any reason and will never use a site that is managed by Teleflora. My thoughts are that the Teleflora company has way too many florist and they do not know what each flower shop has in stock. So when you order from a site like this one, you NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO GET. BEWARE. I wish I could put a photo on this commentary. I paid $45.73 for something that was NOT what I ordered.  Here is the response from the florist:\n\nThank you for your recent order. We pride ourselves on delivering the best, most fresh and most similar arrangements that we can for our customers and we have been doing so for over 38 year in the Shoals area! I am very glad you were pleased with the flowers that we provided for you and your mother.\n\nIn response to your recent request for a 50% refund here is our answer:\nThe basket chosen was unavailable and a similar value was substitute per our substitution policy.\nWe were also instructed to call and leave on the front porch if no one was available. Which we did. Our standard policy is to call and if there is no response, and no one is home, we leave a message as to where the flowers are. Since we were instructed, by you, to leave them, they were; only after a phone call was made. Had you not told us to leave the arrangement, and weather was not good for our arrangement, we would have left a message detailing where the arrangement could be picked up.\nAlso, you did not order from a 3rd party person. You placed your order on our website, which is managed and updated by Teleflora. They are our wire service and website managing team. They have thousands of florists that they service and we all obviously have different items in stock. They do a generic picture, and when a picture is chosen we try to fill the order as best we can with the flowers we have on hand at that particular time. Flowers are very seasonal and have a high turnover because of spoilage. Next time, a  call directly to the florist could save you a substitution since you would know immediately what they had available at that time.\n\nAs far as using another florist, they would offer the same substitution policy as us, so I don't know that you would've been happier.\n\nSince you were happy with the flowers provided in the arrangement and they were Pretty and Fresh I can NOT offer you a 1/2 refund of the product, being as though you were please with it. I will however refund you the \"basket\" charge since you were not pleased with the substitution chosen. I will be adding a refund of the Full container charge of $2.50 to your card. I hope this helps.\nThank you for your business.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d4eb6ed4ce74d:0xf4773df3daae3fbb"}
