I was greeted with a smile and a friendly hello. I went in to get a piece of jewelry repaired. I was told it would be ready by Friday. Boy was I surprised when I received a call the very next day saying it was ready. When I went to pick it up I was surprised to see how gorgeous my ring looked. They had cleaned and polished it along with replacing a stone and a prong. The price was very reasonable. So if you are looking for a jewelry shop locally that has amazing jewelry and a friendly staff you can not go wrong with Cloverdale Jewelers.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1629470129182, "text": "Thank you for your kind words\nWe love our customers and we love what we do and that makes it easy to do a good job"}, "gmap_id": "0x888e81ac22cdf9ab:0x326aa123f09b2c11"}

I explained I have never worn a specific wedding band because over the years I've never found one that I adored enough to wear every day. Most look \"typical\" and I've happily worn the few pretty ones I've collected. I didn't know what I wanted,  I just knew what I didn't want. After a couple of discussions, Rick helped me realize, I had a ring from years ago that meant everything to me... the first ring my husband ever gave me. He suggested we \"create\" that same ring but with more of a commitment look. I couldn't be happier with the result. I had tears in my eyes when he handed it to me! Who knew the little ring I was given as a promise of hope from the beginning would mature into a lifelong dream that I can someday pass on to our only daughter!! Thank you so much for your patience and ability to realize what I really wanted all along!!
