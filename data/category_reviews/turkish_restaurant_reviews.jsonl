I had heard that there was good Middle Eastern wraps somewhere in Tuscaloosa. However, I rarely go into the mall. Today I stopped in and had a d\u00f6ner sandwich.That is basically like a gyros wrap, and the meat is beef and lamb. I opted for the rice instead of fries. It comes with a drink, and I chose a Pepsi, but I lamented that they did not have ayran , the salty yogurt drink. His server said, wait, I will make you one, and he did! It was tasty. The sandwich was large, had plenty of tasty meat on it, and you could choose the toppings, onions, red cabbage, etc. They have a tasty cucumber sauce. The price was not overly high. I really love the rice! I\u2019m not sure what the little brown pieces are that they add, but it was very tasty.
