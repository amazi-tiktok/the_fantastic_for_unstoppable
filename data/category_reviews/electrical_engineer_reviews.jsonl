I told the guy I didn't need him but he insisted, sprayed WD40 without permission, and found nothing wrong. Now they are trying to charge me despite me never agreeing to the \"work\".\n\nIf Im going to pay for shoddy service calls then I will gladly use another company.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8885981e6b27c05d:0x309cafa014da0435"}
