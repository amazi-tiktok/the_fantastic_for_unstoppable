The company believes it  can SUBSTITUTE SOMETHING just so long as they make the deliveries to people on the Disabled & Elderly Medicaid Waiver program (keeps people who would otherwise be in NURSING HOMES in their own home).  I quote several  of their Customer Svc people \"AT LEAST YOU GET SOMETHING\" but it's more so that GA Foods GETS PAID.\nI have no problem with an OCCASIONAL SUBSTITUTION but have gotten them TWICE in the past month - instead of orange juice (as per CONTRACT) they substituted apple one week  & grape last week. So ok it's JUICE right? Both INCREASE my blood glucose levels. They are BEING PAID from FEDERAL & STATE FUNDS (taxpayers that is) that DEMAND FOODS MEET CERTAIN NUTRITIONAL STANDARDS.\nI didn't post prior to now but this week's delivery was not only \"just defrosted\" it was DANGEROUSLY WARM - the ENTIRE BOX WAS DEFROSTED and WARM. The plastic containers had AN INCH OF WATER in them (I have photos) & cardboard partitions were soaking WET.\nSo I call CS and I'm told I will get new delivery on Friday. Glad I'm not TOTALLY dependent on these deliveries like SOME people ARE.\nWhen I said that they need to CHECK THE TRUCK because it is obviously NOT maintaining temperatures to KEEP ITEMS FROZEN as demanded FOR FOOD SAFETY.\nThe CS rep says to me \"We KNOW there is an ISSUE WITH THE TRUCK and it's NOT maintaining temperatures.\"\nWhat the h\u20ac||\u00a7?! They KNOWINGLY DELIVERED DANGEROUS FOODS to the ELDERLY & DISABLED who DEPEND on the FOOD. Think about that...\nThey KNOWINGLY DELIVERED DANGEROUS FOODS to people WHO ARE FRAGILE when it comes to THEIR HEALTH.\nWhat makes it even WORSE is THERE WAS A SUPERVISOR on the truck with the delivery driver!\nBut GA Foods attitude is \"WELL WE GAVE YOU SOMETHING\".\nYes SOMETHING LIKE FOOD POISONING.\nLuckily I'm very AWARE of FOOD SAFETY and KNOW to NOT EAT THE FOOD but there are CUSTOMERS WHO DON'T KNOW BETTER.\nAbsolutely DISGUSTING BEHAVIOR by GA Foods.

I finally decided today was the day. For those of us who live in West mobile or Midtown, there is a scenic drive to the cottage. It's no more than 15 - 20 minutes, just relax and enjoy the ride.\n\nAs soon as you pull into the driveway, you see this cute cottage.  But not until you're inside, do you realize, this is a such a gem.\n\nBecause we're still dealing with Covid-19, there is a sign on the door kindly asked did you wear a mask.\n\nOnce inside, you notice a beautiful  sitting area, coffee bar, a larger seating area, and an area set aside for unique and delicious treats.\n\nMeredith and Lisa are so welcoming. The cottage had just a warm vibe and they're customer service was exceptional.\n\nReney's offers their packaged togo  butters in a refrigerated case. I was so impressed to see they offered other items, in the same case,  from local businesses and small business in the South. Such a generous thing to do.\n\nI placed my order for the Chocolate Banana bread and they recommended Toffee butter. I picked up a coffee Velvet Ice Latte from PJ's Coffee (Spanish Fort, AL) out of the refrigerated case.\n\nLet's go ahead and jump into this Banana bread and Toffee butter. WOW!! Yes, the warm banana bread was great. It was moist, delicious, full of flavor,  incredible!! But let me tell you about this Toffee butter, it was so light with little bits of toffee in the butter. I carefully, with reservation,  spread a small amount atop this incredible slice of banana bread. The first bite, what the what!!! I decided to go for it. Grabbed the knife and did what I know you would do, scooped, yes scooped, a dollop of butter onto the bread and leap to my feet in a happy dance.  The butter paired with the bread will make you want to take a step back or let's say a step towards the butter to spread more on top of that bread. Yummy!!\n\nI decided while I was there to support some of the other local businesses by purchasing more than a few items.

Thanks Lisa.\n\nI'm wrapping up this review because I'm going to the park to run 3.5 miles to burn off this Banana bread and Toffee Butter but it was worth it.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmuapMQ0NxtVTZPGNbWDLHGSN62-oXpV6gebMH=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPf_oQon1RDXe4QKJTSI3D4NnoCOm7d6VJBcAPu=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMLnzOTQ3jARwhc5AKBVCYaEK6qV0AafodkFib=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwIqDR-sftw0fmtEN75UB_JoKIBJs5VpW6P4xA=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb176d44006cf:0x352b9bd128d8236c"}
