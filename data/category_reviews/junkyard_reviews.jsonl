Went in for something super simple and can put with an even bigger problem. I purchased a windshield wiper arm. It was confirmed that the arm was for the year and make of my car. I asked if I could pay extra for him to put it on and he agreed. He wasn't able to put it on claiming that it was becuase I needed a nut. I noticed that the wipers were no longer working after he tried putting it on. He claimed the wiper motor was not working. The wiper motor was working completely fine prior to him touching my car. I took it to my trusted mechanic and it was confirmed that not only did the wiper arm Hammett sold me was NOT for my year and make car, but he also tore my wiper transmission when he ripped the arm off of it. Prior to me even going to Hammett, I took it by my mechanic to confirm what was needed. It was confirmed that I only needed the arm as the wiper motor and wiper transmission were perfectly fine in great condition, I had also driven the car in the rain the day before and the wiper worked just fine. I called and text  the guy who damaged the car and sent photos and I have yet to receive a response. Do not only did i pay $40 for an arm that doesn't fit my car (Oriellys Auto Parts confirmed that the Hammett arm was likely for a 2003 not a 2008), but I also had to pay $75 for the part Hammett broke as well as $75 for a brand new arm from The dealership. This was a $40 fix that ended up costing me $190! This is a real review. I would not suggest taking your car or buying any parts from this company. The honest thing to do would have been to at the very LEAST reimburse me for the arm that didn't fit the car. I gave them that opportunity by calling and texting prior to this review and I didn't receive any response back.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPpTCHuu-CePVv-YXiLx8J980jtxWAtSiqVGX6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a24f244bcf02b:0x42810f229b40e283"}

They give me a part but off the wrong year car. One difference... there was a sway bar tab on the year car I own that was missing.

I go back the next day to try and replace it and they didn\u2019t have it. They then would not refund me. The part was picked and sold to my mother after being very specific about what I needed and they just made a mistake. No biggie but it is ridiculous to not make good on it... they tried to convince me that I should just put it on and not attach the sway bar and after that the thought I would let him weld a tab on there. No way. I don\u2019t trust his judgement and measurements to the precision that they might need to be at.
