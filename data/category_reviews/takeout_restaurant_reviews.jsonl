I wouldn\u2019t give them another penny of my business in my lifetime nor will my family.\n\nFrom the moment we arrived, the two ladies running the front were extremely rude, and acted as if they didn\u2019t want us there at all. Once we were seated, our drinks were slammed down on our table. 15 minutes passed before we saw them again to place our orders, of which we were given major attitudes.\n\nWe ordered a mango lassie, which was very gritty and was made from some sort of powder. The yogurt tasted rotten, and we told the server about it. She snatched it off our table, and rolled her eyes.\n\nWhile we were here, and the 15 minutes passed by, we saw two other tables get up and walk out without ordering because of the terrible customer service given to them by the \u201cmanager\u201d. Please roll back your cameras and watch people walking out after encountering the most rude servers/managers in Huntsville.\n\nThe rice was so dry, we asked for a different entree. Once we got the bill, she refused to take off the drink that cost $3.99 because we took one single sip out of it to find it wasn\u2019t good, and the yogurt was sour. She said \u201cyou took a sip so you\u2019re paying for it\u201d.

With that in mind, I decided to try the Lamb Tikka Masala. It was served in a metal bowl. There were a great deal of lamb in the mixture (see the photo). There was also a lot of it. I ate about half of the dish and got a take-out box for the remainder to enjoy it later.\n\nIt was a tomato cream sauce with spices harboring a different flavor than I am used to experiencing. It looked like a thick tomato bisque soup and had some tomato flavor but with different spices.\n\nI also had a Naan bread to accompany the dish. It was very much like the pita bread often served in Greek restaurants and had a similar flavor. There were four large slices of bread.\n\nOverall, the meal was very filling.\n\nMy dining companion ordered the Tandoori chicken. It is pieces of chicken with yogurt and spices and cooked in a clay oven. I had one of the chicken pieces and liked it very much. Again, a different spice than I am used to having but it tasted good.\n\nThe chicken was served on a plate that was sizzling when it came out. Obviously, it was very hot and an impressive presentation with the chicken sizzling rapidly.\n\nFor a drink, I ordered Masala Tea. Again, I had never had this tea and ordered it on a whim. It was very good. Strong black tea with milk and spices, probably cinammon and some other spices. It was robust and filling and served hot.\n\nThis restaurant is in the back of a shopping center and can be easy to miss. Until we got close, I did not see the sign although we were looking for it.\n\nThe meal was tasty and the prices were very reasonable. The servings were generous and many adults will have food left over to take home for another meal.\n\nFor those who have not tried Indian cuisine, this would be a good place to start.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6dsTnmwlDgq5lxG1NHW_vXiSY8narQmHiffWE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOT_MuHJ-Q5Tdy1zWssaxlpTxYznq_o_cLMc7dU=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1626811951087, "text": "Thanks Ralph for you good review.

Socialized with friends for a while and saw two missed calls a few minutes later at 6:53. No voicemails but I figured it had to be Domino\u2019s so I called back. Waited for 10 minutes and no one picked up. App said pizza was being delivered. Called back at 7:26 to see where food was. Finally got someone on the phone. The gentleman said he tried calling twice to tell me there were no delivery drivers available. But he could\u2019ve left a voicemail for that! Why did I have to try and call him back for that information? At this point we\u2019re all hungry and now the guests are upset.\n\nSo a few things here:\n1. The app shouldn\u2019t show my food is being delivered when it hasn\u2019t even been made.\n2. I shouldn\u2019t have been able to order delivery if the location doesn\u2019t offer it.\n3. The employee should have left a voicemail with the information and not wasted my time trying to call back for it.\n\nSo be careful using this location. The communication is very poor. Call ahead of time to see if they can deliver. Don\u2019t use the app.\n\nEDIT: Bumping up a star since the manager called me to explain the situation and obviously wants to make things right. I may give this location another try since it seems I caught them in a perfect storm of \"things going wrong\", and being a former restaurant worker myself, I can sympathize.\n\nMy order was flagged for review since it was associated to an address that has been linked to multiple phone numbers. This is a national Domino's corporate policy to keep tabs on potential sketchy orders.\n\nDomino's corporate always expects their franchisees to have delivery drivers, and never anticipates a scenario where a given store has no delivery drivers show up for work. So don't expect the app design to improve, and I can't fault this location for that.\n\nDomino's typically doesn't leave voicemails as they prefer to talk about potential order problems in person, and in my case, try to present an offer for me to pick up the pizza myself. Even so, we'll agree to disagree as the voicemail could have said \"We have no delivery drivers for tonight. Please call us back by X time if you still want the order and can arrange to have it picked up.\"", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1627330944209, "text": "Our team appreciates your review and feedback.

We got back to the hotel and opened the box only to find the greasiest pizza I have ever seen.  The thin crust pizza was as flimsy as a paper towel.

It's located inside of the Wavaho gas station, so you can buy more then what they sell at Subway, so you can get a candy bar or anything else to go with your meal instead of only chips. Don't get me wrong, though; I do enjoy their chips. I also love the avacado/guacamole season, which happens every summer. I LOVE their avacado and guacamole sandwhich toppings. You can choose any toppings you want, or just order something on the menu. I almost never order from the menu. I just choose exactly what I want my sub to be, which is what Subway's all about. I love this location because it's like right near my house, so it is really convenient for mybfamily and I to order take out. If you want to eat IN the place, they do have a single two-peeson table you can eat at. If you are passing by this nice building, you can stop by and get some Subway, as well as anything else they sell at a gas station/car oil place.

I don't know his name I'm assuming he's the manager as I always see him working late. The last time he helped me was a year ago, when we talked about their wings being fried, and we agreed that baked soggy wings are the worst. I was impressed he took the time out to talk to me and explain their products when he was busy. A year later he's still great and helped me tonight. I felt compelled to leave a review and tip better next time. I took this opportunity to point out to my wife that this was why I tip even if I'm just picking up pizza.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPsqDRpu8MJE1hJhC2rLniLlCZ3zgQK4f_D3yIU=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889266e7c0dd2b3:0x8293c1f5c0c683c8"}

In addition to having just about anything you might find yourself needing while out on a stroll around downtown, or serving jury duty, etc., the staff is incredibly friendly and will (in my experience) go out of their way to ensure your good day.\nHowever, you will be paying convenience store prices for most of their selections: a cup of coffee will only leave you a little better off than a visit to Starbucks (without the carefully constructed flavor--ACoE's coffee has been particularly bitter in my experience, even with sugar and cream), and the food can get a little pricey as well. Packaged foods, on the other hand, seem to be a bit cheaper than, say, the store inside the courthouse but it's not really enough to keep me from driving the little extra distance to the Publix at Twickenham Square.\nThe cozy atmosphere and neat meeting space upstairs, though, may be enough to counter-balance the slightly higher prices and not-so-awesome coffee--and a warm Spring day sat outside with a cold cup of iced tea and a fresh-made sandwich can't quite be beat.\nSo all-in-all, if you don't mind spending a bit more and not getting Starbucks-quality coffee, you will get a cozy, unique atmosphere great for a refreshing time on your own or with friends.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b56a1fd3df7:0xd805f6cc220b76af"}

After multiple incidents, I finally walked away without my order.  She had one person's order she was making when we arrived.  She asked us what we wanted and I told her we wanted 4 sandwiches so we'd wait for her to finish and check out the woman already there.  She complained that she was all alone and she didn't want to avoid taking off her gloves to save time.  So then when we tried to tell her our order, she kept asking what we wanted, and I kept repeating it every time she kept saying it wrong.   Then after several go arounds she said she'd fix the sandwiches but we needed to tell her what we want. I said I had and asked if she could hear me, and she said she couldn't because there was too much noise.  That was about the time another customer came in.  So I spoke louder and began repeating the order once again, and she interrupted me and told me to hold that thought.  And then proceeded to finish and wrap the sandwiches for the woman ahead of us very very very slowly.  At around this point in time, I looked and it was 4:06 pm.  We had pulled into the parking lot at about 3:51, and upon entering the store I briefly looked at produce then went into the restaurant.   She made several remarks through the course of this time she had started with our order at  about 416. She said she had problems just like me and that the customer wasnt always right and that she wasnt disrespecting me.  Yeah right.  I was in an amigo so these things she bent down and said then through the glass. Then asked me if I understood her.  I told her I didn't.   I heard her but I had no understanding of what she was trying to communicate.  Her response to that was \"see, now you know what I mean\". The woman behind me told the little girl with her not to say a word to this employee because she was frustrated because she was working alone.\n\nShe mixed up the sandwiches, and instead of 2 BMTs, there was 1 and 2 hams instead 1.  This is when I realized she had put pickles and mayo on the wrong sub.  My husband said he didnt want it with the mayo on it.  So i tried to tell her he wasnt going to pay for it and she told me she would  throw them out and had another customer, so I needed to decide what I wanted.\n\nI have never been treated so rudely and it wasn't just what she said , it was how she said it.  It was 4:23 when I finally gave up.  I walked over to a Walmart customer service person to see if I could talk to the subway manager but she and 2 others didnt seem to know anything about it.\n\nSo... at 4:26, we exited the store, and drove a few miles away to the Subway in town across from Dollar General.   There were 3 employees there, all of whom were very pleasant and the subs were bagged before I paid for them.  The time on the receipt was 4:45. This is the sub shop to do business with.\n\nSo if you want good and prompt service stay away from the Walmart Subway.   The employee who was rude had a name tag on.  I would never post it, but I\nWill check before I ever order there again to make sure I never have to deal with her foul personality again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888d470ad0c62c3b:0xfea59d59a020d498"}

I am a manager at a pizza hut now and that's the point. To give customers the best bang for their buck. I sent my stepdad to subway for sandwiches for my husband and I. I knew the sub i wanted was a $5 sub and my husband's would cost a little more. I gave him the money I had and told him to get us foot long sandwiches. He says the lady didnt specify, which i understand, but i paid $4  for a 6\" sub when the woman could have informed him for $1 MORE HE COULD HAVE GOTTEN A FOOTLONG! needless to say, i ate my sub and my husband ate his. Plus the food my mother and stepfather got tasted bad and he wanted to bring it back. My point, you should at least INFORM YOUR CUSTOMERS SO THEY CAN MAKE THE BEST DECISION BASED ON THEIR MONEY. For 1 dollar more I could have had twice the sandwich. If i could give 0 stars i would. This is my first review on this subway and i never try to give bad reviews working in the food industry myself. But i will not EVER use this subway again. I will go out of my way to bypass this one.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88928d331798a3cf:0x1a9b84f85e88ce08"}

The lady whose name I do not recall, told me the bread would not be ready for another 30 minutes. They have been open for two hours. Yes, I could understand being open for 30 minutes and not having the bread done, but two hours is absolutely ridiculous. So, I travelled to another subway up the road to see if the situation was the same. The man in this store was very friendly as he already had his bread done. I called the manager of this subway of which I experienced the bread not being done and she informed me that it was not a priority nor the first thing they do. If you do not have your bread done by time you open, simply change your hours. It is SO RUDE for customers to be under the impression that they can \"eat fresh\" when they can't even eat at all. While on the phone with this manager, I asked if all the subways did this. She replied with \"no.. wait I mean yes.\" I explained to her I went to another subway directly 10 minutes after I was told there was no white bread done but he seemed to have all of his stuff together. She informed me that it could have been left over bread from yesterday, but it was not. Guess he is just more concerned with keeping his job and keeping the customers happy than having them complain about stupid bread situations.

Order is almost always ready when I get there or just coming out of the oven, almost never have to wait around long which makes it super convent. Food is always hot when I pick up my order, unless I am late so can't fault them for that lol.

Also if you use a smartphone use there app or go online makes ordering a breeze but you can call in too they handle that easily as well (just try to know what you want, they will thank you for that and people in the store will thank you for that.

However, slowly the quality has declined. We order from there a lot and usually go pick up our order. They leave out sauces or extras that you order a lot. This really isn't much of an issue because I just ask them when I get there.\n\nHowever, the consistency of quality of the food hasn't been good since around June. We order bread bites a lot from there and sometimes they are drenched in oil to the point that they ooze out a lot with every bite (not good) and others it is bone dry with not even sauce to dip them in (also not good). Sometimes the bites are REALLY undercooked and sometimes they are just right. I understand it is different employees making the pizza, but sometimes the stuff is good and other times I don't even eat it because it is inedible. Ordering now is a 50/50 gamble on whether I will actually be eating what they give me. The pizza is often the same (undercooked or just right).\n\nAlso one time they gave us a cheesy bread instead of bread bites and then when we called about it they basically called us liars. We just wanted what we ordered and we order from there A LOT.\n\nRecently we have cut back on ordering from there because of the consistency issues.

The food was THAT late, and prepared incorrectly THAT badly!\nNow here I sit, waiting for a pizza delivery.....it\u2019s been over an hour.....the app told me it got pulled out of the oven 45 minutes ago.....the store told me the driver \u201cjust left, he had like, 3-4 deliveries BEFORE yours\u201d...and I tell myself, for the last time, I will never order Domino\u2019s again-no matter HOW badly I don\u2019t want to call Papa John\u2019s.....at least Papa John\u2019s does what they say they\u2019ll do, and they actually deliver my order in under 2-3 hours...", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb33aefa62e9b:0xdcf1ec70484217f5"}

It's truly the BEST BBQ locally.  Everything on the menu is homemade.  They offer everything from the best variety picks of vegetables (sweet potato is the bomb and HUGE, fried okra, corn on the cob, great fried green tomatoes are so yummy, field peas, mashed potatoes, cabbage\u2026 all recommended). The Q stew, i.e.:Brunswick stew is a winner. ALL PORK AND BEEF platters, inside or outside chopped, served with 1 or 2 sides,  French bread or cornbread will fill you up with a to-go box for sure. The ribs fall off the bone,  and I truly recommend the chef salad.  All dressings are homemade. Price per person is about $10-14 for a full meal. Homemade lemonade and sweet tea are outstanding. Don't forget dessert.  The pecan pie and lemon pie are the best around. If you've got the time to wait, their steaks are excellent too. Chopped steak is my favorite, the fried chicken fingers are so crisp and tender. My kids love them. They cater too, and do a very good job.

To my enthusiasm n surprise, Country's BBQ. I grew up in Columbus, Ga and go back from time to time. And EVERY TIME I do go back 1st place I stop is Country's. I LOVE Columbus Country BBQ and longed for it. About 3pm when we first walked in, the Mgr told us \"to walk over there, grab a menu and seat where ever we wanted\". There was 2 other couples in dining area. The waitress was outstanding!! I don't remember her name, but she was super bubblely. But we were so disappointed with the food. I ordered my usual; pulled pork platter. Husband ordered his usual; 1/2 chicken. Well the pork was drowned in chutney n coleslaw juices, which totally ruined the taste mainly b/c I don't like chutney. I used a numerous amount of napkins to dry up the juice. Husband's chicken looked liked it was cooked the day before or real early that morning. The BBQ sauce was dried and skin was wrinkled up and some spots were burnt. It was very dry. Husband informed waitress and she was very helpful and offered another one, fresher or something else. He ordered another chicken. The 2nd chicken was a more moist but didn't compare to the taste of Country's in Columbus. If Jim is affiliated with this establishment, he would be ashamed. Also, the Mgr had fixed a plate for herself and sat and ate. Not once did she come over to ask about why we sent it back.  How convenient it would've been since we travel through Montgomery often and it's closer than Columbus for us. Needless to say, we won't be coming back or if by some chance we do, we will hope to remember and not order the same thing.......", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1448860779322, "text": "Dear Pamala,\n\nI am so sorry to hear about your recent experience at our Zelda Road location.

We picked up the order 10 minutes later and noticed there was only one person dining in Country's BBQ, 4 staff in the kitchen and one or two staff in the dining area. About 4 orders were picked up while we waited 10 more minutes (added item to order) for our order. After getting home I realized my 1/2 and 1/2 order of fried pickles and onions was far from being fried.  In fact it was very clear they had gone straight from the container to my take out container. Not cooked what-so-ever. I was soo disappointed. Was really looking forward to trying the side dishes. Now I travel a lot and have been to great BBQ places across the US and outside the US and this is definetly not one of them. Anyone who says Country's BBQ is great has not had good BBQ. Aside from the poorly prepared side dishes the BBQ (chicken and beef) was just okay, definetly not worth mentioning.

The people who ordered before me had time to eat and leave and be gone for 5 min before I got my food. The entire wait for my food there were 2 toddlers running around the dine in area screaming. It appeared that the cashier was babysitting this toddlers. She kept leaving the register to tend to them and give them drinks. That was very unacceptable. I ordered this for dine in but after being in the restaurant for 20 min I was tired of hearing 2 kids screaming and running around I asked them to give me the food to go. I get back to work to eat and the quesadilla was not properly cooked and just fell apart. I will never go back. And as an engineer I hope fast food workers are replaced with efficient equipment.

The staff was pleasant.  I paid for my food and waited in the van for my co-worker to pay for his food.  As I waited I looked into my bag to inspect my lunch and eat a few fries.  The fries were hard and lukewarm at best.  I go back in and ask for fresher fries which they obliged by taking my entire lunch back and putting the \"fresh fries\" in my clamshell.  After returning to the office to eat; the parmesan garlic chicken nuggets were obviously not fried to order.  They were dry and barely warm as well.  Every time I've gone to BWW this has been the case whether dining in or carry out.  I think they cook everything in bulk and its never fresh or hot when it reaches the table.

There will be no \"next time\" BOTTOM DOLLAR ON THAT. Horrible experiences at this locations but tonight's interaction burns bridges. Granted, there was inclement weather tonight so some delay and difficulties were expected. However, from what I experienced tonight, Domino's Pizza off of Mobile Hwy would have been better closed. No matter, I ordered from the app and request delivery. I finalized the order on the app but I later received a call from the store, saying they didn't have delivery drivers (again, expected difficulties) and I need to pick up my food. What they didn't tell me is that they voided my app order, placing a hold on my debit card (upcoming 'last straw'), and I would need to bring my debit card to re-order. So, when I arrived at the store, lo and behold. They told me that I needed my card. Thus, I had to drive back through Tropical Storm Sally in a partially wrecked car, just to get my debit card. (Now, given my past dealings with this store, I should have know better but I am a naive person person at times.) I get back to the store, just to find out that because of the order I made on the app, Domino's Pizza tried to charge me twice for the same order. One for delivery and the other for carryout. I snapped. So what? I need to have at least 40 dollars in my bank account to order pizza. I am sorry; your tax dollars don't pay teachers enough for that. I find it really funny that Domino's Pizza can jump into your bank account so fast when you order but, refunding and correcting orders, they feint as bumbling idiots. I do not just hold the store at fault but the entire corporation. They have no regard for customer service; Domino's Pizza only cares about profits and their shareholders. I wouldn't drop or invest a dime into Domino's Pizza, with all the dried and burnt pizzas I have ordered over the years. Hell, Pizza Hut has a hotline for situations like this, but you invest your time in 'Pizza Insurance' and 'HotSpots'. How about fairly selling pizza when trying to double dip into people's bank accounts? How about optimizing your systems so errors like this can fixed quicker? Just go under, already. But, before you do, give me my money back because YOU STILL HAVE NOT DONE THAT YET FOR A ORDER I CAN NOT EAT BECAUSE I NEVER RECEIVED IT!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1586546559560, "text": "Hello Chris, I apologize for your experience and would like to assure you that this is not an automated response and your review is individually read and responded to because we want to make sure your concerns are addressed.

(Maybe Domino's should consider giving their drivers a living wage so they would stay).1:40 pm, pizza finally shows up at my office. The driver gave me my now cold pizza and seemed a bit miffed that I failed to leave a tip.  Guess I'll wait two more years.

Although the pizza tracker showed it at quality check phase (the last phase before delivery), I get a dead air call no one said anything. So I called back and get an answer from a rude Adrian screaming and cutting me off because I questioned him about waiting 30minutes to call me to tell me they don't deliver in my area after dark. In which I just received a delivery from them about a week or 2 at this hour ago so I guess it's a new policy, So why was I able to place an order and why was I charged and again 30MINUTES before you call knowing you have an online tracker indicating the steps of my delivery??????? Don't waste your time dealing with these people. It's a hit or miss on the quality of your service or if you'll get your food at all.

When I walked in, there was a semi long line.  I was about to turn around and go somewhere else until I noticed the young man behind the counter. He was the only employee in the building from what I could tell.  He is probably a manager. Maybe not but he seemed to be by the way he was carrying himself. If he is not he should at least be considered for a management position.\nHe was moving as fast as he could.  More importantly, (and the reason why I decided to stay and wait in line) he was having a great time talking to the customers and didn't seem to be discouraged by his circumstances.  Customers were laughing and talking and actually ENJOYING their time WAITING in line.   I've owned and sold customer service and hospitality related  companies before and you do not typically see customers that enjoy waiting. For any amount if time or for any thing   This young man, Steven or Steve, is the reason why I stayed.   I enjoyed my conversation with him and my time in line as well. As a former/semi retired franchisee, I can tell you, this employee will do great things for your company.\nEverything was great on my visit. I even met some people in line who I would not have typically spoken to. All because if the atmosphere that was created by one employee.  Food was fresh and perfect.  I would recommend this subway over any others.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918bedbf5b309:0x6b93b6216092fef4"}

So we have been waiting for a long time to try this place out since we didn't want to drive to Auburn to try that one.\nFirst walk in it is very impressive and a very nice re do on the Atlanta Bread Co layout.  Friendly staff and very fast service from the time you order. We arrived at 11 right when they opened since it has been very busy but from the moment you go inside, the order counter is right in the doorway which doesn't allow much space to wait to place your order.\nThe soups are to die for and the salad was amazing. The pesto chicken sandwich was a bit much for my liking . It had too much pesto and almost no chicken.\nThe only main thing why I couldn't give it 5 stars was the fact that like every 2 minutes Andrew was coming by talking to us. I mean , ok, maybe we are more introverted than most but come on, we couldn't take a bite and here he was back again talking to us and trying to clear our plates. We joked about the next time we would go back we would get our food to go so we could enjoy it.\nThe kids got a pizza which OMG was sooooo good . Couldn't understand what the big deal was to just put pepperoni on half but no big deal really.\nWe def wanna go back and try other items on the menu for sure.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2kEC4nRdgMGkMMqtgI9cToLelVLxEGHAoACfG=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnakF6qmbMQ0_pX0dnOtLT2S5LW6oxN-EiAsHv=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhKLh1bzVOmv6gCHjZYGyL4Rg86I3srY8ghmWm=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyVxnpK1Y-i547IuE74of0dM6ZApLtrOPXkRWv=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhU4eCiGMx_L2FmOAkjDsK7vGVJLXioM_-B8AK=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9g9YyNiMwcQeKLAGQeCFdbXZGN1v24T41_Olz=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccb4ab17fdc0f:0x18a9f59cd403b696"}

I didn't see anyone at EITHER cash register so as I went to take my mother to the restroom I came back up and asked where do I place my order order as there still wasn't anyone present at any register. I went to the front with one of the ladies. I asked her about her suggestions and I order d a sandwich based on it with a fruit cup for my mother. I ordered a veggie pizza with no artichokes, no olives, no goat cheese and no basil garnish with a large bottle of Acqua Panna spring water. Whwn was all said and done we BOTH went through the order THREE times but there were STILL a few discrepancies. I was never offered a bottle opened for a NONscrew top so as the lady looked at me struggling thinking why would they give nonscrew top without offering to open it? I walked up and a male came to me and asked me did I need help? The same lady who took my order then came by me and asked me did I need help and I told her this was not a screw off top and sarcastically said that was I supposed to open this with my teeth. She just walked away. The guy said sorry about that and opened it. Sat down and soon after the food was brought to us by the same girl and I noticed my mother was looking extra hard at the fruit cup. I asked her what was wrong and she didn't want it... I asked her was everything okay until I saw the hair on the fruit. Totally disgusted I took it up to he kitchen and told the same girl who seemed to dismiss that there was hair on the fruit and said would you like chips instead. I got my mother her chips (at least I know that we had a better chance of it being sanitary since it was in a bag). When I finally was about to eat my pizza that was clearly on the burnt side I noticed that there was an ingredient that I specifically asked NOT to have on my pizza that was still put on my pizza. Side note my mother said the turkey sandwich was not that bad. When I came in here there was one couple and one last sitting by herself. There is no reason why this place was not spotless, better service and customer care. Future reference if you want to have a successful business the following is crucial: good customer service, CLEANLINESS, attentiveness. I will not come back. Please check your food and proceed with caution.\n\nUPDATE: I spoke with CURT(IS) and explained the whole situation. He was extremely receptive and apologetic. He also offered to reimburse me but I refused stating that maybe he could provide a free meal to someone else. Hopefully, he can get some of his staff retrained and to standard.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2Ln2Akx-QbBFo_6KsVnYcI7UhmkSkmJddUpLZ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccb4ab17fdc0f:0x18a9f59cd403b696"}

I asked for a manager from the start, and got one after repeating myself for approximately 8 minutes. He too was young and offered a poor excuse for the food, particularly the soup. He said that it probably had been out too long.

Everything went smoothly until when I received my order, I realized that two things that I had purchased were missing from my bag. I was frustrated to say the least, so I called the restaurant to have the problem fixed.\n\nI won't go into every little detail about the mess of what happened afterwards with Waitr, but I did want to give a shout out to the manager from Newks, Kayla, that helped me throughout the whole process. She really went above and beyond. Not only did she refund the money for the desserts, she also got a waitr driver back out to her restaurant,  even stayed late after they closed waiting on the driver to pick them up, and also included in an extra half sandwich for my troubles. She promptly called me back every time she had an update, answered my call every time I called, and handled to situation in the most professional and savvy way. She was the only person that saved the day and saved this situation from being an absolute disaster. THANK YOU KAYLA!!!\n\nOn a side note - Waitr is the worst, most poorly managed food delivery service company, and really service company in general, that I have ever used. They were the real problem in this whole situation and were basically running around with their heads cut off. Not to mention, this same situation had happened to me before while using the waitr app, this one just happen to top them all and be worse than anytime before. but again KAYLA SAVED THE DAY!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccb4ab17fdc0f:0x18a9f59cd403b696"}

She was the nicest person I had spoken to at Newks. Sunday was much better. I was greeted very nicely at the door so much enthusiasm especially for the morning time. Some of the servers looked very rude and like they had attitudes when you ask for anything. I luckily got the dread head server again whom remembered me from friday. She greeted us with a smile which was very warming, she is very sweet. Welcomed me back and served my food. Instead of pointing at the round table like the other server did when I asked a question she told me where I could find it and offered to bring it to me. Today the food was much better and out faster. But you really need to fix your servers attitudes and their conversations. One server smelt of marijuana and the to go area two ladies where complaining about customers all morning. I wanted to move away from that area. If you don't like your job quit!

She got a supervisor or someone in charge to tell her my issue. She was very unprofessional telling me my soup was not free and I would have to pay for it! I then explained to her that I worked daily and can pay for my soup and I didn\u2019t ask for you all to give me the soup for free! I simply asked to fix another one. When she saw I was then frustrated, she tried to \u201cclean it up\u201d! No ma\u2019am! Too late! And to make matters worse, once I drove home, I opened my soup and realized I was given less than half of the soup; which by the way was $3.99! I called the manager Sam and he did not seem to care about my issue all he kept saying was uh huh ok. No, sir! Then, I had to ask him what he was going to do about this to make sure it didn\u2019t happen again and they needed to replace my soup!

Visited Newks for the first time on Sunday between 3 and 4 pm. It was empty. Took a while before we were helped. My wife and I both ordered a sandwich and soup. We noticed almost every table had trash and food. I don't mean that in a \"every table - but really like 2\", I mean well over a dozen at least.. The hostess said, \"sorry about the mess, I haven't gotten around to it\". We sat outside and it was a disaster. I mean, I've actually never seen something so bad. We were there for over an hour and the hostess never moved. She sat on her phone and never cleaned a single table. The iced tea was not good and I was concerned about sanitation honestly.. I don't think the dispenser has ever been cleaned and I felt like drinking it might make me sick. It tasted off. The chicken salad sandwich was disappointing and the bread was very tough to bite into. The lobster bisque that I was looking forward too must have come pre-made and frozen. All I could taste was cheese. Plastic utensils and 1 napkin each, but I let that pass because it may be a COVID restriction. We had to go and ask for the bill and when I said thank you to the 3 staff working, they just looked at me with dead expressions...\n\nI'm not sure if this is normal or if this is how things run when management isn't around and just young employees are there, but I was actually appalled. Mind you, the state of the restaurant didn't bother me at first - perhaps they were swamped before we got there, but over an hour went by, with us as THE ONLY people there, and they never busted a single table. I did not take a picture because I didn't want to scare people away, but wow... I mean, wow...

I must say, \"They weren't even worth the wait! The only seasoning I could taste was the pepper. The onion rings were free due to the constant order mix-up. I'm glad cause if I had paid for them the level of disappointment would have been overwhelming. They are the low quality frozen onion rings that has the very thin supposedly sliced onion that has no onion flavor that's breaded in breading that has no flavor! I also ordered the crawfish that's boil-in-bag with potatoes,  sausage,  and corn. I imagine it would have tasted alright if I could have eaten it! There was so much grease in the bag and on the food I was afraid to try it! I don't know if the grease came from the cheap sausage that was included or if they added margarine thinking that would add flavor. The corn literally had to be rung out with paper towels before it was edible!\nAll-in-all the jewel in this experience was the waitress Ashanti! Her patience and her professionalism spoke volumes!
