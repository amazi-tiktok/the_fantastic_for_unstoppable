On the 8th day, July 6th, I called and got the \"I guess they're backed up at the lab\" story.  Then the girl told me \"I'll give you the number to the lab and you can call them and find out what the problem is\".   It would seem to me that's THEIR job not mine.  I finally got my results today July 9th at 5:15 pm. I was the one that called them! It was nine days after I'd taken the test.  The person there had the gall to tell me they tried to call me today.  I've had my phone with me all day and have no record of them calling on my recent calls log.

A Doctor called me back ( not the Dr who saw my daughter) and explained he would never have ran this test without speaking to a parent and that he saw nothing in the chart indicating an opiate test necessary. He also said I deserved an answer for this.\nAbout a half hour went by and Brittany, the office manager called me apologizing for the mistake and said this test never should have been ran. But then she retracted and stated it was protocol when a teenager comes in because \"teenagers won't tell the truth when their parents are there with them!\" This was so alarming to me. Brittany then made an ignorant statement that since my teenage child had pain in her chest that it was just their protocol to test for opiates!  I explained that ALL ages of human beings can do opiates so protocols shouldn't apply \"just\" to teenagers. Let's all keep in mind results were NEGATIVE.\nOverall, I feel this test was ran to get unnecessary funds from the insurance company and what made it worse was Brittany. She was rude, spoke over me time and time again, got so snippy with me when I was merely trying to understand why this test was ran with no consent on a MINOR.

My granddaughter had fever, sore throat and body aches.  I had severe headache and body aches as well. I had looked up and noticed AFC was open at 8am and was very thankful. (We arrived around 8:30) Only 2 cars in the parking lot at the time.  As we were signing in,  one person came out that had been seen by the NP that was on call.  I was finally taken back to be triaged and put in a room.  My daughter and granddaughter were still in waiting room for another 10 mins or so before they were taken back to be triaged and put into a room.\n\nOnce in a room, I waited for a little while and the NP came in and saw me.  She was great! She told me someone would be in to swab me for the flu and strep. Head hurting, lying on the bed...all I heard was talking and laughing coming from the nurses station.  Waited for what seemed like forever...still no one shows up to check on me.  I go to the restroom across the hall from my room and came back out to the nurses sitting at the station talking about Thanksgiving, shopping, etc. I then asked if my orders to be swabbed had been sent to them.  They all opened their laptops and said oh yes, here it is. \"Someone will be with you in a moment\".  Then a moment of silence from them and then the chattering back and forth began again.\n\nA couple of minutes later the nurse that came in was Kia, very sweet and kind.  I had not met or even saw her until she came into do the swab. She did apologize for the delay and said that she had previously been in with another patient. I laid my head back down and then texted by daughter a few minutes later and asked her if my granddaughter had been swabbed as well.  She said she had not been.  I then went back outside my door and asked if anyone had been in to swab by granddaughter and was told yes...without even giving them her name at first. My daughter heard them bold face lie to me.  I told them that I knew that no one had been in there to swab her and expected it to be done ASAP because she was very sick. A \"professional\" to lie to my face is repulsive.\n\nAgain Kia, was the nurse sent into the room to do the swab.  After the test came back on me, a totally different nurse came into the room and gave me my shots.  I never saw one of the ones sitting at the desk again.  That is where they stayed.  My granddaughter finally received her diagnosis as strep and was also given a shot.  The shot was given by Kia.\n\nWhere were all the other nurses that had nothing to do but sit around the desk and chit chat all morning?  For us being the only patients there during all of this time, it should not have taken 2 hours. I don't mind waiting at all if there is a good reason but this particular day and location, there was no reason for this to be a 2 hour visit.  This is what will happen you have a full staff on hand but only a couple of them are actually working.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1575311025373, "text": "Our manager would really like to speak with you more regarding this matter.

Checking over the antibiotic that was prescribed, I called the pharmacy where her last prescription was filled (which happened to be the exact same antibiotic for another ear infection she had).

So now I\u2019m forced to call my pediatrician back tomorrow and see if she will give another script (which I\u2019m sure insurance will not pay for again in the same week- irrelevant because I will do what I have to do to get her better).

I was told by one of the office personnel that \"for insurance plans with high deductibles we charge $100.\" In my insurance booklet from BCBS it says my Co pay for an urgent care center is $50. After telling her that we have a $300 per person deductible, she told me I was wrong and that my deductible was $7800 or $7900 which isn't true. If I could post photos of our State Employee Insurance Board book from BCBS Alabama it plainly states that we each have a $300 per person deductible per calendar year, I would. We have a $7800 Maximum out of pocket cost for one person and $14500 for a family, but she clearly stated deductible. I'm going to assume they were talking about our maximum out of pocket costs instead of deductible, but even then, that shouldn't be something that urgent care centers even consider.\n\nI went to Eastern Shore Urgent Care Center in November or December and they didn't bill me $100 for seeing the doctor. I paid a $50 copay. I am going to go back to that one even though it is out of my way. Always be sure to look at your insurance booklet and read it every year for updates. There are some doctors offices and urgent care centers that will try to charge you more.\n\nEdit: I went to Eastern Shore Urgent Care center and my co pay was $35. I called and confirmed with BCBS that my deductible isn't in the $7000s. I'm not sure if she misread my insurance or what happened, but I shouldn't have to pay extra for services that my insurance MIGHT not cover. They are basically saying that they are going to charge you extra because you may not pay your bill for services rendered so we will have an account.

However, I was told by a clinician at one of my follow up tests that the only way to get a false positive on the Abbott now protocol is if the sample is contaminated or if samples are mixed up.

I am an active duty service member. Our family is insured with Tricare Prime which covers 100%. My wife goes to this clinic because the location is convenient and the clinicians are great. Two weeks ago we received a letter from American Family Care stating that the amount of $54.66 has been sent to collection. I was shocked. Called the clinic and they give me the number for billing the department. Call the billing department and one of the lady who happened to be super rude picked up the phone after I waited 45 min told me that the amount of $54.66 we owned is the deductible. I tried to explain to her that with Tricare Prime there is no out of pocket cost at all. She told me to call Tricare and ask one of the Tricare representative to give her a call. Called Tricare, the representative from Tricare said that they are a receiving call center only, they don't make call out to other people. Asked Tricare about that $54.66, they explained to me that the billing department from AFC mess up the claim. Instead of filling the claim under my regular PCM, they filed it under another physician who wasn't a primary care physician at that time. That's why Tricare didn't process the entire claim amount. Instead of reprocess the claim, no one from AFC ever go back to take a look at the claim but instead decide to bill me the remaining amount. Tricare advise me to call AFC and make a conference call while everyone is on the line so Tricare rep can walk someone from AFC billing department through how to reprocess the claim to resolve the problem. Called back to AFC billing department and talk to someone name David. I explained the entire process to him again and he said he will make some note and transfer the case over to someone who can resolve the problem and I should expect a call back either later that day or the day after. Guess what, today is 2 weeks later and still haven't heard anything from them.

I have always appreciated the way he and his staff takes care of his patients. So yesterday 2/24/2021, I had a problem, post visit with my prescriptions getting filled. Basically the pharmacy didn't have my prescription. So when I used the telephone to call back into the doctors office, I felt like I wasn't going to be able to be helped properly. Not because of unprofessional staff or them having a desire to not help me. But because its a doctors office during a pandemic on top of already taking care of patients.\nSo I went online and began reading reviews. One response I kept reading was \"did you try messaging us on social media or direct thru our website\"? So that was what I decided to do. Now it was after 6pm when I messaged and just a few hours later I got a response. You may think getting a response at 9pm seems bad, but let me tell you. When your in need of help, getting a response at 9pm let me know that Go medical is taking care of their patients.\nSo now here we are at 930am the following morning and my problem has been resolved.

In the beginning I was heard, I was treated for my conditions, everything was going fine in my life other than one issue.(5\u2b50\ufe0f then) Until my last appointment, I didn\u2019t even see Dr.Go after being told that\u2019s who I would be seeing that day. I seen a Np that knows NOTHING about me or my conditions & who was rude and kept cutting me off, wouldn\u2019t even listen to what I had to say, She was hateful to me both times I was seen by her. She laughed at my concerns the first time. The second time she treated me like a liar and someone just fishing w/out allowing me to talk to inform her on what Dr. Go and I had discussed about MY issues and what actions we had taken so far. She admitted that she didn\u2019t know what my apt was even for. Dr. Go stopped one RX, that is REALLY dangerous to just quit prescribing to a patient \u201cCold Turkey.\u201d It states on the FDA website,& medical professionals that tapering IS necessary, I wasn\u2019t tapered at all. I wasn\u2019t I informed at my previous appointment with Dr. Go that I would no longer receive this RX. I didn\u2019t even get my own choice on which I believed my body/mind needed more to have quality of life. Along with the only testing/imaging that was ever ordered was ultrasound and CT which my disease won\u2019t show up on neither one of those as that has been proven by many other medical experts. Nothing further was even discussed to get an accurate diagnoses. Sent me for a CT with dye knowingly that I have a allergy to contrast dye and I had to be treated at the ER because of this and have my husband come 30 miles away to drive me b/c they didn\u2019t check my chart before ordering the scan. Dr. Go has always treated me w/respect and mostly listened to concerns. There was a few times I felt like he was only concerned about a symptom we\u2019ve already discussed when I had multiple concerns that was never addressed. I paid $70 copay to be seen every time besides once therefore I should see Dr. Go. He did help me for 6+ months, especially with my anxiety, etc, but now that my anxiety meds was removed w/o me even being informed my anxiety is @ it\u2019s worse since I lost my dad & two miscarriages this past year. If I was told last month, I could of tapered myself knowing that you need to safely be tapered from any barbiturate. So I felt reeled in at the start. I didn\u2019t break any rules or anything to cause this, either. My first apt I went I was told I would be seeing DR. Go, I didn\u2019t see him that day either. That day was with another NP, Dr. McDaniel, who I DO recommend if you go and have to see a NP. She truly did listen to my concerns and try her best to treat me in the best way allowed, I\u2019d solely give her a star alone, but again I was told by the front that day I\u2019d be seeing Dr. Go & didn't. Normally most DRs would have you come back in two/four weeks to monitor how the meds are working/if they need to be adjusted/changed, to check on how you\u2019re doing with them.  I was really disappointed in the care I received from the office my last visit. I\u2019ve been referring a lot of people to this office, but now I\u2019m unsure if that\u2019s the right thing to do. I truly hope this was just a mistake on the NP side & when I do go back I can see DR GO HIMSELF & discuss options or I will be looking for a different PCP to receive the help to accommodate me. I truly don\u2019t want to do that, but I don\u2019t want to continue to throw away $70 with nothing accomplished, really. MOST of the staff has good bedside manner,a few that could use more discipline as JOKING ab patients after they leave & their private health info is very unprofessional.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nUpdate: to the response, thank you for replying. I am not meaning my review to be hateful. I\u2019m adding a star since you took the time to look into this for me and replied. I have been satisfied the care I\u2019ve received prior to this day, that\u2019s why I said I didn\u2019t want to change PCP without seeing Dr. Go first to tell him how I am feeling about my last appointment.

I believe there were one or two nurses working, but a woman (albeit a very nice and helpful woman who did her job, or rather someone else's job, well) who's badge said Radiology Tech performed all nurse duties other than blood draw and throat swab. I spent most of the visit wishing I had gone / thinking about going somewhere else. I grew up in Vestavia, and this was one of many poor experiences I've had at that location over the years. About 10 years ago I had a nurse insert the blood draw needle upside down! Meaning, she put it in to where the tip of the needle was pointing towards my wrist. Absurd. I was right near it and looking for a urgent care when I went in this week. It didn't take me long to remember why I stopped going there. Also, I've read multiple negative reviews about Dr. Brentnall, and I'm here to add another. I was there with a cold and an unrelated YI. He asked me, \"Well, about that, we can't still get in to see our lady doctor, right?\" It was very dismissive, rude, and awkward. He really didn't pay any attention to what I had to say. He ordered a step test when I had clearly explained I knew the only reason my throat hurt was sinus drainage. The only thing he did listen to was my self-diagnoses. After much wasted time and unnecessary labs, he came in with a prescription for an upper respiratory infection and a YI - exactly what I told him I thought I had.  Overall, he made me uncomfortable and wishing I'd seen any doctor but him. Spare yourself, don't go to this office!

This was a truly baffling experience, and you should only come here if you want you symptoms ignored or to be immediately referred to an allergy specialist for cold / strep throat symptoms.\n\nHere's a quick list of things that Dr. Brentnall did or said to prevent me from ever coming back here again. I came in after my cold symptoms worsened for 5 days with no sign of improvement plus I had developed a bad sore throat and dizziness:\n\n- He treated me like a child. He grabs the instrument to look in my mouth, ears, and nose. He stares at me for a second then says, \"I can see better if you open your mouth.\" Are you serious?? How about you ask me to open my mouth? For all I know you're going for my nose!\n- \"your nose is red. Looks like you're bothered by the ragweed\". Proceeds to talk about an allergist he recommends and a medication etc. I have had allergies since I was 13, and they are under control. I know what allergies are, and this is not allergies. How about my nose is red because I've had COLD SYMPTOMS FOR 5 DAYS!?\n- He never asks about my symptoms. I had to force them on him by blurting them out when he walks in for the 4th or 5th time he's come in the room (usually to talk about allergies some more). He dismissed them all as either being allergies, my IBS (which is also under control), or a side effect of medication I've been taking for 6 YEARS! I have never had a negative reaction to this medication. I know it can start at any time, but what are the odds of all of these things happening at once rather than I actually have a bad cold, or the flu, or something else?!\n- He sat on the bed with me twice.... I was very uncomfortable. He should have grabbed a chair since there were practically no other patients in the entire office.\n- I cannot count the number of times he talked about allergies or particles in the air.\n- He tried to trick me into taking allergy medication. He vaguely described what it was when he listed the meds, and never said it was for allergies. I only found out when the pharmacist mentioned it. I already take a daily OTC allergy medication. I DO NOT HAVE AN ALLERGY PROBLEM!\n\nI'm really curious to know if he treats all of his patients this way or if it is just the female patients. Also, does he get some kind of kick back from the number of people he refers to this allergist?? My boyfriend and I left that place completely furious. Every time Dr. Brentnall left the room, we would rant to each other. I believe the staff could hear us through the door each time, and I really hope they did.\n\nI will say the only positive was the pharmacist. She was knowledgeable yet eager to learn when I told her I needed gluten free medications due to celiac. And there was no way I was going to get that allergy medication filled.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889220ea1374f87:0xf88c51cd3ebb99d0"}

The pain finally got so bad that it is shooting up his leg and he is having trouble walking so he decided he had to go. The appointment was a little over $180. The nurses didn't know how to use the computer system. They asked him the same questions and what his name was over and over. One of the nurses smelled so badly of body odor that I could smell her as I was following her down the hall. My friend was gagging while she attempted to take his blood pressure. It took several tries. Finally, we got into a room. The doctor (Caroline Feist) came in and asked what the problem was. She seemed skeptical like she did not believe him. I'm sure she sees many people seeking pain meds and is therefore skeptical, but he never asked for pain pills. He described the problem and how it was affecting his job and how it developed. She touched the area of his foot, lightly, with two fingers (no thorough exam) and sent him to get x-rays. Once the x-rays came back, she told him they didn't show anything and that there were many reasons he could be in pain (she didn't say what any of these reasons were). He asked what he should do: sturdy shoes, orthotics, compression, ice? She said to do whatever he would like to do, wrote him a prescription for anti-inflammatories, and said to go see his primary care physician. He can't afford another doctor visit. Now he has lost a day's wages plus $180 for nothing and will not be able to pay his bills. Dr. Feist demonstrated a lack of empathy and professionalism and strong skepticism throughout the visit.

I was very sick. I had been vomiting all morning and was extremely weak. I asked if I could lay down somewhere. The ladies at the front desk kindly showed me to the back treatment area where I could rest until my name was called.( I have never been that sick and never would\u2019ve asked to lay down unless I was about to pass out. People shouldn\u2019t make it a habit to ask to lay down somewhere is my point.)I was checked on periodically and offered some water. The nurses and doctor were all very kind and thorough. I was diagnosed with Strep, and had them send my prescriptions over to USave Pharmacy at the front of the building. The Pharmacist was nice and quick as always. So, overall my experience at AFC was great. Even though there were probably about 27 people in front of me when I signed in at 11:15, I was still treated far better than any other ER or urgent care place would\u2019ve in that situation. Clearly they were swamped with patients, but everyone was still pleasant and thorough. This location is always clean and everyone is always nice and helpful.

When I called my insurance on the advice of AFC and they told me that AFC had billed it under a depressive disorder (I only went in for regular lab work), which is covered under another section of my insurance.  The woman even told me that they'd told AFC that they'd billed it wrong and what to do, but they never did correct it.  So, I told AFC billing dept what the insurance company had told me and what they needed to do.  I didn't hear anything else, so I thought they'd taken care of it.  Nope.  They sent it to collections!  So I called them back and explained again, and the first person got an attitude and said they couldn't rebill because they already had done it once.  Which I know is BS.  So I asked to speak with the supervisor, who was rude and hung up on me after she asked me to verify my insurance #.  Anyway, I don't have the time to deal with it, so I paid the collection for that date.  Now, I've received another bill for the same date and due amount.  I haven't been to AFC in over a year, and I will not be back.  This is a $160 bill, whereas the original should have been maybe $30 max, and I've already paid it.

I've only had issue with one, and I refuse to see her again.  The front desk staff and billing departments are horrible.  My latest fiasco is billing that they billed incorrectly for 2013.  When I called my insurance on the advice of AFC and they told me that AFC had billed it under a depressive disorder (I only went in for regular lab work), which is covered under another section of my insurance.  The woman even told me that they'd told AFC that they'd billed it wrong and what to do, but they never did correct it.  So, I told AFC billing dept what the insurance company had told me and what they needed to do.  I didn't hear anything else, so I thought they'd taken care of it.  Nope.  They sent it to collections!  So I called them back and explained again, and the first person got an attitude and said they couldn't rebill because they already had done it once.  Which I know is BS.  So I asked to speak with the supervisor, who was rude and hung up on me after she asked me to verify my insurance #.  Anyway, I don't have the time to deal with it, so I paid the collection for that date.  Now, I've received another bill for the same date and due amount.  I haven't been to AFC in over a year, and I will not be back.  This is a $160 bill, whereas the original should have been maybe $30 max, and I've already paid it.

However, I have been seriously disappointed the last few times I've been to this facility. First and foremost, the Friday before Easter, I was ill and needed to come in for antibiotics. My fiance and I arrived at 7:15 only to find them closed. AFC used to be quick- in and out in an hour. As I write this I've been sitting here for an hour in the lobby. Haven't even been called back to triage or a room yet. Not to mention, when I checked in and paid my copay the receptionist tried to discourage me from being seen. \"If you get tired of waiting, we will refund your money.\" I asked if there was a long wait, she stated that the doctor was only seeing seven patients at a time and that there were seven in the back already and \"five thousand\" in the lobby. After this, I watched the same receptionist pseudo turn away three more people, discouraging them to check in because of the \"long wait\". All three left, one a teenage girl with her mother, limping and in tears. If people come here, they obviously have a reason. This is a facility that is designated to help ill and injured people, and if that impedes your off time, then so be it. Most people in the working world have to stay late from time to time. Good workers still do their job. Also, the doctor may only be seeing 7 patients at a time, but there are more than 7 rooms in the facility. Instead of having people that are already unwell sit in the uncomfortable lobby chairs for hours at a time, they could move people to the vacant rooms so they could be more comfortable. Even still, this location always seems to be this busy so why on earth is there only one doctor on staff? Makes no sense. The last few times I have been in this facility for either me or my fiance, we have had to wait for at least two hours. There was one occasion that we didn't get out until almost 10pm, at which point I would have had to drive 25 minutes to get to a pharmacy that would be open and able to fill my scripts. I've been to Shelby ER and have been taken to a room faster than this. More to follow....\n\nUpdate: 1.5 hours. Still in the waiting room. Still with two patients in front of me.\n\nBack in a room. Angelise triaged me. She's a doll. Best part of this experience so far. She has great communication skills and was still upbeat even with it being 8:45 by the time I was triaged.\n\nTook me another hour to see the doctor, Dr. Habert. I could tell what the holdup was when he spent a lot of time chatting with us in the room. I didn't mind that so much. Its better than seing a doctor for less than a minute when you wait for hours. What I did mind was being told that my diagnosis, walking pneumonia, was a result of dairy products. Now, to be clear, I didn't have an issue with this and I heard him out at the time, but by the time I got home, I researched it, and couldn't find any correlation or any research to support his statements... He was very nice and had a great bedside manner. But maybe we shouldn't be misinforming patients?

My grandmother had fell causing her lip to bust open and was in need of stitches, so this medical facility was the closest and hopefully cheapest choice, But on arrival i was treated with such disrespect. I checked her in and give the nurses my grandmothers information and helped her back, but i wasn't allowed any further, so I go to wait in the lobby and waited for an hour. I go to ask how my grandmother is doing but the nurses acted like they didnt know what i was talking about so i ask how much longer was it going to be and they ignored me so i go back to sit and waited for another hour. I go up to ask about my grandmother again only to be given the same response as before, I get frustrated so i go out to check on my car, and as i was trying to come back to the lobby the doors were locked. I was locked out in the cold and had no idea what condition my grandmother was in so I knocked on the door until a nurse noticed and she just stood there staring at me. I wave her over but she ignored me and went back behind her desk.I dont know why i was treated like this but i can only come up with that my skin color wasn't white (all the nurses were white). It was 15 degrees out so i went back and waited in my car. A few minutes go by i see a cop car come by and he parks in front of the building like he got a call, and then i see him looking around the whole building for somebody (im guessing me). But i stay in my vehicle until he leaves. After all that i see my grandmother finally come out after 4 hours of waiting. Again i illiterate: i dont know why they treated me like a second class citizen but i guess its cause im not white.\n\nIn summary: This medical facility locked me out and called the police on me for my skin color.

I had what most would call a toothache. I, however,  called it the forces of nature trying to rip out my insides through a small opening in my exposed gum.  Anyway, I am also a Medicare patient who cannot just up and make an appointment with a dentist or oral surgeon like everyone else.  I have to get any dental procedures approved through Medicare, which by the way doesn't happen the same day (usually a 72 hour turn around, even then you are not guaranteed approval).  I had an infection and had eaten an entire bottle of 20 Alleve in about 48 hours.  I entered the facility expecting just average level of concern and kindness.  What I encountered when I got there was anything but that!  The front office staff was so nice and professional!  However, the best was yet to come!  The nurse who called me back and took my vitals was just such a lovely young woman. The EPITOME of professional, kind and sympathetic that one would look for while in pain visiting ANY doctor's office, but often never receiving.   Then, Dr. Pike entered the room.  I have seen Dr. Pike before while I was sick, and he was always professional.  Maybe, I am being swayed by the amount of discomfort I was in, but this doctor acted as if he were a concerned family member!!    I was SO IMPRESSED WITH MY VISIT FROM THE SECOND I ENTERED THE BUILDING UNTIL I LEFT!  I do have a PCP who practices several cities away.

So I was being given two shots as treatment YET NO LABS HAD BEEN DONE. SO what exactly what she treating me for? Strange to recieve shots before labs....and then she never even came back in the room...the medical assistant walked in and mumbled something about take your meds and went to leave. I had to stop him and ask him what medications I was given and what my test results were. He then had to go and ask the NP and try to get an answer and came back and mumbled ok follow me...next thing i knew i was being pushed out the door and i had no idea what meds i was given or where to pick them up. I stopped him and he had to go back and ask the NP AGAIN....all of this could have been prevented had she seen me and given me the results to begin with like a dr should. he comes back 20 min later and tells me that my meds got sent to calera and they got them changed to alabaster. only thing i was given was a Zpack. i was miserable for several days and could not sleep so i finally went to another urgent care and recieved the care i needed. I was also told I had a raging UTI and that zpac would not touch it....so they gave me Bactrim....so the NP ran all these tests on me and even my urine but didnt follow through.  I will not be back.

If you're sick, don't bother going here. I went in at about 11:00 and I was the only patient in the lobby. I signed in and paid my $20 copay the woman at the desk insisted I had to pay, even though my insurance card (which I handed her to look at) says \"copay $0\"). I am brought back pretty quickly by a nurse who takes my vitals and I have a low grade fever. I get seated and the doctor comes in decently quick, but she is cold and seems to be standoffish. I tell her my symptoms and she looks at my ears, throat, and listens to my breathing. She quickly orders the flu test and walks out. The nurse student says that the test will take about 15 minutes and she swabs my nose. I wait for a total of 48 minutes until some other nurse walks in, hands me a paper that says Influenza Type A on it and tells me to read it. She then walks right back out without seeing if I had questions (which I did!). While I waited, I could hear the nurses and doctors sitting there talking about their lunch plans and weekend plans, not doing their jobs. Also, after about 20 minutes of sitting in the room, I hear the nurses start talking about how my flu test was positive, and they were being super loud about it. That is a HIPPA violation! I then wait another 15 minutes for the student nurse to walk back in and give me my perscriptions and school excuse. Not once did anyone bother to come in and tell me I had the flu and bronchitis or to see if I had any questions. On top of it all, I heard the doctors outside my door arguing about whether or not I could continue to take the Tamiflu with my iron pills, and they still never told me if I should or should not take the Tamiflu and my iron pills. These doctors couldn't even tell me if my medications would conflict or react with the perscriptions they gave me! Overall, my experience was unprofessional, excessively long, and completely rubbish.

He Check my ears, nose, and lungs and told me I had drainage that was making my throat hurt.  He never looked in my throat.  He gave me a steroid shot and a week of amoxicillin. Over the next days I got worse.  After visiting another doctor, it was determined  that I had a bacteria in my esophagus and needed to be treated with a different class of an antibiotic.  Here is my review:  after a $50 co-pay, the doctor spent less than 2 minutes with me, doing a very poor job of considering all the possibilities for my sore throats and just treating me like I had a sinus problem.  He never looked at the back of my throat to see that it was not inflamed and the problem with further down in my esophagus.  I will never go back.  If you choose to use AFC, be sure you get the doctor attention to look at all possibilities as to the cause of your illness.  The doctor is working for you.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2c6dd61bec35:0x1413ff6eeaff2401"}
