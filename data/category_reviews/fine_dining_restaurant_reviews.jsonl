In the past 3 weeks, we have enjoyed breakfast/brunch out 4 times - Grille on Main, local self serve bakery, and a meat and 3 cafe.  Unfortunately the Grille on Main was the worst food of the 4 yet the most expensive.  The eggs Benedict were marginal in taste and not hot.  The ham and cheese omelet was almost missing the ham and cheese - very stingy with the ingredients and not much flavor from a normally flavorable cheese.  If you want biscuits, you can get 4 for $5.  They were probably the best part of our meal.  The skillet cinnamon roll was a miss - not hot enough the melt the icing. The Cobb salad was not much bigger than a side salad at most restaurants but it was densely packed and good flavor - just on the small side. Grille 29 that was in this location was superb and we were hoping this would continue the tradition of a great place for ambience, food, romantic dinners, etc.  Unfortunately that was not the case for us.

The cole slaw also wasn't interesting. I did like the cooked spinach. It was very good. Don't waste your calories on dessert. The pineapple, upside down, carrot cake was terrible. Carrot cake should always have cream cheese icing. This did not and was very squishy without much flavor.
