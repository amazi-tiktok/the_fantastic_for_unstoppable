Was a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews but thought would give it a try.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised.  I called.to make a appt for a other day as it was late.  They said they had a table open so I went on in.  The place is in a small strip mall but most of them here in Huntsville are.  Once you get inside looks like most small massage places.  I have included a few pictures from their website as they are accurate of what you actually see.\n\nThe lady was very nice and very professional.  She gave me a very relaxing massage.  I would have like a little more work on my neck but I did say anything as I wanted to just see what was their normal.  Only other improvement I can think of is she did not do the front of my legs at all.  Since I do alot of lifting and crawling around that is always a sore spot.  But over all I left feeling very relaxed.\n\nI did opt for the shower table as some recommended to get the oil off.  Again very professional and make sure \"everything\" that needed to be covered stayed covered.  Thought it might be awkward but the way she did it made it feel very professional so really did not even think about it.\n\nThe only real negative I can say is the same as of other peoples reviews.  They leave the door slightly open so anyone walking by can see in.  I understand from a security view but the walls are paper thin (like most every other place you get a massage) so you can hear everything so I do not really see that the pros outway the cons for doing this.  I could not really relax and although I really like this place it was the reason for 4 stars vs 5 stars.  It also would be the one thing that made me look somewhere else \u2639.\n\nAlso one note since it came up in some of the other reviews.  No one pressured or even asked me for a tip.  I did give her one as she did a good job but she never asked.  The only thing they asked was if I would like a 4 hand massage (I only booked a 60 min) and when I said not tonight that was that.\n\nOver all a great place and so far I recommend it for a great relaxing massage if you dont mind everyone that walks by your door seeing in \ud83e\uddd0.\n\nWill update if I go back.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOA1FbHtCamDoFPPdQMGkYztFVFx2ThZNK83lYB=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzJSml9LE8V6WWeNTZyOMMsnBursNL_BGv5fqt=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNHV4HZpfhPDmPBQ9S1sMAcpQGLrFHWfO65-f7=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1590289416354, "text": "Hello, Terrell.

I travel to the Birmingham area for work once a month and was looking for a gym/box that has hours on Sunday.  I had heard some not-so-great things about a few boxes but I hadn't heard of Forge Fitness/ CF Shades.  Not only is CF Shades the only place with Sunday hours, but they were above and beyond wonderfully welcoming when I showed up unannounced during their open gym period.  Upon first glance, the gym was very clean, which is not very common among CrossFit and Crossfit-inspired facilities.  The owner, Rich, jumped up from a staff meeting and gave me a tour and after learning of my CF history, invited me to use any and all of their space as well as invited me back through my duration of stay while in town.  They have an awesome workout space out back with a platform, squat racks and a rig and the running course around the building is super safe.  I also met coaches Caleb, Josh and Rebecca who were all very accommodating and friendly.  When I returned for a class, Rebecca coached and I really appreciated her attentiveness.  I'm a CrossFit coach in Denver and because I move relatively well, I tend to get left alone - but I love being coached when I drop into new places and Rebecca was great.

{"user_id": "103804845592874345668", "name": "Tera Shade", "time": 1393167773078, "rating": 5.0, "text": "In response to the \"1 star\" review written 3 years ago.  I responded 2 days after it posted but it never showed up, so I'll try again with my response...When this review was first posted the person included her name (it has since been changed to \"anonymous\").  I called the reviewer and inquired about her time spent at Bliss.  You see, I am the owner and very concerned about our reputation and our guests experience.  I believe the following information will help you decided if you want to take this reviewer seriously.   Let me begin by saying this reviewer called late in the day to make an appointment to have her hair cut.  Even though we were booked until closing time, one of my stylist agreed to stay late and take the appointment.  The two employees behind the desk greeted this reviewer, offered her something to drink, and informed the stylist of her arrival.  Because it was now after closing time, the two front desk employees left for the day.  This reviewer was not left alone or ignored at any time.  The stylist who volunteered to stay late, finished with the client she was with and was on time for this reviewers scheduled appointment.  This reviewer had her hair shampooed, had more of a trim than a cut, and blown out.  She was charged $15.  Her comment about being charged three times what she should have been charged... Well, I don't know where a woman can get her hair shampooed, cut/trimmed, and blown out for $5.  She did say she was new to the area, so maybe she could get the above service done for $5 where ever she moved from...Just to be clear, Bliss does not offer shampoos, haircuts, and styles for $5....  I noticed she did not mention the amount she was charged.   Could it have been she as embarrassed to admit that she thought $15 was \"three times more than what it should have been.\" Because this reviewer posted this review under her name and because we had her phone number on file, I called and inquired about her time at Bliss.  I stated I was the owner and was making follow up calls with our new clients.  I did not  mention I had read her review but instead asked how she enjoyed her visit with us.  I gave her every opportunity to relate any unpleasant experience she might have had.  I was told that Bliss is a beautiful place and was thanked for taking her appointment on such short notice and after hours.  When asked how she like her hair cut even thought it really was only a trim, she responded \"I like it, she did a good job.\" During our conversation, she never said anything negative about her visit at Bliss, and when I invited her to return in the future she said she would.  To be honest, she has not returned .  I wish she had given us another chance so that she could experience what Bliss is really about.  I would also like to respond to the comment about the service being done half-hearted and with no conversation.  The stylist's mother had just passed away very unexpectedly two weeks earlier.  She was still mourning her loss but trying to live as normal as possible and continue to work and support herself.  While this reviewer had no clue what was happening in our stylist personal life, I think because of the comment she made in her review for all to read, its important for you to know why our stylist was not her usual outgoing friendly self.   I am very interested in making each client feel welcome and appreciated.  I personally follow up with as many clients as possible to make sure that their time at Bliss was relaxing and that they are satisfied with their service.  I know this has been a lot to read, but I wanted to give a little more information about the above review.  I am sure I am not the only business owner that is willing to go above and beyond what is normal to make their guest happy.  If something is not what you are expecting, please let us know.  Give us the opportunity to \"fix\" it.  Our guest are the reason we even have a business and we understand that, without \"you\" we wouldn't be here.  We look forward to seeing you and making you feel \"special\" like the person you are!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d61a6391ccb:0x7321ebb76dd3fc84"}

I was going came in town to visit for a month after traveling for 3 months straight.  He thought this would be a good idea for me to relax.  When I received the groupon via email,  I called to schedule an appointment (as suggested on the voucher) but I just got the voicemail.  I called a few times over the next couple days because I actually wanted to talk to a person.  But after no response, I followed the instructions from the voicemail, which was to go online to check availability.  Only to find out that the next available day was in September 2017 (4 months later).  I immediately tried to call groupon to get a refund, because I definitely didn't want to wait 4 months for a massage.  However, Groupon was not able to refund me because it was day 4 since he purchased the Groupon.  They have a policy of a 3 day return.  They were not understanding and didn't care to hear my story.  I decided to try calling LeAnne again, but of course there was no answer.  I left numerous messages and she finally called my back 3 days later.  When she called, my intent was to explain my story to her and advise her I would be there for the next month to see if she could squeeze me in anytime within the next few weeks.  She said rudely said she couldn't and advise me to tell my boyfriend to give the groupon to someone else to use.  I made a suggestion to her to possibly disable her Groupon option until she's caught up, because I'm sure I am not the only potential long term customer with the issue.  She proceeded to rudely yell and tell me that she's backed up because of Mother's day and she doesn't need anyone telling her how to run her business.  Ironically this is the same place I purchased a Groupon for my boyfriend (with a different person) and he had a great experience.  Which is why he decided to do the same for me.  At the end of the day I will never give this place my money again and I will tell everyone I can the same.  My boyfriend basically, gave away money.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1499299292810, "text": "I am sorry that this person feels this way. I do stay booked out anywhere from 10-14 weeks in general for new clients.  I called the person back as soon as she left a voicemail. I explained to her that if she calls and doesn't leave a voicemail that we don't know someone has called. The client wanted to know about how much money I make and I did tell her it was none of her business as it was also none of her business my relationship with Groupon which stands at 4.7 stars out of 5. I am sorry she feels this is rude, but I find it extremely rude for a stranger to try and tell me how to run my business. As a self employed person not having an opening 2-3 months out  means that I am employed, and that is a good thing. Groupon helps bring new clients in that I hope will become regular clients. I stay booked and I can't fit someone in because they are only going to be in town for a short time that just is what it is. That wouldn't be fair to all the people who wait the standard time for the great deal that Groupon is and I have done over 1500 Groupon massages in the last 3+ years. The person  begins the complaint by saying she was only going to be in town for a month and then talks about how she wouldn't be coming back. If she is only visiting for a short time it sounds like she wouldn't be coming back anyway. I find that most people who leave bad reviews it is because they couldn't bully their way into getting their way and try and get me breaking tmy best practices and rules. The fine print of the Groupn says by availability only. My schedule is online for the whole world to see. The lady wanted me to give her a refund and I told her no bc she didn't buy anything from me she bought a product from Groupon and I do not get all the money from the product. The woman then started asking how much I make  and that was when I told her it was none of her business which it wasn't. Being a therapist who is booked out means I am good at what I do. Groupon is to bring in new clients, not for your next day massage. I tried to help her and offer suggestions but she just wanted to be mad."}, "gmap_id": "0x888c297d793fa07b:0x75b689bc0f9acea4"}

When a client is 20, not 10 minutes late it is my policy to consider them a no show. This was the second of a 2 massage Groupon deal, and the client states she got a great massage the first time. To give me 1 star because I upheld the company policy of not giving away free massages when people do not follow instructions is her prerogative, but she is the one missing out on great massages, and as for our hours of operation, I am a massage therapist of 20 years experience so no I don't work late or on the weekend, I work 9-5 like most working people because I too have a family to take care of.
