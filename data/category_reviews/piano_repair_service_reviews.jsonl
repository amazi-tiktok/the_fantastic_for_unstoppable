My wife and I purchased a baby grand piano from this loving and welcoming establishment in September  of 2017. After having the instrument in our home for 4 months 2 keys at the very far end of the piano were sticking. I called Mr. Ellis told him the problem and he sent out a professional to fix it in a very timely manner. Not only did they fix the 30 second minor problem Mr. Ellis had my piano tuned at no expense to us. If that is not customer service I don't know what is. If anyone who reads this post is contemplating purchasing a piano please please please rest assure from the time you meet Mr. Ellis, his sons, and the staff that work there, you will be well taken care of. These people are genuine from the word go. They will assist you if you know absolutely nothing about  a piano to help you find the right instrument for you.

Purchasing a piano is a matter of very personal taste and preference...what matters most to David Ellis and his sons is quite simply whatever matters most to you.  My husband recently surprised me by taking me to Ellis to pick out the piano of my dreams.  While they could have pushed me to purchase on the spot, they did exactly the opposite and accommodated me on multiple visits to make certain I went home with the instrument I not only liked....but with which I fell in love (as did my husband).  They went out of their way to educate us about the instruments and encouraged me not to settle.  Not once did I feel pushed to make a purchase.  David and his sons knew this was a very special gift from my husband and they went above and beyond to make sure it was all he wanted for me...and all I wanted as well.  The Ellis family knows pianos, they know the value of a good investment, they know the value of superior customer service, they are approachable and meet every pianist on their level - from the young child just beginning lessons to the most accomplished world-renown performers and everyone in between and they treat them all with the same utmost care and respect.  When you select a piano from Ellis, you receive not only a stellar instrument suited just for you, but also the benefit of a family legacy based on fulfilling musicians\u2019 dreams.  If you\u2019re in the market for a piano, question no further where you should go...Ellis Piano is your answer.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a3544961c1:0x4e608e6bb337b439"}
