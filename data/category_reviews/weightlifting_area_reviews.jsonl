This gym is well organized and sectioned (cardio area, dumbbell-bodybuilding area, and powerlifting area), with all kinds of bars and equipment you can think of. I was visiting Tuscaloosa for a week (hi from Mount Oread) and lucky enough to find this place - bought a week pass and enjoyed every single day training there. If you like lifting weights, heavy or light, look no further \u2013 this is the place.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1533600069057, "text": "Thank you so much for the kind review.

Strong has all the equipment you'd want for powerlifting (and other sports, but I'm a powerlifter, so I'm not as familiar with the others): cages, platforms, combo racks, barbells galore, bumper plates, you name it. The gym is well-worn (i.e. people actually use it) but stays nice and clean. Chalk is allowed and stays cleaned up. The owner (Charlie Lyons) is super helpful and the USPA AL state chair. I was a recent newcomer and welcomed by the crowd; the community is excellent. Rates are great. 24/7 access is super convenient. The women's bathroom area has plenty of room to stretch, which I also like; I prefer not to stretch in the middle of the gym. It's fun being in a gym where you see people lifting 500+ lb every time you go in.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1547660943837, "text": "Thank you!"}, "gmap_id": "0x88861d3510c2c091:0x471ae4b1ae249bf2"}
