The boutique/ gift shop is a very welcoming space, bright and open.\n\nI arrived with ideas to purchase but the customer service was limited. After more than few minutes, someone asked if I needed assistance and unfortunately, it was a bit rushed. They were working with another customer when they asked.\n\nI wandered around the store, I think, about 10 - 15 minutes. I didn't have a lot of time, so I wasn't able to wait until they finished with the other customer.  There was only one person available for customer service, but it looked as though they were preparing for an event, I saw tables outside and the door was open when I arrived.\n\nThere's an array of wines, gourmet food and truffles just to name a few reasons to check this place out. I had my eye on a couple of things so I'll definitely be back when I have time to linger and browse.\n\nI didn't have an opportunity to ask about the wine tastings or the personal consults for gift baskets because of the limited service. It's easy enough to check their website for the classes and there's plenty of time to check back for basket ideas.\n\nIt's a great place to get gifts for family, friends or co-workers.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-5ZFNFaapcS3tx93Ruwhux7aE_N2RXgEjO_qq=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtah4rBijkCp_Kp3rk7tm0VKeGaj1qAJRBdvYV=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP32NkXSmibKvHUPr8KzEDEsNkMe9deczmAydGR=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPa_k7YsM3aJCMZIe4CducOPwxZ0WHSMh22YtZy=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6gHyv2WISwD8cGd_PseUxk-cgcRT4LUKglDiZ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNuXbKDvNmz5w38LaQ-pEEFdeCWrh9Us8TAoY6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvkUGT2Ka65vOyMekjnkgv7ImjIHq9L7oBgGBw=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMetblD9v_JvFIi3ZyMGfW6Zo-V2YhPSPbL1cij=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmoYQjxT4-WaomrWMUblTmd61z4VaVqbRnUxgK=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOav1b93YvXmcQ0Hb-D6er4jmoJKA0aId1GgZPo=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKhnkiZMImx7PcA-RKCCWp_AqdYVvWa8mXlndP=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODZl1hLyM3im5JjbrvTZ4JEGpsqMTWSNmB4Gp-=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb32c0847c87b:0x6354c7ecf71c4ea4"}

My wife and I are not in Auburn so we chose this company to deliver an arrangement for Valentines Day for my mother-in-law in Opelika. We ordered a higher dollar item other than the lower priced special. Specifically for the reason of having more fruit and less chocolate as we were hoping for something a bit healthier because of health issues. They charged our credit card for the higher priced item we ordered but delivered the lower price special with added chocolate and it was a smaller item. In addition to the wrong item - they did not deliver it on Valentines Day. We called several times and they acted nice at first and promised to deliver the item the next day. Late in the day mom called and said it was never delivered. We called back and it was being delivered late in the day - a day late - and it was the wrong item, not the higher priced one we paid for.\n\nWe called again and one of the employees admitted they went to the wrong house on Valentines day so somebody got the higher priced item. My wife called again to at least get a refund for the overcharged amount or to have the right item delivered. We were promised the right item would be delivered. The next day, no delivery.\n\nAt this point, several days after Valentines Day my wife gave up so I started calling, was promised a refund or a deliver of the right item. There was no refund or proper delivery. I was then promised at least a call back from the owner, then another promise, another promised call back. I never heard back.\n\nMy mother in law never received the correct item and and we never got the refund. We finally tried to cancel payment with credit card and to get a refund but they disputed it - said that the item was delivered. Did not mention that it was the wrong item, and that it was late, missing Valentines Day. I'm sorry that they delivered the item, possibly twice, to the wrong house, and then the wrong item to the right address. That's three deliveries, three trips, three items. However, those mistakes are not our fault. All I know is that my mother in law never received what was ordered.\n\nI would not recommend this company to another person.\n\nI would probably have written a different review if the owner would have called me back as promised by the several employees.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2ce2392dbe3:0xba2152bd50d19c00"}

Some of the small roses that were in the arrangement were broken when I picked it up. There was green floral tape around the top rim of the vase which could have been easily concealed with a nice ribbon. It was so much green foam in the bottom of the small sized vase. That may be why the flowers aren\u2019t lasting as they don\u2019t have enough room and are poorly cut and crammed in. We put the few flowers that we could salvage in a larger vase. It\u2019s unfortunate that I paid $66 dollars for an arrangement that my mother will only get to enjoy for a few days. I have Walmart flower bouquets that are outlasting these. I usually buy special occasion flowers from Publix at a cheaper price and better quality work, but I wanted to patronize Ferguson\u2019s florist because they are a locally owned business.

Again, my delivery went unreceived.\nSunday, I called the store all day, always reaching a busy tone, but felt confident that the company would at the very LEAST deliver my order first thing that morning, despite it already being two days late. No such luck.\nFINALLY today, three days after my intended delivery date, I was able to get ahold at someone at the store and let them know that I was displeased to say the least, and would like my order to still be delivered but would like the delivery fee refunded, as it did not arrive the day it should have. The person on the phone then said he cancelled my order completely (although I have yet to receive a refund), rang up another order, and charged my card AGAIN for the amount of the basket. By now, there has been $200+ worth of charges put on my card. But hey, they offered to give my mom a free box with 6 chocolate strawberries to make up for it.\nAfter speaking with my mother, we decided to cancel the entire order and, YET AGAIN after not being able to get ahold of anyone at the store for several hours, I called corporate and asked to cancel my order and was informed not only did they have absolutely no record whatsoever of my 2nd purchase (even thought they were more than happy to charge my card earlier today), MY ORIGINAL ORDER HAD BEEN CANCELLED BY SOMEONE ON THE DAY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DELIVERED. I was informed that I should try to get in contact with someone at the store (as if it's so easy) and my complaints would be passed on to the manager.

I really just would have been fine if they were apologetic towards the situation and cared but instead in a monotone voice the response I was given was \"well sometimes we miss things, do you have the card so I can refund the money\". Outstanding response sir. Needless to say I told them my fianc\u00e9 would call them with the card information. When he called the owner answered and again was not very sympathetic to the situation. He decided a refund wouldn't matter since the surprise for her birthday was ruined anyways. She had the balloons delivered the next day that we paid for already and a box of 6 complementary strawberries sent with it.

I ask the representative when was the soonest they could deliver the arrangement?  She told me they could deliver it around 12 Noon on Thursday, August 16, 2018.  I told her that would be great and to please get it there as close to Noon as possible.  She said they would.  I called Edible Arrangements at 12:30pm to see if my order had been delivered. The lady told me it was on the table being finished.  I told her it was supposed to be delivered at Noon and asked her when would it be delivered.  She told me by 2pm.  Bottom line, they did not get the arrangement delivered until 4:45pm and where they had to deliver it to was less than 3 miles from the Edible Arrangements shop.  I called and spoke to the manager and she didn't care at all about the problem and said there was no way they could have gotten it there by Noon.  I ordered it the day before. They open at 8am and you can't fix, arrange and deliver an arrangement by Noon and it is less than 3 miles from your place of business?  Something is wrong with your Business Plan then.  I called and complained to corporate  and they said they would have the owner call me from the Mobile, Alabama location but, I have not received a call yet.  I spent over $100.00 and the business delivered it when they wanted to not, when I wanted them to.  If I don't hear from the owner this week, I'm sending it to my attorney. I know it's just a $100.00 but, it's about the principle of the matter.  This business did not do what they said they would do and they have not even offered an apology, much less a refund.  Well, I expect a call and if I don't get one, it will most certainly cost them more than$100.00.
