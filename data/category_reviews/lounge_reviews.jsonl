They are finally serving a few types of alcohol. Which coupled with the recent friendlyness of the staff, makes thier rating go up. The smoke eaters are way too loud, they have good music playing but is still drowned out by the excessive amount of smoke eaters and it makes it harder to converse with a buddy. Cant really hear the games being played either. Up stairs tv has no sound and it was dirty, ashes all over ground, bottles everywhere, full ashtrays- this was before 12pm. Only had 1 guy working so this could be atributed to that. But other times it wasnt as bad but not like other places. All the seating is rediculously uncomfortable-hard leather and metal stools- imo not fit for a lounge, more of a come and go place. Hard to find parking which is a deterrent sometimes.

I noticed after my last visit in Dec. 2015, that the club had really changed and not in a good way. The first thing I noticed is how the club had hired very unfriendly and unprofessional staff. The bouncer a five foot bald black guy looked very creepy and weird, he looked like bouncers you would meet in ghetto clubs. My friends and some of relatives who USED to frequent the club kept saying that this particular bouncer was rude, unpolished, and should not be working in a high end club like Sammy's.\n\nHe pretends to be the management, but you can see that he has no customer service experience at all. This bouncer has some serious issues, that need to be addressed by management. There are a lot of complaints on social media about this particular bouncer and management seem to be hiding their heads in the sand.\n\nI might also add that some of the girls are less than average. I found it very difficult tipping girls that I didn't think that should be allowed to strip dance on a public stage.\n\nSammy's used to be a classy and very customer friendly club in Birmingham, not anymore. A lot of my friends and relatives have recommended that I try \"The Furnace club\". I will not be going back to Sammy's any time soon, that's for sure. If you are spending your hard earned money you at least expect good customer service and a friendly environment. A bouncer is the first staff member you get to see and therefore, a creepy and rude one is very telling of the outlook of the club in general.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891eb335b4a999:0xbed319bfd6e1821e"}

Security is beyond ridiculous. I got threatened with a taser because one security guard didn't like that I was sipping on my beer and trying to close my tab at 3:01. I know that makes no sense but that's what happened. The guys name is John I believe - 5 foot tall, bald headed, unethical black guy who eats too much protein and is easily intimidated. The \"real\" cop that was in there didn't help either. I have never been treated this poorly by any club in all the state's I travel to. This all happened even after spending over $100.\n\nI paid for a beer that got snatched out of my hand and thrown onto the bartender while the guy was sparking the taser in the other hand. He then followed me outside, calling me names and playing with his taser while I was heading to my vehicle. Bartenders and servers were great and the girls were nice. Cigarettes said $5 but actually cost $8. A lap dance with clothes on is over priced in my opinion at $20 in a place like that. The atm charges you $7 to withdraw - you're better offer bringing cash with you.\n\nSaw a manager at another bar afterward and he deeply apologized for the actions of the security guy. He agreed that the guy lost his temper far too easily and gave me a free pass for next time if I choose to go back. Not sure I'll be back. My luck would be that he have a gun next time and lose his cool and shoot me or someone else. Be very careful.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891eb335b4a999:0xbed319bfd6e1821e"}

I think the cheese sauce was made with cheez wiz. The couple we were with had the Surf and Turf. The lobster tails were very small AND OVER-COOKED!!! The filet could not have been more than 3 oz.

We did not wish to make a scene. I told her that the oyster dishes were not the authentic recipes and they tasted like cheap american cheese melted atop of each. she replied that the sauce was Hollandaise. Yeah, maybe it was packet hollandaise, like Knorr's! The Oyster's Rockefeller, O---M---G !!!! Chopped creamed spinach over a tiny oyster with melted \"cheez wiz\" on top.
