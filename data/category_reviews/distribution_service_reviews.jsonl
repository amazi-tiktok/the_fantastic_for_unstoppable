If you're a person looking to work for these guys, or if you saw a Craigslist ad, don't do it. It's just a pyramid scheme. You will not be paid.\n\nYou are going to be shown a demonstration of a Kirby vaccuum and how cool it is. While it is a cool product, these guys are going to tell you all sorts of promises about the job but the main things being the 2000/mo base pay and the fact that appointments are pre-arranged. What I am going to tell you should be enough to deter you alone:\n\nYou will not be going to pre-arranged appointments, you will be traveling in a old van up in Tennessee in the middle of nowhere in places like Union City (Don't know where that is? You're already on Google, so look it up on Google Maps) doing cold appointments as if this were the 50s. The vans are filled with your selfish 'team lead', a woman to knock on the doors, two 'Kirby sales veterans', and a few other people who fell for this like you did. No-trespassing signs? They don't care. Threatened to be shot? They don't care. Guard dogs? They don't care dude!\n\nThey are going to smoke, curse, and otherwise act unprofessional. You are going to slog through cold Fall and winter nights and days with no cell phone signal and 11 hour work periods with one or two lunch periods that you have to pay for out of your own pocket. You will enter the homes of old men and women or young couples who can't pay for it anyways. You will not get bathroom breaks because the team lead wont let you out unless you yell. Did I already mention you will be in the middle of nowhere too? Good, because this is important to note. Think about what I just said earlier in conjunction with this. If you're in the middle of the sticks with no cell phone signal with your only support being a bunch of jerks and two scared people also in your position with no power, what do you think will happen if you tick off  the driver? That's right, you will be kicked out of the van in the middle of redneck central with a dying cellphone batter and (if you were unlucky enough to fall for this in late fall to winter) frigid weather. Don't bother calling your 'employers' if this happens either, they will not care and will act as if you are bothering them. btw you'll be left in this position for hours at a time anyway if the person doesn't let you remain in their house after the appointment is over.\n\nThe feeling of hopelessness you will find surging through you will make you want to end it as you realize you will have to do this for six-days a week for a month.\n\nI quit after three days of this, but you may sit through it to realize that you won't be paid a cent, because the 2000 base pay is not real!! You must satisfy $2000 worth of sales and THEN your sales will start to count towards your pay. Good luck doing that when you will maybe get one appointment a day tops since the 'team leads' let the more experienced members go first.\n\nDO. NOT. DO. THIS.\n\nI do not care if you are about to be homeless. Better to enter into that with honor than shame.\n\nOh yeah and as a post-statement: they mark up the price on the Kirby vacuum by 40%.

I ordered a tube where i can fit my electrical fish rod tools but to my surprise, the product arrives with no end caps.  All while the product picture has end caps, which is basically false advertisement.  So let me get this straight, your customers are coming to your site to buy an empty tube with no end caps?  I can conveniently drive to home depot and get a random pipe for that.  Or even ask my neighbor.  How about putting it in capital letters on your site  that \"the tube doesn't come with end caps.\"  Then it would be up to the customer to read and do the proper product research.\n\nBut wait there's more.  So i was already super irritated at the lack of logic being used on this one but i refrained from writing a bad review.  Instead, I brushed it off, went on the website, and found I can just order these vynil end caps for $2, plus shipping.  Whatever! Right?  It happens!\n\nBut my disappointment didn't stop there.  I received the package, opened it and only one cap was inside.  Again, the product page is titled \"black vynil caps\" and the first picture is a picture of multiple caps.  So once again, misleading a returning customer that already gave you a second chance.  Where is the logic?  I am certain that you have run into this problem before.  Why is it not fixed.  You risk reputational damage for a few extra bucks.\n\nI just don't understand how your number one priority isn't to make life easier for your customers and delighting them at every step of the sales process....  I am stuck between throwing the tube out and looking elsewhere, or just ordering another stupid end cap and paying shipping FOR THE THIRD TIME", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1607389600380, "text": "Hi Ersi.

Considering I am a first time owner he said it may be a simple fix. I said great when may I drop it by? He said he is backed up and it would really help him out a lot if I could bring it by that Tuesday, I told him that sounds great. He asked that I send him my address and the issues via text before hand. I did. I had to work late and had my cousin drop it off. Please see the photos of our texts. I told him a million times DO NOT BUY ANYTHING for the RV I ONLY want a diagnosis. He took a week, and ended up purchasing: -LP for the RV, Checking the outside, HE BROKE the generator and told me that it stopped working. He even said on audio, it was working when you dropped it off. HE broke the battery disconnect again which was working when I dropped it off. When I went to pick it up he kept repeating how he put me in front of other projects and he needs more time. I explained how he told  me to bring it in on that day because he was behind the previous week.

I have no doubt he is good at working on more commercial projects,but to try and take advantage of  smaller projects is just not good business.
