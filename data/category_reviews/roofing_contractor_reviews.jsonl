Jeremiah is probably one of the most honest hard working businessmen I have ever met in my life.\n\nWe had to have a 20yr old shingle roof removed and a new roof Istalled.\n\nThese guys were friendly, timely and professional.\n\nWhile the roof was being installed if there were any questions regarding what I wanted, the project manager was ON SITE and made sure to come to me immediately.\n\nThey went above and beyond with customer service.If I ever need a roof on any other structure, this is the company that I am going to use hands down.\n\nTHANK YOU!!!\n\nThe price was only $200 more than any other estimate that I had gotten, however, for that extra $200 I also got a warranty that I could not beat anywhere else. I received new flashing instead of using the old flashing (like the other companies said they would do because it wasn't \"necessary\" to change flashing). BULL HOCKEY!!!\n\nThey removed old copper on my bay window and put rain/iceshield over the ENTIRE window, flashed it, rain dripped the WHOLE HOUSE (Because we don't have gutters) AND fresh shingles on the Window!!!\n\nThey installed rain and ice shield around ALL of my dormers. The original roof did not have flashing in the valleys and this company made sure to do it correctly.\nThey removed rotted decking and replaced it with new. What a great company.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3otKjHzWvpabqkhABBTGAO5uh2wYRv6XekAM7=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a173eed57100d:0xf6c9a48add8fadcf"}

I'm incredibly disappointed. Our order was managed poorly - the left hand doesn't seem to know what the right hand is doing - and we're still waiting 6 months later for 3 doors to be installed. From this experience, it's hard to say whether I'd recommend Champion again. I like the product a lot, but I'm very disappointed with the progress of this project.\n\nWe were so pleased with Champion before, that we decided to hire them for 4 new doors around our house. January, they came and measured the doors and told us they would be installing the end of Feb or beginning of March (can't remember exactly). They show up and one of the doors is just right, one door is the *wrong* door, and the other two were not measured or manufactured properly. Ok, mistakes happen, I get it. So they tell me they'll order new doors and get back in a month. It's a busy time or something, right? They tell me the doors won't be ready until May. May rolls around, nothing. I start calling in June and nobody knows what I'm talking about, I have to tell the representative what my problem is and she tells me she'll have to contact the local office, gives me her number, and tells me to call her the following week. I call her the following week and she doesn't answer. I call the HQ and the rep has to take all my information again because my record isn't clear to her. I call the local office, nobody answers. I call HQ again, nobody answers. I finally get a call in JULY that *one* door is ready to be installed. \"One door,\" I ask, \"we are waiting for 3 doors.\" The rep is confused. All he has in his records is one door. I'm contacted by another rep the same day who says she got in contact with the local office, who weren't able to tell her whether the door had even been ordered and, again, I had to remind the rep that we had ordered 2 other doors.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1580132983886, "text": "Champion appreciates the feedback in order to improve our customer service.

After paying and getting the measurements, it took 2 months for the windows to be installed. During this time there was 0 communication. We tried calling and left several messages with the receptionist, but no one ever returned our call. Finally, we called our sales rep and complained. Suddenly, the windows were ready to be installed.\nThe day of the installation, the company sent two workers who told me they would be finished by 1. The workers showed up an hour after we were told they would. After our old windows were removed, I overheard them talking about how our windows weren\u2019t measured correctly. When I asked what was wrong, they assured me everything was fine. Later, the workers and their boss were screaming at each other over the phone about the correct way to install the windows, the result of which was another working coming to explain the correct way to install and why the windows maybe looked too small. At 4:45, I informed the workers that I had to be somewhere at 5 pm and was already going to be late. They left, and promised to return the next morning at 8 am to finish the installation. The next day my husband stayed home from his job to be there to let them in. At 9:15 they arrived and finished the installation.\n\nThe overall quality of the windows was fine, but I have never dealt with more unprofessional people in my life.

Last year when a Hurricane blew through town, I had suffered roof damage along with many of my neighbors. Being fortunate and not actually displaced from my residence, I opted to wait a few months to solicit repair estimates while those who needed immediate help were being serviced.\n\nWhen the rush had died down (or so I thought), I reached out to multiple companies for estimates. I quickly realized that getting someone out to even give me an estimate was going to be a challenge. Numerous companies offered to come out but none actually followed through. Until I found Davis Roofing! They arrived within a few days at the precise time I was promised. A detailed professional estimate was provided to me and my insurance company for a complete roof replacement.\n\nUpon acceptance by my insurer, they asked me for my business.  At this point, they were the only company to respond. I took a chance with a single estimate, mostly because of promptness, professionalism and effective communication. I was not disappointed!\n\nDriving through my subdivision, I have the best roof in the neighborhood! The price I was quoted was the price that I paid. An addendum was even sent to my insurance company (by them) for additional expenses to be paid to me. That was a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe efforts and communication of this group did not end when the job was over. I have been contacted multiple times over the last year with inquiries on my satisfaction. What more could I want? With this latest communication, I made mention of a single shingle that had slipped and looked crooked on the eve above my front door. The customer service representative promised to have the repair crew out to fix it. It happened the next day!\n\nFolks, I don't do many Google reviews. It takes a lot to impress me! Suffice to say, Restoration Services has done so and has earned my business going forward. I like the fact that they have expanded their offerings to include electrical services as well. I know they will be there, if needed. They will be my only call!

I accepted the estimate and a few days later two great young men - Sammy and Jamie - came out and took care of the job!  From what I could see they did an excellent job  I figured I would receive the bill and pay, and I would be happy with that.  It was much better than that.  I received a follow-up call to see if I was satisfied.  On top of that Scott called and scheduled a walkthrough.

All will say they will do your roof at \u201cinsurance proceeds and will demand the quote given to you by the insurance company to base their quote and or price.\u201d Needless to say BCR started out great with my roofing process, their communication was lacking at times and I felt I had to beg and follow-up to see when I would get my roof put on. I was then contacted at the last minute by their office manager due to a cancellation and I agreed for the appointment date and time. I was not briefed on exactly what would be taking place besides the fact that the materials will be dropped off at 7a.m. I remember during the initial sales meeting I was informed that a project manager would be on site during the roofing process to oversee the work , that did not happen. As I was proceeding to get my day started and walk out of my house, I noted that I was not able to access to exits out of my home (i.e. front door, back door or garage) I entire yard was a complete mess from the roofing. I phoned Mr. Majors and informed him their cleanliness was not professional at all and asked where was the project manager. Thinking if project manager was present, the amount of debris blocking exit/entrance would not be. I was greeted with hostility and then told with sarcasm that \u201cyou are getting a roof put on\u201d. Understandably, however, your team\nIs not structured and or organized as it relates to my job. After much complaining, a \u201cproject manager\u201d showed up and agreed that the roofers was disorganized. Fast forward during the roofing process, I am asking question as it relates to installation and was basically told a project manager will not be there through duration of roof as they had other appointments but will follow up. Again, I voiced my frustrations to Mr. majors and they was simply over look. Needless to say, I can\u2019t confidently refer anyone to this company due to their lack of professionalism and work ethics of the individuals they sub-contract their work to.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1591709521767, "text": "We are sorry to hear about this situation.

When I checked the roofs after installation there were numerous nail heads showing that should have been covered by shingles, his flashing on his chimney was almost 3/4 inch away from the chimney allowing water to run behind it, along with torn shingles, nails sticking up from under the shingles that were not removed, and many other items. I really wish I was allowed to put pictures on Google.\n\nThe next 2.5 months were a back and forth between the owner and myself in which they would come and fix the roof and then I would check and either they would not have done what they said they would, torn other shingles, or I would find more issues.  A total of 4 repairs on our brand new roofs and we still had items they had \u201coverlooked\u201d. My biggest complaint is that I was finding the issues each time instead of a BCR representative making sure it was done correctly.\n\nFinally, after I wrote a very poor review on Google and told the owner that after their next repair I was hiring a roofing inspector out of my pocket to check the roof because of all the issues I was finding they replaced most of my roof and half of my uncle\u2019s roof and did a good job on those installations.\n\nI understand sometimes there are issues with installations and if BCR would have checked it and made sure it was corrected this would have been a 4-5 star review. Because I was having to get on the roof each time and check the roofs and finding things that were \u201coverlooked\u201d it should have been a 1 star review.  I moved it to 3 stars because to their credit they did replace most of my roof and half of my uncle\u2019s roof and supervised the workers when they did it, but it was a lot of discussions with the owner, many unsatisfactory repair jobs, and sleepless nights for myself and my uncle to get to what we should have gotten to to start with.\n\nIf you use BCR make sure you check your roof.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1566956562006, "text": "Hello, we are so sorry to hear about your experience.

I don't recommend them. The only Yellowhammer employee that will show up is the salesman. They sub-contract the work out to various crews and it is apparently the luck of the draw on how good the crew is. Our neighbors used them at around the same time and their roof looks great. It took them two days to do our installation. The first day, they stripped our old roof and then left us overnight without any roof covering. The next morning was foggy and we had a lot of condensation on the roof deck. Some of that water then dripped through and stained our living room ceiling. When I contacted them, they said let's observe it for a few weeks and make sure the new roof is not leaking. Once it was established that it was not leaking, their idea was not to repair my ceiling, but to attempt to contact my insurance company and claim it was storm damage. They showed up with the wrong color drip edge (my neighbors also got the wrong color) and the installation was not professional looking. The installation of the shingles was also done with a less than professional  look (uneven edges, curled shingles, gaps between ridge shingles etc.).  I had plastic strips sticking out from under the shingles all over. They did a less than stellar job of clean up and even left tools behind. I had them install ridge vents and they left a mess in my attic. I supposedly had the option of keeping my turban vents, and I chose to keep them, but they removed them anyway. I contacted them and they did come back and repair some of the work, but I still have plastic strips sticking out and my ceiling has not been repaired. I feel as though I will now have to pay more money for a third party inspector to come out  and see if the installation is properly done.\n\nI will update the review if/when my ceiling gets repaired and they return to finish cleaning up the little plastic strips.\n\nEdit:\nYellowhammer sent the same guys that installed the roof back for their second attempt at fixing the deficiencies in their install. Luckily, I was able to leave work early and catch the guys before they left. After a brief glance at the roof, I could still see plastic strips sticking out. I had to stop the guys from leaving and literally point things out to them. One of the installers even had the nerve to act like I was inconveniencing him by having him come back a second time to fix the roof. So far, they have repaired issues that I can easily spot from the ground, but the entirety of my roof is not visible from the ground, so I have no confidence that there aren't issues on the places I can't see.\n\nSince the owners comment that \" they will do anything possible to fix my concerns\", I have not been contacted by them. I wish they would send someone out to audit the installer's work. If they think that this is acceptable, then I  invite them to take pictures and use them as examples of the \"quality\" that you can expect from Yellowhammer. They still have not fixed my living room ceiling. I will update if anything changes.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1617203675211, "text": "Mr. Pee, we apologize about this and we will do everything we can possible to fix your concerns."}, "gmap_id": "0x88891ec3360abe8b:0x34c1ce950a20a4a0"}

David helped me through the entire process, and made everything incredibly easy! He assisted me with filing my claim by answering questions the claim rep had that I didn't know the answer to. He also met my adjuster and reviewed the damage with him, got my roof approved, and had it installed all within a couple of weeks in time for the closing! It was a great experience, and David made it a lot easier than I ever could have imagined. I highly recommend he and Yellowhammer Roofing for your roofing needs.\nSincerely,\nIva Hines", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891ec3360abe8b:0x34c1ce950a20a4a0"}

The salesman even told me he'd pay me, not the company, a $100 for every referral. Being a Contractor I occasionally know people who need a roof so I said; \" Great\". I referred him to my mother. After she signed the contract I saw on FB a post by a Realtor looking for recommendations for a roofing company other than Yellow Hammer. I mentioned it to the salesman. He said he'd contact her. It appears they have little communication between the delivery people, installers, the home owner, and salespeople. No coordination at all. The job was expensive for the type of shingles installed. It looks good though however they left marks on the house and garage door. They also punctured the screens on the screened porch. The referral fee that I was promised is still in the salesman's pocket. I see now why the Realtor posted ; \" other than Yellow Hammer.\"\nYou've heard; \"Where's Waldo?\" I'm wondering; \"Where's Benjamin?\"\n\n9-20-18 update. I can't believe after they read my review it happen again. Yesterday my mom said some guy was knocking on her door. She waited until he walked back towards his vehicle and opened her door to ask what he wanted. He said he was from Yellow Hammer, but nothing to show that he was, and came to look at the needed repairs. She said; \"They're around back\". She thought he was walking down the driveway to the rear of the house so she went back in to walk to the back porch. She said she heard something as she was opening the back door and was startled to find this guy in the house, standing behind her. She never was notified that he was coming and the scared by him being in the house uninvited. Still a lack of communication in this company. Good thing this 88 year old lady didn't have a gun in her hand. The salesman did call me a couple of days ago wanting to know how he could rectify me changing my review. I don't have an answer for that other than issues that continue can only be rectified from the top management down the chain of command. Sounds like some goal setting with a plan of action is needed.\n9-23-18 Update. They showed up on Sunday, unannounced. Seems to be a pattern. My mom had been gone and came back,  unaware they had been there and that they left over a dozen nails in the driveway, she drove over the nails. Not sure if any are in her tires yet. They did get the black marks off the house and replaced the screen.\nUpdate 11-1-18 The Salesman obviously  didn't tell the truth. He never gave me the promised referral fee. NO MORE REFERRALS.

He inspected our roof and looked at the other damage that we had that needed to be repaired and with our permission took charge and got it all done. Not only did he hire excellent roofers, but he also engaged the fence builder and the drywall company to repair the inside leak damage. He handled the details with the insurance company. When the roofers came to repair a roof we were extremely impressed. There were at least five people at all times working on our roof. The team he brought were some of the hardest workers I have ever experienced. They put a tarp around the house and covered our bushes and they put on our new roof to the new Alabama wind code.  Their cleanup was impeccable. Using a magnet they cleared excess nails. We have only found 3 nails from the whole project.\nMost importantly, Jason was available by cell phone at all times. He returned calls immediately and kept us informed of arrival times of material and workers. Impressive!\n\nThe drywall repair company provided by Greater roofing was also excellent. Texture and paint in the ceiling look great.\n\nFinally the fence builders came. They were prepared when they arrived and 2 of them completed the job by mid afternoon.

We appreciate all they did from delivering the shingles, tearing off old roofing , replacing rotted decking, installing new roof to cleaning up.

I was initially quoted 4 days, but it ended up taking them 7 and a half weeks to completely ruin my roof. I have walked the roof and personally counted 138 screw holes in the metal that were left open when a screw was put in the wrong place then backed out. There is trim that is put in backwards and allows water to run under the metal instead of over. There are unsealed holes the size of dimes at every corner of the dormers and at the top of the valleys. The ridge is screwed on crooked, even after they \"fixed it\" once already. There is literally a water dam in one of the back valleys where metal was folded up at the end, creating a blockage and not letting water drain the way it is supposed to. No corner on the roof is sealed and instead of doing it right they put \"ornamental\" trim on to cover up the fact that they didn't do it right. The roof has leaked from the day they showed up on the job, plus they never came back to fix it or the water damage that they caused by not sealing it up. I have over 200 pictures, an inspection report, all of the texts between Matt and I and between myself and his incompetent workers, and I'm waiting on a quote for a complete roof replacement. I have also contacted my lawyer to begin the process of filing a lawsuit due to their extreme incompetence and shady business practices, and filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau in Birmingham. Matt is quick to take your money, but he's in no hurry to make good on his word. I've also added some pictures to let others know the lack of quality that comes along with hiring Mobile Roofing and Construction.\n\nUpdate to your response: I made a side deal with the crew? I called YOU. YOU sent that crew out here. The quote is a carbon copy with YOUR business name on the header and the truck that showed up had YOUR business name on the side of it. The check was written to YOU. And now you're trying to put the blame on someone else? The reason you didn't get paid in full is because YOU reduced the price since it took your workers almost 2 months to do a roof. Just yesterday you responded to a text and said that I told the crew how to put the roof on and that's why it was installed incorrectly. Since when does a customer tell a roofing company how to install a roof? I'll even post a picture of the text so people can see just how shady you are.", "pics": [{"url":

A big thank you to Mobile Roofing, Robb Harrison and George Fell.\nTwo years ago, we had a major leak on our porch \u201cfixed\u201d.  Recently the leak returned.  After getting one bid, Mobile Roofing was recommended to my husband.  I called, spoke to Matt and that afternoon Robb came to talk to us.  He was professional and appeared knowledgeable.  Robb said we needed a completely new roof and suggested we have our insurance look at the roof before we spent (specific dollar amount).\n\nGeorge came out to meet with the insurance adjuster, spending most of an afternoon going over the roof on the house and other buildings on our property.  The insurance adjuster agreed we needed a new roof but unfortunately, just wear and no insurance claim.\n\nRobb and George came back to talk to us.  After measuring and figuring what was needed to do our roof, Robb gave me a bid that was less than $100 from the dollar amount he had mentioned on his first visit.

He knocked $100 off the original quote and said his team could do the job the very next day. I decided to go with another company anyway. I can\u2019t speak to quality of work Matt and his team do, though I have only heard good things. I just hope they focus more on good, prompt customer service in the future, and then their reviews will take care of themselves.\n\nORIGINAL POST: I had some minor damage from Hurrican Nate, so I called and gave them my phone number and email and scheduled an appointment for an estimate. The guy who came out showed up 30 minutes late, but he did a quick inspection, entered info into his phone, and gave me a verbal estimate. He said he would follow up with his interior guy and send me an email so I could have the estimate in writing and so that he could get me a quote for the additional work of repairing some leak damage on the ceiling.\n\nA week passed, and I still hadn\u2019t received an email, so I called to request it again. I had to give them my email again, and I was told I\u2019d get an email right away. Another few days passed, and I still hadn\u2019t gotten an email. I called and had to give my email AGAIN. Later that day, I got a text (maybe they lost my email again) with a screenshot of a quote that was nearly double what I had been originally told. When I asked why it was so much higher and if it included the estimate for the interior repairs as well, I never got a response. Every time I called, they acted like they didn\u2019t even know what I was talking about. It\u2019s been over three weeks since I first called them, and it doesn\u2019t seem like these guys communicate with each other.\n\nI know it\u2019s a busy season, especially with the storms and rain, but how hard can it be to contact a potential client? Or at least call and say that you can\u2019t take the job right now so i\u2019m not sitting here waiting. Not happy with the lack of service I received, and I\u2019ll be going with another company who has their stuff together.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb2b0e2f011f5:0x17b01ff87c77f6b"}

If you need a roof replacement or repairs this is the company to contact. Superior Roofing is a GAF Master Elite certified roofing contractor. They provided quality materials, removed the old roof, installed the new roof, cleaned up the area, and ensured the work was supervised throughout. This company (Superior Roofing) has over 30 years in the roofing business. You want quality work and people who care about their business then this is the company to select. Mr. Dykes was on site during the second installation date and ensured the roof work was completed correctly. The roof looks great and the quality of the installation is of high quality.

As of July 20th they still had not finished. We had a vacation planned and upon our return, the unprofessional work ethic and attitude continued so we fired them.\nThe problems:\nThey have installed the tile flooring incorrectly, it is very uneven, has to be removed and replaced. The tile was uneven, grout lines not the same and tile was crooked. They chipped floor tile trying to fix the mistakes they made.\nThey rebuilt the shower walls but made the shower to large. The cabinets now do fit in place. The shower walls have to removed as does the mud bed for the shower.\nThe tile work they did on the shower had to removed because they had a 1 inch bow i n the wall. The bow in the wall was due to APEX's contractors putting inch of thin set or mortar behind the tile, inch thick!\nThe floor pan was not sealed or glued correctly. This was pointed out to me two other contractors who have given us bids.\nAPEX also did not install the left counter properly so they cut the stone back splash and side splash to try to make it fit. They cut the back splash uneven.\nThey broke fixtures in the bathroom.\nI had to make them put insulation back in the walls.\nApex did paint behind the counters in the bathroom.\nApex contractors would show up and work for a couple of hours and then leave to g to another job. At times they didn't even show up.\nI was told not to worry about the job in progress but the end result. If your foundation on the job is not right the finished product will be junk!\nAPEX would lie to us about job finish date. They would tell us we will be done by this Friday, but the tile had not been ordered or was not going to in till the next week.\nThe contractors would sit out back and smoke under my Gazebo! One of the guys had his girl friend hanging out all day. They did fire him after I brought this up.\nI had to tell them to not smoke under my Gazebo, don't put your stuff on my grill, do not smoke on my porch, do not turn on my outside fans and for them to clean up after themselves.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1543339278005, "text": "Please call me at (931)691-3800 I will do all in my power to resolve this issue.

Apex was referred to me by USAA for a water damage insurance claim that occurred in early December, and they just now finished. This was not a huge project - about 8 sheets of drywall and 2 doors, and I elected to paint, yet it still took nearly 4 months to complete. The drywall work was so bad that it took me an entire weekend to prepare it for paint. Debris was dumped in my trash can despite them billing for removal. I voiced my concerns with a quality manager, but heard nothing else after. Communication with Apex was frustratingly bad. Calls to project managers would go to voicemail and would not be returned. Weeks went by without updates despite my numerous calls and texts. I don't know how these guys are still in business, but I do plan on voicing my concerns with USAA to at least get them off their recommenced list so this never happens to another veteran.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1543338715641, "text": "Please call me at (931)691-3800 I will do all in my power to resolve this issue.

I did my homework and got quotes from 5 other companies, but Blair blew us away with their authenticity, local roots and competitive pricing.

The install went smoothly, a little over a month after buying. We had metal windows and the guys took the time to cut them out by hand and ensure our new windows went in seamlessly. Instead of just throwing up wood surrounds, they capped the windows with custom aluminum before sealing it all up.\n\nFrom beginning to end, Craig Blair was very patient in walking through everything with us and ensuring we were informed and comfortable.

I first met with Craig Blair on April.  He gave me a quote that same day.  He was very patient and was definitely not in a hurry to leave, even though it was late in the day.  He answered all of my questions.  After I thought about it for a while he came back another afternoon to answer more questions and show the demo window unit to my wife.  Again, very patient and in no hurry to be anywhere.\n\nMade down payment in April.  He said they would install in early June.  That is exactly what happened.  The install took only three days.  They started on a Wednesday and finished on a Friday.  The install crew consisted of three guys.  They were extremely polite and cleaned up their mess each day.\n\nThere was only one major issue.  There were streaks and smudges on every window.  It looked like some kind of sealant that was not cleaned off during the manufacturing process.  I met with the lead installer on Friday morning and pointed this out to him and asked that he clean the windows.  He was very condescending and obviously did not want to clean the windows.  He said he would but I knew he would not.  I went back to work (my wife was home but said she would not enforce the window cleaning)\n\nThe project was finished when I got home Friday afternoon.  The windows looked great but . . . You guessed it.  There were still streaks and smudges on all the windows.  Not wanting to be a pain, I tried cleaning the windows myself.  The sealant was very difficult to remove.  It would not come off with glass cleaner alone.  I decided this should definitely be Blair\u2019s responsibility.\n\nI asked for a meeting with Criag Blair.  We met the following week.  He was very polite and patient.  He agreed to have the windows cleaned and address a few other minor issues.\n\nIt took a while, and to be fair, I was out of town for a week but we finally coordinated on having the windows cleaned.  The crew that did the installation came back out.  They came while I was at work.  My wife was home but declined to be the inspector.  They finished cleaning about 3 PM.  They waited for me to get home at 4:30.  We walked around and inspected all 26 windows.  There were a few touch ups but for the most part they did a good job.\n\nIn summary, I was very pleased and satisfied with the entire process.  I will definitely use Blair Remodeling in for any future projects.  Craig Blair is the best.  I totally trust him and I know that he will do whatever is necessary to make sure I am satisfied.

Unfortunately, he couldn't find them locally, but did find that he could get them in Columbus, GA. James drove back over to Columbus, got the exact shingles needed, came back and finished up the job.

It took only 2 days for removal and installation of my new roof which is amazing because mine is very high pitch. Each day they cleaned up their debris (shingles, nails, etc..) and when the dumpster they used leaked hydraulic fluid onto my driveway, they pressure washed the spot. His crew even replaced a board on the side of my home that had a rotten spot. I cant tell you how pleased I am with the aesthetics of my new roof, not to mention how structurally sound it is. 2nd to None had the highest warranty (7 years) of all the companies I was considering which was also a deciding factor for me . Most only have a 5 years warranty and one had only 2 years. When a company can stand behind their workmanship, they deserve my business. Bryan also worked closely with me to make sure I had the right type of shingle (color, functionality). He also imparted valuable advice regarding which shingle manufactures are honoring their warranties. Also..it needs to be mentioned that before they installed the new roof, I had a portion of my old roof tarped but the wind blew it off. Of course heavy rains came and water was leaking in several spots on my roof and into my master bathroom/closet. It was raining and lightening when his crew got on my roof to retarp/stop the leakage. That was also a deciding point for me that I would be using his company for my new roof. I can tell you most companies would not have done that. Also Bryan worked diligently with my Allstate adjuster explaining the cost of the roof which they had initially underestimated.

I had a complete roof replacement done 2 months before hurricane Sally literally T-Boned my home in Elberta, AL. The owner came and performed an inspection after I called them due to a small leak discovered on the ceiling inside. The leak was discovered the night that a tropical storm was hitting Louisiana and we had solid rain and some gusty winds. He found several locations of wind torn shingles. His company's process for handling insurance was thoroughly explained and he offers fighting the insurance company on your behalf for you, and this save a lot of headaches. He also explained how many roofing companies have a bad habit of \"high nailing\" shingles leading to typical thunderstorm gusty winds tearing them off. He also provided an excellent overview of the quality shingles he uses (IKO) and their second to none wind ratings. Besides, you get what you pay for! I signed his contract. His job foreman maintained constant communication with me on material delivery date, asked where I was ok having it placed closest to house. Job day came and let me express my amazement with his crew! Arrive 7am and depart 4:30pm....job complete!!! It looked like no one ever came! And trust me, I am one of those people that like to watch like an \"inspector\", and these guys know what they're doing. I also had Fortification completed on the roof, powered attic vent removed w/ridge vents and off ridge vents put in place. I never ever had to deal with the insurance! People just don't understand the process, want a complete new roof for pennies on the dollar....and folks unless you're ok dealing with leaks/missing shingles a year or two later, or doing the roof yourself...you are not going to find a company and roof products of this standard for that kind of money! I paid a small wind deductible and got a complete roof w/fortification and 45 year shingle, full wrap of gutters and ceiling repair (about 700sqft due to \"continuous surface\") for that small deductible! Then hurricane Sally hit. Not one shingle, ridge/off ridge vent even flinched!\n\nIf you want honesty, quality material and construction w/out fighting your insurance, and no concerns about future issues with your roof....call the folks with ICE Restoration and let them take care of you. The one or two reviews I read that were not so nice, clearly to me are folks that do not understand roofing or the process with insurance and think everyone is out to take advantage.

That said, it was a very minor amount debris (maybe 10 nails in total and only one or two pieces of broken shingles) and that complaint is being extremely picky.\n\nI would definitely recommend them to anyone needing a new roof, especially if it is an insurance case.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890ce2ec4d4923:0x86f9441ee456958d"}

His crew removed all the shingles and then said he had to put plywood down in order to install the shingles. (A large section of roof was uncovered so it isn't like he wouldn't have known something like this ahead of time). He wanted over $6k (I had it done for under $2k paying help) to do this and I had to make a decision before the next time it rained. During the whole process he wasn't helping and was down right rude in his treatment of me. After all was said and done and we were waiting on the insurance company to make the final payment, he sent my bill to collections with additional fees. Mind you the bill would have been paid in under 30 days if he didn't try to scam me out of even more money. Now, I tried to reach out because I needed to get matching shingles for a section of the roof that needs repaired and he sends me another overdue bill and lets me know he won't bother helping me because of all the hassle he had to go through to get paid and threatens me with harassment.

The more estimates I got the more I began to get extremely panicked. The prices that I got were unbelievable. Doing a google search I found Kelbie Roofing. After speaking with Mike he took his time and did a thorough inspection of my roof, chimney and the ceilings inside that had water damage. Mike gave me several options from a patch to a full replacement and the price was really fair and reasonable. Talking to Mike I could tell he was extremely qualified and knew exactly what he was talking about. There was no pressure he even advised if I wanted to get more estimates he would expect no less never go with just one or two estimates. Mike sat down with me and completely went through the entire process that would take place to replace the roof from start to finish.  After speaking with Mike we decided that his knowledge and courtesy was the way we wanted to go.  After signing the contract we set up a start date, the crew he sent showed up on that date on time ready to work. The crew was very courteous and professional, when they began to tear off the roof the crew made sure that my property on the side of the house where they were tossing the trash off and my wife's flower beds were protected. If I ever had a question during this process Mike and the crew never hesitated to answer the question being as this was my first time with such a large repair. The crew went above and beyond to make sure the job was completed properly and that it looked very good. From the tear off to the minor finishing touches I am completely satisfied with the job Kelbie roofing did for me and I will not hesitate to use them in the future.

I was contacted by Mark and he came right over and gave me an estimate I could work with. Mark was awesome and kept in contact as the process began. I then had huge issues with my mortgage company wanting 15 different forms needing this and that from this company. Mark went above and beyond to get this done for me.\n\nFast forward to the Christmas vacation......well mark is no longer with them, no idea what took place. I was then contacted by the new rep clay. Clay called and seemed to be on top of things. They were coming to set up the cut list appointment and I was finally ready to get my roof done. Well now clay won\u2019t return any phone calls ? Guess he got lost or something. Well I reach out to the owner who Jospeh White who was very helpful at the time when mark left. Well he too forgot what the hell customer service was too as he too can seem to remember how to answer a phone or return a call left at the office.\n\nThese people came to our town in our time of need and took advantage of the damage caused in the area. This company is sorry, the owner is sorry and I hope anyone reading this will make an informed decision and not use this place. I am also glad that Country insurance took my complaint and will be removing them from there service use list.\n\nThe rating of one star is only because it made me pick one to post my review.

The roofer walked the entire roof looking for nails that were backing out (not just in the area of the water stains below, but the whole roof), removing all that he found, sealing the hole and making sure the roof shingle lay flat. Two days after the repairs we had a lot of rain, and no water leaks inside the house.\n\nOnce again, Pickett Construction has made my wife and I very happy, and I will not hesitate to call them in the future.

We were looking for some typical wood rot to be replaced and exterior paint. We also requested an interior paint quote. I think the quote was a bit high for the exterior work, but not so bad that I didn't go with their services. The quote for the interior painting was outrageous, so we opted for another painter. The other painter's quote was nearly $3000 less than the quote from Pickett. We were also having some plywood put in the ceiling of the carport, because the builder used interior drywall in our neighborhood. Pickett gave us a \"complimentary upgrade\" to beadboard instead of plain plywood. This really added a nice touch to the carport ceiling, and was an appreciated upgrade. They only requested 1/2-down to start the work, which we felt was certainly reasonable. They also honored their coupon they regularly have (often in the Alabaster Newsletter, or ValPack). We printed ours from the ValPack website.\n\nWorkmanship:\nThe quality of the exterior work was pretty good. There were a few spots where the painting got a bit \"sloppy,\" but was overall good work. The beadboard in the carport made a great upgrade to our carport, and added a touch of \"class\" to an otherwise mundane area of the house. Unfortunately, due to our unusually cold winter, the holidays, and several bouts with rain, our work was regularly delayed. It took a bit longer than expected to complete, but didn't delay our schedule of listing the house. The little interaction I had with the crew was polite and courteous, though at times the project manager came across as mildly arrogant. Communicating with the PM via email was the best medium, although he sometimes took a bit longer than expected to return messages.\n\nPost Work Follow-up:\nAgain, the delays in returning messages made for a challenge in clearing our post-work \"punch list,\" but this was also around the holidays, so we conceded a bit.  Had there been more clear communication about workday expectations (e.g. workers will/will not be onsite today) this would have made for better overall feeling about the length of the job.\nDuring our home buyer's inspection, they found more wood rot that was inadvertently overlooked by the crew. While I don't expect the painters to look over every square inch of the house (heck, neither did I!), it ended up being a significant portion of the chimney that had rotted out the edge of our masonite siding. One would expect that at least part of that might have been discovered and either repaired or at least alerted me to the potential change in an estimate so it could be repaired. When we approached our PM about correcting it, he gave us a price quote. After paying over $6000 for the original work, this was certainly unexpected, especially with their \"1 year warranty.\" I spoke with Josh, the owner's son who is also in management with the company. He immediately started working with me to find a reasonable solution. I ended up having to pay a bit more, but we did come to an acceptable compromise on the final cost of the supplemental work. In the end, Josh personally stopped by the house to deliver the revised agreement and took pictures of the missed work. It turned out that the rot was more severe than even he expected. He opted to continue to honor that revised estimate and didn't charge anymore. Josh really worked hard to make a relatively displeasing situation wok out well in the end. Josh was absolutely committed to service and ensuring my end satisfaction. He even reached out after the supplemental work was completed to check in on my satisfaction, and knowing there was a bit of a sour taste, still wanted this Google Review. Josh knows what it takes to listen to customer concerns and immediately find a reasonable solution that works in the best interest of all parties. Had it not been for Josh's actions, my 4-star rating would have been a high 2-star, or low 3-star.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888928b42506b8af:0xcb8d4f70d1041df1"}

The Superior Roofing team replaced the shingles on our steep, tree-damaged roof, removed damaged gutters, installed new gutters with a perfect color match to our existing fascia trim, and expertly repaired our tree-damaged deck railings and steps.  We are very pleased with the results of all this multi-trade work and have received quite a few neighborhood compliments on the results.\nA late spring storm with heavy rains and high winds had caused a huge, old poplar tree to fall on our house.  Once our insurance company had completed their initial estimate of repairing the damage, we made our list of potential service providers and included Superior Roofing.  The estimator returned our call promptly and set up a convenient appointment to come by our house to assess our situation.  After walking the site, he explained his estimate while talking around the kitchen table with us and provided a professional package of insurance and business license documentation.  We had previously talked with several other very reputable and capable companies, but only a few could manage all the tasks in a single installation window and even fewer were willing to stay within our preferred guidelines for deck repair rather than replacement.  The Superior Roofing estimator described how the team could do our preferred repairs and created a window of opportunity in the work schedule.  After weighing a lot of factors, we decided to do business with Superior Roofing based on the estimator\u2019s straight-forward and professional manner, experience working with insurance claims, personal referrals from other trusted service providers we had used, the company\u2019s excellent ratings on several web sites and with the Better Business Bureau (A+ rating), and the interesting completed projects described on the company\u2019s web site.  The estimator personally showed up on site while the work was being done, made sure we were satisfied with the work, and followed up promptly with the close-out paperwork and insurance coordination.  As with so many home repair projects, some field changes to work already quoted were requested by us or suggested by the project lead on site.  The estimator and the project lead communicated promptly with us, gave us their candid assessments, provided cost deltas both plus and minus, and decisions that worked for all parties were made without delaying the work schedule.  Thank you, Superior Roofing - we enjoyed working with you and we appreciate the excellent results your team produced for us.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88621327f98ba979:0x8ca536f9e4258faf"}

FInally I got a highly rated company to come out and they took pictures and showed me where the metal was cut short in several places and patched, most all of the screws are halfway or more out, the edges are patched together causing leaks and overall the work after seeing pictures is very poor. What is really sad is that the original company is not willing to look or stand by their work. so after spending the money and putting a metal roof I now am going to have to replace the whole thing not to mention the wood in several places from the leak. They put screws in the flat part of the metal instead of in the ridges which means water is constantly running over them and slowly leaking into my house. I could understand the metal needing to be rescrewed but because they did not screw it on properly the first time in order for it to be correctly done it will have to be replaced. This company has been around a long time which is one of the reasons we chose to use them in the first place but apparently they have so much business they no longer care about the quality of their work.

We called them for two weeks to get someone out to the house to look at a possible repair on our roof.  I was told that they would call me back. NEVER HAPPENED.  And it was right before Thanksgiving.  So I let that one go.  So I called back frist thing Monday morning and got a person that actually set up an appointment and they would be out to the house on Dec 1 after 3:00 pm.   We took off work to make sure that we would be there for the rep to  stop by.  IT NEVER HAPPENED. I called the office at 338-0490 and spoke to office person and she said that she would call this person to see where he was and call me back I told her I prefered to hold.  So she called and laid the phone done (no hold) and he said that the did not have a 40 ft ladder on him and he was in Odenville.  So she said that she would call another rep and call me back.  So Charles called and said that he would be out at the house Friday at 9:30 and take a look.  Well nobody was home and we had no clue if he had some out or not.  So I called Charles this morning and asked if he came out and looked at the roof.  He said the took a ride out and then said that they were covered up and could not get to my repair.  I'm totaly blown away at this business practice and will not recommend them to anyone.  Word of mouth is costly sir!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88897dba11a508eb:0xeca332028eb62ac9"}

On week #6 half the bill was charged with interest with NO work being completed and no communication on when it would be completed/started. When this was addressed with Charlie (owner) it was ignored and not resolved. There was no mention of us being charged BEFORE work was completed. We called the Champion local office twice with no response. On the 3rd time we called corporate and Damon (installation manager) quickly returned my call.\nThe installation guys were 40 minutes late from appointment time, again with NO communication. I had to call to find out they needed to stop and get caulk on the way to my house. I would think they would have been prepared with the proper equipment prior to the customer's appointment time.\nThe installers were polite and professional, however I brought up some quality issues during the installation process that did not get properly taken care of until they said they were leaving causing them to stay longer and redo some of their work. (Gap in the J-molding, they wanted to caulk the gap, not fix it) Corporate called me wanted me to sign a form stating the job was done even though the installers were still here finishing the job.  When I mentioned the issues regarding some other problems (window & screen defects) Damon called me to come out to resolve the issues.\nBottom Line: Customer service and apologies goes a long way.

We just wanted a person to come by and talk to us about a new sunroom. This phone system service (meaning=the \"trained\" people manning the phones) is highly disorganized! Perhaps it is because of the virus? Leaving messages or even setting up appointments to meet with a representative and that representative never showed is very disheartening. (0 stars for that set-up-an-appt craziness.) Corporate office? You need to get that fixed! Perhaps employ another phone service to answer your toll calls? \ud83e\udd14\n\nFINALLY...after months of calls...we got our Champion reps at our home.\n\nMatt and Charles came to us in East Limestone from the Huntsville office which is by the airport. Having already had sales presentations by two competitors, we knew what to expect in their presentation. They immediately realized we were most interested in quality and price for our new sunroom.\n\nMatt was thorough in showing us the construction of their unique products. He even had samples to demonstrate the sunroom's best attributes.\n\nWe were surprised at the price. Matt was precise and clear on it. One contract, too, one price. Never additional hidden fees. Perhaps we contacted them at the correct time since it is December after all. \ud83d\ude01 Good price for the quality...the sunroom we chose actually can be added to our home square footage.\n\nCharles invited us to come by their showroom. I suggest everyone do this! Seeing several sunrooms already set up truly helps in your decision process versus just seeing magazine quality sunrooms in their catalogs.\n\nCharles even brought us to the back of where products are custom made for every sunroom. These are not kits. We went for the 6in depth walls. Seeing the sun rooms in the office and showroom also convinced us to go ahead with additional products. Charles was not pushy at all. We made these decisions on our own.\n\nBoth Matt & Charles also gave us their personal cell phone numbers and we have called them several times. They have always been available -immediately-. We appreciate this courtesy! (Those 5 \u2b50's for them.)\n\nHaving read 1-\ud83c\udf1f reviews from a year ago...yikes! We decided to see for ourselves and really tested our sales team.

Corey's temper when we involved Rob in communicating our concerns was completely unprofessional. Rob offered to give us a gift card for dinner as a compensation for the trouble we experienced (what a joke!). The national customer service manager threatened me and swore at me when I insisted Champion make the right the issues we experienced.\n\nThis company is full of dishonest, unprofessional, and unexperienced people charging high prices for a product of average quality.\n\nUPDATE IN RESPONSE TO CHAMPION'S RESPONSE: If nothing else, please take Champion's sarcastic response to my feedback as a token of their lack of professionalism.

We have a home that has 32 windows. These windows were from the original build back in 1999. Over time these windows failed, broke internal components, were loose, didn't stay up and let so much air in between them; it really hurt our HVAC bills. We decided to look at new windows. We went through the hoops and ringers with various window companies in the area and the big box stores. The price ranges were all over the place and the functions, options, features and price points were the driving factors in this big home reno purchase. We called Champion (CW going forward) and had our salesman Whit come out and give his sales pitch. He did a great pitch and was at our house for 4 plus hours. Going over every detail and question we had. He was not afraid to say \"I don't know, but I will find out\" and called ahead to ask with us on his speakerphone right in front of him. He never stepped out to his truck to ask; he just did it right in front of us. We wanted an answer and he went and got one. Good bad or indifferent there was no empty promises or sugar coated answers. We were explained all the finance options and the promo they were having during our consultation. We beat him up pretty good with our wants and needs for the windows. After that was done, Cory then came out a few days later and walked me through the measurement process; again answering my rhetorical questions and others I missed with Whit. He took meticulous measurements of ALL my windows and explained what my casements would be and how they would sit in the frame. I walked through the house with and he asked questions to me about each room as he measured and took detailed notes. We discussed the order that was first taken to verify everything was right...the first time. He explained the install and what was done with that process from top to bottom. As well as what to expect with financing options again. Making this as streamlined as possible. He explained our order, what timeline for delivery was and the timeline of the install process once the windows arrived from the factory. Once our windows arrived in Huntsville, we were given a few choices on the install. We picked the date that worked on our schedule and a timeframe that made sense for the install. Once again, were explained the who what when were and how on the install team. The install team was on time the first day with everything ready and planned out so they could hit the ground running. Jimmy Mashburn and Brandon Clark were the install team and they were incredible. I have OCD about fit and finish and so does this install team. Jimmy talked with my wife so she would get the understanding of the install and what she could expect. He didn't make her feel silly for asking and was very professional with each question. We, of course stayed out of the way, but if either side had a question about a window, my wife and or Jimmy/Brandon made sure both parties were on the same page. They took their time and set everything right the first time. We didn't care how long it took and they were very meticulous and detail driven on each window. They were not in any hurry to just set 'em and forget 'em. It was done right the first time. I'm no installer but I'm a homeowner that bought 32 windows so I was wanting to find something wrong or find a shortcut that I saw...NOPE! I couldn't find anything that I felt was incorrect or not done in a make sense manner. Everything was top notch work. All my old windows were removed and stacked out of the way. Drop cloths were placed inside on each opening to make sure the removal was as clean and clutter free. All of the windows were set correctly, openings were cleaned from past dirt and debris. Professional 100%!! I felt that my money was going to the right company for our home. These are big decisions to make when getting new windows and the value of the CW product met our families need. We are truly very happy with our windows and would recommend CW to anyone!! We are very happy we went with Champion!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1572873361192, "text": "Thanks so much for taking the time to leave this great review.

We had noticed a leak from the last couple of times it had rained and we were told to call Henderson. When we called they told us a guy would be out at the house at some point that day and that he would call us before he came by. We never got a call. We tried to call and got in touch with NO ONE and They were not closed yet. They never called us to let us know that they would be unable to get to us that day. We could have called someone else to help had they done that much, at least. Not even a courtesy call. We are very upset since it looks like today was the only day we might be without rain for a bit and our roof vent is leaking into our little boy's room through the ceiling!\nWe will be calling again at some point tomorrow and we expect an answer for this. It's unprofessional to not even give a client a courtesy call if something comes up and the repairman can't make it. Now, tomorrow and Saturday will be rainy and our little boy's room will be dripping...and we may be dealing with mold if this is not fixed fast.

A review is simply that, my opinion based on my experiences. You, however sir, have turned this into something else and are taking a path that I choose not to follow. It is not that I did not want to \u201cdo the work\u201d. I do not have to list my credentials to prove something to someone who in the grand scheme of things does not matter. I have 10 millions things going on in my life. From speaking with other people who had roof repairs, I was informed that the repair company does that part. So I based my expectations off of what many people, including people in your profession, explained to me about the process. In MY OPINION, which is what this is, I felt it could have been handled better. As stated before, you seemed disinterested from the beginning of the conversation but I chose to continue on because of the amazing reviews you received. At the end of the day, I am above this. For the record, I have contacted a company who will come out and assess the damages and give me a quote that I plan to pay for myself if that is what it comes to. Lastly, I have adjusted the ranking because clearly \u201cstars\u201d are more important that people. I am in no way here to damage anyone\u2019s reputation. Some people take constructive criticism better than others. I\u2019m sure that as successful as you are, you neither need or desire my business. I truly wish you much success in all that you do and pray you have an amazing evening.\n\nI was highly disappointed with my experience, especially considering all of the amazing reviews. I called and left a message with a representative who said I\u2019d receive a call back. True enough, I did; however, everything seemed rushed and the gentleman seemed disinterested from the beginning. I explained that I had some leakages that an inspector felt could have resulted from hail damage and that I was interested in getting an evaluation. I feel as if the man I spoke to felt that I had no point of reference just by some of his questions and comments. After telling him that I had another company come out weeks prior who did an inspection and said I had a valid claim, the man I was speaking with all of a sudden seemed interested in what I had to say. Further conversation revealed that my policy was transferred to a new company and that there may not be a storm that I could link the damages to under my new policy, which is understandable. From that point on, all conversation had a negative undertone and seemed as if it was a race to end the call. My biggest disappointment came in when he recommended that I personally look for a storm with a date that correlates to the damages and call him back if I find one. He said he\u2019d do the same. Needless to say, that was 3+ weeks ago. I do not feel that it is my responsibility to find a storm. The other company did all of that for me. I did not go with them due to poor communication and failure to call back in a timely fashion (like more than a week passed when I was supposed to receive a return call within 24 hrs). I am glad everyone else had a great experience and am sad to say that mine was quite contrary.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1560125877308, "text": "This negative review is in no way reasonable or justified. I do appreciate that she acknowledged that we promptly returned her call, which we always try very hard to do, but beyond the truth in that, her complaint against us is totally unwarranted.\nThis person wants to file a claim against her insurance company for hail damage to her roof. She told me that she changed insurance companies at the end of last year. I explained to her that in order to start the claims process her present insurance company will want to know the date of the hail storm that damaged her roof, in order for them to confirm (or deny) coverage. I told her that I am unaware of any hail storms that occurred so far this year that would help her to start a legitimate claim against her present company. I told her that I could be mistaken, and encouraged her to do some research and maybe she will learn of a storm that I am not aware of. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is an excellent governmental reference point for weather history.\nThe issue is not whether she has hail damage on her roof, but rather whether she can make a claim for the damage against her present insurance company, so it will pay for it. It appears that she can't.\nHer complaint against us is clearly rooted in her notion that she didn't want to be bothered to have to put any effort into the fact-gathering element of making a claim with her insurance company. She didn't want to \"\u2026 personally look for a storm with a date that correlates to the damages and call him back\". This is her \"biggest disappointment\". She obviously feels that someone else should do everything for her. I simply explained to her that there can be no claim for hail damage against her present company without a hail storm that occurred while insured with her present company. This is a person who has shot the messenger who brings disappointing news.\nWe have a long list of hard earned and well deserved stellar reviews.

After the installation, we had lots of questions for the Operations Manager, because we have been burned in the past by roofing companies who did a shoddy job and left us with problems (we are on a shady lot with lots of tree waste, and we get rough rain and windstorms on our property).  But the Operations Manager handled all of our questions with care.  After several weeks of typical summer weather including some torrential rain, we are still very pleased with the condition of our new roof and feel confident that it will serve our home and its new buyers for years to come.  Very satisfied customer here.  Thanks!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890f1c0c45fdd7:0xe897e4d03dcb5ebe"}

Referrals by mouth are rare and I did not have anyone I knew who had replaced their roof recently. Searching the websites was my only option. I decided to call roofers nearby or within my Zip Code.  Alabama Discount Roofing and three others were on the BBB website. I read the reviews and settled on three.  I called Alabama Discount Roofing and Marc was very nice to agree to meet with me on Sunday to accommodate my schedule. When Marc came, he was professional, respectful and did not put pressure on me to make a decision. I had prepared a list of questions to ask him but I only asked a few questions because he was very well prepared; he brought all his paper work for the licenses and insurances.  He also had prepared three different estimates: one for the 3 tab Asphalt Shingles, Architectural Shingles and the Metal roofing which he left with me and also samples of the shingles.  This gave me an idea what is available and what it will cost me. In addition, he brought with him a reference list with 17 names to contact if I had more questions. I told him that I had two other companies I wanted to meet with and then will call him back once I get their quotes. One company left their estimate on the door and I was not able to talk to them in personal but communicated by phone. The other company came in and we met but did not have all the details of paper work as Marc had prepared for me. I relied on what they told me. One had a lower price but did not tell what shingles they were going to use. Alabama Discount Roofing also gave me a five year labor and workmanship Leak Free Warranty while the other two gave me a two year Warranty. I made a choice to go with Alabama Discount Roofing and the Architectural shingles. The materials were delivered a day before and the next day, on 11/09/ 2016 before 7:00 am, the workers arrived. They were organized, worked fast and each one seemed to know what he was doing on the site. I had a few question and they answered my questions or I called Marc and he explained.  Since I was at work, Marc made sure he sent photos of the progress and at the end he sent me more pictures of the completed job. Marc did not ask me to pay up front and this made me more comfortable. The cleaning was amazing. I have not found any nails or debris left behind. It seems like they were never here. At the end of day, I met with Marc and he made sure I had no further questions or concerns. Would I recommend this company to any one? Absolutely yes, this is a professional company with a personal touch. Excellent customer service and my estimates and the actual cost were not far apart.\nVL", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890f1c0c45fdd7:0xe897e4d03dcb5ebe"}

Will recommend to everyone who needs a roof replacement in the future.\n\nI wanted to add to my first review, because I needed to add to how great my experience has been with Cardinal Roofing. I have had two roofs replaced now with Cardinal Roofing. Both were done with the same crew but a few months apart. The second roof was my personal house. The crew came early and worked hard all day long through hot temperatures, muggy conditions, and rain off and on. With only one small break in the middle for lunch the crew worked until they could see no more, then came the next day and finished the job up. The roof looks amazing. The crew worked with precision and accuracy that I have not seen before. I have had roof work done in the past to some of my rentals and the experience was not good. This time was different. From beginning to end I was treated with respect and valued as if they were replacing someone in their own family\u2019s roof. Anthony Gioiosa, who is a representative for Cardinal Roofing, saw the job through from beginning to end, handled all of my concerns with professionalism and grace that has exceeded all of my expectations.

Jason Smith was always more than punctual, helpful with every step of the process, and laid out every minute detail for us as this was a roof for a multi-level 4,500 sq. ft. house. If it had not been for Jason Smith, we might not have our brand new roof in the fast amount of time it came together. He noticed extremely significant hail damage to my roof that likely meant replacing the entire roof. I was surprised that a roof on this size of a house could be completely torn off, plywood repaired or replaced, with all new shingles, flashing and vents put on in one single day, but that is what happened. A week later we were visited by inspector Mac, who answered questions I had concerning 2 spots on the roof where I saw some materials I had questions about. He got on the roof, took pictures, and came down to explain theses to me, and I was totally satisfied. It can be scary as a homeowner to take on such a massive and costly project, move the family and animals out of the house for a couple of days, and hope you've chosen the right company for the job. After my first meeting with Jason Smith I had no doubt that I could cancel all other roofing contractors I had called for appointments and go with Cardinal Roofing, due to his extreme efficiency, professionalism, and thorough knowledge of all aspects of the roof repair. From consulting with insurance (which he has immense amount of experience doing) to the step-by-step process of the installation, even down to telling me how and when to have my TV satellite dish reinstalled (and not on our beautiful new roof due to leaks/damage the bolts could cause), Jason brought us all information we never even knew we would need to know about a roof installation. Our satellite dish now lives happily installed in our yard on the ground. There was an army of persons installing our roof in 90 degree heat, and they worked very efficiently and very hard. Within 2 days after the roof was on and complete, someone had swept my entire property with large magnets to gather up roofing nails and other debris scattered about from the install. I did a thorough look over my driveway when I returned to make sure no nails were left that could cause my car to get a flat tire. They had gotten every single one. Within a week after the roof was completed all materials - extra tarp, shingle boxes, plywood, etc., were removed from my property by Cardinal Roofing. I cannot express enough that Jason Smith and those at Cardinal Roofing were professional, punctual, and always available to answer any question I had, via phone call or text message. Jason Smith is invaluable to the company. We are so grateful to give our house a much-needed update, better living for our family, more equity, a facelift due to a change of color from a dated orange roof, and most importantly, zero leaks. I am forever grateful to Jason and Cardinal Roofing and would highly, HIGHLY recommend them to anyone and everyone whoever asks me about a roofing job on any scale. Also, Jason never asked me himself, but I contacted him and insisted that he put a Cardinal Roofing sign in my yard when they were completed, so that others in the neighborhood knew who did this beautiful and very fast, excellent quality job on such a large house.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1598366476517, "text": "Sadie, we're a little late here, but THANK YOU for your kind review!

The actual work contracted, putting on the roof, I guess we'll see in the years to come but the behavior and ethics of this company are known and it is not a good story.  Originally they did not think the Insurance company was going to fully pay out the policy so they gave me a cash quote and fully expected to leave that in place after the insurance company decided to pay fully (after repeated harassing by me).    Mary Margaret spoke of it while standing in my front yard as the third inspection took place.   That even if they did decide to pay out fully that the original quote was valid and that we were \"technically\" committing fraud.  She had no issues with it, even mentioning that I would make out nicely.   I admit I was ignorant and perhaps complicit about learning the subtleties of the arrangement.   I got scared when I fully realized what was at stake and full disclosure was weighing my options at that point.  I had decided that 1500 bucks or whatever it was going to be was not worth the penalties and possible ramifications.  Cardinal needed to send in a completion certificate.  After avoiding my calls for two days Mary finally answered the phone.  I needed to know what they needed to send in the certificate and what was the final total given the insurance company estimate.  Mary encouraged me to call them and defraud them by telling them I could not wait for the certificate.   I immediately sent in the full amount to Cardinal as I knew at that moment Cardinal was without ethics and could not be trusted.  CYA was in full effect.    Then to put the cherry on top, they did send in the certificate but now my insurance company notified me that the full amount, or what I thought it was, was not correct.  That I had overpaid Cardinal.  My insurance company told me that, not Cardinal and they had no intention of telling me.  So I called them and let them know that I needed my refund immediately.  The owner, Jody, feigned ignorance and defiantly \"objected\" to my insinuation of impropriety.    The problem folks?   I have every text, every document and most importantly every phone call documented and recorded.  I have the audio.   This is not a question of right and wrong.  Cardinal was going to defraud my insurance company and complicit or not initially, I was not.  I was however not going to allow them to defraud me.  I would stay very far away from these people.  If you see them chasing ambulances in your neighborhood understand these people are not ethical nor honest.\n\nJody, I have the audio.  Feel free to ring me up and give me your email address.  I'll be happy to send you copies.\n\nIf you read this far and are confused at all the other positive reviews notice one thing.  They haven't responded to this review to refute it and I never heard another peep from them when they realized I had the proof.\n\nFinally, look at the review profiles of the reviewers on here.  Lots of them Cardinal is their only review.  Doesn't take a genius to understand why.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bf8c5ba182d:0x85468b64203ed855"}

Steve also corrected a water trap area.   Finally, we elected to replace the gutters and install ridgeline/soffit vents to our older home.  On Steve Whites initial visit, he listened to our concerns and needs and did a thorough roof inspection.  He came off the roof and laid out what and how his team would complete the work, which also included the quality of materials they use beyond just the shingles/paper itself.   All the work was done by Steve and his crew.  We were most pleased and recommend you give Bill White Roofing (Steve White) a call if you have roof issues.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1527711082562, "text": "Thank you so much, Robert.
