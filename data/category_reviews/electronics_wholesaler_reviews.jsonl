He asked me to describe the symptoms that my Samsung Plasma was experiencing.  Rather than just sell me the part as so many sites have done (I've replaced almost every board in the tv so far)He ran me through a common fix (soldering issue) and asked me to call him back to let him know how I made out.  The fix worked and cost me nothing.  I have been talking to a local repair shop and I never got this kind of service.\n\nGood for Huntsville to have his shop and customer service!\n\nOn another note, through just everyday conversation (I am Canadian), I learned that his son is a Doctor in that area.    I'm sure his \"customer service\" has been handed down!!!\n\nThanks So Much!!!!!\n\nRandy D\nQuispamsis, NB, Canada", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626c91ace66e75:0x2a7c52a029550669"}
