I asked about prices for the procedure and inquired about getting an implant down the road. The lady I spoke with gave me a quote for everything including the bone graph required to have an implant done when healed. The price she gave me was $415, I do have dental insurance, but it still seemed lower than I was expecting. I asked her again to make sure I heard her correctly and wrote down everything she told me. Well I get there this morning and the Dr comes in to go over everything they are going to do and then another lady comes in to go over pricing again and get my payment info. She informs me that she saw the quote I was given in my notes, but she didn't know where the other lady had gotten those figures because they were not correct. She informs me it was going to be $992 for the exact same thing I was already quoted the much lower price of. I told her that I was not paying that price so she does some figuring on the computer and tells me $650ish without the bone graph to which I replied, I'm still not paying that price, she needs to go talk to the lady who quoted me the other price. She walks out for a few minutes and comes back in and says the other lady is not there today, but they can do everything but the graph for $476. I declined that price again and told her they should have to honor the price I was quoted, especially if it was in my notes. She said they could not do that, that it was just an estimate. Well I'm sorry, being quoted one price weeks ago only to get there today and it has more than doubled, is not an estimate to me. They never said it was an estimate, they specifically used the word quote! Needless to say, I am still dealing with a broken tooth because I refuse to pay more than double what I was told it was going to cost me out of pocket.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a83fef37800d:0x51e8a2ea70656792"}

I have a rare genetic disease that unfortunately my daughter has the gene for and if not carefully watched certain medications given can turn the gene into the disease. I wasn\u2019t informed what type of medications they planned to give her prior to the procedure when I asked to know the nurse seemed to have an attitude and reluctantly told me to come back to see. While back there talking about the list with the doctor the incompetent nurse proceeded to start my daughters I.V. Instead of at least waiting until we had finished determining if the medications were indeed okay all while rolling her eyes. Which was so disrespectful I can\u2019t even imagine how such a person in a field of care could show such disregard but I guess that\u2019s how she was raised to be. I\u2019m not sure. However, there are two office staff members that are always most helpful that sit on the side. The lady at the front when you walk in was not very thorough she didn\u2019t make sure I had the cost information prior to the day of the procedure in writing (I had to ask for it as well as the code explanations), she also didn\u2019t make sure my daughter had an excuse for school but did offer one to the Caucasian lady that came in after me just not to me for some reason \ud83d\ude12. However the lovely lady on the side provided what I needed which I am most grateful for. As I said there are good staff members it\u2019s just probably half good, half bad but the doctor was nice 50% of his staff I would say need some serious retraining and empathy towards others if they are going to stay in that field or look for another industry where care isn\u2019t essential.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886213520971870f:0x1444005ad0a93d19"}

His arrogance and lack of empathy made for terrible bedside manner. After removing all four of our 16 year old daughters wisdom teeth on July 3rd, she was in recovery longer than anticipated. I waited patiently until I was called back to sit with her. She apparently hadn\u2019t  tolerated the  Anastasia well. They released her to be taken home while her eyes were literally still rolling back in her head as the nurses walked her out. Over the long holiday weekend, dry sockets formed. I realize this is something that sometimes happens and isn\u2019t necessarily the fault of the surgeon. My daughter was in agony, with pain medication doing nothing to dull her pain. When I called the after hours emergency number, listed on the discharge instructions sheet provided to us, they were completely useless. I seriously don\u2019t even know why they have one. I was rudely told twice, once by the after hours staff member who answered the phone and again by Dr. Hudson himself to \u201ccall the office during regular business hours to schedule an appointment. \u201c  At that point, I debated going on to the ER, but decided to have her at Dr. Hudson office as soon as they opened the following morning. We arrived 15 minutes prior to opening, signed in 2nd, only to be \u201cworked in\u201d to the schedule. While my daughter sat in the waiting room in misery, no urgent attention was shown. When we were finally called back, dr. Hudson examined and packed a bottom socket. My daughter did not receive relief as the dr. and his staff insisted she would. She kept trying to tell them the pain was coming from the upper socket which Dr Hudson and his assistant would NOT hear of, nor would he even look at.  They told us repeatedly she was wrong, and the pain she felt wasn\u2019t coming from the upper socket, bc it was basically unheard of to develop an upper dry socket. They also repeatedly tried to get us to leave,  saying she would feel better in 15-30 minutes. I finally stated that I wasn\u2019t leaving with her until I knew she was relieved. Dr. Hudson then SHOVED his hand into the top of her mouth asking \u201cis THIS where you\u2019re uncomfortable?!?\u201d She grimaced and moaned in pain and tears flowed. Even I began crying just watching the scene. I absolutely was in shock and disbelief at what had just happened. Then, he stepped back and admitted it appeared to be an upper dry socket. He also admitted he couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d packed an upper, and that he didn\u2019t know that he ever had. Once it was packed, she did get relief from the pain within a few minutes. I suppose Dr. Clint Hudson is an adequate surgeon so long as the patient doesn\u2019t have any complications from the surgery, and if the complications aren\u2019t rare or unusual. If there are complications, better hope they only occur during regular office hours. Since there is no way of knowing beforehand if these will occur, I\u2019d suggest finding a different oral surgeon. I believe in giving credit where it is due, and there was an assistant who works for Dr. Hudson named Micki who was very sweet and sympathetic. On the flip side, another who I believe name was Jan was as rude and uncaring as the Dr. himself.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886213520971870f:0x1444005ad0a93d19"}

I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to have the Oral and Maxiofillial surgeons of this group care for my oral surgery needs for many, many years and I have yet to have anything but excellent experiences.\nDr. Davis is now retired but while he was practicing he performed oral surgery and placed several implants for me over a period of years. Drs. Davis and Bess, in consultation with my dentist Dr. Dollar, also surgically moved my jaw forward correcting my bite and very successfully relieved the jaw pain and headaches the misalignment had caused.\nIn the last several years Dr. Falconer has placed five implants for me and I have found him to be as personable, kind and caring a professional as was Dr. Davis.\nI also want to commend the excellent staff who keep this very busy office running so smoothly. Each of them is pleasant and eager to assist the patients and their family whether in person or by telephone.\nLast but certainly not least, I cannot say enough positive things about Ms. Shelley, the implant co-ordinator for this practice. Over the the last few years Ms. Shelley has worked with me tirelessly, helping me with scheduling, sometimes rescheduling appointments, solving co-ordination and communication problems with a \u201cformer, less than cooperative\u201d dentist\u2019s office I switched to when we moved away from the area, and keeping me knowledgable enough to make intelligent financial decisions about lost teeth. This young woman is very kind and caring, always pleasant and helpful and such a nice person!\nWe drive two hours each way to be able to use this surgery group and I consider it worth every mile we travel which should tell you how highly I recommend them.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88928d997ff66937:0xad7d8bf04b1c4cf6"}

The office is very nice, VERY efficient (we were in an out within an hour), and the Dr. himself seems attentive, and even called to check in on us that evening.

I have no knowledge of how to care for oral postop things, but my mom's a nurse so i know these things can go smoothly or horribly depending on the patient's choices after surgery - behavior that is usually informed by the advise of medical staff, since the general populace is presumably ignorant (safest assumption). I asked if I needed to replace the gauze as soon as we got home, and was about to ask what all he needed to avoid doing. The nurse quickly said, cordially but also sharply such that she cut me off before i could ask, \"everything you need to know is written on this sheet\" and told me to call if I had questions. Well, long story short he ended up using a straw and doing a few other things I had no idea he wasn't supposed to, because i didn't //know// those were things i needed to ask about, and the sheet made no mention of any of them. I am now unsure how much of his pain is a natural consequence, and how much is our fault. So now we're keeping an eye on, questioning every symptom, which is stressful for both of us.

During that time, the intent was to keep my teeth and gums as healthy as possible. Regularly scheduled deep cleaning worked. However, my doctor retired and the new staff had different ideas. The regularly scheduled deep cleaning was no longer an option, and within a couple of years my teeth deteriorated to the point where it was embarrassing to even smile. The new staff recommended extractions, at first only a few teeth. Ultimately, they planned to extract all my teeth and do implants. I agreed to have the first three teeth extracted. That was the beginning of a horrible time for me. After the extractions I bled profusely and was in a lot of pain. For two weeks I continued to bleed on and off. I was frightened ,I could not eat, and I was miserable. As time passed it didn't get much better, and I was not myself, as I was normally very outgoing and talkative, but now became very uncomfortable around people. The staff then recommended extracting the rest of my teeth and doing implants. But I was afraid of what might happen after the last experience. I thought, \"if I bled so profusely from 3 extractions, how would my body react to all my teeth being extracted\". The thoughts going through my head were all scary and uncertain. I sought out other opinions, but did not have a good feeling with anyone. Finally, in late 2016, I met with Dr. Sam Nizam. When we met, I immediately felt the connection, and I was comfortable. Dr. Sam listened to all my concerns attentively. I knew the qualities in a doctor that I was looking for and Dr. Sam had all of them. Dr. Sam sat me down and explained step by step what he recommended and how the procedures would be done. He was so calm and confident, and did not sugar coat anything. He explained that I needed 26 extractions, and why. He explained that I needed bone grafting for the implants to take, where he would need to do the grafting, and why. He explained that I needed a sinus lift, and where and why. Also, he showed me visually on the computer and pointed out exactly where my implants would be placed, to have the best chance of success. He explained how all procedures would be done at the same time. I was still nervous about the whole process, but I had total confidence in Dr. Sam and agreed to schedule it as soon as possible. It was February, 2018. I was in surgery for 5 1/2 hours. He performed all the work that he had explained to me. I went home, knowing I was in good hands and that I was going to be fine. But I was just a little nervous, thinking I might bleed. Dr. Sam prescribed pain killers, which I took that night and went to sleep. I awoke after a peaceful night sleep. My bleeding was the size of a dime!. I had minimal pain. I stopped taking the pain killers. I went back for a follow up. Dr. Sam was pleased with the results and so was I. No pain, no bleeding, the implants (all 11 of them) all took. I now have new teeth. I can smile again. I can speak without fear and embarrassment. At my daughter's wedding I was able to proudly smile and laugh all night! Dr. Sam gave me my life back! I am myself again! Thank you!! I will always be grateful to Dr. Sam for the incredible work he did, that now gives me the chance to enjoy life as I had not been able to do for so long. If I ever have a problem, even though I now live many states away in New Jersey, I would not hesitate to make the trip. I recommend Dr. Sam highly . He has been blessed with a tremendous talent and gift to help people.

Not once did they say out loud they forgot anything, they just quietly whisked him back and seemed to want to keep everything hush hush (again, trying to leave early).

You seemed young and cool and when the dental assistant suggested using a bite block/dental dam (padding) to help rest my jaw, you told he you didn't usually use those and didn't need it. (No one asked the patient)\nAfter FIVE needle sticks to the area, one of the injections hitting a nerve that sent an electrical shock through my head and neck... I was getting a little nervous. But I told myself, simple replacing an old filling, she seems nice.\nDuring the procedure, the dental assistant repeatedly suggested you use a bite block or wedge to help keep my mouth open so there wouldn't be a need to push my jaw down so far.\nI couldn't Feel anything after the 5 shots, but as you pushed down on my jaw to drill, I heard my jaw make a loud POP Twice through my head and it made me shutter.\nSince I couldn't Feel anything I didn't know how severe the damage was, just knew I could no longer open my mouth at all the next day. Called the office and was told it might be sore for a couple of days.\nI could barely get a straw in my mouth for days, finally had x-rays by an oral surgeon and was told the ligaments were completely torn loose and I would NEVER open my mouth again without surgical repair of Both jaws.\nThat was just the beginning of a long painful process to then recover from an oral surgery that never needed to happen if the filling were done with more care and awareness. After the jaw surgery, i spent 3 Months off work in constant pain, 6 more months trying to work in constant pain. For over 9 months, there was not one day that I didn't sit and Cry in pain and frustration. Over 9 months i could eat nothing but pudding, jello, mashed potatoes and applesauce. It took Over 2 long years of intense physical therapy to open my mouth to just a few millimeters.\nIt changed the course of rest of my life in many ways.\nI had planned to get invisible braces after that filling replacement, but couldnt open my mouth enough to have any further dental work done for over 3 years.\nMy mouth suffered, even my voice - I can't speak as loudly as I used to, everyone says I sound like I'm mumbling now.\nThat horrible life changing day was about 10 years ago and I've had to get used to a different life.\nI got NOTHING for all my pain and suffering, not even an apology from you personally.\nThe next time I asked to speak to you they said you were just helping out and were no longer with their practice.\nNOW I have huge bone masses growing above my gum line due to clenching from the jaw pain, and am told I need to have extra bone growth surgically removed.\nCan you believe my current dental office just referred me to YOU for the surgery for oral surgery?\nShes young and had no idea, but she does now! Not only has this been costly to me physically, emotionally, financially, but it also affected my career in the long run and its still causing more medical problems to require additional surgeries.\nOne dental visit with a young upcoming dentist to replace a filling, changed my life forever, put me through an unexpected nightmare, and I'm still paying for it.\nI'm beyond disappointed, I'm completely devastated.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1554417917546, "text": "Tams Bunn-\nWe are sorry to hear about your experience having a filling placed.

My appointment was the day I got back from driving for 13 hours due to family emergency and I was told I would only have to pay a cancelation fee if I scheduled another appointment. Well they lied and reported it to credit and added on a 90 dollar cancelation fee when I called and canceled and had no intentions on rescheduling with a dentist who charges so much and refuses to do local anesthesia.

My consultation with Dr. Parker lasted maybe one minute, leaving me more nervous than I previously was to get my wisdom teeth removed. This was my first time ever being put under for a procedure, so the lack of connection and trust I felt with the doctor did not sit well with me. My other complaint is in regards to how I was treated on procedure day. First, my wait time was astronomical: probably 3-4 hours, which is a horrendous wait prior to a fasted procedure. When I was woken up post-procedure, I was basically yanked out of my chair as soon as I could open my eyes. Due to the meds, I couldn\u2019t walk at all and was dragged to my car by two nurses on either side of me, catching me as I fell. It would have been nice to have been given 5-10 minutes to wake up and regain consciousness before being forced to walk. It made me feel like this place prioritizes being a wisdom tooth factory rather than caring for their patients.

From the moment we walked in the door, we were greeting with compassion and understanding, and assured that they could fix her crowns.  They immediately scheduled an appoint for that same week to do her evaluation.  In that first appointment, Dr. Wilson laid out exactly what needed to be done, gave us a time frame for the work to be completed with cost estimates, and hand made her a set of temporaries that looked better than any of the final crowns from the other dentists we had worked with.  He performed laser dentistry on her gums to give her a bigger smile, used the KOR whitening system to give her a bright white color to her teeth, and put on two new crowns that he gets from a lab in Hollywood, CA.  I can proudly say today that my wife has a beautiful smile that she is so proud of thanks to the work of Dr. Wilson and his staff at Signature Smiles.

I scheduled my appointment with the dental rep and asked what I could expect. She told me to plan to be there about an hour. They would clean, polish and then give me the Sheer Whitening treatments. Wow, I thought, pretty good prize. I proceeded to ask what kind of whitening treatments they used, 5 day strips, ugh, I thought, oh well.\n\nUnfortunately, I arrived for my appointment about 10 minutes late, however, not intentional. The receptionist was a bit unfriendly and I thought maybe it was because I was late. Shortly, a dental assistant came to me with a clip board and 5 pages to fill out. I completed my basic information and soon realized they were wanting more info than was totally necessary to claim a prize. I began scanning over the pages and stopped immediately. They were asking me everything from signing to consent to pay for the charges they would render to me today and insurance could not be filed to authorizing them to obtain my dental records from my current dentist. I proceeded to the receptionist and told her there was obviously a mistake, I was asked to fill out patient paperwork and that I was only there to redeem my gift certificate. She told me to proceed completing the paperwork so that they could keep it on file. I looked at her in disbelief and sat back down placing the pen under the clip. I guess she signaled the assistant who came out and retrieved my paperwork. I waited for over 30 minutes before they called me back. I followed the assistant back to a dental room and she handed me a box of strips and about 5 minutes of instruction. Do you have any questions? I said, \"Are we done?\", she said yes that's it. Hmm, so they led me to believe that the cleaning and polishing were part of my prize when really they were going to bill me for this when they were finished. I guess I didn't fall for their trap. Talk about deceitful, a good reputable business does not do business this way. I will not be back. I will still use my strips, but could have got them at Wal-mart for $12.00. What a joke.

However, when I first switched to Northcutt, it was because my previous dentist retired.  I was told that a filling I had received needed to be replaced.  I was reluctant, because it wasn't giving me any pain or problems, but I had it replaced.  After the replacement, the dentist said he needed to replace his own work (no charge)  so he did.  Then I started having a lot of pain from the 2nd replacement.  He worked on it a 3rd time.  The last time I went in, he expressed that the whole tooth needed to be crowned - lest I eventually need a full root canal.

Like I said probably my own fault for trusting someone else to have my best interest in mind and to be on top of something like that but lesson very painfully learned.)\n\nOriginal review\n\nI have terrible dental anxiety but everyone at Deerfoot Dental has gone above and beyond to help ease that.

We came to find out that most dentists are closed on Friday..and it was Thursday evening when this occurred. My son has been a patient at Deerfoot Dental since his teeth really started coming through. We left a message after hours and Dr. Grovestein called us back! He asked us to text him photos of my sons teeth. We sent the pics and he called us back. He reassured us that it probably wasn\u2019t as bad as it seems and he would meet us at his office the next morning. So he opened his clinic for us on his day off! I mean who does that? He gave us instructions to care for the tooth, we made a follow up appointment, and left. Needless to say..our sons tooth looks great. It actually straightened out almost back to its original spot. We went to our follow up appointment and got the good news that his teeth looked great and to just keep a watch on it.

But I trusted him and he did 2 fillings and the 3rd filling he just put a deep hole in my bottom tooth and sent me home. When I got home I realized there was a big deep open hole in my tooth. So I go back up there to have it filled. The dentist said out loud, \"why did I do that?\" Which lets me know he messed up. While he was sticking needles in my mouth to numb everything, which never got numb, he hit one of my top teeth with the needle and made a hole. The whole procedure was so incredibly painful and they just kept going. So now I have to get that hole fixed plus the tooth he put a deep hole in then filled, it still hurts. Also while drilling he hit so many surrounding teeth with the drill, made punctures and grooves in teeth that are now sensitive.  I can't chew  anything even a little bit crunchy on the right side of my mouth.  When I called asking for a refund nobody ever got back with me and they feel like they did everything right.

When I got out to the car she had black all over her teeth, all over her mouth, splattered all of her arms, and on her brand new jeans she was wearing. The second time I took my sixteen year old daughter to have a filling done. She was flossing two days later and the filling came out. She had to have shots in her mouth again to fix it. Never has there been an apology. I was told my youngest daughter could wash the black splatters off with soap and water that she smeared all over herself. It was not smeared. You could see were it landed all over her from them working on her mouth. This place is ridiculous.

I felt very comfortable discussing my dental issue with him.\n\nNo dental procedure is ever \u201cfun\u201c - especially when a tooth must be extracted, but the procedure was done in a second it seemed. Of course, I asked to be sedated so I didn\u2019t feel a thing! Everything went very well!

I\u2019m currently in the process of  healing and waiting for the implant procedure. Everything\u2019s gone exactly as planned and I\u2019ve had zero issues.\n\nI would absolutely recommend 100%. If you\u2019re fearful in seeing an oral surgeon, don\u2019t be. Don\u2019t ignore the pain, McLain Surgical Arts will take great care of you! Waiting only makes matters worse. I needed this procedure done a few months ago but due to Covid I was afraid to see a doctor. The entire staff follow CDC Covid procedures.

Everyone was telling me it was a very unpleasant procedure, but they were wrong in this case!. The doctor made me wait an extra five minutes on the anesthesia to make doubly sure I was completely numb, which I appreciated. Basically, he didn't try to  rush this at my expense.  And, I felt zero pain, not even any discomfort at all!  Even my stitches (which will dissolve) haven't bothered me.\nMy husband drove me home, but I could have driven myself, since I didn't even have the expected bleeding.  The anesthesia just barely started wearing off after I'd already taken my first prescription for pain medication, and so I never suffered at all. When I woke up the next morning, I was prepared to take more pain medication, but I realized I didn't need it and never took any more. What a pleasant surprise.\nDr. McLain personally called me the same evening to find out if I was doing okay.\nAlso, the actual wound was closed up so neatly, you could barely even see it.  Maybe that's because the doctor is also a cosmetic surgeon.  After this experience, I would wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Mclain to anyone. Quick, and painless, and NO complications.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8856b02e07bd080b:0x848b08352409d8b0"}
