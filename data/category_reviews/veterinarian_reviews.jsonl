As of 11-20-20, we have had to close our doors and the entire staff go into quarantine until 12-1-20 due to an exposure to CoVID.  We had been taking emergencies and new clients, but only the patient that needs the treatment has been allowed in, much like our human hospitals are doing. Unfortunately, this is not being followed uniformly and the lack of control of CoVID is evident. We all are unhappy with many of the  the situations we find ourselves in during this pandemic, but the protection of human health and life outweighs the sacrifices we must make in order to slow the spread of this disease. The pandemic has created a lot of uneasiness, fear, anxiety and frustration throughout our area, state, nation and world. I am sorry you felt it necessary to give us a one star rating.

The price to neuter a cat at our clinic is actually $150.\nIt is important to compare apples to apples with quoted pricing. There are subsidized spay and neuter clinics that will be less expensive. In addition, many quotes do not include pain medication (during surgery and to go home) and intravenous catheters (critical in the case of possible but rare emergencies). In addition, is the patient intubated (this allows us to keep the patient under anesthesia longer if there is a problem such as excess bleeding and allows us rapid access for CPR if needed), and are the patients\u2019 vitals being monitored before, during, and after surgery? These are standard procedures and best practices at Auburn Oaks Animal Clinic.  All of these are important considerations when selecting someone to perform surgery on your beloved pet.  The most common time for a young patient to be lost is after surgery due to improper or lack of monitoring.\nWe welcome this opportunity to address the topics that you have raised in your review. Our goal at Auburn Oaks Animal Clinic is to be a full service animal clinic that provides the highest quality care available for our clients and patients by using the latest procedural techniques and medical therapies, state- of-the-art monitoring equipment, thorough diagnostics, and most importantly by making ourselves available for follow-up during and after hours.  Unfortunately, we cannot provide all of this with the sole goal of being the least expensive on a particular procedure. We do put a priority on making ongoing care affordable. I encourage you to compare our pricing on vaccines, commonly used medications such as Rimadyl, Apoquel, Cytopoint and preventatives such as Bravecto, Revolution to others in the area, including Chewy and 1-800 Petmeds.  You will find that Auburn Oaks Animal Clinic is very competitive and less expensive than many others. Please take the time to come meet us and take a tour of our facility.\nSincerely,\nMatt Sullivan, DVM"}, "gmap_id": "0x888c8d4c2b6029e3:0xafa44777bb3f2835"}

When I went to pay my bill I was pleasantly surprised. Dr. Ryder doesn't always make us come in to pay a dr's visit every time either. There has been a few occasions when they were able to call in some meds for him. I have seen the same vet for years and to be honest I wish I had been using Countryside Vet the whole time.

On Thursday, you dropped your cat off to be spayed and requested that she receive all vaccinations recommended for an outdoor cat. We spayed her and gave her a rabies vaccine, feline distemper vaccine, and feline leukemia vaccine. We did not test her for feline leukemia. It is not our office policy to test all adult cats. A feline leukemia test is $50. If you check your invoice, I think you will find that this procedure was not done. We make every effort to ensure that we follow the client's requests to the best of our ability. On Friday, your wife brought in 4 kittens for their first vaccinations and deworming. They each received a thorough physical exam, their first feline distemper vaccine, and a dose of dewormer. A 20% discount was applied to the vaccinations because you have 4 kittens. Your wife paid the entire bill at checkout. Angel was the receptionist that you spoke with on Thursday when you dropped off your cat for surgery as well as who you spoke to on the phone when you called back with concerns over the bill. Angel is one of our lead receptionists and does her very best to ensure that all of our clients are happy and their needs are met. Prior to this visit, you had not been in our office since 2016.

In the State of Alabama, state statues do not allow a case to be handled as you describe. Likewise, it is against the Veterinary Oath and Veterinary Medical Ethics. I know the law well since i served on the Alabama State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners for many years. There are mechanisms in place with that board to file a formal complaint against  any practicing veterinarian in Alabama. I encourage you to file such a complaint if an event such as you described actually occurred with me or any other veterinarian. I can assure you a full and formal investigation will be made. If the events you described did not actually occur at my office or did not occur at all or if you do not actually exist, I demand an immediate and public apology. If all of this is a figment of your imagination, I encourage you to seek professional help.  Sincerely,  Dr. Welch"}, "gmap_id": "0x888c27caca3d9171:0xe1b703f76349727c"}

Instead of just giving me eardrops and nothing else, the vet, Dr. Jordan, explained exactly what was wrong and wht it was an issue. They made sure to have me bring him in each week to check on his ears. And everytime, the vet tech has been able to get stuff out and report back on his condition. I believe everyone there really cares for the well being of each animal they see. Another nice thing is that appointments are usually staggered, and I don't have to wait long or with a bunch of other animals that might scare kitty even more.

She told me they couldn't fit our 17 yr. canine's emergency into the \"schedule\" for that day because they were all booked up.  \"No openings\" she said. Even worse, she didn't refer me to any other veterinarian or emergency clinic for him.\nWe did find another clinic that day that welcomed us with open arms.

I told the assistant about a sore on the tip of my dogs tail from wagging and hitting items she said the doctor would look at it.  They both returned I mentioned the tail again & he said it was common (which I knew), listened to her chest, gave vaccination and preceded to leave.  I asks what about her tail he replied to put some tape on it, then left.  I go to pay for the shot and it was 2x the amount I saw on the internet.  The office clerk stated they did not have a website, she got Dr. Renfroe and he stated the same, then ducked back behind the lobby door.  While paying I told the clerk that they should address the incorrect information along with all the negative reviews that were posted.  She said \"IT DOES NOT MATTER--HE DOES NOT CARE\" I told her it was obvious and I would not be returning with any of my pets.\nThe building looks as if maintenance has been deferred for many years and seeing the pics in side from patients it nice long ago.

Somehow between keeping our dog for 8 hours, charging us 400$ just for bloodwork and X-rays, he failed to notice the 5 pound tumor on our dogs spleen. The tumor caused our dogs spleen to rupture in which we took to another vet in town, who was amazing and their entire staff treated us with the upmost respect and professionalism. They had to do emergency surgery for which our pup didn\u2019t make it. Aside from overcharging us, and missing the key diagnoses for the situation, he was extremely disrespectful and unprofessional to my wife and I. His passive aggressive, sarcastic remarks all of which regarding money, were almost overwhelming. Not to mention that he didn\u2019t even send any meds home with us to help my dog. Neither myself nor anyone I know in our community will be using this vet ever again. He really needs to do some self reflection and learn how to be respectful and professional all the way around.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1607195277424, "text": "Mr. Burgamy,\nWe were perplexed by your scathing review because as you left our office on Monday, Nov. 30th you thanked us repeatedly for all we had done and assured Dr. Johnston and the rest of the staff that Cooper would be returning the next day for the free treatment that had been offered. We were even more surprised by the hostile text from your father that was sent to Dr. Johnston after hours. Thankfully, your father was willing to answer our phone calls and understood our position. It has come to my attention that you may have heard a briefing between the vet and staff, which is often much blunter than the conversation between a vet and the client by necessity. Unfortunately, I believe that this misunderstanding may be the source of this perplexing review. Our staff would never speak to a client in the same manner as they do to each other as we understand that clients do not handle these situations on a regular basis. All conversation that has taken place between you and the staff at Pike Animal has been compassionate and courteous up to this point.\nI would like to assure you that our staff does not bring up money unless asked to do so by the client. We did everything in our power to help you and Cooper. I would like to remind you that we did not only offer ICU care for Cooper, which was declined, we also offered 7 days of free out-patient treatment which was also declined. We highly doubt that your other vet offered any free treatment for Cooper.\nIn veterinary medicine, there are many variables. Cooper presented as a 12-year-old Lab who could not walk; therefore, we were searching for hip dysplasia. Dr. Johnston informed you gently that as we ran more tests more health issues would be found due to Cooper\u2019s age and pre-existing health conditions. Once initial diagnostic testing had been run, Dr. Johnston did inform you that Cooper\u2019s prognosis for recovery was poor. Pike Animal Hospital and Dr. Johnston do not make these calls lightly and run every diagnostic test necessary before coming to this kind of conclusion.\nOur heart goes out to you for the loss of your beloved pet. It is unfortunate that you cannot find it in your heart to see things clearly at this time and have chosen to accuse Pike Animal Hospital of any form of neglect or misdiagnoses when so much was offered to you in kindness. We have attempted to reach out and extend our condolences as well as hear your feedback and try to put to rest any miscommunications, however, we have been met with no response. It is regrettable that you misunderstand the situation and this review is all the more disappointing. Each case presented to us is different and as such we must customize treatment accordingly, which we attempted to do for Cooper and would have been able to do better had he returned for further treatment. Please bear in mind that Pike Animal Hospital did everything we could for Cooper. Cooper was a fine dog who the staff here at Pike Animal Hospital, especially Dr. Johnston, grew to love in his short time here. We would like to offer our condolences and hope that you will be grateful for the love and memories Cooper bestowed instead of looking for someone to blame for his loss."}, "gmap_id": "0x888ded6dff28b8ed:0xdf0940acbba4f090"}

I lost a Toy Poodle that I was told had pyometra and needed to be spayed immediately. I took her in and she was extremely sick. I went to visit her, and they had her in the boarding runs, surrounded by barking dogs. I asked for her to be moved to a more quiet place, so they moved her to the cat room. A couple of days later, I came to visit her again, and they had her in a \"parvo\" kennel that was being used for storage. She died shortly after that visit.\n\nA couple of years later, I brought a Heeler in because she was throwing up. Same scenario--pyometra. They spayed her and her health continued to decline. After a few days, she was stable enough to come home. When my husband got there to pick her up, Dr Johnston said she \"crashed\" when he took her IV out. A couple of days later, the doctor recommended that we euthanize her.\n\nI came in to pay my $1200 bill and pick up my dog's ashes,  and the doctor didn't even bother to talk to me. The young man at the desk apologized and hugged me. Then he handed me a stained pillowcase with a plastic bag full of ashes. I couldn't even get a list of procedures that they did on my Heeler.\n\nIt has taken me a long time to be able to write this review. Look around the clinic when you go in. There are used needles laying on counters and the place needs to be deep cleaned. The exam rooms are full of junk, so he uses the exam table in the middle, where the public has no business going.\n\nI've been to a lot of vet clinics, and have worked at a couple. This one is sad.

Since you have chosen to remain anonymous and this event occurred years ago, I have little recollection of the specific details. I do, however, remember you said you previously worked in vet clinics before. You were shown that my equipment is constantly upgraded and all approved treatment protocols were followed. You must still be grieving to write a scathing one star review so long after the event occurred. My heart goes out to you. I would have met you at the door with your ashes had I known you were here.\nI am also very sorry that you did not have your dogs spayed. That would have prevented the deadly pyometra, not the lack of a \"deep cleaning\" which all but brand new clinics require. To ensure transparency, we do encourage clients to watch us work on their pets in our treatment area. All treatment areas have surgical instruments and needles in them. If a client does not care to watch, they always have the option to wait in the lobby. Since the time of your visit we have an entire new staff. I have shown them your review in an effort to reemphasize the importance of client communication, compassion, cleanliness, and grief management. Sometimes during upgrades to our facility, we regrettably must utilizes all the storage space including the exam room and isolation ward. Sounds like you caught us at a very busy time and we made some mistakes in those areas, but unfortunately those things could not have prevented the tragic outcome. All animals I see get the best care I can provide. Tragically, they do not all survive and I have as much trouble accepting that as you  do.\nI have been practicing for 30 years now. Losing a patient gets hard every year. Online reviews are new to me. I take them all personally and would much rather speak in person. I am very accepting and open to constructive criticism.  As you can tell by the vast majority of my reviews, that my cherished clients are pleased. I know it is impossible to please everyone and save every pet, but I do try my hardest. It breaks my heart to know how you must feel to write this review after a loss so long ago. Again, I am sincerely sorry you are still grieving and I am hurting too.\nMy very best regards."}, "gmap_id": "0x888ded6dff28b8ed:0xdf0940acbba4f090"}

I had called ahead of time. It was 11:30 pm on Christmas day 2018 when vets are closed. Including ones that are listed on Google that say Emergency. I guess it is only for emergencies that happen during business hours only!  BUT NOT HERE!!! . At ER Specialty Animal Medical Center there is ALWAYS someone there to help when no other vet is!! Be assured they are there to help your baby!! I had ( keyword had ) a vet for 25 years or more that I kept telling them something was wrong. I kept asking questions wanting answers! We tend to know when things go wrong with our babies  or when something just isn't right but I kept getting told by my regular vet \" she is just old \" . Well it was more than just old!! She should NOT have had to suffer like she did for as long as she did!! A year!! My mistake was trusting my vet and not trusting my gut instinct and taking her here a long time ago !  IF ever you need a GREAT doctor who is knowledgeable and caring or if you have a gut feeling something is wrong and you do not get the right answer from your regular vet THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO DO NOT DO AS I DID JUST GO!! I appreciate EVERYONE who tried to save my baby girl Trixie!   Thank you ALL for making a very hard and painful situation a little easier and giving me the truth so that my baby did not have to suffer anymore! Believe me I will be back to have my other baby Zeno who is also 15 years old checked out because I know you all are the best! They have more equipment than most vets! I see many negative comments about price. All I can say is I have paid way more to save a my baby only to be told after wards that I need to put him to sleep which then added more cost!! These people care about your baby not money! It is my vet of over 25 years who is in it for the money! My heart is shattered to pieces but I know my baby is no longer suffering! Dr. Hinton explained every thing and answer all my questions no matter how many or how long it took!, They do not rush me into anything! Thank you does not seem like enough! I appreciate you all more than I could express or than you know!  Love you all! Thanks again!

The lack of empathy and/or compassion is embarrassingly evident and I feel ashamed for leaving my sweet cat here to suffer overnight. Not only did she end up having to be euthanized the next morning at her regular veterinarian, she suffered for almost 12 hours overnight in organ failure and it was never mentioned to me that there was a simple blood test to check for ethelyne glycol in her blood (common cause of poisoning in cats and she had been stuck in the garage inadvertently). I paid a significant amount of money for \u201cintensive care\u201d so she should have been offered the diagnostic test that could have ended her suffering if I would have known. The doctor specifically discussed with me the possibility of our cat ingesting a toxin, but failed to offer this simple but easy way to determine that. Even if there is a slight chance that they do not perform this simple 20 minute test, it should have been mentioned. By the time we discovered the truth, the window of time to take interventions had passed. My pet was offered no chance at survival. Although I do not blame this establishment for the original cause of our misfortune, they caused undue suffering and prolonged an extremely painful death. My heart is heavy for those who bring their pets here and have to deal with the indifference and lack of overall concern for not only the pet and their suffering, but the emotional trauma and heaviness of watching a pet struggle in pain. The ONLY thing I am grateful for is that my cat had a peaceful death in the comfort of the office of our vet instead of here. If I would have had been faced with the choice to euthanize my baby here, I would never have forgiven myself. The front desk staff was kind and understanding as I sat and sobbed with my animal who is now no longer with us. Four days before Christmas, I am left with only a huge dent in my bank account, a few tufts of her fur, and an empty pet carrier.

I don't usually post reviews, but this is unacceptable.  We were all traumatized over this diagnosis and in the end, our puppy was not injured at all.

The younger lady at the front desk laughed at my puppy\u2019s name, and did the same to another couple behind me . (Who where equally as stressed as me at the time.)\nNot only that but I witnessed a vet tech throw a dying dog on the exam table aggressively, with no descentcy to shut the door . She then began screaming the owners name rudely to everyone . I finally reminded her that no one in here I\u2019ve seen owns that dog . Later I find out it passed away, before  the owners could get there they again left the door wide open with zero consideration for those poor people .\nSo, now my dog is being seen . All of the vet techs where snarky, rude, and  ESPECIALLY unhelpful . The large Ogre of a woman especially . I suppose she had to make up for looks with a nastier attitude .\nAnyway, my dog is taken from me. To the back, where I\u2019ve seen multiple dead dogs and crying owners come from . She just takes him by the leash and leaves . My dog wasn\u2019t returned until 3 hours later . The male vet comes in looked me up and down many times, side glanced my husband while talking to us, suggests my dog has parvo only bc of age . And walks out . A tech finally comes back in,  They where doing vitals on my pup in the back . Without any updates on him or letting me know where he was . They came up with a summary of 430$ for a X Ray, a parvo test, and a anti vomiting shot . We said that\u2019s fine we will pay it, ( we-also called ahead of us arriving telling them we couldn\u2019t pay it until tomorrow). And 30 minutes prior to our visit, they said that was perfectly fine . So now our dog can\u2019t be treated bc our card didn\u2019t activate until Monday . The larger tech snatched my estimate board from me and tells me to go to the front desk to apply for credit care . Which I didn\u2019t approve bc I don\u2019t have credit .\nSo they returned my dog AFTER we gave our card information \u201cto make sure we pay .\u201d THEN he is returned to me . We get home and my dog begins shaking again . Just as before we went to the vet. I call them upset wondering why we even went here, confused how we now owe almost 200$ for a shot . Why my dog to be held ransom from me while he is still in horrid condition . They refused to do any testing on him to find out what was wrong with him !!!!! I called again today to ask why my dog is drooling and what it could mean, the large tech answered and literally laughed on the phone with me, because I was Concerned about my pup . She laughs and goes \u201c I can\u2019t say what drooling means, but can you find the money to come in and get him diagnosed now ?\u201d Like ??? This place needs to be shut down !!!! I\u2019ve never seen so many upset clients, dead dogs, and unsolved problems . The techs don\u2019t know a single thing and should find another industry ! So ignorant !!! BEWARE!!

Next time I am driving to which ever city has an open vet close by weather it be Atlanta, Tuscaloosa, Montgomery, Huntsville or even Nashville.

I would have rather been seen in a fraternity house bathroom than one of these examining rooms!\n\nNow the vet tech was amazing!She came in and had my puppy playing, rolling over for belly rubs, giving kisses to the tech, my puppy was in heaven! My vet tech was so helpful, professional, and educated I thought she was the vet! And to be honest I really wish she was! Everything was okay at this point other than the cleanliness.\n\nBut when this \"Vet\" walked in her energy was so negative I could sence it of course my dog did too. She took one look at my dog and kicled her foot in front of my dogs face and was shocked somehow when my dog did not like it. And didn't ask if she could mussle her just walked out and came back in with \"muscle\" a muzzle and a chocker collar!! My baby was terrified I should have walked out then and there! I have never seen an adult to bad with an animal in life let alone a vet.... I was so disappointed in the back of bedside manner this alone. But after only touching her belly for 10 seconds she asked no further questions, she suggested we ran some test and she scared me into it with an infomercial full of a 1000 was for my dog to die if I did not run these tests  IMMEDIATELY. Of course I pay what ever they want to run these life saving tests!\n\nAfter a miserable 6 hours in the waiting room with chairs that dont have back reats in this filty vet after forking over $675.00 in testing. They now think it is a good idea to ask if I've changed her diet recently. I had and the smart ass response I got back had me appalled. This vet asked ME, why I hadnt brought that up sooner like she was paying me to find out what was wrong with my dog!!!!!!  Of course me not being the vet who appeared to be a doing this for 60 years plus now did not think to bring it up first thing. Before the tests were complete I was sent home and told just tonchange her food back. She was fine after changing her food back of course. Something a vet should have been able to tell me over the phone!\n\nSafe to say you pay for testing up front.

I ended up removing my hamster from the box, wrapping her in a cloth and handing her to the vet, who then left the room with her for almost 20 minutes, which made me very uncomfortable.

{"user_id": "109130056488579915795", "name": "Baylie Payne", "time": 1600201869196, "rating": 1.0, "text": "My husband and I just moved to the Wetumpka area a few months back from Prattville. We were going out of town for a few days and needed a place to board our Aussie and Mal-Shi. We tend to do our research when using a new animal clinic so we turned to Google and Facebook to find a highly rated animal boarding facility to take our babies to. I called over a week before our trip to schedule their boarding at Castaway Animal Clinic after seeing their reviews, and the receptionist was friendly and answered all I\u2019ve my overbearing pet parent questions. We were looking forward to going to the facility. Upon arrival on drop off day, we called to let them know we had just arrived on Saturday, but no answer because they are closed on the weekends and only have someone there for drop off and feeding. The lady that we handed our dogs off to seemed extremely rushed to get the dogs inside the facility. We did not get to go inside, although I asked if I could take my dogs in. With COVID-19, I didn\u2019t see this as a real problem, but did feel a bit disappointed that I didn\u2019t get to say goodbye to them before they were hauled away. The lady then proceeds to say that she remembers my dogs from a previous visit to castaway and I reassured her that she couldn\u2019t possibly because this is their first time there. She laughed and says \u201coh okay.\u201d Then she hands me paperwork to just sign that she gave me no real time to read or put notes on because she was frantically trying to push us out to get to the next customer. I had treats and their dog food still in my hands along with my dogs shot records that she would\u2019ve never gotten had I not spoken up. I left feeling very uneasy about the drop off process and wanted to turn around after we left to go back and get them, but my husband helped calm my nerves with, \u201cwell, maybe she was just having a busy morning.\u201d I calmed down and we left for our trip. Because they were closed the next day, I decided to call on Monday morning to check in and see how they did throughout the weekend with no answer. I sent an email and they finally called me about an hour later. Dixie (the receptionist) assured me my dogs were doing fine and I felt much better about the situation. Then, the weather where we were staying on our trip began to get pretty bad and we decided to leave on Monday evening instead of Tuesday. I called Castaway and told them about the change in our plans. I spoke with Dixie again and she said they they would have their baths and nails clipped on Tuesday morning and would call me as soon as I could come and get them. Tuesday morning comes and goes and I finally decide to call around 12:00. They tell me they had their baths, but had not been dried because other dogs took precedent over mine and I can come pick them up at 3:00. The receptionist I spoke with this time was Sarah. I asked if she would call me if they get done any earlier and she very rudely says, \u201clike I said, it will be 3:00 unless you\u2019d like to pick them up when they\u2019re still wet.\u201d I reluctantly said, \u201cokay, thanks,\u201d and she hung up. I decided then that I didn\u2019t want to leave my dogs there until 3, so my husband and I hit the road to go pick them up. When we arrived, It looked as if my Aussie had her bath and she smelled of shampoo but wasn\u2019t completely dry. I was fine with this because we decided not to wait until 3:00, but my Mal-Shi was clearly unbathed as he didn\u2019t smell like shampoo (in fact, he stunk), his eyes and mouth were filthy, but he had a wet head. I believe when they heard us come in, they wet the top of his head to make it look like he had been bathed so that the receptionist didn\u2019t look like a liar because they didn\u2019t expect us to come that early. Regardless, if that\u2019s how they do their baths, I would\u2019ve been very disappointed at 3:00.  All in all, we had a horrible first impression that led to the worst boarding experience we\u2019ve ever had and there\u2019s no way my two dogs will ever return to Castaway Animal Clinic. We would much rather risk the inconvenience and travel further than go back.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c153add465ddd:0x8f292ab87a660d95"}

I then took my dog to our home vet for a second opinion, and asked that Castaway forward the test results to them. When I got to my home vet, the nice receptionist there told me that the girl at castaway complained to her that they were \"stealing her customer\", when she called to inquire about the test results, (which were never sent, by the way).\nMy home vet felt of my dog's belly, and told me the same thing that castaway did. For the price of an office visit. This is why I will no longer support this clinic. Don't let the low-price office visits fool you.

Aliyah was wonderful with arranging our boarding accommodations and scheduling exams and documenting information in their records.  I received two calls from physicians, one after their initial exam and she thoroughly explained everything to me and offered to complete dental cleanings for them.  She was able to get them scheduled and completed as soon as possible.  Additionally, they now offer a turn down service where my babies were provided a walk and cuddles in the middle of the night.  With service like this, I am completely at ease leaving my babies with the Goodwin family.  Thank you so much for the amazing job you did.  I genuinely appreciate it.

Above and beyond, even on her weekend off. Dr Myers will always be straight with you about your pet. Yes, some people don't like this but i would much rather have a doctor, people or animal,  tell me the truth no matter how hard it is to hear. I respect this about her.

They prescribed medicine that I had to pay for, but he developed Kennel cough at their facility.  He\u2019s 8 years old and never had this happen before.  (2) Took my dog in for grooming at 7 am.  Told it would take 3 hours, after not receiving a phone call I followed up at 1pm, only to be told my dog was groomed, except nails.  He would be ready after groomer retuned from lunch.  Why not finish him, nails take 5 mins???  Well then I go pick him up a hour later and he still not ready.  So the person working the front counter goes back and cuts his nails and now he is bleeding from that experience as I take him home.  (3). While I\u2019m waiting at front counter for my dog another gentleman brings his dog in who is barking quite a bit.  I happen to look back at the Counter Rep and catch her look of disgust of having to deal with this dog. (4) I call on Weekend because my dog has ear infection, Doc calls me back after second message and says it will have to wait till Monday.  Gives me remedies I had already looked up, but no option to get medicine after hours.  I brought my dog in Germany and he has lived in and been cared for Vets on Turkey, Tucson Arizona, Chicago, and Alaska.  Never have we had any of these experiences, and I have all these in 3 short months..  Time to move on and I tried to give benefit of doubt.

My Kira is a Pitt bull dog who has not always been the easiest pet to treat. Although she was never aggressive towards people she was a little unfriendly with other animals.  Therefore,  the staff of the Dr. May veterinary clinic always provided her with her own entrance and exit and they were never judgemental or unkind to her.  We recently had to have her put to sleep.  I have been with her for 11 years and to say that she was a part of our family doesn't even come close to describing the relationship my entire family had with her.  I will forever miss my sweet Kira.  Dr. May and his staff treated us with the utmost respect during this horrific process and for that,  I am forever grateful.  I want everyone to know that the May Veterinary family offer the best veterinarian services I have  ever used.

Snoopy was discharged over a week ago and she still called after his discharge almost everyday checking on my baby and offering me solutions.

My Miniature Pinscher was misdiagnosed by Dr. Vigg which caused her a major relapse and a 1 week stay at Auburn University Small Animal Hospital.\n\nMy Min Pin has a neurological condition and was under the care of the Neuro Team from UGA. 3 weeks before she was seen by Dr. Vigg, she was on the lowest dose of Predinisolone and being weaned off. I had travel to work a project in Maryland and my Aunt was watching her. My fur baby was not eating and drinking and showed signs of neck pain. She was taken to TU Vet school and Dr. Vigg was made aware of her MUE condition.\n\n1 week later, Mahogany could no longer walk and had to be rushed to the ER. The Neuro at Auburn University called me and inquired about her visit with Dr. Vigg and after talking with my Aunt about her med management, it was discovered he made my Aunt take her off the meds and this was why she had the severe relapse . He advised my Aunt to take her off the prescribed Prednisolone by her Neurologist, stating it was making her sick and to keep her crated for 90 days.\n\nMahogany's meds tripled and her re-checks which were every 3 months changed to monthly.\n\nI could not get TU to call me back and had to almost harrass them before I was able to speak with Dr. Bellamy who refused to address any wrong doing and stated, \"what do you want me to do about it! She's a dog!\" Dr. Bellamy was unprofessional and I questioned why she wanted to be a Vet. If these animals are only \"animals\" to her and not a life worth protecting, why is she in the field to care for them?\n\nDr. Bellamy nor Dr. David McKenize have replied to emails, although they promised they would.\n\nPlease make sure you think throughly before taking your pet to this Hospital. I know mistakes happen, however; as a Medical entity, there is a duty to make sure you are licensed to practice in a specialty and Dr. Vigg was not. Dr. Bellamy told me he did not have to be but that is not true and the Neurologists at Auburn and UGA confirmed this. They said you NEVER pull a canine off a steroid suddenly as their system will go into shock and if he were a Neuro, he would know this.\n\nA lot of progress was made to get Mahogany back on track and Dr. Vigg's negligence caused the Neuros to go back to the drawing board which upset them. They told me he never should have treated her for a Neuro condition as he is not a licensed Neurologist.\n\nPlease think twice before coming to Tuskegee University Vet Hospital. Auburn is far more rounded and the professionalism/bed-side manner exercised along with certified Medical Professionals who treat your pet with care is reasonating. It gives you peace of mind to know your pet will be given the utmost care. TU, on the other hand, views them as 4-legged property with no regard to the level of care amd treatment they are given.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c510e303e62e9:0xf598f4353e4e7ffe"}

They euthanized our dog without a court order and so much as a phone call. I gained this information from the Manager of the city of pPelham. We boarded our dog with this clinic on June 1, 2020. We are homeless because of covid. My wife has contacted them several times checking on him and discussed services that they offer. We got a coupon via PetSmart and Shelby humane to have him neutered in Irondale. When we went to get our dog the clinic had adopted him out. Instead of being professional and admitting their mistake and helping us to bing our family member home they blamed my wife. They said that they attempted to contact us. They did not.

They treated our cat's chronic and severe UTI and he hasn't had one in 2 years; where as at the other vet we felt like he was not being fully treated and was having unnecessary testing for his diagnosis. In Sept. 2013 we noticed that our dog was not acting like herself and it was after hours, so we took her to the ER vet and they misdiagnosed her with gastritis. We took her to Dr. Price the next day because she had gotten severely worse. Within minutes he diagnosed her with an IMHA, which is a very serious, usually fatal, diagnosis. He sat down with me and explained the disease and treatment course. He stayed with her through the night while she received a blood transfusion, to ensure that she didn't have a reaction to it. He even called me late that night to give me an update. Now nine months later she is her perky self. I would never trust my pets to anybody but Oak View!

Oak View came up multiple times so eventually i decided Oak View would be Max and mine's vet. I could not have been happier with the choice. They helped me take my firsts steps as friend and pet owner and made both of us feel like we were part of the family.\n\nMax didn't have his first seizure until 3 months after i adopted him. Oak View walked me through the different reasons a dog can have a seizure and laid out a plan to help moderate or even eliminate Max's seizures. Had Max's condition been epilepsy or even one of the many normal conditions that can cause seizures i can honestly say Oak View would have been able to help him. Through the empirical method we tried everything to help Max. Unfortunately Max's grand mal seizures persisted and i lost a piece of my friend after each one. Dr. Price and Dr. Robinson admitted that this may be beyond their scope and I respect them all the more for it. I took Max to Neurologists, pathologists, and almost every specialist at Auburn and in between. No one could put a finger on it.\n\nWithin a year my friend was no longer himself. Oak View helped with his final moments and the level of caring and comfort they provided i will never forget. Thank you Oak View.

This had nothing to do with how she had been cared for her whole life, seeing how she had lived well beyond her life expectancy and was a very happy and loving.  I knew her life was coming to a close but when I found her collapsed on the back porch one day after letting her out , she appeared to be suffering from a stroke or cerebral hemorrhage I took her to Southern Regional  Veterinary Specialist because it was the weekend and my usual Veterinarian was closed. The staff were very helpful and caring but unfortunately there was nothing that could be done except ending any pain or suffering that she may have been experiencing.  The experience was awful but the staff were very kind.\n\nA few months after this I was looking after a friends place in a rural area when I kept hearing a persistent tiny meowing from a kitten.  Unfortunately his hind leg had been pinned and severely mangled and I was afraid I was going to have to once again have to poor animal euthanized but after once again having to take the animal to southern Regional because it was the only vet open they reassured me that they could save the animals life and that he would have a good chance of having a pretty normal and happy life albeit without one limb. I choose to adopt the poor critter and spend the money to have the amputation performed. I can say that although the price was what I would describe as fairly considerable, its been by far the best choice I've ever made. The cat and I have bonded like no other animal and I have before. I am very thankful that the staff explained that the kitten would very likely survive the amputation surgery and go on to have a normal and happy life as an indoor cat. I was worried about him not being able to get around well or being handicapped by the surgery but they assured me that since he was so young he would very likely adjust and go on to adapt to not having it and indeed this is what happened.  He is very happy, loving, playful and gets around just as well as any cat I've ever had. He's very fast and can jump on a counter top with very little difficulty and has had no problems to speak of  besides not being able to scratch behind his ear very well on the affected side,  which I happily scratch for him when I see the need or he brings it to my attention.

After some cruel person abandoned a sick cat and it made its way to my yard, I had to make my way to Dr. Martin.  The poor little darling Marilyn Monroe was born with a terrible disorder that had her overeating, followed by projective vomiting.  She is a midget of a kitty cat due to the lack of nourishment.  I was fearful that she could not be saved but after a simple description from me, Dr. Martin immediately knew the problem. After running the appropriate tests, sure enough, he was right -- yesterday Marilyn Monroe underwent the operation to solve her problem and save her life.  Tonight she is home and happy.  Without Dr. Martin's years of expertise, I am not sure Miss Marilyn could have been saved.  I am happy.  Marilyn Monroe is happy.  The world is good again.  Thanks, Dr. Martin.

Our 18 month old Chihuahua Pee Wee was outside on Mother's Day playing when he took off running through the woods chasing a squirrel. When Pee Wee came out of the woods he was limping and wouldn't put any weight on one of his back legs, so we took him to the vet. After having x rays done we were informed Pee Wee had indeed broken his leg and the best option with the best outcome was surgery. After having Dr. Martin at SRVS highly recommend to us the x-rays were sent over and we was told to be expecting a call from SRVS. It didn't take long before I was contacted by SRVS to set up an appointment for Pee Wee to come in and have surgery. The lady I spoke with on the phone was extremely nice and set up Pee Wee an appointment for the following day. The morning we arrived for surgery we was greeted by both ladies at the front desk and was checked in. We didn't have to wait no time before we was called to the back.\nDr. Martin discussed everything with us and we was given an estimate of what it would cost. When given the estimate it was detailed very well with the lowest and highest estimate. (Which I totally appreciated) When we checked out I was ASKED if I could pay the lowest estimate right then and told if it did go over that amount they would let me know the following day when I returned to take Pee Wee home. It was explained to me that if it ended up costing less than the lowest estimate that I paid the day of the surgery that they would refund me the difference. I appreciated the fact that I was given the lowest and the highest estimates that way I would know  about what the cost would be. A couple of hours later I received a call from Dr. Martin himself informing me off Pee Wee's condition and details of how the surgery went. I was told if I wanted he could come home the following day or he could stay an additional night if I felt more comfortable with him there. I chose to go ahead and bring him home the following morning because he was doing well and we missed him dearly. The day after surgery I returned to pick him up and Dr. Martin went over all the aftercare instructions with me and the medications given. Pee Wee is home resting now and is expected to make a full recovery! \u2665 Thank you Dr. Martin and ALL the staff at SRVS for taking such wonderful care of Pee Wee,  you've been such a blessing to our family!!!

I believe he was more concerned about how many surgeries he could do that day and how much money he could make.  Duke is a Miniature Dachshund.  They are prone to have back problems.  When he was 11 years old he woke me up about midnight in pain.  I took him to SRVS where they gave him a shot.  I spent about $200 then.  The next morning, he was still in pain so I took him back.  They gave him narcotics and put him on an IV of fluids.  He did not have access to water, otherwise. I believe they gave him too much narcotics because he was howling and did not even recognize me when I went to see him.   After a quick diagnosis, they said he needed surgery on his back near his neck.  They couldn\u2019t do surgery right away because he was dehydrated.  Dr. Martin admitted they did not give him sufficient fluids. They told me they would have to do a Myelogram.  I specifically asked Dr. Martin \u201cWhat are the dangers?\u201d  He remarked that he may hit a bone (vertebrae) and have to move the needle.  He did not say anything else or tell me of any complications.  When I confronted Dr. Martin about his answer regarding complications, his remark was \u201cMy bad\u201d, meaning himself that he didn\u2019t inform me.  That was no consolation. Duke also had seizures that I was never told could occur.  When I got upset about that, his daughter got all high and mighty like I had done something wrong.  It was only later in talking with friends that I realized how dangerous this procedure was.  In my opinion they did not take necessary precautions when administering the Myelogram, such as keeping his head elevated so that it didn\u2019t go to his brain.  The next day they took him outside to potty but said he just wanted to sit down.  This was the second lie I was told.  In actuality, his hind legs were paralyzed from the Myelogram.  Then his liver and kidneys started failing.  They put him on an IV to try to regain function but it was too late.  On the discharge papers they told their third lie.  They said that he was standing on his own.  At that point I took him to his regular Vet where they tried desperately to save his life.  The damage had already been done.  I took him home.  I took him outside and he took two wobbly steps and that was the last time he walked.   Duke lost his dignity and his pride when he lost control of his bowels and bladder.

Sounds to me like most of the folks were in seek of free advice. If you need after hours emergency care, you can certainly expect to pay for it. The first time I called this clinic was late at night on a weekend and I agree, the person I spoke with was definitely determined to get my commitment to pay if a Vet was coming to meet me. How many of you would get up at 3:00 AM on a Sunday morning and go to your office if you were not going to get paid? I can only imagine the frustration they experience when pet owner has a possible emergency but yet balks when expected to pay to have their pet treated. It is very expensive to obtain the education necessary to cure animals of diseases and to fix them surgically. Should they do it for free? Is it wrong to make money? There's a difference between a business and a charity. Some evidently don't realize that.\n\nI was thrilled with the care my dog received. Yes it was expensive!! So what, they saved my dogs life...Dr. Martin removed an insulinoma- a tumor from his pancreas and inspected his lymph nodes, liver, etc. for signs of spreading.\nA major surgery that included over 48 hours in the hospital. should I complain about the bill? Should it have been cheap? If your child had cancer would you look for the cheapest oncologist? Of course not. The doctors at STVS are kind, patient, and most importantly skilled. If I went to College for a decade and spent God knows how much money on those degrees, I would like to think I would be well compensated for my expertise. Try calling a surgeon at your local people hospital and asking them if you should come into the hospital or not? Come on folks....everything related to medical care, animals or people, is expensive. If you had gone in and paid the 250,  you would have received very good care for your animal!!! Thank you to Dr. Martin and the entire staff!

Naturally, I didn\u2019t had much of a choice b/c of my dog issue. The desk clerk seemed to be new at her job b/c she continued to ask surrounding vet specialist for help on every question that I asked. After basic paperwork, I was hit with an itemized bill that was x2 the cost for normal OFA x-rays and submission fees. I also had to write down my credit card information on the OFA paperwork for additional reading and filing fees (In which, I learned later this is false). Now, I fear about my credit card information. I questioned everything with little to no help. Faced with little choice at the time, I continued with the process. Before they took my dog, they asked me if I had any questions before they begin. I ask how are they going to evaluate my dog\u2019s legs to determine if it\u2019s a soft tissue or ACL damage. They replied by saying during sedation they would flex my dogs legs by feeling for full range of motion. I, again, ask how is that going to determine anything since my dogs muscle is relaxed and limped. That answer didn\u2019t settled well with me. In the mist, the desk clerk wanted me to pay upfront for the entire procedure. I questioned this action since it was unusual. She replied that it is company policy and we would credit your card if any after the procedure. I told her that I wasn\u2019t leaving my dog during his sedation (previously showed her my military card to validate personal information) and my dog is microchip with corresponding information. After the x-rays, the veterinary physician went over the x-rays. He didn\u2019t give me any answers to why my dog was having issues with his rear legs. However, he kept on saying that German Shepherds are prone to hip dysplasia. This was his go to answer for everything. He didn\u2019t provide recovery recommendations, treatment, potential future issues, or anything. I felt like I was rushed after they finished the x-rays. After paying that high bill, I asked if they had a dog gurney to ease my dog\u2019s problem but nothing. The following day (today) I reviewed this situation with the on post vet.

I recently had one of my dogs put to sleep there because he had a severe case of cancer. The staff was very sympathetic however I have recently learned that the way the put an animal down Is identical to an animal shelter.  They do not sedate the dog or cat before hand. They just inject the shot and your animal dies in front of you within a few seconds. This moment has haunted me since I have witnessed it. I have inquired at other vets and they ALL sedate before lethal injection to keep the dog from panicking and the owner at greater peace.\nCalera Animal Hospital does not do this so please beware.  Plus they asked me to pay the bill before they performed the injection..considering the amount of money I have spent there I was very surprised at this action.

He had terminal cancer and they offered no treatment plan for him. My husband took him in for an appointment for euthanasia. He told me the method they used to euthanize him, and it was not the standard as to other local facilities. Our pet was not sedated at all. They immediately administered the shot to stop his heart- which within 3 seconds our beloved family pet fell over in my husband\u2019s arms. As hard of a decision as it was, this small act made it so much worse. We felt this was not correct procedure and actually inquired with other local veterinarian offices. They in fact confirmed our suspicions. We will no longer take our other pets to their office, and in good concience cannot recommend them.

We recently purchased one, Ramos, from  Germany.  After about  6 weeks here,  he developed a case of bloat that could have killed him.  With bloat, the stomach actually \"flips over\" and cuts the blood supply off to the stomach, causing a rapid distension, and death if not treated quickly.  Fortunately, Ramos' stomach flipped back without emergency surgery.\n\nNot wanting to go through this again, we researched bloat and found the best \u201ccure\u201d for it is a laparoscopic assisted gastropexy.  In this procedure the dog's stomach is sutured to the abdominal wall. The sutures eventually dissolve but the stomach is held permanently in place by an \"adhesion\" preventing recurrent \"flipping\".  Many animal hospitals do not have a laparoscope or the skill to accomplish this procedure.  Dr. Daniels was able to take care of this surgery and Ramos is 99% normal after five days. He has personally checked on Ramos 4 times on his own time since surgery.\n\nEverything about Drs. Daniels and Clark, and their clinic and team  was strictly professional, yet courteous and friendly.  We can't forget Cassidy, the glue and the center of their clinic.  Exceptional personality and warmth!\n\nIf you are looking for a superior team to take care of your special \u201cfamily member\u201d, consider Dr. Daniels and Clark at Nall Daniels Animal Hospital in Homewood.\n\nNot close enough for you?

The first time I took him for his annual shots and a check up I asked about the small lumps on his body and they said it was nothing. 6 months ago I took him to this office to get a check up because we had some concerns. After paying hundreds of dollars for tests and x-rays, they assured me that there was nothing usual going on with my dog. This week he started getting very sick, and after a trip to a different vet, we found out he had cancer and it was very prolonged and caused other problems like anemia, kidney failure and lesions on his lungs. This kind of progression doesn't happen in 6 months. It happens over years. He had been coming here for years and they never once said anything about the cancer that was all over my dog's body and covering his organs. At this point, he was in too much pain, couldn't eat or drink, and could hardly breathe. The new vet and I decided it was best to put him down so he wouldn't be hurting anymore. After years of coming to the same office they never said anything remotely close to cancer.\n\nThere is nothing I can do for my dog anymore, but there is still something you can do for your's. DO NOT bring your animals to this office. There is no way a cancer this severe goes unnoticed for so long with an office that provides quality care. Find somewhere to take your pets that won't treat them like they treated my dog.

When we got called back, we were in a decent sized examination room with a vet tech, I can\u2019t remember his name, but he was a very kind and patient young man with brown hair. He was very thorough with us; he listened to and answered all of our questions. He even provided us with a printed out quote of what all the shots, the visit, and the treatment for the ear infection that our Golden had, before performing any procedures. Then, Dr. Dunaway came in to examine them. She immediately got down in the floor and started loving on the boys. You could see her passion for animal care when she came in the room. She was very articulate and detail oriented, laying out all of the treatment options for the ear infection and recommending medication for his arthritis, too. Her bedside manner was impeccable and I felt listened to and informed as she explained everything that she was doing. We never felt rushed, even as it got near closing time. All in all, it was a wonderful experience. I had called fifteen clinic before choosing this one. The reason I chose them in the first place was because they were one of the most affordable. Sometimes, affordability comes at the expense of the quality of care, but not here.

Going to the vet is a lot of work with two dogs. Scheduling the appointment, taking time off from work, driving there, dealing with the other animals in the waiting room.

My dogs were very comfortable with her, she was very sweet to our dogs (even gave them some of her lunch to keep them calm).\n\nIf you think you can't afford a mobile clinic, think again. It cost us no more, actually a bit less, than going to our regular veterinarian.\n\nI asked her lots of questions and she can do tests, checkups, surgery, essentially - full vet service.\n\nThank you again VIP Mobile Clinic for offering a great service!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88893ea931f449f1:0x5ac8d5bcf17c179b"}

Miraculously, Monday morning, instead of performing surgery on him, Dr. Montgomery told me I could take him home. Also, she told me about what she felt caused the infection, a scorpion bite. They gave me directions to care for him that were easy to understand and follow. They asked me to let them know the next day about how he was doing.

But NOT HERE!!!! My wife and I just visited here yesterday with our 4 week old kitten to get an eye problem checked out and a little guidance on properly caring for the little guy. Overall the the visitation was informative. We did get guidance on how to care for and take care of our new kitten properly, even if the Vet was very flippant and lacking in a warm bedside manner! (like I said I can overlook somethings.) This brings me to my point... In order to get that information, we had to ask questions. That\u2019s where my issue is...\n\nMy issue is with the pettiness in their billing practices!!! They actually charged us $10.00 for \u201cEXTRA TIME\u201d in our appointment! WTH!!!! Whoever heard of such a thing?! Now keep in mind, I am a stickler for following rules.......but in this case NOBODY told us we only have an allotted amount of time to have your appointment and ask questions!! Also, there was NO SIGNAGE about this anywhere!!! Again, WTH!!! HOW CAN YOU KNOW, IF YOU ARE NEVER TOLD?!?\n\nAlso, when my wife called to ask about this they had the nerve to say, \u201cWe asked too many questions and talked too long with the Vet, making the next appointment start late.\u201d I am sorry, but when was it a bad thing/wrong thing to ask questions to a doctor? And never mind that we sat in the room with our Vet SILENTLY WAITING, while she told us to hold on, while she typed up her notes!! Heck, that was at least 15 minutes!!! Also, per their policy, we called to their office number upon our arrival to let them know we are here and WAITED ON HOLD FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES, prior to starting our visitation!! I guess that was counted against us too!!!\n\nNeedless to say........this has nothing to do about the $10.00 and more about the pettiness and principle of the matter. And upon talking to them further, they still don\u2019t understand or acknowledge that this is a ludicrous fee for a petty policy! They have lost our business forever over $10. I hope it was worth it!\nAnd don\u2019t get me started on the overcharging of medicine...............", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923aab552aa97:0xdd5cd7885f83241f"}

Our Bassett Hound, Daisy, had been attacked by two other dogs on a Saturday afternoon so we rushed her to the hospital.  After \u201cdiagnosing\u201d and treating for her for about 4 hours, Dr. Buxton is ADAMANT that we euthanize her due to her injuries.  It was about 10:00 PM when this occurred.  In addition to the comments above, she also told us \u201cbesides, you only have a year left with her at best\u201d. REALLY????\n\nI insisted on a second opinion, not because of the prognosis, but because Dr. Buxton\u2019s lack of ability to be open-minded.   And here\u2019s a tip Buxton:  If you sign up for weekend emergency room work, you may have to stay late and skip supper to care for the animals.\n\nThe next morning, we took Daisy to Dr. Galbraith, an angel on Earth, in Pulaski, Tennessee.   Dr. Galbraith stated that Daisy might eventually have to be euthanized, but we wouldn\u2019t know for 48-72 hours.  Daisy stayed with Dr. Galbraith about a week and is now home and fully recovered.\n\nThis is not an indictment on Wall Triana Animal Hospital itself.  If you do patronize this establishment, then I would just ensure that you choose another of their doctors.\n\nHow sad if we would have listened to this lady\u2019s advice..\n\nHow many other pets has she needlessly euthanized?\n\nDismayed,\n\nDaren Carter", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886267da8de4cf59:0x9621c7b09d06fa28"}

I went there because its convenient to my home, but after several months of using them, its obvious they care more about making money than about your pets health!! I was already displeased about being talked down to when I asked Dr. Leonard about getting my dogs monthly flea/tick and heartworm meds from an online vendor. He told me it would only save me a few dollars, blah blah... but, he seemed to fail to realize that, they are MY dollars!! 4 months later, after paying about $45 a month for her meds through him, I finally decided to place my order through 1800petmeds and pay $60 for a 3 month supply.  Of course, the Rx has to be authorized by your vet, who we just saw less than 2 months ago and had an appointment to see again on the 17th for her final round of puppy shots and to make an appointment for her to be spayed in the coming weeks. After a week has passed, 1800petmeds has faxed them for approval 3x and I have called twice. Finally, they called my husband to say it'll be $18.50 to approve her prescription, and she will need a $25 heartworm test first??? Regardless of the fact that she's been under his regular care since the day I got her at 6 weeks old. I am switching vets. Like, today!!!! I will not be extorted by a cheap, condescending vet who cares more about making a profit off the meds than about the health of my dog. Also, at her last visit, I had her nails trimmed, it was going right along fine when he got to the 8th toenail and all of a sudden she yelped so loud and totally freaked out and he couldn't finish.. but, of course, he didn't cut or hurt her.. she just suddenly got upset.. after calmly letting him cut the first 7 nails!  The ONLY thing I can say positive I can really say about this place is there's a very nice lady that works there on Tuesdays, who seems to care about pet owners and helping them save money while caring for their fur babies.  I used to interact with her alot with my previous pup, who I lost tragically in April, but I haven't seen her much since I got the new one. I'm not sure of her name, but it wasn't the vet, or his wife, who treats my dog like she's just any old anonymous dog... didn't even bother to write her name on the folder containing all the shots, treatment info she sent home, it's just a blank card with no \"pet's name\" written in the blank. Same with appointment cards.. to them, she's just any random dog. Convenience isn't everything! Go elsewhere!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a4a55fcad8c93:0xefd9c5ba96e0a61e"}

One of those dogs had a stroke three days before my husband died of brain cancer. She dealt with my hysteria, my pain, and terror with gentleness, understanding, and compassion. She took care of my dog as if he were her own.

All four of our \u201crescue\u201d pets have had a somewhat difficult past and require a little more than average care. On our first visit we got there a few minutes early with our two dogs and two cats and in no time at all they were seeing Doctor Brothers... so... no waiting!! All our fur babies loved her and the dogs were laying at her feet not long after being seen and the cats were at ease too. They got their shots and blood draws, she diagnosed and prescribed meds for a yeast infection in one of our cat's ears that was previously undetected for years and found a hernia and a tumor in our newest dog\u2019s abdomen. A week or so later she repaired the hernia and removed the tumor, spayed her and pulled four broken/bad teeth and now she\u2019s doing just fine. She is VERY happy and active now and actually runs and plays. We love Dr. Brothers, we really love her and her office staff too! Excellent care at reasonable prices!!

Dr. Brothers first impressed me when she called me herself to let me know how the outcome of surgery went. The staff did not call. She personally took the time to let me know that my fur baby was ok.

There have been a couple of my babies that had to be euthanized,  but she did everything she could to prevent that. Her facility is always clean and the staff is always nice. Dr. Brothers is excellent at her job. I am grateful for her and I am so glad she is close by.

So, less than $150 for all 3 rounds of shots + rabies vaccine, along with a visual exam each time. A test for worms was $18, and his microchipping was $53.\n\nWhen I had a list of questions written down and sent in with my pup during one of his checkups (renovations made it impossible to go inside), Dr. Baldwin came out to my car and went through each of the bullet points with me. Very professional and thoughtful.\n\nMy ONLY complaints are that I often get the \u201cclosed\u201d or \u201cbusy\u201d messages when I call, especially at around 8-9 in the morning.

Yesterday, her amniotic fluid broke at about 1:35 pm. We called you around 5:30 pm to find out if her condition is normal. Your doctor is very sure to tell us not to worry. It will be around 1:30 in the evening. It \u2019s been 12 hours. When I called your doctor again and left a phone number for us, we called for a long time before contacting your doctor, but he still said everything was normal. He only helped to find the contact method of the pet emergency room, but during the two prenatal inspections of iris before, we twice asked you to help us find a contact method for the emergency room. You said that even if there is a problem, you can do it at night Calling you, you also have an emergency room at night, saying that she will have no problems with the second production. Even if there is a problem, you can help me at night. I believe you, because Iris has been here to check with you . But last night when we needed you most, I took a long time to contact you. I also thank you for helping me find the emergency room contact method at the end, but just when we were going to see the emergency department When Iris left us, I always wondered why during the two prenatal check-ups, we asked for an emergency room contact method. You only gave me your outpatient phone number, and I remember I told you that It \u2019s just that Iris can contact the doctor who can help her when the 1% you said needs the doctor \u2019s help. You said you can help her even at night, but when Iris needs the doctor \u2019s help most, where are you , Did you know that because we spent the time to rescue her in the most urgent time, if you can help me find the emergency room contact method, at least Iris still has the hope of survival, and May continue to be with us. Do you know that iris is like our daughter in our hearts? Do you know how helpless we are when we watch iris walk away in front of us? I want to ask you Where is the night emergency? I want to ask if your commitment is really so worth mentioning? Iris just had her two-year-old birthday last month. She is still so young, and the baby in her stomach has a total of 9 lives. Just say that it is gone? ?\n\n(Original)\n\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u4f60\u4eec\u8fd8\u8bb0\u5f97iris\u5417\uff1f\u6628\u59291:35pm\u5de6\u53f3\u5979\u7684\u7f8a\u6c34\u7834\u4e86\uff0c\u57285:30pm\u5de6\u53f3\u6211\u4eec\u6253\u7535\u8bdd\u7ed9\u4f60\u4eec\uff0c\u60f3\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u5979\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u6b63\u5e38\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u533b\u751f\u5f88\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u7528\u62c5\u5fc3\uff0c\u7b49\u5230\u4e86\u665a\u4e0a1:30\u5de6\u53f3\u5df2\u7ecf12\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u4e86\u5f53\u6211\u518d\u4e00\u6b21\u6253\u7ed9\u4f60\u4eec\u533b\u751f\u7559\u4e2a\u6211\u7684\u7535\u8bdd\u53f7\u7801\u6211\u4eec\u6253\u4e86\u597d\u51e0\u4e45\u624d\u8054\u7cfb\u5230\u4f60\u4eec\u7684\u533b\u751f\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4ed6\u8fd8\u662f\u8bf4\u4e00\u5207\u6b63\u5e38\uff0c\u90a3\u65f6\u6211\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u975e\u5e38\u7684\u62c5\u5fc3\u7684\u8bf4\u4e86iris\u7684\u72b6\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ed6\u624d\u5e2e\u5fd9\u627e\u5ba0\u7269\u6025\u8bca\u5ba4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u4e4b\u524diris\u7684\u4e24\u6b21\u4ea7\u524d\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e24\u6b21\u8981\u6c42\u4f60\u4eec\u5e2e\u6211\u4eec\u627e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6025\u8bca\u5ba4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u8bf4\u5c31\u7b97\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u665a\u4e0a\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6253\u7535\u8bdd\u7ed9\u4f60\u4eec\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u4e5f\u6709\u665a\u4e0a\u6025\u8bca\uff0c\u8bf4\u5979\u662f\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u751f\u4ea7\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u7684\uff0c\u5c31\u7b97\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u4f60\u4eec\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u5230\u6211\u5728\u665a\u4e0a\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u6211\u76f8\u4fe1\u4f60\u4eec\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3airis\u4e00\u76f4\u5230\u5728\u4f60\u4eec\u8fd9\u91cc\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u6628\u665a\u6211\u4eec\u6700\u9700\u8981\u4f60\u4eec\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u6211\u5374\u82b1\u4e86\u5f88\u957f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6765\u8054\u7cfb\u5230\u4f60\u4eec\uff0c\u6211\u4e5f\u611f\u8c22\u4f60\u5728\u6700\u540e\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5e2e\u6211\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u6025\u8bca\u5ba4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5c31\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u51c6\u5907\u53bb\u770b\u6025\u8bca\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0ciris\u79bb\u5f00\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\uff0c\u6211\u4e00\u76f4\u60f3\u4e0d\u660e\u767d\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5728\u4e24\u6b21\u4ea7\u524d\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8981\u6c42\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u6025\u8bca\u5ba4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u53ea\u7ed9\u6211\u4f60\u4eec\u95e8\u8bca\u7684\u7535\u8bdd\u53f7\u7801\uff0c\u6211\u4e5f\u8bb0\u5f97\u6211\u544a\u8bc9\u4f60\u4eec\u6211\u53ea\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86iris\u5728\u90a3\u4e2a\u4f60\u8bf4\u76841%\u9700\u8981\u533b\u751f\u5e2e\u5fd9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u53ef\u4ee5\u53ca\u65f6\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u5230\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u5979\u7684\u533b\u751f\uff0c\u4f60\u8bf4\u4f60\u4eec\u5c31\u7b97\u665a\u4e0a\u4e5f\u80fd\u5e2e\u52a9\u5979\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728iris\u6700\u9700\u8981\u533b\u751f\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u5728\u54ea\u91cc\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u77e5\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u5c31\u56e0\u4e3a\u5728\u6700\u7d27\u6025\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u6211\u4eec\u5374\u628a\u6551\u5979\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u82b1\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u4f60\u4eec\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5f53\u521d\u4f60\u4eec\u80fd\u5e2e\u6211\u627e\u5230\u6025\u8bca\u5ba4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6700\u8d77\u7801iris\u8fd8\u6709\u8fd8\u6709\u751f\u8fd8\u7684\u5e0c\u671b\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u7ee7\u7eed\u966a\u7740\u6211\u4eec\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u77e5\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053iris\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u5fc3\u91cc\u5c31\u50cf\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5973\u513f\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u77e5\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u5f53\u6211\u4eec\u770b\u7740iris\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u9762\u524d\u8d70\u6389\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6709\u591a\u4e48\u7684\u65e0\u52a9\uff0c\u6211\u60f3\u95ee\u4e00\u4e0b\u4f60\u4eec\u7684\u591c\u95f4\u6025\u8bca\u5728\u54ea\u91cc\uff1f\u6211\u60f3\u95ee\u4e00\u4e0b\u4f60\u4eec\u7684\u627f\u8bfa\u771f\u7684\u90a3\u4e48\u7684\u4e0d\u503c\u4e00\u63d0\u5417\uff1firis\u4e0a\u4e2a\u6708\u624d\u521a\u521a\u8fc7\u5b8c\u4e24\u5c81\u751f\u65e5\uff0c\u5979\u8fd8\u90a3\u4e48\u7684\u5e74\u8f7b\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u5979\u809a\u5b50\u7684\u5b9d\u5b9d\u4e00\u51719\u4e2a\u751f\u547d\u5c31\u8fd9\u6837\u8bf4\u6ca1\u5c31\u6ca1\u4e86\uff1f\uff1f", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqrw1lZDy-F6zdTa1maPazMceFDAxwqT7gPmwE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5cnLAoRvm1zfI4SsQ3oea6mmJVfLImXA6YSWC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQHxQbvSB4xAyHGvmP21FN8NAZUoyTLfAs9sCn=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2c721ffc03fb:0xd9657e4b494a3bd3"}

The herbs we boiled as tea and made a warm compress and also she drank it. It helped with pain, swelling and we also used a salve on a very bad gash. We tried Antibiotic cream and considered surgery but decided to try and let it heal. It was really bad. The first night we used the salve and by morning you could already see it was healing. This was a week after the incident. It healed from the inside out. We were amazed and can not believe at how quickly she healed. The love and knowledge they put into her care really is remarkable.

They gave her a shot for nausea and send her home after telling me that she didn't look like she had parvo. 3 days later she was still sick so I called them back explain the situation and how dire it was that she got hydrated they told me that because she had an appointment the next day to just wait till the following day to bring her, that would have been four days in on not eating or drinking. I am very disappointed in this place I truly thought that they loved animals but they didn't even give my puppy a chance each time I would call them about her they would call me right back and explain why they could not do whatever it was I was asking.

But if not, they will ask you to leave your baby or babies with them and you can pick him/her up after work. They board, give medical baths, treat all types of animals.

My mom took her precious ten month old maltese to be spayed and have some teeth pulled.  This little baby was the sweetest thing.  She went in for the surgery on Friday with Dr. Marrs. After the surgery, Dr. Marrs placed her on Previcox which, according to the Previcox website should not be given to animals under 12.5 pounds because it is not possible to break the tablets accurately enough for a proper dosage- (My mom's dog is 4 pounds).  After the surgery, she initially she didn't eat, but that was understandable because of having teeth pulled.  On Tuesday (four days later) she was having multiple seizures, couldn't stand up, and wouldn't eat. My mom took her to back to Golden Triangle, and after more tests, they gave her IV fluids and sent her to an emergency room.  They told my mom that her dog most likely had a liver shunt - a birth defect not related to the surgery at all.  After more pricey testing, they discovered the puppy has no liver shunt. You are telling me that it's just coincidental that a perfectly healthy dog had surgery, was given a drug that shouldn't have been given to a dog that small and the side effects including seizures, and four days later has severe neurological issues unrelated to this?  I doubt that. My 78 year old mom is now nursing an invalid puppy that was supposed to bring her joy.\nThe puppy can't stand up, she bobs her head up and down and does basically nothing more than that.  When she takes her outside, she can't even stand up to go to the bathroom and just goes on herself.  Golden Triangle has done NOTHING to try to help. I am happy to send before and after videos to anyone who asks if it prevents them from going here.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891991d2dcbe99:0x20f3f9e33a8ff7ff"}

The office manager helped me with getting out 3 dogs records from our previous vet and arranged our pets visits. During the vet visit the Doctor was on the phone with me the entire time (during COVID) - explained everything including the cost for each test and medication. She answered all of my questions honestly and was great to explain everything. My dog suffers from allergies and previously we were not taken very seriously and told to give large doses of Benadryl even though I explained that does not work for her anymore- it never really did. The most vital part was that she helped me with a treatment plan for my dog. At the end of the visit #1 I was not surprised by the bill- she discussed all that with me as we spoke and #2 I knew the all of the next steps. That was a big deal because where we were before I never had a treatment plan and basically we started over every time we came in. The next day Lucy\u2019s skin was not red, hot, and irritated, she wasn\u2019t chewing on her paws and shaking her head, she wasn\u2019t panting and stressing her and everyone around her out. she was relaxed and calm, and sleeping so peacefully- that hasn\u2019t happened in 8 years for her. The doctor even called me back to go over all of her blood work results. I have never been more impressed with a veterinarian clinic. I am actually a little embarrassed that I continued taking my dogs to the previous vet all these years- had I known the level of service that we were missing and the expertise these doctors offer in comparison to what we had grown accustomed to, I would have moved them many years ago.

They brought it to my attention that he was not being cooperative and would need to be sedated. We passed on this at the moment to discuss the $150 fee they were asking.\n\nThey did let me know they were able to get his back paws trimmed. Upon returning home, we found that they completely broke one of our dog's back nails. Not just broke, but practically tore it out of the nail bed. It's sitting 90 degrees from where it's supposed to be.\n\nIt doesn't take a genius to think this through...if this was the first nail they tried to cut...then of course he acted out the rest of the time. He was hurt!\n\nIf it was the last nail they tried to cut and he had been acting so bad to begin with, why didn't they stop?\n\nAnd...you're telling me you didn't know you hurt him that badly??? How can this happen and you not see it?\n\nToday, he is at another vet who was able to examine him without any sort of sedation. The nail that was injured by Helena Veterinary Clinic will now cost me $200 to fix.\n\nHelena Veterinary Clinic's response to this...it's my fault. I should have practiced with him daily to get him used to having his nails trimmed.

I don't expect anyone to stop everything when something happens to one of my animals but when an animal is very old and becomes short of breath and semi responsive, you'd at least think the vet office that you call would at least sound like they care even if they don't. In a brief phone call, it was obvious that the person who answered was not concerned, sympathetic, or compassionate. Luckily, there is another office that we were able to contact, be seen, and send our sweet angel to Heaven within an hour. She was almost gone when we called your office and were told you could see us in about 2 hours like it was just some routine vet visit.

However, that is absolutely where the positives stop. On my initial visit, the veterinarian saw a human being and provided medical advice. It was a scheduled appt. I know cause it pushed mine back 30 mins. Not sure if this is normal, but it made me a little uncomfortable for reasons I honestly can't explain. Just seemed really weird. When we got to see the vet he was very passive aggressive toward my knowledge of how to care for an animal or as he assumed my lack thereof. Never personally insulted me by any means but passively insinuated  I was not a vet and should keep my comments to myself. When I left i was told the dog needed to come back in a week. I asked about prices and reasons. I was told by the receptionist that if I stopped by and got the medicine and did not have the medicine administered by the doc it would only be $5. Being on a budget I decided to do that. I was advised to still make an appt in the event my dog was not getting better. Well a week later, I was kicked out at the threat of calling the cops with a $26 charge because I was questioning why the price went up $21. The answer I got was they do not administer meds over the counter. And the vet said he was not going to argue and then asked if I would like the cops called. Baffled at how quickly he got defensive I said yes please. He got angrier, and told me to leave. He said he asked his workers who said it would only be $5 and both of them denied ever saying such a thing. Of course not, why would they right? Again, my animal was treated fine and is getting healthier. But the customer service, lies, anger toward me over questions about price, and seeing a human being before seeing my dog are what led to this ZERO star rating. I do not write this out of anger, simply out of working in the customer service industry for a long time and spreading the word that if you want to be treated well, do not go here.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862753096ae4609:0x709b048c868a11f6"}

Dr. Snead is very calming and appears to really care about her patients. We've found ourselves a new vet for all our pets!

He was seen by Dr. Goodwin. I was told he was blocked and had to have a surgery that would basically open up his urethra. So he had the surgery and he came home. He wasn\u2019t getting better. Still in complete pain, losing weight, and straining horribly to use the bathroom. Not only that but he now has a gaping hole in his rear that is exposed to outside air and bacteria and causing infection. We went back to Goodwin in December for them to redo the surgery. Still not successful. At this point he\u2019s being boarded at the Chantilly facility for constant observation. Looking back I\u2019m assuming because they knew they had messed my baby up. So January rolls around and he\u2019s not better. Weight loss, no appetite, and clearly in pain constantly. Dr. Sermon(?) decided to take over and redid the surgery AGAIN.  At this point my cat has been boarded there for over a month and has had THREE SURGERIES. Now I have a cat with constant issues at this point. They said the surgery was effective. WRONG IT WAS NOT. I\u2019ll put a pic in the comments of his rear on the regular due to this complication. He couldn\u2019t even sit down comfortably. He couldn\u2019t walk like a normal cat. And he was constantly crying out in pain and straining. I switched vets at the point and had to spend the next three years of his life at routine visits every 2-3 months to have him sedated and antibiotics and his rear cleaned up. This constant pain eventually took a toll on him. I paid hundreds for prescription food and frequent vet visits and all Goodwin did for me was take a couple grand off my bill and left me with still around a $2k bill for them ruining my cats life. He recently died at only 6 years of age due to his poor quality of life and constant pain and infection caused by this surgery. I\u2019ve investigated this with an attorney and I\u2019m regretful I waited this long as it is outside of the statute of limitations for malpractice or Goodwin would have a lawsuit on their hands. I truly believe they single-handedly ruined my cats life and caused him to be taken from me way too soon.

You can tell the staff have been through extensive sales training from the way they push the Wellness plan (starting at $500 per year per pet).  They avoid answering questions about how much the items covered in the wellness plan actually cost, which is why I politely told them no each time they brought it up (on average 3 times per visit).\n\nWhat has made me decide to NOT use them again is the number of follow up exams they required (beyond the industry standard according to 3 other vetinarians).  Each of these follow up exams was another $30 (not including medication, scrapings, etc).  All 3 of the other vets said that the follow up exam is included in the initial exam costs.

I brought in my dog to get his shots that he was due for. I asked if it was ok if he only received some of the shots now and I\u2019d bring him back for the rest. I just wasn\u2019t used to having such a high vet bill and I needed to split up the services. I was told by the woman behind the counter that yes, it is possible to do that but the overall price will be higher because it costs less to do it all bundled together. I said that\u2019s ok and I still want to split it up the bill. They took my dog in back and 10 minutes later they brought him back and charged me the full amount for all services, even though I was very adamant about not having them all done at this time. They just went ahead and did it all without my consent and then actually had the nerve to tell me that\u2019s what I said I wanted done. Really?!? I just got done saying I wanted to split up the services and I asked for specific ones to be done. Then they just did them all anyway. To me that seems like a place that\u2019s more concerned with getting as much money as they can from you and very little concern about your actual pet. And I don\u2019t like how they take your pets in a back room to do everything. My last vet did all the shots right in front of you and didn\u2019t have anything to hide from you.

Very disappointed in this place we used them for years and through countless surgeries and check ups but the moment our dog gets to old to bring into the office they write him off.  Let me explain he is 17+ years old and takes a pain relief medicine called caprofen for arthritis (it is a non narcotic).  Instead of allowing us to purchase more caprofen to help with his pain for his remaining time they demanded that we bring him in for blood work.  After explaining how stressful that is for him and how we would rather not do that and asking if there is any other way to get the prescription filled they told me no.  So let me get this straight you need blood work for a prescription that he has been taking for over a year to tell me \"The numbers are good but he is old and will die soon\" or \"The numbers are bad but he is old and will die soon\".  Look I understand that my dog does not have much more time I am just trying to give him his best life for the remaining time he has as long as he enjoys assisted walks outside, eats food and drinks water I will continue to do so I just wish this vet clinic had more compassion towards its animals.

They do not keep good records on vaccinations, procedures or other visits.\n\n2. They will overcharge you for things they did not do. Multiple time we have been charged for vaccines that didn\u2019t happen (or weren\u2019t recorded), nail clippings that didn\u2019t occur, etc.\n\n3. Along the lines of record keeping, they will not transfer your records to any other vets- even if it\u2019s so you can board your animals at a location 3 minutes away instead of the 20+ minutes away they are.\n\n4. For the cost of their services, their facilities are a joke. I\u2019m not sure where their money is going because it is not to hire good staff (except Dave and Ivey)  or going back into their vet offices or boarding areas.\n\nAgain, incredibley disappointed in their professionalism and customer support after years and years of loyalty.

When we decided to take our animals to the McCurdy clinic again, Dr. O'Reilly had taken over the clinic. During that visit, Dr. O'Reilly was informative, he asked us questions, listened to our concerns, and gave us options regarding how to address our animal's needs. Since then we have been thru a lot with he and his staff! Thru everything, they all showed us and our pets caring and concern and were always there if we had any questions. Dr. O'Reilly is professional and practical when it comes to our pet's needs and understands not everyone has bottomless pockets! He will also refer when needed. We have seen Dr. Maddox on several occasions and had good experiences with her as well.

Dr. Farmer is a wonderful vet and I have used him for years. However recently we saw Dr. Bearden. I cannot recommend her under any circumstances. My dog had an obvious deformation in her leg after an accident. Dr. Bearden put her in a splint, took X-rays and told us she would send them to a surgeon. Each week we went back and the treatment plan/diagnosis/story changed. The staff would tell me something different than she did each time. She never sent the X-rays to a surgeon. 6 weeks this went on. (Shame on me for letting it go on so long) On the last visit the dog was dropped off 7am, at her request, for observation without the splint. She didn\u2019t look at the dog or remove the splint until I called at 1:30 for an update. At 3:30 she claimed the dog only had \u201cliganitis\u201d but was still not putting weight on the leg. When I asked about the \u201cdent\u201d she claimed I had never told her about it. Not true, and it was easy to see on the dog\u2019s leg. She wanted to give the dog back without a splint. I had the staff splint the leg and took the dog to another vet. She had to have a metal plate surgically implanted to fix the damage. Because of Dr Bearden\u2019s poor diagnostic skills, I cannot recommend PC Animal Hospital unless you see Dr. Farmer.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888962c804fbec89:0x71ba20c35393e330"}

Namie and Griffin are truly the best veterinarians in the area, and I can say that truthfully, as I visited nearly every single one of them prior to finally settling at Smiths Station Animal Hospital as my clinic-of-choice nearly five years ago. I originally stumbled upon Dr. Griffin and SSAH when I was searching for a place to have my dog, Lou, who I had recently adopted from Columbus Animal Care and Control, treated for heart worms. At the time, I didn't have the funds available to pay for the fast-kill treatment, but every other clinic I had visited informed me that I had no other options, and that my dog would die very quickly if I refused to have the treatment performed. I met with Dr. Griffin that first day at SSAH, and he was the only veterinarian I had seen (out of at least a half dozen) who understood my predicament and explained that we could start Lou on the slow-kill treatment option until I had saved up the funds to do the fast-kill, as the slow-kill may not work long-term but would certainly extend and improve Lou's quality of life until I could afford the more expensive treatment, since it would prevent the heart worms from continuing to multiply and may even kill off some of the mature worms. SSAH was also the hospital I rushed my dog, Charlie, to the first time he had a seizure. My husband met with Dr. Namie that day, who ran a battery of tests that were all reasonably-priced, and who went over every detail of what she was doing, what it would cost, and what the short-term and long-term implications might be for our Charlie. It was that visit that solidified SSAH as our home clinic, if you will. Since then, we have taken no fewer than eight dogs and two goats to see Drs. Namie and Griffin, and each time we go we are treated like family. It is glaringly apparent that these doctors have a heart for animals that exceeds what one would think is possible for a normal human being. Dr. Namie has devoted hundreds of hours of her own personal time to care for animals at the clinic after-hours, including my own pets on multiple occasions. Every time we step into the clinic, our pets are greeted by name by nearly every member of their staff. Our pets are excited to visit their friends at SSAH, where they have been apprehensive of visits to other veterinary clinics in the past. Drs. Namie and Griffin and the staff at SSAH have always been available to answer my questions, even if I am unable to bring my pets in at the time. It is incredibly comforting to know that a professional, educated, experienced, and compassionate staff of veterinary medicine professionals are always just a phone call away in the event of an emergency. I recommend Drs. Namie and Griffin and the staff at SSAH to anyone and everyone who may be searching for a veterinary family to which they can trust their pets' care. Our pets are our family, and they are SSAH's family, as well; after five years of excellent medical, preventative, and emergency care administered by the doctors and staff at SSAH, that much is obvious. Do not hesitate to take your pets here. You will not be disappointed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cc8b2400c59a7:0xc1321240562cdaaf"}

Veterinarians are the only ones legally to purchase certain products directly from the manufacturer. 1-800-Petmeds has a reputation for \"illegally using\" veterinarians DEA numbers. This can cause legal problems with vets, therefore a lot of vets will not fax directly to some online pharmacies. This is just a way for the vets to protect their identity and reputation. Most clinics do not mind writing a written prescription at all, I know Smiths Station does not mind. A lot of people do not know this information, neither did I until I asked. It makes sense. The reason for the tests is because heartworm preventions require a recent blood test. Its like when we go to the doctor, certain types of meds need bloodwork before prescriptions can be filled. If certain values are not where they need to be the medication could be harmful to the body. Sometimes we may think that ones policies and procedures are ridiculous and just another way to get money, but the true story is, the doctor and staff just want to make sure that the pet will not be harmed. I do know for a fact that most clinics, including SSAH will do their best at price matching online pharmacies. Never hurts to ask right :o) Novartis, the maker of Interceptor is not selling certain products to vets because of FDA requirements.

She came back happy and clean (all pets are required to leave with a bath) which was lovely.\n\nHowever, there were a few problems.\n\nFirst, there is a gray cat that wanders around in the lobby. I might be a bit more understanding if the cat was relaxed and calm, but it clearly doesn\u2019t like dogs (hissed at ours as soon as it walked in). It was walking all over the counter and floors when we dropped off and picked up, and was actively rubbing itself on the items owners were leaving for their dogs. Everyone in my household has cat allergies, so this was very unwelcome for us. Additionally, not all dogs can handle being around a cat or their scent, and with leashes coming off and on there is way too much opportunity for an attack to happen. That puts people\u2019s dogs AND the cat in danger, which just seems so irresponsible for a clinic/boarding facility.  As we were picking up, we also witnessed this cat suddenly scratch a woman that had been petting it. I know cats can be finicky but what if that had been a child?\n\nOur second issue was that we had to ask where the rest of her items were when we came to pick her up as they weren\u2019t with her bag. Their boarding paperwork requires you list all the items you will be leaving with your pet, so what was the point of filling it out if it doesn\u2019t matter?\n\nThird, we left exactly enough food for our dog to be fed for 6 mornings and 6 nights when we dropped her off Monday morning, so you can imagine our surprise when we saw 2 bags of food left. When we asked the receptionist why she still had food left over, she directed us to someone who might have been feeding her for the time she was there. He said that he and one other person were responsible, yet when we asked he couldn\u2019t explain why there were 2 bags left. First he said he didn\u2019t know, then he said she ate everyday. Which means she either ate someone else\u2019s food or someone didn\u2019t feed her. Either way he clearly didn\u2019t know and didn\u2019t want to get in trouble. We label her food bags because she has to take a fish pill for constipation in the morning(which we leave in the bag) and both bags were morning bags, so that\u2019s 2 days of her stay where she didn\u2019t get her food OR her pill. It\u2019s unacceptable that no one could answer whether or not she had been fed. If she had just not eaten on those days I would understand, but they didn\u2019t even know the answer to that.\n\nI will say that our dog was clearly much calmer and happier at the end of her stay than she has been at other dog boarding facilities, but sadly the other issues will likely keep us from using this facility in the future.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a8008a431853:0x54e11952ed42bc8f"}

When I took my animal inside, the stench of litter box odor filled the air.  There was a cat on the receptionist's counter, one on a bench in the waiting room, one behind the receptionist's desk, and I think another cat was present.  I was too shocked to really remember.  When we walked towards the exam room, the smell seemed to be stronger and I noticed things appeared to be dirty.  I declined service and stated we were leaving because it was too dirty and smelly.\n\nI had phoned around for prices on vaccinations, and this place was one of the cheapest.  We recently moved to the area and our small-town vet back home had a building that wasn\u2019t fancy or anything special to look at from the outside.  However, the outside was always clean and maintained, and the inside was spotless.  I hate to judge a book by its cover, but in this case the outside spoke for the inside.  I highly recommend taking your pet elsewhere.  When I left the Colbert Animal Clinic I phoned the Tennessee Valley Animal Clinic, which is located up the highway about a mile.  They offered to work my pet in and were only a few dollars higher.  It was money well spent to have my pet cared for in a clean and well maintained facility.\n\nThe staff at the Colbert Animal Clinic seemed friendly and nice, but I was only in there for a couple of minutes.  On the phone the receptionist mentioned they offered kennel services; but after seeing the office, I can only imagine the condition of the garage where they kennel pets.  Do yourself and your pet a favor, spend a few bucks more and drive up the highway to the Tennessee Valley Animal Clinic or another local vet.  Surely there can't be one that is more smelly, filthy, or dirty.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d4e567d57ee1f:0x5c629f86ef7c2d4"}

There is duct tape holding their scale wires to the wall and numerous random food items and personal items scattered though the shelves of the weight intake area.

I understand that MRVC has to stay in business but this is absurd, especially when we're trying to save the kitten's life! You try to do something good and get punished for it. This experience really left a bad impression, combined with them charging us $170 to euthanize our old Chihuahua a few months before.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a52b7fa1f9e0d:0x90bf5f46b113c2c1"}

Our fees are based on our own costs to provide what we feel is exceptional care. Making sure your pet has the best and most current diagnostics, surgical equipment, and experienced staff ultimately pays off in the long run, because it results in fewer tests and procedures as well as healthier animals. Our policy regarding checks is one we arrived at after long experience and is not intended to be punitive or insulting, but one we had to adopt as a business because checks are no longer a reliable form of payment. We do pass along a small processing fee for credit and debit card use to avoid raising the cost of our veterinary services to cover them. As always, the health and well-being of your pets is our priority, and we hope to have the opportunity to provide care for them in the future. We would also welcome the opportunity to discuss your concerns personally and invite you to contact us at the hospital at (205) 486-4500 if you wish to do so."}, "gmap_id": "0x8887e696888377d7:0x4e0b0434c7e4624e"}

He was a riot, and when it came to the serious nature of some of the issues concerning my pet, he was all caring, no-nonsense, thinking outside the box.. I was honestly impressed on several levels with him!! My baby is a bit needy as he has several things going on with him, and this one can be quite a handful, but I have absolute peace of mind taking him here. Again, the nicest people, who you can tell care greatly about their animals and their owners! So far, they've only seen one of my pets, but I will be bringing them ALL here. I don't mind driving a little bit out of my way for people who care about you and your pets!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888e2ad8eb08c29:0x2c72e0255e64d318"}

They were kind and compassionate and my short experience with them were wonderful. But the lady working the reception...by far the WORST encounter I have ever had.\nI am not one to complain, I do not believe \"the customer is always right\" and I also understand sometimes you just catch people on a bad day, but even on my WORST day I have never treated another person the way this woman treated me.\nLong story short, I took a dog in off the street, she turned out to be pregnant and had a litter of 10 puppies. At six weeks old I vaccinated them and de-wormed them, however one was failing to thrive. She quickly became ill and lethargic. I called to get an appointment to have her be seen. (My regular vet was absolute packed out due to the holiday weekend and suggested I call around to try to be seen as quickly as possible) I booked an appointment with Forrest Vet Clinic for later that day. However, the puppy quickly took a turn for the worst and so I rushed her in to be seen early. I knew enough to know it wasn't parvo (and it wasn't) but the dog was definitely suffering from something serious.\n\nThe receptionist greeted me with absolute contempt. While the dog convulsed and whimpered she stood there arguing that I never told her the dog was sick (of course I did but I was too polite to argue) she then curls her lip and says \"you probably haven't even vaccinated it!\" I explained I did and told her the brand used. She goes off on me. Rolled her eyes, told me I wasn't qualified, lectured me about how I had no clue to be buying some shot from a co-op (they were vet recommended and exceptionally reviewed vaccines by the way) all the mean while the dog is suffering terribly and shes too busy rolling her eyes at me to see anything is done about it.\nHer terrible behavior continues until I feel about as big as an ant and like I am human garbage. You would of thought I was some back yard breeder who brought in a trash bag of starved puppies and dumped them in her cornflakes.\nShe continued to roll her eyes and curl her lip and snarl remarks at me until my sobbing 7 yr old whispers to me \"mommy why is that lady making mean faces to you?\" She announces loudly (but to no one because the place was all but empty) \"that dog could have any contagious thing and we don't want it spreading it around. (understandably but come on, have some discreetness)\nWhen the vet saw the pup he was incredibly kind about it, the tech was very compassionate and concerned for my nearly traumatized child who watched the pup convulse and die.\nWhen it was all over I gathered what little nerves I had left and asked through humiliation and tears what the vet would charge to have the puppies de-wormed again at their office. The receptionist snarled yet again and said \"Well I don't know. Who knows what you've given them and what you haven't and when!\" and huffed at me.\nI was tempted to take the remaining 9 (and exceptionally healthy and thriving pups) and dump them in her lap and ask her to so kindly home and feed and medicate and adopt out a group of rescue mutts in the middle of summer.\nI was doing everything I could to keep this litter out of the humane society and it's been no easy financial or emotional task, but this cruel ladies absolute lack of compassion and decency had be more humiliated and disgusted then I have ever been. I had to pull over on the way home and just cry from the stress and humiliation of the entire experience.\nI am not a breeder, these were rescues, I intend to ask no money for any of these precious puppies, and until I find them safe and loving homes I will be footing the bill for vaccines, food, etc. It's expensive and stressful but I am not some careless human garbage and never should of been spoken to as such.\nSo beware. It's a shame because the rest of the clinic seemed absolutely lovely, but I would crawl through hot sand and razor blades before I ever faced that woman at the desk again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ec62749e7f94f:0x636803f2190fa082"}

So I told the staff she wasn't acting right and they assured me that she should be ok and she was  just in recovery mode.  With that being said I call the Dr. On Monday and told him that she was  not still progressing the way I thought I she should have being, and again he assured me she should be ok and to bring her in if I seen any problems at the surgery site. Well here it goes I get home from work the next day which is Tuesday and she was bleeding and had herniated at the surgery site so i immediately took her back in. Dr beech immediately noticed that this was bad and she was rushed to the back for surgery. 3 hours later she was gone. Basically  3 days after i picked her up she died from a simple spayed.

My dog seemed well taken care of and surgery went well. They even called me to update me. The girls in the front are always nice and helpful. After this first experience I decided I would probably use them for all my vet needs. So fast forward to the last visit. I brought my dog in because he\u2019s been sneezing AND having breathing problems. I knew the sneezing was probably allergies but the breathing scared me. The girls up front were nice as always. Then it came time to see the vet. He did a quick examination and explained his throat was swollen and that he was going to give him antibiotics. It had bothered me that he didn\u2019t explain what was causing the sneezing and sore throat. When he came back he went straight into talking about the pills. I had to interrupt just to ask questions. He never once asked me if I had any questions or if there was anything else I was concerned with. I still don\u2019t know what my dog is allergic to and the breathing problems were never addressed at all, which is what made me nervous enough to go to the vet in the first place. I feel like being asked \u201cdo you have any questions?\u201d Or just pausing to let me talk should\u2019ve been common practice, especially if I\u2019m paying over $100 by the time I\u2019m leaving.

Without hesitation or questions Dr. Bruce examined Brownie. Other vets told us \"this is out of my league\" and another commented \"we will have to put him to sleep.\" By this time I had tears streaming down my face, just the thought of no other options broke my heart. Dr. Bruce examined Brownie and told us it was cancer in his tail. His next step was to exray his whole body to see if it spread to other parts. Never uttering the words, \"put to sleep\" at this time.  After exraying and examining my labrador, Dr. Bruce gave my husband our options. On febuary 13th, Dr. Bruce operated on our lab and saved his life. Now he has a beautiful stump for a tail and is getting stronger every day. There are no words that will express what a genuinely caring, compassionate, and fearless veternarian Dr. Buddy Bruce is today. I want to thank him for giving my family our friend and faithful companion the chance for more time together. It is wonderful to see someone who cares for all animals, and is not afraid to offer other options for treatment. Brownie was the best Valentine gift a person could ask for on this febuary 14th, 2018. Dr. Bruce and his staff were the greatest. I personally want to thank you Dr. Bruce for saving Brownies life.

She also had a bump the size of my knuckle in between her eyes. Well 3 days later it got progressively worse so I contacted them and I asked them what should I do she said bring her in for a checkup. I asked if there was a charge she said yes 50.00 I said I didn't feel that I should be charged since this happened to my baby on their watch so she said let me ask the vet she came back said no charge I then told her i didn't appreciate the way my kitten was treated that I was going to take her else where.  Her response was oh ok. Today I took Gracie to another vet and they said it's a bacterial infection and gave her antibiotics for a week then want to see her again in a week.

The person came to the door and asked is this all we're doing or did I want to do blood work as well. I asked how much the blood work was and how much the full total was going to be. She estimated around $250. So I signed off and all was good. I had the vet come out and talk to me about my dogs health and it was all good. She told me someone would call me shortly so I could pay the bill over the phone. When they called, they said I owned $480.80. I asked her what happened to the $250 I was quoted? I completely understand an estimate is just that, an estimate. Yet when you're jumping over 100% over it's ridiculous. She told me someone would call me the next day to discuss.\n\nI get a call from Christy who then tries to inform me that I was quoted $250 for the blood work only.

Lucky for me, I keep a dash cam for insurance reasons and was able to send her the video of the whole conversation.\n\nAfter they reviewed she calls me back and the first thing she says is \"You win, we lose. $250 is the total.\" She proceeded to speak in a very condescending manner to me. This wasn't about winning or losing. She then tried to tell me that me recording on public property was illegal with a bit more rude attitude. I wonder how'd she feel to know I also record all my phone calls as well.\n\nI say all this to state that I wouldn't go back her.

Later in the night he could barely stand. We suspected some type of seizure or stroke. First thing Friday morning we took him to Dr. Berry. He did an x-ray and took blood samples. He told us that Sam had suffered a stroke. Sam could not even stand when we got him to the vet. He stayed at the vet\u2019s Friday through Sunday night. Dr. Berry went in on Saturday & Sunday to check on him and called us with his observations of Sam, even during halftime of the Super Bowl. Monday afternoon we went to get Sam. He could walk but was unsteady on his feet. Dr. Berry and his staff are so considerate of everyone and they love dogs. Very positive experience with them. We have Sam at the house now and his behavior is his usual self as we hope his walking improves.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88627fc65a7993ed:0xc280a6cd424d1db8"}

After doing some research myself and reading that Haws Syndrome can be an indicator for any number of issues, but most often gastrointestinal, I took my vet to another vet clinic and they did xrays and found a blockage in his intestines and other gastro issues.
