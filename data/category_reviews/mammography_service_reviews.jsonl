I am hurt to the core with visit yesterday with my sixteen year old daughter. She has had some issues with her cycle and I took her to see a doctor that I was not familiar with.  I don't understand how a parent can be a parent and have to go through what I have. I was asked by my daughter not to come in and I respectfully understood that request and stayed out. I also had an appointment so when I was out I asked where she was and my nurse pointed me in that direction.  I calmly walked down to where she and the tech were.  I asked for my daughter and the tech says that she is going to get her some water  she's a upset.  I say \"Water?\" I began to shake knowing what has happened.  I text and call. She answered and I asked to come in. She said no and my hands are tied.  I am asked to sit in the hall as others walked by crying my eyes out. I am told that I have to wait in the main waiting room.  I couldn't bare it so I walked in the hallway crying out to my husband. I am then asked back in so the doctor can try to convince me that I didn't know what is best for my child when I tried to suggest other options. I tried to express how I felt. In return I got a story about his daughter 20 years ago. I was told she's trying to please me.  I had already seen another doctor in that building that I asked questions about how a diet change, supplements, minerals,  and vitamins might be an effective way to help. Yet for this doctor wanting to know what doctor would ever say that.  I understand patient confidence and you were her doctor but I am the one who loves and cares for her on a daily basis. I don't understand how I wasn't even considered. I wasn't unreasonable. I have been a patient in this office for 10 years. And have never felt so belittled in my life.

My family doctor sent me here for x-rays .... I asked several times if I needed to make an appointment, but was assured x-ray need no appointment and I would be in and out fast.  This was Friday.  I came by and the person in front of me had extensive tests and it would be at least 2 hours before they got to me.  Understandable - said I would be back on my lunch break on Monday.  Again, was assured - this time by the check-in desk clerk - that daytimes were typically not busy and I probably would be in and out fast.  I have been here an hour and a half, after being told as I came in the wait would be about 15 minutes.
