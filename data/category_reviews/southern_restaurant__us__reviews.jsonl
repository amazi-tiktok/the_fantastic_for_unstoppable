Today was the grand opening so I will forgive them for forgetting the jalape\u00f1o cornbread then giving me biscuits and having to ask for ranch multiple times. The chicken was excellent, They use a crumbly crust almost like you use on fried green tomatoes. And It almost seems like they smoke the chicken first then batter and fry. It was tasty and next time I will have to have the hot. Now for the bad the corn bread was cold, not just room temp but cold. If it was warm then man it would have been great.

They never brought the biscuits, which we paid for because they were part of the breakfast meals we bought. We kept asking the waitress for them. And she kept saying they are still making them. So we finished our entire meal, when I went to pay to said something and they said we are so sorry. Would you like to take the biscuits with you. Well no I wouldn't, 1st of all were done eating. And 2nd if they are ready for me to take with me why weren't they ready to eat with my meal. They didn't offer to take any off the check bc I paid for something I didn't get. Nothing. Just offered the biscuits I'd been asking for my whole stay but couldn't get. Really disappointing considering i went there especially for breakfast food. We were there for about an hour in total.

It's a shame because we were told this was the best BBQ in Alabama. I unfortunately am going to disagree with that claim.\n\nWe ordered take out for a party we were having. Several pounds of pulled pork and pulled chicken. The BBQ was ok, nothing spectacular. We did however have quite a few bones in both the chicken and pork which was alarming since we have young children who were also eating the food. I will say that the sauce itself was pretty good. So there was at least one positive.\n\nThe real disappointment with this establishment came to the bill. Total for our order was $150 which was split with another party. Rather than charging myself $75 and the other party $75, they charged me $150, then charged me again $75, then charged me again another $75. The other part was double charged as well. Upon complaining to Full Moon, I was told that I was not charged multiple times and that it was an issues with both my bank, and the other parties bank. It's now the next week and they are still in fact trying to charge my bank the additional charges, that is per my bank.\n\nWould you like to pay over $400 for only $150 of sub-par BBQ? Probably not.

I'm more into comfort food cafeteria style food and awesome BBQ but none to be found that I knew about in this area so I decided for this place. Wish I could sample the food at places to decide what tasted awesome? I got a Brisket chicken platter. The food was not bad good portions self serve on drinks and BBQ sauces to me a little pricey but overall not bad but to me it kinda lacked a smoked flavor? I've eaten a lot of BBQ over the years and I know good BBQ. Overall, the place had a bunch of celebrity pictures on the wall with TV's in the corner kinda felt more like a sports bar than a BBQ place? The place was clean and probably not a bad place to take a friend or meet up with someone as it was convenient but depends what you are looking for and how picky you are in great BBQ.

With that said, I had an experience there that has me rethinking my BBQ choices. My family and I went to Full Moom last weekend to celebrate my son's birthday. We ordered the smokey wings like we always do, as well as ribs, greens, mac and cheese, and fried okra. The sides were tasty as always, the okra cooked a little too hard, but edible. The wings however were smoked, but very raw inside. I am not sure why because it took them an hour to bring out the wings in the first place. When we brought this to the attention of the staff, they apologized and said they are not smoking anymore wings so we would have to choose something else. We specifically came for the smoked wings, but we had already been there over an hour at this point and just wanted to consume a meal. They were suppose to replace two 10 piece orders, buy brought two six pieces. Once this what brought to their attention the server got upset and said you need to go up to the register with your concern and they will work out a refund. So not only did they have cook my food, short me my food. I waited in a 20 min line to get reimbursed for services not rendered. This was my first bad experience at full moon, but sometimes that is enough. I sent a message to the survey on the back of the receipt and not one person's follow-up up.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1570205301172, "text": "Hi Anthony, thank you for your feedback.

We have to get a table because my  86 years old adopted  Mother has dementia and down \ud83d\udd3b n a wheelchair.  After waiting 20 minutes still no table available. My adopted 81 year old Dad asked to speak to a manager. The host then got us a table after waiting 30 minutes. We looked in all corners and they were available tables everywhere. When the manager did come to our table I told her about our experience and  asked her why this happened and she explained she was short handed with staff and she was swamped with doing to go orders. If someone is in a wheelchair and I can't stand very long and there's no sense in them not offering at least a place that's available to sit until our table was available. I have a bad torn hamstring. If management don't get better we will take our business somewhere else. I will be contacting cooperate office. I have the manager's name's. This is very bad customer service when we are regular customers and my adopted parents drive a long distance. Besides this Logan's the one in Moody is even much worse. We've gave Moody chance after chance. It's poor management at that store. It's ashame I just moved here a year ago and when I first started going and our good experience only lasted maybe 3-4 months now we can't even eat here anymore. It's lousy. Don't do any good to talk to the manager. Moody  Al don't know how too cook a medium rare steak. It's always too tough. I should have sent it back but I didn't.

There were three factors. Baby Back Ribs were not properly cooked......an ongoing problem at all the locations in the Birmingham area.  I have learned to have a picture on my phone showing the proper preparation when I run into this problem.  As I was politely attempting to explain this issue with manager John Prince, Mr. Prince's attitude was hostile, uncooperative and confrontational. When I asked if he knew how they were supposed to be cooked, he replied, why don't you tell me how they are supposed to be cooked.    At this point I knew I needed to document the conversation and started my phone recorder.  Mr. Prince said I am not going to talk with that recorder on.  I asked Mr. Prince's name and he just stared at me.  I then prepared to leave and Mr. Prince said his name and walked off.  My waitress did a splendid job.  The issue with the ribs is they were pre-cooked as usual, but then they were not finished on the grill.  They were warmed up and BBQ sauce smeared on them. It appears that race may have even been an issue.......I am white and Mr. Prince is black. Mr. Prince never acknowledged the ribs were not properly cooked nor did he offer any apologies or consolation for my dining experience. At approximately 5:15 pm, Logan's District Mgr Charlie Eben called me in response to my complaint.  Mr. Eben assured me that employees would be retrained to insure that proper food preparation would result and the John Prince would also be counseled.  Sorry Mr. Eben!  I have heard promises like that too many times.  It is a roll of the dice no matter how many free meal cards you want to send me.  Your sincerity is in doubt.  There are too many good and quality companies out there with whom I will do business.  Just for the record, I am including a photo of your signature Baby Back Ribs when prepared properly.....and this photo was taken at the Trussville location several years ago when they were doing it right!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5meTA3g87mqIEgBhLxUFVvMvDBZsYFfZ7Pi9K=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOruS7JqwKqimfLfTToU9zMi6yQsE4lgxgHOyW=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1488303649780, "text": "Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

I asked The hostess how much longer and she said her manager was waiting for a party to finish before she sat us. Another 10 minutes went by and I began to get upset because our placement should not be based on when another family finishes eating. We were about to get up and leave but a server came and got us, told us he was working a big party but he would be more than glad to serve us. Keep in mind the hostess never came by to address us again, nor did any manager. We would probably still be sitting there now if the server who was around the bar area did not offer to wait on us. Now granted I am not an unreasonable person nor am I impatient but the lack of professionalism displayed by the management team was unacceptable. We arrived around 6:20 we were not eating to well over 8:00 pm. I didn't want any discount or free food just the common courtesy to say I'm sorry for your wait and we will get you and your family served as soon as possible, but I guess that was too much to ask for.

We sent the wings back and told the server that we would pay for the three wings he ate and ordered something else. The manager came out, not to apologize, but to tell us that we didn't need to pay for the three wings. Oh ok, thanks. Guess that was his solution to the problem but then we receive the replacement meal. The replacement meal that we paid full price for and paid extra to get an upgraded side of macaroni and cheese that came in a container that was less than half full. So what do we do? Pay the bill, tip the server her 20%, take the food and leave to not return any time soon until someone in management encourages the kitchen staff to always work hard at sending out quality food.

Over half of the restaurant was empty. Then they seated four 2 tops before me and my wife and 1 child. Even though we were next in line according to the hostess. I can understand seating 2 tops over 3 because they are busy and that's what's available but they had half of the restaurant empty. There was no reason to adhere to section integrity when tables are open. Then they were out of the steak I ordered and when the steak I chose  was served it was cold.\n\nIn the end the food wasn't bad but wasn't worth what I paid or the 2 plus hours we spent there. I have finally learned my lesson and will never ever give them another chance.\n\nWe never heard from a manager to explain what was going on.

Hands down the WORST dining experience I've ever had in my 30 years. The wait wasn't too terribly bad, but after we were seated was terrible.\n\nMy roommate, her son, her girlfriend, and I were sat and promptly greeted by our server. We each ordered drinks, and then our food. The salads were pretty good, but then things took a U-turn.\n\nOur food was first brought out to the table next to us. When we brought this to the attention of the server who brought it, he said \"Let me go check the ticket.\" I know from some knowledge shared with me that when that happens, a fresh order is to be made because it touched the table. So the same man finally brings us our food, with the exception of my roommate, which I happen to know is another mistake, as we should have all been served together. I should also note these plates were the same ones as before, which I happen to know because I had a clear line of sight to the kitchen from where we were sitting. This is a health violation.\n\nSo after bringing our steaks out, I notice mine is undercooked (I ordered medium and got medium rare). My roommate's girlfriend's steak has been cut into, which is ANOTHER huge no-no. When this was brought to the attention of the man who brought them out (the same man I mentioned before), he claimed that was how it was cooked and acted as if he didn't care when we stuck a knife straight through the pre-existing hole in the middle of the steak.\n\nAfter the guy walks off, my roommate's girlfriend goes to our server and asks to speak with a manager. Our server points directly at THE GUY WHO HAD BROUGHT US OUR FOOD. You remember him- the rude one. So she asks if there is another manager around. Keep in mind that my roommate still hasn't seen the first morsel of her food. She informs her that the other manager's name is Jennifer and she will be right over. Jennifer was great and went above and beyond to try and turn our visit around. She quickly explains she will check on my roommate's food and bring fresh steaks out to replace the ones we had.\n\nMy roommate finally gets her food, and there is cinnamon all over her baked sweet potato- which she specifically ordered without cinnamon. But there is also cinnamon all over her steak- why would the steak have cinnamon on it in the first place? So they bring out a fresh potato, which tastes like it's been sitting out for about 2-3 days before it was brought out to the table.\n\nMy roommate's girlfriend and I finally get our fresh steaks, and mine is RARE when I cut into it- worse than before.\n\nWe left not having to pay for any of our food, including what my roommate's son ate because his was fine- but I still won't be back.

Let me say I've been to this Logan's many times since it opened, in fact it use to be one of my favorite restaurants in Trussville, but that has definitely changed. We got there a little after 2 PM and had to wait for a table until almost 3 PM. Now, I understand it was a Saturday, so even though it was annoying I was willing to look past it. Once we sat down, we sat there for 45 MINUTES without anyone even acknowledging that we were there. My uncle had to get up and go find someone to even get them to come take our drink order. After finally placing our drink order, it took another 45 minutes to get our drinks...and most of us ordered WATER. Our waitress had a terrible attitude,  we didn't even get our food until almost 5 PM, and once we did get it, it was not good. 3 1/2 hours for what should have been a simple lunch, when most of it was due to sitting around waiting on someone to even acknowledge that we were there is ridiculous. If it hadn't been for my grandmother refusing to leave, we would have left. And then, when my uncle asked about getting a discount, because there was no way we were paying full price for the terrible service, the manager had the nerve to ask \"Why do you need a discount?\" Even the management didn't seem to care.

However, after this pass weekend, they left me no choice. My fiance' and I go to Logan's faithfully, so needless to say, we have spent too much money in this place to be treated the way we were. The service and food quality has really gone down hill. Quite frankly, I can see why they're having to close so many locations now because the competition is better. Granted, all of the other Logan's in this city ARE indeed horrible, but this one was still the best in my book. That is no longer that case!\n\nFirst of all, we ordered a basket of fried pickles, and we received a half of half basket of fried pickles. I would rather they just told us they were out rather than bring us what they did. We ate those because we were hungry, it was getting late, and we expected a much better dinner than appetizer. It got no better! We waited over 30 minutes for food, and when we got it, most of it was cold as hell. I guess our waitress forgot about it and left it on the counter. My fiance' had meatloaf that was not thoroughly cooked in certain areas, he never got the fries he ordered, so he practically left everything on his plate, he never touched the mashed potatoes and gravy. Our waitress took up our concerns with the manager about our 30-minute wait and the missing items, and as a courtesy she removed 3 whole dollars from our ticket. That was the cost of a side! Gee thanks! You took off what exactly? Our taxes off one of our sides! Then she goes on to explain that they had a party of 35 people come in that they had no idea was coming. That's great, but what the hell does that have to do with us? That's not our problem!! If your business can't serve large parties while maintaining the quality and integrity of your food to all other visitors then you SHOULDN'T be in business... PERIOD!\n\nBasically, we paid full price for horrible food and horrible service. It's sad because we WERE faithful customers, and Logan's just lost us.

I have eaten here several times and the service has been average, but yesterday was awful. The hostess said it was a 30minute wait to get a table and their were people ahead of me waiting. However she said that if I would sit at the bar that there would be no wait and I would get immediate service. What a misstatement. As I proceeded to the bar, I couldn't help but notice 6 tables empty and wondered why no one had been seated there. Anyway, I sat at the bar and spoke to the gentleman who was seated to the right of me. He said that it had taken 20 minutes for them to take his to go order and that he had been waiting an additional 40 minutes for his prime rib order to come. After about 20 minutes of waiting myself, the bartender/waiter finally brought me a menu. I told him I wasn't expecting to wait an hour for my  food like the gentleman next to me. He said food was coming out in about 30minutes which obviously wasn't happening. Finally the waiter came to take the order of the gentleman on my left side who was with a young boy. He had been waiting over 30 minutes for his order to be taken. He explained to the waiter that he had ordered prime rib on his last visit and was disappointed because there was more fat than meat on his portion.  The waiter told him that the prime rib is usually very fatty and that gives flavor to the meat. I thought to myself that I have eaten prime rib at many places that had little fat and was very meaty, juicy and tender. The bartender/Waiter then suggested that the gentleman order the new York strip. At that moment I changed my mind about ordering the  16 ounce prime rib and decided that I would order the 22 ounce porterhouse,if I could ever get my order taken. By then the poor guy on my right was getting antsy because he had been there over an hour and said that if he had not already paid for his to go order that he would leave. Finally someone else came and asked him what he had ordered since he had been sitting there forever. That  person went to the kitchen and the bartender finally came out about 5 minutes later with the man's order. I thought to myself I hope he has his order right in his bag after that awfully long wait. So now I've been waiting over 35 minutes and still have not had my order taken. So now the bartender waiter guy goes to take someone else's order, bless their soul who was there before me. At that point, I could not take anymore,so I politely got up and told the people around me to have a nice evening and left. I would think that a major franchise as Logan's Roadhouse would provide extra help on busy days like Sunday. I left went to the grocery store and bought a large tbone steak and took it home and cooked it. Oh, also one lady ordered only potato skins to go and said she has been there over 30 minutes.

I have eaten here several times and the service has been average, but yesterday was awful. The hostess said it was a 30minute wait to get a table and their were people ahead of me waiting. However she said that if I would sit at the bar that there would be no wait and I would get immediate service. What a misstatement. As I proceeded to the bar, I couldn't help but notice 6 tables empty and wondered why no one had been seated there. Anyway, I sat at the bar and spoke to the gentleman who was seated to the right of me. He said that it had taken 20 minutes for them to take his to go order and that he had been waiting an additional 40 minutes for his prime rib order to come. After about 20 minutes of waiting myself, the bartender/waiter finally brought me a menu. I told him I wasn't expecting to wait an hour for my  food like the gentleman next to me. He said food was coming out in about 30minutes which obviously wasn't happening. Finally the waiter came to take the order of the gentleman on my left side who was with a young boy. He had been waiting over 30 minutes for his order to be taken. He explained to the waiter that he had ordered prime rib on his last visit and was disappointed because there was more fat than meat on his portion.  The waiter told him that the prime rib is usually very fatty and that gives flavor to the meat. I thought to myself that I have eaten prime rib at many places that had little fat and was very meaty, juicy and tender. The bartender/Waiter then suggested that the gentleman order the new York strip. At that moment I changed my mind about ordering the  16 ounce prime rib and decided that I would order the 22 ounce porterhouse,if I could ever get my order taken. By then the poor guy on my right was getting antsy because he had been there over an hour and said that if he had not already paid for his to go order that he would leave. Finally someone else came and asked him what he had ordered since he had been sitting there forever. That  person went to the kitchen and the bartender finally came out about 5 minutes later with the man's order. I thought to myself I hope he has his order right in his bag after that awfully long wait. So now I've been waiting over 35 minutes and still have not had my order taken. So now the bartender waiter guy goes to take someone else's order, bless their soul who was there before me. At that point, I could not take anymore,so I politely got up and told the people around me to have a nice evening and left. I would think that a major franchise as Logan's Roadhouse would provide extra help on busy days like Sunday. I left went to the grocery store and bought a large tbone steak and took it home and cooked it. Oh, also one lady ordered only potato skins to go and said she has been there over 30 minutes.

Yesterday June 11th my family and I went there for my daughter's birthday dinner. We got seated right away. But then it took 10 minutes before the waitress came to take our drink orders. This was shocking since the restaurant was fairly empty. Also The waitress tried to bring my daughter Coca-Cola  twice when she had sweet tea that was empty . But that is not a big deal. Upon receiving our steaks That's when we were told that what my youngest daughter ordered they did not have. They asked her to re-order while the rest of us had our food in front of us.\nI am not the type of parent that will eat in front of my child that has nothing. At that point I asked to speak to the manager. I watched as the waitress went over to the manager and told her I would like to see her. But she did not come right over. It took at least five minutes before she came to see what was going on. I explained what had happened and she did not even apologize. I asked her what we can do at this point. She said she would take our food back and make sure that we all got them served at the same time. It just did not sit right with me that she did not apologize and I had to ask what we can do to fix the situation. At that point I asked her for a check because we were leaving. It was then she just pointed towards the door. Again not apologizing or saying you don't owe anything. Just pointing towards the door. So we walked out and left the food on the table To say I am disappointed is an understatement. I especially felt bad for my daughter who just wanted to eat there on her birthday.

My salad came out with my dinner, my son had to ask 3 times to get water and more bread. My order was wrong and my to go order for my husband came out to me plated. His side salad never came with his order. I waited 20 min for a box to take our nasty food home to give to our dog. When I asked the waitress if she could get my to go side salad as fast as she could (seeing that I already paid for it and I over paid on my bill) there was literally about 3-4 bites of lettuce. My son had practice at 6:00 and it was close to 5:50. Mind you we we got there at 4:45 and ordered right away with our drink order. We were done eating before 5:30. This is a real shame since my son is obsessed with your dinner rolls and we frequently dine there. I will never go back again. I paid for things I didn't get. I don't know if the cook was new but my steak had so much seasoning on it it was barely edible. I scraped as much off as possible. If our waitress would have been more attentive I would have said something. We spent too much of our time seated with no one taking care of us. Even when I said I have to go please give me my receipt to sign, she dropped it off with no pen. Leaving me to have to chase down another waitress to borrow her pen.

But now my friend and I look back (2-3 days later) because we're still distraught over our experience, there were several red flags, which started from the moment we walked in to be seated.\n\n1.  When we walked in to be seated there was a customer complaining about there service and how they never received items that they ordered.\n\n2.  The first thing we noticed once seated (which was promptly considering they weren't busy at all) was the table across from us hadn't been cleaned.\n\n3.We sat for about 15 minutes before a server (black male). finally came to our table.  He stands there with his arms crossed speaking abruptly says, \"have y'all decided what you you want to order\". Without a greeting or introducing himself, we were caught off guard because it felt like he was a drill Sargent commanding us to order our food! We ordered and noticed his arms were still crossed AND noticed he wasn't writing down our order!  It felt as if someone made him come to serve our table.\n\n4.  While we were enjoying our appetizer, which a nice, cheerful young lady brought to us, he returns once to let us know since it was 2:44 p.m., it was too early to put our order into the system because  it's a certain time to order the 2 for $15.99 special, which we understood.\n\nAs a result of not writing down our order initially he came back to ask what our orders were again!  Then shortly after that, the initial young lady comes back to ask my friend what his entree was.\n\n5.  Also, while we initially started eating our appetizer, we noticed there were no napkins.  My friend had to get up (while on crutches and wearing a boot) had to go find us napkins!\n\n6.  The entrees were served and the first thing I noticed was my salmon seemed very dry and I thought it was because the oil topping was missing.  I also noticed I received a mushroom skewer, which I'm allergic to mushrooms.  I was supposed to receive the veggie skewer.\n\n7.  The table across from us still hasn't been cleaned, this has been after sitting there over an hour (2:30 - 3:30 at least) looking at it.\n\n8.  After talking to the sweet manager and explaining to her that this could be a training moment for our server(at this point we hadn't started eating to notice the actual condition of our food), by this time,  we're frustrated and ready to leave.\n\n9.  While the female manager was adjusting our ticket to remove the appetizer, I noticed my food wasn't cooked properly.  The sweet potato wasn't cooked all the way through!\n\nMy friend has to get up once again, now to request carry out containers because we haven't seen our server lately except from across the room while he was just standing there talking to someone.\n\nThe server comes to ask if we need carry out containers.  I explain that my friend just left to go find containers. At this point he realizes hat we can use a refill on our water, which was the best 2nd thing we've had after the appetizer.\n\n10.  The next day (Sunday).my friend takes his dinner to work and realizes his chicken isn't done in the middle!  This is when he and I start to reflect on our overall dining  experience at this location!,\n\nI do not recommend this location, please consider the Fultondale or Crestwood locations, l've only had good service and food from these locations.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1496690231605, "text": "We're sorry to hear about your experience.

The first time we ordered from them, we did a call in order. My food was not cooked to order as I assumed it would be. Maybe my fault for not asking, however, when calling in an order of chicken wings one would expect it to be cooked to order. We've had their breakfast quite a few times it is decent. Prices are fair. On two occasions my food was slightly undercooked (wings). Another occasion my eggs were slightly overcooked/dry. Fast-forward to today (3/11/21) I stopped in for a breakfast biscuit before heading to work. I placed my order with one of the older female cooks. At the time she was preparing what appeared to be some sort of cleaning or mop water with bleach and disinfectants.  After placing my order she walked her nasty a$$ over to the food area, without changes gloves or washing her hands and begin to prepare my food with the same wet a$$ gloves on from the disinfectant water solution! She literally picked up a biscuit with the same wet gloves on! I could not believe my mfn eyes! I said \"Are you going to change your gloves, weren't you just handling mop water of some sort?!\" She said \"oh it's just water with a little bleach in it, it's not gonna hurt you\" The look on my face made her change her f'n gloves and prepare my order! JCDH regulations require staff to thoroughly wash hands between glove changes! So why wasn't this done? I notified the owner and if it wasn't for him being pleasant to us every time we visit, I would've reported this business to JCDH! I immediately called my husband and made him aware of this issue.

So when I saw it on the menu I got hyped. But I always temper my expectations by asking if it's prepared fresh from scratch or frozen, since I don't go out to eat frozen food. The waitress assured me it was freshly made & proceeded to bring out a flat, processed patty drowned in bland white gravy. If the deception wasn't bad enough, the taste was a slap in the face! Everything was flavorless & needed salt or herbs & spices. Since my MIL enjoyed the bland food, I didn't send anything back. The fake steak, field peas, mashed potatoes, chicken wings - they had NO flavor. My nieces were laughing at how often I grabbed the salt & pepper shakers. The only reason they don't get the worst rating is how speedy the service was: it took 5 mins for a table of 4 to get our food. And paradoxically enough their banana pudding is the best around! They should have whoever does the pudding do all the cooking, because today was sadly unimpressive. 3 of 4 people disliked the food, and 2 were first time patrons...Not good. They also need jalapeno cornbread, even though theirs reminds me of Jiffy mix.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2bcd2a346da9:0x259856557fc0614b"}

One member of our party has diabetes, so that particular drink goof up is bad and gave us cause to complain and get replacement drinks. The visit prior to that, we had 3 in our party.  We received and were charged for 4 meals. The cashier had double rung one meal combo.  We had to get a manager to refund the extra meal. Three visits ago, we had a drive through order of 4 meals.  Got home and was missing 1 fry and received 4 Dr Peppers for the drinks when none of the drinks we ordered was a Dr Pepper that time.

They handed the milkshake to my husband, who just put it in the cupholder while he got the other food & passed it to me. I checked to he sure all the food was there & we pulled out of the parking lot. I went to pick up my shake & noticed it was WAY overfilled, and the top had been forced on to where the shake was running all down the sides. There was seriously no way I could drink it without it pouring out all over me. It had leaked all down in his cupholder, then it leaked all over his floorboards & down my leg. I reached on the bag to get napkins to try & minimize the damage, but..  lo and behold... they didn't bother to give us any. I wasn't dressed, or I would've made him turn around and go back. The mess from this shake was ridiculous. I had to wait for hubby to go inside & get paper towels so I could wrap the shake to bring it in the house. Then my daughter opened her box & there was no fork with which to eat her mashed potatoes and green beans. So, bottom line. Food is good.

We pay for the food and start reviewing the receipt as we thought the bill was high, only to notice that they charged us for 2 extra pints at full price.  Pints are 6.95, quarts are 9.95 (may not be exact to the penny but it's close).  I get the three dollar up-charge as that's the difference between the two but why would I pay nearly $14 for 2 pints (2 pints = 1 quart) when I could pay the $10 and get the same thing.  We brought this to what appeared to be the manager on duty (he had a different color shirt than everyone else) and all he would assure us of is that he would speak with the cashier and acted as if we were crazy for questioning the charges for what we received.  He made no offer to correct but only saying \"what do you want me to do?\".  As a customer service manager you should know full and well what to do.  On this alone I won't be back.\n\nFor the product, the brisket was cut thin (who does that) which severely limited the flavor available from the bark.  Got chopped pork, this was insanely dry.  Only saving grace is they give you almost 2 quarts of sauce - it's certainly needed.
