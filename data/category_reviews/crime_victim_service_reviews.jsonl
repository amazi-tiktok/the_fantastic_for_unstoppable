I unfortunately required their service due to my brother unexpectedly passing and his remains had decomposed in his home for approximately a month. I was able to get ahold of Stuart on a Sunday early morning and he quickly took my information and throughly explained the process. I then worked with Steve to complete the work and he handled everything with such compassion and care I am extremely grateful to him. We were faced with a very difficult situation on how to handle this and they handled everything and kept us informed of the project status at all times. They were kind, compassionate and professional throughout. I am very grateful that we used Alabama Bio-Clean for this service and I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to use them again. If you require their services, I highly recommend them and you will not be disappointed. Thank you Alabama Bio-Clean for providing your services and taking care of the families the way you do. We will always be grateful ~The Guerrero family", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1577118412803, "text": "Thank you, Marie!
