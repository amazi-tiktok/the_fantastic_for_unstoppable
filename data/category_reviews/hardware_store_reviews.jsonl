After 20 minutes of running the saw broke and needed a new head.\n\nFirst Stihl gave me a hard time about the saw, made me take pictures of an obviously brand new saw and after a lot of hull-a-ba-loo agreed to fix the saw.\n\nThen they had Electrical Outlet fix it.  It took Electrical Outlet six months to fix the saw.\n\nWent back into Electrical Outlet today (a year later after the saw fiasco) and put $300 dollars worth of material into my buggy.\n\nI went to get a log chain and requested help from the owner, a Mr. Alexander.\n\nHe helped me get the chain and I requested help obtaining hooks to put on the end of the chain.\n\nI had some reservations about the eye hooks, such as would they be as sturdy as the chain itself.  What type was better, etc.\n\nDuring this question session three men came up to us and interrupted our conversation.  Mr. Alexander then just left me standing there with a couple of different hooks in my hand and walked away to discuss college football with what were apparently his friends.\n\nSo, I shopped a bit more, patiently waited at the front desk while these four people gabbed about college football.\n\nWhen Mr. Alexander finally decided to check me out I indicated I was not happy with his leaving me standing there.\n\nWhile explaining this I did not raise my voice or act rudely, I simply told him I wasn't happy with the service level provided.\n\nIt was at this time that Mr. Alexander decided to go ballistic on me.\n\nI got a good reaming out by him.  For good measure he also tossed in a few choice four letter words.\n\nI told him that I was having a difficult time being calm with him.\n\nTo that he pointed at the door and told me to get out.\n\nI then told him about my chain saw experience and that I had refrained from criticizing the store about the poor service because one of his young employees had been very nice to me during a weather emergency we had April 27th, 2011.\n\nOnce again I got told where the door was and to use it.\n\nSo, I proceeded to do so.\n\nAs I was opening the door he shouted at me \"You must be another one of those Terry's\".  I promptly told him who I was and spelled my name out for him.\n\nI try to support local businesses, but he effectively sent me next door to Tractor Supply (where I got everything I came to town for anyway).  Guess it will be Tractor Supply or Lowes in the big city from here on out.\n\nGood luck with your attitude Mr. Alexander.

Now when I got it they told me that if I needed repairs I could take it back to them and they would only charge me for the price of the parts. I was thinking it was a good deal. But however a couple weeks ago it needed wheel bearings wheel assemblies and a whole bunch more so I took it to them and the replaced it all. Now last weekend I was going about 40, mabe, on a the road to see my kids. The roads weren't wet yet it was b4 the rain. However, as I went around a slight curve something happened I can't explain but the car turned completely to the left and hit the side bank and flipped 3 times. The people who were outside and saw it all said it looked like a full mechanical issue. Now when I told the insurance company and they asked family building supplies they said they never worked on the car.

They are not for the customer but only want to make a sell. My wife had a list of exactly what was needed from the person who was installing the flooring in our house and she showed the list to the people who work there. They showed my wife flooring and she picked the color she likes. Not knowing the type of floor was wrong. Remember these are the \u201cexperts\u201d. We unloaded all the floor at the house the next morning the person installing asked why they gave us the wrong stuff. We ended up having to return the floor which we would have purchased the right floor from them but they charged us a 20% restocking fee because they sold us the wrong floor. Knowing what was asked for and needed as my wife showed pictures of the subfloor.\n\nNonetheless they lost our business and stole 20% because they should have fit that bill due to their lack of of professionalism and customer service.\n\nIf you want the cheapest price maybe they are the place to go, who knows. But if you want customer service and want to be sure you are getting the best product for your needs this is definitely not the place to go.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1624747662307, "text": "Yes they did give us a list of materials they needed. On that list were the items that they needed for a remodel and there was a quantity of flooring that they needed not a specific floor but just a quantity. We asked her what type of floor she was looking for so we helped her get a waterproof floor that she asked for. She had over 100 options to choose, yes we have a great variety at great low prices. Theirs was a 5mm/20mil wear layer at only $1.49 Sf by the way. She even took a sample of the entire piece. When they came to return the floor the installer came with her and he said that he seen the piece when they brought it to their home, he said that he seen the sample  when he was at the store. Why he did not mention he could not install that type of floor in that house we do not know (this was before the purchase was made). We gave her the floor she chose not a wrong one. She also read and signed a receipt that she still has that specifically says **no refunds** that\u2019s why we let people take samples so they make sure they take the correct floor for their home. As many people here know that this is a family and USMC veteran owned and operated store and we treat people with respect. We have extensive knowledge about flooring and helped her get a floor that was waterproof that they did not want to install. We then proceed calling our supplier which does take returns at a 20% cost. Which they claim we stole but we have to give that to our supplier to return the floor just like any other store that charges restocking fees for special orders. We tried to help them and get their money even though we do not take returns and they accepted the 20% from the supplier. We never sold a wrong floor. The customer saw and took a sample and we gave her that exact floor that all the names and numbers match to the sample to the receipt and to all the boxes they took. We never sold a wrong floor. We\u2019re just following store policies that she was well aware of when she signed and payed for her floor."}, "gmap_id": "0x888925dfcab2f593:0x34e9f2c50edd6c0b"}

I called 11/20/19 to get a lumber package delivered to save some time. I knew it would be a bit more expensive but more convenient. Delivery was quick and early 11/21/19 unfortunately delivery is at wrong address 100 yards from where it should be and about 15 boards were incorrect. Still no biggie just let them know and I would think it would be taken care of. First call was 8:40 am. Left a message for Dino with another salesman and on his cell phone. Second call was about 12:30 pm, third call was at 3:00 I was told he was still with a customer. I asked the person on the phone to please tell him so that I could hear him answer I needed a call back today, and he did. 3:30 pm Dino calls I explain 15 boards were to be pressure treated and the delivery was in the wrong spot (address) I was then argued with that I didn\u2019t order pressure treated I wrote down the prices quoted and if it wasn\u2019t p.t it was expensive white wood. He put me on hold when he came back to the phone he said the contractor that came in and paid told him the location. I explained it was all done over the phone and there was only me. Where he described is exactly where I told him to put it. Unfortunately that\u2019s not where it was put. He said he would call me back and get it straightened out. No call back, so 11/22/19 I called and left a message with a nice young lady for the sales manager.(I was told his name is Jason).No call back!! I go to see if the package has been moved that afternoon. I have pressure treated wood but package not moved. So much for convenience. Now I will have to pay someone to move the wood.

Hey, they mix paint as well!  Good stuff to boot.  Recently they mixed a color for me that did not come out right. They took my number as they were closing.  The next day I received a call from the owner to let me know they figured it out and it was ready for pickup.  That kind of service with excellent price point and products is what you get from this store l.  Overall, 53 Hardware saves me a lot of time, frustration, and money.  That is well worth my short drive to 53 Hardware for that \"one thing\" at a good price, if not better than the big box.

My shipment is a pallet of 33 boxes of porcelain tile., plus 7 additional boxes they put on the same pallet. The right side of the pallet was coming apart due to the immense weight of the tile . The driver could not move the pallet down the truck. He was not going to be able to pull it up the small slope on my driveway. What on earth were they even thinking?They needed a fork lift.

I checked the shipment tracking and found that they changed it to Tuesday 3/9! I got no call, text, or phone call.So Tuesday 3/9 I message them to find out eta. They said the drivers hadn't left yet and to keep checking they will update me. That never happened.

Home Depot just subs out delivery to the cheapest company....and you can see the quality when your damaged items arrive!\nAnd I pray for you if you have ANY problems with your delivery or installation!!!\nCount on a couple of things: 1) You will spend hours on the phone getting to talk to the right person. Once you think that you have the right person, they will tell you they have to check on something and they will have to call you back. OR, the right person is \"on lunch\" and they will call you back. After giving them ample time for \"lunch\" (3 hours) when you call them back, you will be told that they were \"off today\" but they will return your call in the morning.\nBasically, it's a game of ping-pong and it takes days to get simple questions answered because, obviously, no one who works there wants to actually do anything.\nI can't believe I dropped over $7K in there and they can't even answer a simple question!!!!\nBuyer beware!!! Shop at Lowe's!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb240162a2a6b:0xb64868f9b73224ba"}

When I arrived, fresh from having an MRI which made me hurt even worse from laying flat, I saw a ride along cart and got on it. I was having a very hard time walking. The cart was over half charged but the only one on that side. (Of course plenty were left out in the parking lot, guess I should have gotten one of those.) Anyway, as I'm starting to go, a greeter tells me, ma'am, that was is being charged, and needs to continue charging. Made me feel like I couldn't use it. So I took it back, and hobbled to shop best I could. I couldn't get everything I needed, because the pain was excruciating. She did not offer to find me one, either. The more I hobbled around, the more it irritated me. I should have gotten her name and contacted corporate. I know who to contact as I used to work for Wal-Mart before I became fully disabled. I am so disabled, I had a \"tough judge\" and they concluded that I couldn't work ANY job. But this lady made me feel as if I couldn't use the cart which was well over half charged. I know she was a medium complicated, a bit heavy set and wore glasses. I will still contact corporate over this. I had a helper with me, but couldn't stay in the store long enough to finish shopping. My helper had to just take my groceries to checkout for me as I hobbled back to my handicapped parking spot to wait in the passenger side. It's already bad enough that the store was out of a lot of stuff, but the thing I am really upset about was being treated like I didn't need the cart. Next time I will be quite rude instead of my usual nice personality. That lady should be put in the backroom on cap 2 where she belongs. A greeter, who is part of AP, should be very nice and accommodating. When I worked at Wal-Mart I always went above and beyond for customers. Customers are who buys the things that pay employees. If I didn't live 40 minutes away from a Wal-Mart I would go back and get her name. I do plan to, but will go ahead tomorrow and contact corporate. I will not go back to whittlesey rd Wal-Mart ever again, except to get her name. None of my family, nor myself will ever shop there again. Do better, and don't treat people less than, it will only lead to write ups and dismissal. Very dissappointed and hurt honestly. Wish that lady had to live in my body for a whole week. She would be crying in pain every day and see why she should treat people better. And anyone reading this, when you are treated badly at any Wal-Mart, go and complain to CORPORATE. The managers may not do anything, but corporate takes things like this seriously. And know that the Wal-Mart employees make at least $13 an hour now. They should be doing MUCH better.

Before the door could shut, Jenn walks out the other door behind the register and greets me with a friendly salutation and asks, \"How may I assist you today?\" I'm thinking, \"Am I actually at Walmart?\" I tell her, give her my order number and ID (which she politely requested), she finds the info on her screen, and before walking to the back asks, \"Would you like some water while you wait?\" As she reaches behind her.\n\nWAIT, WHAT? Did she just offer me water? I decline, she excuses herself to fetch my package and I look behind the counter to see a small fridge. SHE DID offer me water... I had to check the sign to remind myself that I was at Walmart and not some fancy schmancy store.\n\nShe brings the order out, confirms it, does whatever she has to while making small talk, I sign for it and I'm out...took less than 7 minutes.\n\nStill in a daze, I walk to Electronics to find the Apple TV thing.

He quickly, without hesitation, stops whatever he was doing and promptly unlocks a cabinet, all the while greeting me and informing me about the item I've requested.\n\nSo now I'm really paranoid, cause he has actual KNOWLEDGE of the item...this has got to be the TWILIGHT ZONE! He rings it up along with my other stuff while chatting away. Everything done, he thanks me for shopping at Walmart (really) and I'm out!\n\nI still don't like this location and wouldn't go back unless by force, but this was a great experience for which I HAD TO write about.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccb4e83b2b117:0x1b62484355485945"}

On two occasions I had to wait until the next day. Today my groceries were to be ready by 9am. I knew they were running behind so I arrived at 11am. I sat in my car with my 8 year old daughter for over an hour before I could get an employee to talk to me and no on would answer my phone. By the time my groceries were brought to my car it was 1:05 pm AND my car battery had died. When I told the Walmart employee that my car battery had died because I had waited so long I received a blank stare and he walked away. Thanks to the kindness of strangers who were also being held hostage waiting for their groceries I was able to get jumped off and on my way after sitting in your parking lot for almost 2 1/2 hours. My advise to you is to communicate clearly and quickly with your customers. Making them wait for over an hour before you even acknowledge them is unacceptable. You had my money and you had my groceries so what choice do I have other than to wait when no one will communicate to me when I should expect my groceries.\nI have been a loyal Walmart grocery online customer since the program started in my area last October, check your records. I use this program because I am a working mother of 3 and this allows me to spend more time with my family and less time walking up and down aisle of the grocery store. Well on three occasions now I have waited an hour or more... I could have done the shopping myself. Needless to say I'm done. I was a loyal Winn Dixie customer before online grocery and since it is no longer a reliable, time- saving service I will be headed back to Winn Dixie. I was nice while it lasted but if you continue to conduct business in this manner you will lose more customers than just me.\nBest of luck!\nName: Heather Davenport\nCustomer ID: 56782149", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccb4e83b2b117:0x1b62484355485945"}

My partner was at the coinstar machine & it took his coins without giving an accurate count. There was a customer service center employee by the name of Virginia Love that came to his aide because she saw it happen too. I walked up as they were on the phone with coinstar customer service, but what blew me was the fact that an employee by the name of VONICE was tasked with helping them solve this issue and she had a horrible attitude about it. She wasn't looking us in the face at all, and when we asked her questions, she'd mumble something and walk away. She wasn't giving us direct answers AT ALL, and she was getting upset with my partner as if it was his fault the machine malfunctioned. She was speaking to Miss Virginia Love SO disrespectfully. it was disgusting how bad her attitude was, ESPECIALLY with how rude she was being to Miss Love, who is visibly older than her. Everyone knows not to disrespect your elders. Miss Love was only trying to help my parter so they would know he wasn't lying. I understand that there is only so much they can do with the coinstar machine without a coinstar vendor present, but VONICE had an attitude from the start. There was another very round woman that came to unlock the machine, she had an attitude as well, but her name tag was flipped over so I couldn't see it. She called my partner \"shawty,\" as if that was professional. she said \"scu'me shawty\" WHAT? Why is that your preferred choice of communication when interacting with customers? The whole experience was mind blowing. However, I am very appreciative of Miss Virginia Love for all of her support, considering how rude the other employees were. It's quite obvious that Miss Love should've been in a higher position as opposed to VONICE who clearly needs more training.

I don't know if I'll have space for this story so here's the abbreviated version. I have to say 1st that I have always loved Walmart, in general. Cheap prices and they have everything. I won't get into all of the politics of it. I just loved them. Went here at 11:30 pm to get a pre-workout protein bar. Parked, turned off my SUV, (which has heavily tinted windows) and was looking for my headphones. Guy tries to open my passenger front door. I hop out and he immediately bolts and jumps into another vehicle. So far, nothing here is Walmart's fault. Went in to tell the manager that someone is breaking into cars and to call the police. I'll never forget the manager's response. \"You'll have to call them yourself. It happens so often that they don't even come when we call them anymore\". So, there are times when one of my kids needs diapers or medicine and everything else is closed so I'll go. And there are times during the day when I need something that costs twice as much every where else I've checked so I'll go. But, I never go alone and it's always super quick. Here's the point. It's a Walmart. Just like every other Walmart. But when the employees aren't even willing to go through the trouble of picking up a phone for criminal acts happening on their property, then I'm never going to feel safe with my family at that store. We all know Walmart has cut way back on security in order to cut rising costs (caused in large part by theft). I'm just one person in, what I am assuming is, a sea people that have actually felt the sting of those cutbacks.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888959c2010cabad:0xcfc4c03312773777"}

I was sent to sylacauga after waiting 5 and a half hours to have a battery tested and returned. Yeah, I admit it was about 20 minutes after the tire/ auto center was supposed to have closed, but I was told by the Talladega employee that a manager at the customer service counter, in sylacauga, would go back and swap out my battery.\n\nSo, I mule in this battery to the customer service desk. The cashier told me the auto dept was closed. I replied that a manager was expecting me. Cashier called the customer service manager up, I explained things to her. She said id have to come back tomorrow as well cause they lock up their batteries at night. I asked if anyone in the building had keys. Frustrated she had to do her job, she hops on the phone. Just a few minutes later she yelled across the customer service area, and said I had to follow her.\n\nSo I tried, she made sure that she was a good 20' in front of me so she could talk with her coworker without being overheard. Im a disabled veteran. I have to pick and choose when I can hurry, and after hauling this heavy battery around for the better part of a day, I was all out of get up and go. And I especially don't care for your small town, holyer- than- thou attitude cause you \"have to turn a key\". It's called doing your job.\n\nAnyways, so I make my way back to the battery area. The manager there went on to state several reasons he couldn't do the exchange. From me not having a receipt (handed it to him, with the last exchange receipt) to the battery being old (the color coded sticker dates it back to November of 2018), and finally the managers settled on being unable to do the exchange because the computer says it's already been exchanged. That's 100%, I traded the last box of garbage for this one.\n\nI'll be calling corporate after lunchtime today.\n\nSummation: the employees are killing this big box store. Don't visit Talladega or Sylacauga. They are both garbage and could care less about the customer.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888959c2010cabad:0xcfc4c03312773777"}

There is no way that any Walmart employees can monitor these thiefs, and also assist others who have computer issues at the self-service registers. There is absolutely NO REASON for a customer to have a cart full of one hundred items of clothes and food, to ever be in the self-service lines. There is not space to accommodate so many items. There must be a limit of NO MORE THAN 25 ITEMS AT SELF-SERVICE REGISTERS. ALL OTHERS MUST BE RE-DIRECTED TO CASH REGISTERS WITH WALMART ATTENDANTS. Doing so will reduce Walmart theft, reduce costs to customers caused by theft, and will allow lines at self- service registers to move quickly, which is the purpose for self-service in the first place. I have seen a husband with one cart and his wife with a second cart, with 6-packs of drinks dangling over the top of carts. This practice must be stopped by Wal-Mart.

I have shopped their for years and am also a club member. As stated in other posts most of the staff are helpful and supportive. While you may find a few that seemed pre-occupied when you ask a question, that is not the norm.\n\nHowever, today lowered my perspective on this store after talking to a store employee over the phone and the manager.\n\nIt seems HFT has known for a long time there is an issue with their emailing receipt system. When you purchase something you can have your receipt sent to you by email, just by giving them a phone number. So apparently by opting into the stores emailing me a receipt, I now will get random receipts by people making up phone numbers or the cashier entering the wrong number.\n\nThe store manager seemed to take this lightly, however I believe they need to invest in better software and even better theft prevention people.\n\nThe receipt I got stated the last 4 numbers of the CC used, and like they said it was not mine. Fine. However, the system should have alerted the cashier that me as being a CLUB Member did not have that CC number related to my account. It should have also detected that my CLUB member name did not match the name of the person on that CC.\n\nBottom line we can not get a good grip on crime in our communities if the stores are not going be responsible with our personal information. What may seem minuscule to some can in fact be a huge issue. Did someone just use my phone number to commit a crime? Purchase items fraudulently at their store?\n\nThe first person I talked to was frustrated at me, telling me it happens all of the time and is no big deal? Really? I get an email purchase notification and I have to stop what I am doing to make sure someone has not stolen my CC number and used it? Its not a dig deal to them, to the consumers it is a HUGE deal.\n\nSo again, it is the consumers responsibility to correct these actions. I was told in order to correct this I must go into the store and request my number be removed from their automatic system. Hmm.... Northern Tools is just down the road guys. Think about it.\n\nIf it were not for the issue with the point-of-sale systems, I would give the store a 5 star rating.. You need to address this issue, stop making the consumers do your work for you.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b8e99f0187f:0xe30e435c8aafedf0"}

I have shopped their for years and am also a club member. As stated in other posts most of the staff are helpful and supportive. While you may find a few that seemed pre-occupied when you ask a question, that is not the norm.\n\nHowever, today lowered my perspective on this store after talking to a store employee over the phone and the manager.\n\nIt seems HFT has known for a long time there is an issue with their emailing receipt system. When you purchase something you can have your receipt sent to you by email, just by giving them a phone number. So apparently by opting into the stores emailing me a receipt, I now will get random receipts by people making up phone numbers or the cashier entering the wrong number.\n\nThe store manager seemed to take this lightly, however I believe they need to invest in better software and even better theft prevention people.\n\nThe receipt I got stated the last 4 numbers of the CC used, and like they said it was not mine. Fine. However, the system should have alerted the cashier that me as being a CLUB Member did not have that CC number related to my account. It should have also detected that my CLUB member name did not match the name of the person on that CC.\n\nBottom line we can not get a good grip on crime in our communities if the stores are not going be responsible with our personal information. What may seem minuscule to some can in fact be a huge issue. Did someone just use my phone number to commit a crime? Purchase items fraudulently at their store?\n\nThe first person I talked to was frustrated at me, telling me it happens all of the time and is no big deal? Really? I get an email purchase notification and I have to stop what I am doing to make sure someone has not stolen my CC number and used it? Its not a dig deal to them, to the consumers it is a HUGE deal.\n\nSo again, it is the consumers responsibility to correct these actions. I was told in order to correct this I must go into the store and request my number be removed from their automatic system. Hmm.... Northern Tools is just down the road guys. Think about it.\n\nIf it were not for the issue with the point-of-sale systems, I would give the store a 5 star rating.. You need to address this issue, stop making the consumers do your work for you.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b8e99f0187f:0xe30e435c8aafedf0"}

A bag of sugar substitute I put in my buggy had a hole in it, got all over my foods and the floor. I asked someone for help so there wouldn't be a mess, and they sighed and said, \"what do you want me to just get the bag from you?\" So, I went no, I'd like a broom so no one slips on it. Person said they'd get someone. The new person came and was very sweet and cleaned up the mess and asked if I needed a new bag. The cashier didn't ring a lot of my veggies as what they were, even when I told her. For example, I had a ton of poblanos, and she rang them as 3 g peppers. My bag of cherries I weighed at around $8, never made it on my receipt. So somehow they didn't get scanned. Free food not a problem for most, but I buy for several ppl, and need the items on the receipt. So, I gave it a three cause it made shopping from a list very frustrating.

They have plenty of handicap parking but as far as someone with a disability being able to go in store and shop that's where they apparently have no concern about. If you have/bring your own mobile cart you will be able to shop..however if you don't you may want to use the services of another store because you will be unable to get around the store to shop. I was there tonight and they only had 3 carts in the store. The two on the side which the doors were opened didn't work at all and the third one, which was on the other end of the store on the closed doors side,  wasn't charged nor was it even plugged in to charge the battery.. I asked an employee who was bringing in carts on the closed side if they maybe had a cart outside that hadn't been brought in by chance. He told me he would go get me one and walked away.. After waiting 10 minutes I proceeded to head back to the other side I had originally came in hoping to catch him headed back. Well no such luck he was no where to be seen. Not only that but while I was on my way there I notice two teen girls ( that definitely had nothing wrong and no need to use) playing around the store with each other on two.. Meanwhile the store had myself needing one and gentleman needing one for his wife so we could shop!! I left the store and went elsewhere to do business. The lack of care or concern this store exhibited is not only shamefully sad, disgraceful and angering but it's unethical, incompetent and reprehensible!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862119337809d89:0xf73913acf5ad4f61"}

The only regular register that was open was the tobacco lane which was backed up with probably 6 or 7 customers with shopping carts. I will use the self checkout when I have small amounts so today I got in that line for the self checkout corral. After waiting in line for several minutes and making to that front the young lady says \"cards only\" I tell her I'm paying in cash and she tells me \"I guess you will have to go get in the other lines\" and turns away. So we go to one of the self checkout with the belts and when we make it there it too says 'card only'. Next we try customer service but there is a customer having trouble with a return and they turn the lights out on us so we finally go to the tobacco line. Probably should have done that to begin with. So on the way out I call the 1800walmart number to complain her answer was the cash shortage that happened a few months ago or she said \"at least that's what they tell me\". I'm sure it was someone that has to count down the cash from the self checkout at night decided they wanted to leave early so they pulled all the cash and switched the registers to card only. This has happened on a few occasions at this store. It was once the cleaner and better stocked walmarts but has suffered for the past few years.

Fifteen minutes after that, the employee pushed the man's order out to his car, unloaded it, and proceeded to have a TWENTY minute discussion with that customer!!!  They were hidden from my view by the man's massive truck, but I could hear them talking - just in regularly toned voices, no yelling or sounds of anyone upset - couldn't hear what they were saying, however.  When the employee finally went back inside the store, it was another 10 minutes before he got my order out to my car!  He again very humbly apologized and blamed the man in the truck for \"needing to talk about something\".  At this time, I had been waiting almost an HOUR!  I could have gone inside and done my own shopping, then been back out to my car by then!

But for convenience I went back, and although it ended up more of an inconvenience, the customers service this manager provided today made me want to leave this review and acknowledge him for doing his best to make things right. Again, thank you.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862119337809d89:0xf73913acf5ad4f61"}

The reason I say that is because they have no cashiers. Everything must be self checkout.  And the problem with that is there are not enough self check outs for the number of customers in the store. In addition the self checkouts  do not all work.  The few that are open and they do not seem to have anybody available to help. I actually saw 1 customer  Leave the store with a full shopping cart as he CV old not pay or get help. I was considering leaving as well. But   I really needed the items so I left for 10 minutes and then came back and was able to use the self check out.\n\nWhat is the purpose of being open 24 hours if you're not going to be  staffed?  They seem to have plenty of people on the floor stocking shelves but no cashiers.\n\nPerhaps the are trying to cut back on pay roll because of the holiday is but that's terrible. As I said if you're gonna be open 24 hours you need to have employees working.\n\nAlso on another note the service desk closes at 10 so customers cannot do any returns after 10pm.\n\nTarget is a much better run store and company.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888903f508190cb3:0x56624955ad684461"}

If I\u2019m checking myself out, I need a discount. Not everyone was made for checking yourself out. Most all of the scan and go were full. Well I found a scan and go open. Found this lady with a yellow vest on and ask about paying for my pictures. She tells me I will need to go to the back to the photo department to pay for them. I said okay, I\u2019ll check myself out and then I will go pay. So I proceeded to check myself out. Well unfortunately I had a item that didn\u2019t have a price tag. So what do you do? Is there some way I can call for a price check? Nope! So I proceeded to look around for help. Found someone in a yellow vest. She called some other guy in a yellow vest. She stands there in my way of checking myself out looking for a price on something  for another customer. Anyway, the guy ask me where I got the 2019 item. I said, in the back. Then he said, I don\u2019t know the price on this item.  I said, that\u2019s fine I will just leave that here and not get that item.\nFinished my self checkout. Go to the back to pay for my pictures. Walk back there and they are changing out the register. The lady says I can check you out in the back. Looks at my pictures and tells me I need a copyright to the picture I took of my sons graduation picture.  She said I can\u2019t give you this picture. So already irritated from my whole trip and wondering were this lady was the hour I had sit here looking for help. I said, that\u2019s fine. Shred those, that\u2019s fine. I just want to pay for the other pictures. She looks at me like I\u2019m crazy. I said the ones you have in your hand. I have several pictures there that doesn\u2019t have a copyright. I want to pay for those.\nI have never complained about any store or any customer service.\nYour customer service is terrible! Scan and go is ridiculous!

What's funny about that is that they run out of stuff that isn't common items, there are always people stocking day and night, and they can be out of an item for over a month (with me checking every week for over a month).\n\nTo list a few of uncommon items they were out of for over a month is tarter powder in the baking section and evening primrose oil in vitamins. There is absolutely no way that for over a month every bottle of tarter powder was bought up. And I don't mean at Christmas time, I'm talking about in June they are out of spices. Ridiculous. The manager or the ordering system doesn't do its job properly. That's the only reason why these things would consistently be out of stock.\n\nWorkers are always stocking items which means they have pallets of items all over the floor even at rush hours when people are getting off of work. The floor itself has too many floor displays which makes it really hard to navigate around them and the large amount of people that tend to be there.\n\nThere is also a huge lack of items regardless of what department you are looking in. The kids clothes is always understocked and has horrible selection. The home section with pots and pans is always lacking anything you could possibly be looking for. I literally couldn't find a basic set of salt and pepper shakers. I've even had to search for basic toothpaste because they were out of all Colgate.\n\nWhen it's time for school shopping, the aisles that contain those items are very clutter and disorganized. You can never find anything. And even when it's not school shopping time, there is still a lack of items where you can find them.\n\nThe electronics section sucks as well. If you are looking for a particular item, they never have it. Period. I even struggled a few months ago to find usb drives. Seriously.\n\nThe meat department never has the cuts of meat I need, even down to the kind of ground beef I buy.\n\nThe whole store is barely worthwhile to go to.\n\nThe only reason I shop here is because it's the only store in the area unless you want to pay triple the price at Publix. This Walmart is more like a Dollar General when it comes to availability of items. The only reason this store succeeds is because no other store has moved into the area. Fingers crossed that we'll get a Super Target or something in the next few years.\n\nFor clothes and any kind of real shopping I drive to the Walmart in Trussville. It's well worth the drive because they are very organized and the selection is always great.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888903f508190cb3:0x56624955ad684461"}

I can have 10 items on list and you can bet they are out of 4 or 5. Some have been out for weeks. Thankfully we have a Publix, Foodland and Winn Dixie in area. Walmart only has a minimum number of manned registers open, they are trying to force everyone to use scan n go and bag their own groceries, lift them into your cart etc. I am a very healthy and very capable, very good mind 82 year old female but I refuse to ck myself out and bag them after paying the high prices for the few items they happen to have.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888903f508190cb3:0x56624955ad684461"}

That being said, the only thing keeping me from giving them a different is for these reasons:\n\n1.)  a single star rating is whenever I\u2019ve had an issue, they fixed the problem to make things right. It didn\u2019t matter if we did online ordering or in-store shopping, it was corrected by whichever one handled the original order.\n\n2.) a 2-star rating because the last 3 or 4 times I\u2019ve been to the store the cashiers were wearing genuine smiles and greeted me when I came up to their lane, were friendly and held a pleasant conversation while they worked, bagged my groceries the way they should\u2019ve been bagged, and seemed like they were there to work and not just be there for a paycheck. The cashier lanes weren\u2019t overly packed. The last 2 or 3 times I was there, the staff stalking shelves asked me if they could help me with something rather than me having to ask them for help or me walking away frustrated which was actually pleasant for a change. The staff that I did ask for help from were awesome too. Both sets of stalkers went the extra mile and did what any person in the customer service industry should do for a customer.\n\nThank you to those wonderful individuals who worked the last few times I\u2019ve been to the store. You guys were awesome and WalMart should have more people like you! Keep up the excellent work!\n\nOverall, what keeps them from getting either a negative star rating (if only it were possible) or even a 4-5 star rating is for reasons listed above. Especially since 9 out of 10 times they are out of the majority of everything, they are massively understaffed, most of the employees are rude and can be even ruder if they feel you are a nuisance when asking for help or interrupting their personal phone conversations, you can\u2019t get through most of the aisles because there\u2019s pallets of stock everywhere, and when we order online the store substitutes items that either is nowhere remotely close to the ordered item or doesn\u2019t use their noggins and give the correct item from their shelves because the item became out of stock online (which means staff if you have it on your shelves, even if the online item says \u201cout of stock\u201d, substitute the same exact item from your shelf and not something entirely different), or they gave my order away to another individual. Yes I know you have the option to reject items but when you go into the store and find the exact same item you ordered on the shelf it kind of irks a person off, especially if it happens more oft than not. There has to be a line drawn somewhere because patience one\u2019s behalf and ignorance on another\u2019s only goes so far.\nFor the record, it was explained to me this way:  when you do your shopping online their stock is a separate entity from the actual store\u2019s stock. In other words if it\u2019s out of stock online it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s out of stock in the store.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888903f508190cb3:0x56624955ad684461"}

When they were forced to call me back, I felt like my problems had been resolved, and my appliance would be delivered. The next day, I received an email that my fridge was ready to be picked up. After calling the store AGAIN, it was finally sorted out. I think I got lucky and spoke to someone who cared that it had been nearly two months of waiting.

He had no info - not even on the process and we explained we had a bad experience before.

We went in to return a work desk that he had purchased yesterday, only to come home and find out that pieces are broken and missing. When we arrived at the return desk we were greeted angrily by a lady named Shelia (her tag said CSA Front Desk). She was in the process of helping another gentleman with a wheelbarrow at the time we arrived so I shrugged her attitude off as frustration to begin with. By the time she got to us she took the receipt from my husband, asked angrily what was wrong to which he informed her that the desk portion (the main part of the item) was broken down the middle and pieces were missing. She rolled her eyes, mumbled a few things, then started to walk away and as she was walking into another room yelled back at us \"you know it's a clearance item right?!\"  She then came back out of that room, struggled to get the lid off the box and then continued to tell us in a displeasing tone that our kobalt work desk was on clearance. I then stated \"so does clearance mean that pieces are broken? If so, lowes should not be selling clearance items\". She then argued with me that clearance items are usually returns with missing pieces and I restated that the main portion of the item is completely broken in half. I don't care if it's clearance or not, it was not marked down nearly enough to compensate for a complete useless, damaged piece. She then slammed a refund receipt down and asked my husband to sign. She never asked if we wanted to swap it with a usable piece. She never asked anything, actually. During this entire transaction she was rude and everything anyone in customer service should not be. She was also complaining and cussing under her breath about no one answering the phone around there during our entire few minutes with her. When we were leaving there were 2 more men waiting patiently behind us and just staring in disbelief at what they witnessed and would unfortunately encounter. I told one man good luck as we walked off and he said it looked like he needed it.

They were the absolute nicest WalMart employees I\u2019ve ever spoken with. They were so understanding and polite. They even called me later in the afternoon to confirm my order had been cancelled & the money would be back in my account in 2-3 business days.\nI wish all WalMart employees had the same attitude as these guys!

I have trouble getting my own photos developed there, because they are continuously falsely accusing them of being professionally done.  I can request them from the Walmart website and have them delivered without question or harrasment.  They purposefully denied an enlargement for a wedding gift.  The photo had two men getting married in it, so I question the employees reasoning for not allowing the enlargement.  Throughout the years, I've complained to management.  But management does not care and never wants to hear it.  They will not back their prices.  One time, they had a display of socks marked at one price and at the register I was charged another.  When I noted it to the manager, she just rudely ripped off the pricing sign, charged us the higher cost, and seemed more upset about me having some perceived audacity of complaining.  The list of my complaints goes on and on and on.  This place definitely needs new managers and definitely better help in the photography area.
