I then called back and spoke with Chad again and told him that he had me hold for 30 minutes before I was hung up on and he then transferred me to his manager who really only said what Chad told me previously and that he will give me a call back Monday to confirm that my account had been marked same as cash.\nYou would think that since I\u2019ve paid my bill on time and that most of balance has been paid their customer service would be better. However their customer service is terrible. I\u2019ve should have known better because when the account was set up initially I never received any information as far as account information and how to make payments through mail like I was told I would. I had to contact them only to find out that the account was never set up so I really could have gotten this item for free but since my integrity is solid I did what I agreed to do and took initiative to make sure the account was paid.\nFrom the start until now my experience with Tower Loan has been piss poor and I caution all who are considering using them. If I were you I\u2019d try a different bank with better customer service.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a03f5b5a29:0x3f192adc961cda60"}

The pell city location is awful. The assistant manager is horrifically rude. I called about THREE overdraft fees coming out of my account for ONE thing that overdrafted overnight before I got a chance to deposit cash. I called to find out why it took 3 out, totaling over $100. As soon as I said I had a question her response was \u201cwell I don\u2019t understand what you want me to do I can see the same things as you can\u201d. She continued to tell me my banking app was incorrect and I did not have money in my account and multiple pending transactions that \u201cI could see\u201d I have NEVER had issues seeing pending transactions or even with the money not coming out of my bank immediately for a \u201cpending\u201d transaction. She then told me the only accurate way to monitor how much money I have is to keep an \u201cold fashioned check book\u201d. I asked her again why I got charged THREE overdraft fees and she went through my account telling me all of the charges that still wouldn\u2019t have led to me having three overdraft charges. She put me on hold 3 times in the middle of me talking and concluded the conversation by telling me she could only take one off, which I still haven\u2019t seen the money back in my account, and that I would have to wait until her branch manager got back on Monday to resolve the issue and see if he could do anything for me at all, and that she would tell him I was \u201cso distraught over the situation\u201d in a super condescending tone. Absolutely disgraceful to handle business in this way in the middle of a pandemic where so many people are financially stretched. I wasn\u2019t even fighting the first $36 charge, but the other two were absurd. Would not recommend this location, and it\u2019s seriously making me reconsider banking with regions all together if this is how business will be conducted.

I typically do not leave reviews, but the woman who assisted me, Roxie Kitchen, was phenomenal and deserves the recognition! She not only helped me update my address and request me a new card, but she also assisted me with setting up a savings account, and gave me several options to help me build up my credit score, since I am looking to purchase my (first) own vehicle by the end of the year and I currently have no credit.\n\nWe had some complications, but despite it all she kept a positive attitude and was very helpful, informative and sweet; it was just like talking to a friend.

So the last few payments have been by check (which is fine)  I never experienced the type of rudeness I received like I did the other day from a teller. I've been cashing the checks through my wells Fargo account mostly and others I have cashed inside the bank I received the check from, to see if I want another account with another bank. (Walking in regions) waited 10 mins to even see a teller due to them being busy(3 customers 2 tellers) yeah that was sarcasm.  When it was finally my turn I told the cashier I need to cash this check. She responded ok I need your LICENSE  to which I provided while I signed the back of the check. Of forgot to mention this is a $25.oo check. She asked if I had an account with regions I responded no mam. She said you are aware their is a service fee on checks if you do not have an account with regions. I said no I didn't know that, that's weird. I said how much, she replied 2 dollars (not much it seems but when you struggle to make ends meet that $2 means a lot) she said yes it's just our policy \" EVERYONE GETS CHARGED THE FEE IF YOU ARE NOT AN ACCOUNT HOLDER\" I said ok, my bank doesn't do that. When I write a check to someone they cash without having an account with my bank it bc that's their hard earned money. She responded \"well the only way I cannot charge you is if the check HOLDER gives permission to WAIVE the fee. So naturally I was pissed off. I said how is it you can say that it's a mandatory fee and EVERONE GETS CHARGED THAT FEE IF NOT AN ACCOUNT HOLDER, but if the check HOLDER called and said it's ok to WAIVE the fee. That literally makes no sense! She replied in a smart tone \"well why don't you just deposit it to your wells account. I said I'm almost out of gas and just figured I could cash it here being less than a mile from my house. I said fine just cash it I'm on my way to work. I will be visiting the branch manager of regional manager tomorrow to see exactly why they say it's mandatory but it can be waived? I'm in customer service I know what it's like dealing with the public but that was uncalled for rudeness. I will recommend everyone close their account bc my friend did the day I told her what happened she said she had no idea they did this when she paid ppl by check and was outraged. So that's 1 account being closed. 1 may not matter much to this bank but I have only told her so far so next is other friends who msg me about their accounts with them.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a1cd156ff2b79:0x80751851e8f42a1"}

First time experience at this location. There were several cars in drive thru so I thought it would be quicker to go in (I only had one deposit to make). Parking lot was full but got lucky with one space. Walked in and three people sitting in chairs right inside door, all employees busy with customers, two empty computers with no employees. I really didn't  know what to do when I walked in. I asked the customers sitting if they were waiting for a teller and they said yes so I noted who was in front of me and stood and waited. One customer got frustrated and left so now two in front of me. Two more came in and walked ahead of us and I kindly said that we were waiting for a teller, too. They were nice, one left and the other sat down and waited. The two in front of me were there because they had wrongful credits to their account so they would be a while, too. They all said that the wait was common at this location. I stood there for 20 minutes before I finally got waited on.  The teller was nice and started to chat with me ( I was in a hurry, on my lunch and frustrated) and there was was still one person behind me. I told him that I was in a hurry and had already waited 20 minutes to please just deposit my check.  He then tried to tell me that I could have used the machine outside and or gone through the drive thru (he was still very nice). I was not. I told him I thought it would be quicker to come inside that I had never waited this long with just 2 people ahead of me.  He said that he thought it was normal to wait at all banks.  He stayed professional but I know I made him mad at the end because his smile went away. It wasn't his fault. Evidently they have a new policy that you can go to any teller for anything, opening an account, lost card, wrongful credits to your account, all of which take a long time so if you want to cash a check or make a simple deposit then don't go inside. I did hear that the drive thru is pretty quick even with a line.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891905b4538569:0x937788d83e75f0f0"}

Again I called and was told again someone would be to get it. I waited almost 3 weeks before calling again, at this time I was told they had to talk with someone to see if they wanted the vehicle. When I called back two weeks later, because I was told someone would call me back, I was told they didnt want the car. I proceeded to  get said vehicle off my property  when I was told I had to get a WRITTEN letter stating they didnt want the car before I could proceed with getting car off my property.  My husband went to the office and they REFUSED to give him any documentation.  They did call the other party but was told again they needed WRITTEN documentation before PROCEEDING AGAIN THEY REFUSED..IM VERY FRUSTRATED AND AM VERY CONCERNED THAT THEY WERENT WILLING TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND TO SATISFY A CUSTOMER.
