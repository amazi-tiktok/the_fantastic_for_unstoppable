The staff members are noticeably racist toward white inmates, able to be bribed with money, & under qualified, poorly trained, unprofessional officers of the law. It is now one of the top 5 most violent prisons in AL, & several deaths, stabbings, & sexual assaults occur all the time.

I have been trying to see if she had received the money yet. I called the facility on multiple occasions and have talked to my mom's lawyer to see if everything was ok with my mother. Today 22Jun2017 I received three calls two from a private number and a cell phone number. Didn't get to answer I was at work. The cell phone that called texted me and the text said inorder to send money to your mother I would have to go thru western union and gave me a inmate number which was not my mother's. I called the number back and a lady answered and was telling me the only way I could get money to my mom would be western union which I know is not true. I told her the inmate number was not my mom's and she said her friend gave her the information. I told her there is some shady stuff going on and hung up. I called the prison and told the representative that answered the phone about the shady encounter. The representative put me on hold and after like 15 minutes I got tried of waiting and hung up. Then I called back several times and nobody answered at the facility. Finally I received a call from someone from the facility that allowed my mom to call from there account. And was told by my mom that she hadn't received the money and that is why her cell mate let her call from her account. So I went back to were I sent the money gram and they verified the transaction was held and now since it was being verified they would release it to the account. I called the facility back several times and nobody still answered. Finally about five hours later somebody from the facility answered and I asked them if I could verify my mom received the funds he told me that everybody that could help was gone and call back tomorrow. The point is I'm getting a bad feeling about the integrity of the staff here. Nobody seems to care about somebody trying to scam me into sending them money and how they got my mom's information. Pretty disgusted and will not stop until I get some answers from somebody that is competent.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8886873dd10e3a39:0x1ff039e0cb5d7543"}
