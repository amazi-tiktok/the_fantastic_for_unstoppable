At that time I had no time to spend on thinking about meal planning and no money to go out to eat (and not willing to eat ramen), so I decided to take a gamble on a 10lb bag of blue grits instead.\n\nSince then, McEwen & Sons grains have been a fairly large staple of my diet.\nAt this point, I am mostly gluten free, and not even by conscious decision. The way corn or oatmeal fills up your stomach feels entirely different from the way bread or pasta does - and never have I felt physically ill or lethargic from making and eating a little too much (many?) grits.\n\nFor a month or two, I found a local supermarket that offered grits in bulk and thought I'd switch, but despite my attempts to add spices and such they didn't taste like much of anything (they weren't organic and definitely hadn't been refrigerated).\nMaking cornbread using the recipe on the bag was also wonderful! And very easy to make and pack, though is always best straight out of the oven or with soup.\n\nFor anyone trying to eat healthy on a budget - or really anyone who enjoys tasting food at all - I very much recommend McEwen & Sons.\n\nThey offer free ground shipping on all orders over $75, which I try to take advantage of, as it's usually around $25 of shipping that I can now spend on provisions instead.\n\nAdditionally any orders over $40 include a free gift!\nOnce it was yellow cornmeal, which got me hooked on that. This most recent order included blue cornmeal, which I haven't tried yet but am very much looking forward to making blue cornbread with).\n\nCurrent favorite recipe:\n1.In a cast iron pan, cover some garlic and shallots with oil/butter/lard and roast in your oven until crispy.\n2. Add some grits or cornmeal to boiling water\n3. cook on low, stirring until thick.\n4. Add chipotle, garlic and shallots, hatch green chile, some buttermilk, coriander, spinach etc.\n5. Enjoy\n\nA very long review, but I'm spending Christmas morning alone this year and thought I should give something to somebody this morning.\n\nSo long and thanks for all the grits,\n\nAKK", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888945c1a71211f3:0xd5b626ceee42051b"}

My husband and I have been taking advantage of  the early hours for seniors for some time.  I was unable to go today due to my health.  My son drove from our town at 6:30 in the morning for early shopping with my husband. When they arrived there was no set up at the side of the building as there had been previously.  They did not  understand where to go since this was the first time my son had taken my husband. We had not ordered previous  to this since we  did not know. We had another pickup at WalMart the next hour and they did not have the time to go in and shop plus it would have been hard for my husband to do so. My son is taking my husband for the WalMart pick up and will bring my husband home and turn around and go back to Dothan to shop for us at the time he can go in.  That is 30 minutes each directions or a total of 2 hours driving to get our needs. Extra time, extra gas. extra money which doesn't make sense to me.
