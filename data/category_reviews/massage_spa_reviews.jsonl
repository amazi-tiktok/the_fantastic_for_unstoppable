Was a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews but thought would give it a try.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised.  I called.to make a appt for a other day as it was late.  They said they had a table open so I went on in.  The place is in a small strip mall but most of them here in Huntsville are.  Once you get inside looks like most small massage places.  I have included a few pictures from their website as they are accurate of what you actually see.\n\nThe lady was very nice and very professional.  She gave me a very relaxing massage.  I would have like a little more work on my neck but I did say anything as I wanted to just see what was their normal.  Only other improvement I can think of is she did not do the front of my legs at all.  Since I do alot of lifting and crawling around that is always a sore spot.  But over all I left feeling very relaxed.\n\nI did opt for the shower table as some recommended to get the oil off.  Again very professional and make sure \"everything\" that needed to be covered stayed covered.  Thought it might be awkward but the way she did it made it feel very professional so really did not even think about it.\n\nThe only real negative I can say is the same as of other peoples reviews.  They leave the door slightly open so anyone walking by can see in.  I understand from a security view but the walls are paper thin (like most every other place you get a massage) so you can hear everything so I do not really see that the pros outway the cons for doing this.  I could not really relax and although I really like this place it was the reason for 4 stars vs 5 stars.  It also would be the one thing that made me look somewhere else \u2639.\n\nAlso one note since it came up in some of the other reviews.  No one pressured or even asked me for a tip.  I did give her one as she did a good job but she never asked.  The only thing they asked was if I would like a 4 hand massage (I only booked a 60 min) and when I said not tonight that was that.\n\nOver all a great place and so far I recommend it for a great relaxing massage if you dont mind everyone that walks by your door seeing in \ud83e\uddd0.\n\nWill update if I go back.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOA1FbHtCamDoFPPdQMGkYztFVFx2ThZNK83lYB=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzJSml9LE8V6WWeNTZyOMMsnBursNL_BGv5fqt=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNHV4HZpfhPDmPBQ9S1sMAcpQGLrFHWfO65-f7=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1590289416354, "text": "Hello, Terrell.

They didn\u2019t seem too welcoming and stared at us speaking in their language after telling them which service we wanted.\n\nBefore receiving my service, I was asked to pay in advance and for a tip in advance. I kindly told the lady I will pay in advance but will tip her after the service. The lady swiped my card and said \u201c$42\u201d. The service was supposed to be $40. So I just figured it was taxes until my friend told me hers was the flat amount it was said to be on their price sheet.\n\nMy friend on the other hand, who is Caucasian (I am African American), was told by the same lady, she could pay AFTER the service. I\u2019m assuming she thought I didn\u2019t hear because I was already getting situated in my room for the massage.\n\nAfter the service, I gave her a $5 tip. My friend also gave a $5 tip.\n\nThe ladies that worked at this place started talking to each other in their language. I could tell they were not pleased with my tip. Then, to my surprise, another lady approached me and asked if I can give a $10 tip instead, repeatedly saying that the massage was a really good massage. The service was ok but at the time I figured maybe they just really need the extra money, so I allowed them to take off $10 total in tip.\n\nAfter speaking with my friend about the situation and after she confirmed she didn\u2019t have to pay until after, they didn\u2019t charge her an extra $2 or ask her for an extra $5 tip, I decided to write this review. After some thought, it seems like racial profiling to me. I could be wrong but they should have the same policy set in stone for anyone who walks through their doors.

I've been a client for several years and I have been extremely pleased with my services and the owner Mike, he is very sensitive to your massage needs and he will make sure someone will get you in one of his 3 different massage parlor's in Birmingham. Mike is very knowledgeable in massage therapy and with a pandemic going on with the cornavirus, I was very hesitant in going to get a massage but Mike reassured me and answered all my worries, the therapist take their own temperature and shows you their temperature,  they also take the clients temperature, hand washing, rooms and tables are sanitized along with mask being worn by both the therapist and the client. The Tao location is very clean with a comfortable atmosphere, they are all very professional. I can't say enough about Simon, he is one of the best massage therapist I've ever came in contact with,  he's very professional, covers your entire body head to toe, applies the right amount of pressure and will adjust according to your preference, he's very knowledgeable about the anatomy of the muscles and will apply the amount of pressure and hits all the pressure point's, their prices can't be beaten, I always get a 3 hour deep tissue massage and I'm never disappointed, the money is worth every penny. I work in the medical field and have herniated discs with sciatica, I'm always on my feet and Simon knows every spot to hit, his hands are magical and it de-stresses me.I recommend any of Mike's parlor' s if you get a chance to go ask for Simon he is awesome and you couldn't ask for anyone better than Simon. Mike has a great business, I don't think I've ever had to make an appointment they say come on in and they will get you seen by a therapist, Mike will always do his best to accommodate you and your schedule. 5 star service!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888917ae03e50bcd:0x5719a7c375d783e0"}

{"user_id": "103804845592874345668", "name": "Tera Shade", "time": 1393167773078, "rating": 5.0, "text": "In response to the \"1 star\" review written 3 years ago.  I responded 2 days after it posted but it never showed up, so I'll try again with my response...When this review was first posted the person included her name (it has since been changed to \"anonymous\").  I called the reviewer and inquired about her time spent at Bliss.  You see, I am the owner and very concerned about our reputation and our guests experience.  I believe the following information will help you decided if you want to take this reviewer seriously.   Let me begin by saying this reviewer called late in the day to make an appointment to have her hair cut.  Even though we were booked until closing time, one of my stylist agreed to stay late and take the appointment.  The two employees behind the desk greeted this reviewer, offered her something to drink, and informed the stylist of her arrival.  Because it was now after closing time, the two front desk employees left for the day.  This reviewer was not left alone or ignored at any time.  The stylist who volunteered to stay late, finished with the client she was with and was on time for this reviewers scheduled appointment.  This reviewer had her hair shampooed, had more of a trim than a cut, and blown out.  She was charged $15.  Her comment about being charged three times what she should have been charged... Well, I don't know where a woman can get her hair shampooed, cut/trimmed, and blown out for $5.  She did say she was new to the area, so maybe she could get the above service done for $5 where ever she moved from...Just to be clear, Bliss does not offer shampoos, haircuts, and styles for $5....  I noticed she did not mention the amount she was charged.   Could it have been she as embarrassed to admit that she thought $15 was \"three times more than what it should have been.\" Because this reviewer posted this review under her name and because we had her phone number on file, I called and inquired about her time at Bliss.  I stated I was the owner and was making follow up calls with our new clients.  I did not  mention I had read her review but instead asked how she enjoyed her visit with us.  I gave her every opportunity to relate any unpleasant experience she might have had.  I was told that Bliss is a beautiful place and was thanked for taking her appointment on such short notice and after hours.  When asked how she like her hair cut even thought it really was only a trim, she responded \"I like it, she did a good job.\" During our conversation, she never said anything negative about her visit at Bliss, and when I invited her to return in the future she said she would.  To be honest, she has not returned .  I wish she had given us another chance so that she could experience what Bliss is really about.  I would also like to respond to the comment about the service being done half-hearted and with no conversation.  The stylist's mother had just passed away very unexpectedly two weeks earlier.  She was still mourning her loss but trying to live as normal as possible and continue to work and support herself.  While this reviewer had no clue what was happening in our stylist personal life, I think because of the comment she made in her review for all to read, its important for you to know why our stylist was not her usual outgoing friendly self.   I am very interested in making each client feel welcome and appreciated.  I personally follow up with as many clients as possible to make sure that their time at Bliss was relaxing and that they are satisfied with their service.  I know this has been a lot to read, but I wanted to give a little more information about the above review.  I am sure I am not the only business owner that is willing to go above and beyond what is normal to make their guest happy.  If something is not what you are expecting, please let us know.  Give us the opportunity to \"fix\" it.  Our guest are the reason we even have a business and we understand that, without \"you\" we wouldn't be here.  We look forward to seeing you and making you feel \"special\" like the person you are!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d61a6391ccb:0x7321ebb76dd3fc84"}

I had an appointment this evening at 5pm, but woke up experiencing illness so wanted to reschedule my appointment, especially in light of the Covid-19 climate we are still in. I called their office first thing (8am) and explained my illness to Debra and informed her I would like to reschedule. She gave me several run-arounds concerning why even though I was sick I could not reschedule. Even so much as stating the owners are the reason why if a patron feels ill they still have to be serviced. She then said half of my Massage Envy points banked for today\u2019s service would be expensed because of the same day reschedule. I asked what concessions are made for feverish patrons. She said they are still required to show up and Massage Envy would take their temperature. I told her I would be going to the doctor\u2019s office today and could provide an excuse. She said a manager would get back with me today, but no one ever contacted me. After having my suspicions proven that I had been lied to and no one would contact me, I called back to ask about what was the current status of my appointment/points. I was then informed the appointment was taken off the records and all of my points for today\u2019s session had been expensed. I am extremely frustrated with their \u201ccustomer care\u201d. I feel lied to and with their \u201cCovid protocols\u201d that were exhibited today first-hand to me, I will NEVER feel comfortable patronizing them again. There is no telling how many patrons who have been ill (with or without fevers) have received service and unintentionally spread it to others with the help of this location\u2019s policies. So much for this place being a standard of wellness services. I feel more stressed now after dealing with this than I did before.

There was a fan on me the entire time... For one hour, I was covered in oil (and naked with only a sheet covering me) with a fan on me in the middle of winter! I was almost shivering. The bed warmer was either not on or not working.... Bummer. Also, the light in the room was on the whole time... I like it dark and relaxing. Rooms need to be vacuumed.\ud83d\ude1e\n\n2. My MT was clearly sick with something respiratory going on. Being that close and breathing over me sick was a major deterrent on a return visit. Not sure if he kept stopping the massage to wipe his nose or what but I've never had so many pauses in a massage. \ud83d\ude37I'm used to smooth continuous pressure/ touch during a massage except for when its time to turn. Also, no hot towels this time!!!\ud83d\ude29\n\n3. I feel like this particular chain is on the downhill... The past few times I've gone, you can never get the same therapist twice. It appears there is a lot of turnover here. It is noisy in the hallway out side of the room. I made sure to use all of my gift card so my friends and family can start giving me new gift cards to use somewhere new.\ud83d\ude10\n\n4. The receptionist stated she was going to look up my gift card towards the balance. I had two cards to use. She couldn't get them at first.

After the desk staff not being trained well enough to handle the request, or just not wanting to, I have asked repeatedly to speak with the manager to no avail and have been transferred to his voicemail, again to no avail.  He will not call me back and he is never in or so they say.  Massage Envy advertises transferring a credit to another member's account (for a fee).  They have charged the fee and have yet to transfer the credit to my sister's membership at another location out of town. Twice now they have set up a guest account for her in Hoover, even after a detailed phone call on May 9, 2016 with a front desk staff to try and rectify this situation because when my sister asked her location if it had transferred and they let her know they had set up a guest account for a half hour in Hoover.  After no help from the Hoover location I called my sister's location out of town and they walked me through how simple the process is to transfer and they themselves cannot understand why I am having issues.  At that point I decided to ask for the manager and I still cannot get any help.  At what point does this surpass bad customer service and become deceptive business practices or fraud because I have paid for a service that they offer but am not getting it?", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1468338485623, "text": "Thank you for taking the time to inform us about this situation.
