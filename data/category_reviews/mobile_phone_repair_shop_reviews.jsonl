But\u2014 I had gotten my phone screen \u201cfixed\u201d at a rival store (the one in the mall), and they failed to install my screen correctly.... twice. And left my battery loose in the phone so that it was not glued down as it originally was to the inside. They also failed to glue in and screw in my new screen properly. I walked into this other store with a lose screw clanging around in the phone. So. I came here, to the Cell Phone Doctor to have it PROPERLY fixed, based on reviews I had seen. I made a great choice. He immediately told me what they had done wrong, fixed the battery issue with no extra charge, and was nothing but kind and fast at his work. A real expert. I had no issues, he was very respectful and easy to deal with, and a few weeks out I\u2019ve had no issues! So I suppose it\u2019s good that I\u2019m late to reviewing, as I can see that it is still holding up perfectly!

And left my battery loose in the phone so that it was not glued down as it originally was to the inside. They also failed to glue in and screw in my new screen properly. I walked into this other store with a lose screw clanging around in the phone. So. I came here, to the Cell Phone Doctor to have it PROPERLY fixed, based on reviews I had seen. I made a great choice. He immediately told me what they had done wrong, fixed the battery issue with no extra charge, and was nothing but kind and fast at his work. A real expert. I had no issues, he was very respectful and easy to deal with, and a few weeks out I\u2019ve had no issues!

He immediately told me what they had done wrong, fixed the battery issue with no extra charge, and was nothing but kind and fast at his work. A real expert.

The cool part is that they protect the screen so that it doesn't break again with a cover that is not likely to break. This location is the exception. I just wanted to buy the screen over the phone and have it shipped so that I could travel only once to the store. This store is a bit of a journey for me.  They would not under any circumstance take a credit card over the phone and do this for the customer that is in Cellairis' customer data base. I am so visible on the internet. It makes me wonder if perhaps they had an employee who took customer information and used it for something nefarious. The idea that they could not take payment over the phone is odd in this day and age. I simply found them to be adversarial and not interested in one more customer. Every other Cellairis I have ever been to was completely amazing. If this is the worse thing that happens to me I will be just fine.

Also, their selection of cases is massive and full of variety. Call them about estimates and such.\n\n3 hours ago, the phone I am typing this on wouldn't turn on and the screen was cracked badly after a very bad day. By the time I got off work, it was 7:45, and all other phone repair shops in town were closed. It's Veterans Day weekend which means a lot of places are closed for the next day or two. Thank god Cellairis was open. I called and asked for an estimate before going and asked about a student discount and screen protector. Shyna gave me an incredible deal for calling that made this struggling college student feel sooooooo much better. And when there was confusion between what Shyna told me on the phone and what I was told in one store (since there are two locations in the mall, Shyna's deal was honored!! One of the things they test for after fixing a phone wasn't met when I came to pick up my phone, and Shyna worked on my phone well past their closing hours and tested it until it met their standards. Rachel stayed to help out as well and make sure everything went well and I was satisfied. They both were very kind, and they both were so very helpful! They also talked to me like a normal person and explained what they were doing when I asked, and they were very friendly. It's been a while since I have had service that nice! Thank you both so much!\n\nBrenna", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da3023c6d63:0x2ba54fb5ac2c2dd9"}

Also, their selection of cases is massive and full of variety. Call them about estimates and such.\n\n3 hours ago, the phone I am typing this on wouldn't turn on and the screen was cracked badly after a very bad day. By the time I got off work, it was 7:45, and all other phone repair shops in town were closed. It's Veterans Day weekend which means a lot of places are closed for the next day or two. Thank god Cellairis was open. I called and asked for an estimate before going and asked about a student discount and screen protector. Shyna gave me an incredible deal for calling that made this struggling college student feel sooooooo much better. And when there was confusion between what Shyna told me on the phone and what I was told in one store (since there are two locations in the mall, Shyna's deal was honored!! One of the things they test for after fixing a phone wasn't met when I came to pick up my phone, and Shyna worked on my phone well past their closing hours and tested it until it met their standards. Rachel stayed to help out as well and make sure everything went well and I was satisfied. They both were very kind, and they both were so very helpful! They also talked to me like a normal person and explained what they were doing when I asked, and they were very friendly. It's been a while since I have had service that nice! Thank you both so much!\n\nBrenna", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da3023c6d63:0x2ba54fb5ac2c2dd9"}

Found this place and decided to give it a try. They had to order my screen and we paid in advance. Asked about insurance, which we don't have on my phone because I've never broken any of my phones. The guy at the counter kept commenting on how expensive it was going to be.... okay, so?... I want my phone fixed and your business does this right...?\n\nWe paid and were told it would take 3 to 5 days for the screen to come in; they would call me and I could come in and have the phone's screen replaced in an hour or so. 10 days pass and no one calls me. My husband calls them and they say the screen is in and I can come in and get it replaced. They then try to call me, but I was unavailable. The next day, he drops the phone off as soon as they open at 10am, and was informed that the only one who could fix it wasn't there yet. He would be there in 45mins and it would take 2hrs to fix the screen. 2 hrs....\n\nMy husband decided to go to the gym, then come home and clean up. He called them at 2pm and my phone was still being worked on: they said give him more time. He arrived there after 3:30pm and the phone was not finished being repaired. Decided to pick up dinner next door. Still not done. So finally, around 4pm it is finished. It works and has a lifetime warranty for the pressure sensitivity. This was one thing I was concerned about: the screen's pressure sensitivity.\n\nI get my phone and inspect it. It was not even sealed properly! Therefore, it is not waterproof anymore, and not resellable. Annoyed, I go to the shop myself and the tech who worked on my phone is very apologetic, admits it was done incorrectly, but is unable to help me. He said he was busy and trying to hurry because my husband had been waiting for a while. Still has a lot of things to work on; I could leave it overnight, come by tomorrow. Maybe it would get done. I can't leave my phone there overnight, and I can't come back the next day. He was going to try and put weight on the phone before taking the screen off and resealing it.\n\nThat is what I'm trying to do now: put weight on it. I wrapped it in screen cleaning cloths and set a gallon water jug on it. About 7 or 8 lbs. I asked him how much weight, but he never answered me, telling me instead about the warranty. The warranty is for the screen's pressure sensitivity.\n\nI'd rather have it take a long time and done correctly, than rushed and crappy. Now, I'm trying to correctly their mistake. I don't think pressing it down with weight will help. It is misaligned somewhere, and not glued and seal properly.\n\nPaid $340 to have my phone's screen replaced and they didn't do it properly. The back part is spongy; you press down and it comes back up. The whole left side was not placed correctly or glued down properly. Would never go here again. And would urge everyone to not waste their time until the people at CPR have better organization and attention to detail. They also seem like they need more knowledgeable people. My husband was told this tech had never worked on a Samsung Note 8 and that one of them only works on computers and laptops; no phones at all.

I was advised instead to purchase a wireless charger elsewhere and a battery from them since mine was weak. I did buy the battery from them and they came from the back with a battery that had no seal or package and sold it to me for $40 and took my old battery, which it would not charge past 20% until I bought a new battery from another location indicating they sold me a used battery as new. What they didn't inform me was that my phone was not wireless charging capable. I went back to try and get a refund but I was never given a receipt and they said they can't do anything about it since they have no records of them selling it to me. Not only am I now stuck with a used battery that was sold as a new but was given false information. I took my business to another phone repair shop that was capable of performing my repair at $65 compared to their quoted $200 and my screen never had to be shattered. I advise not conducting any business with this store if you need anything because you may end up with used parts and misleading information.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1503527530248, "text": "Hi Kyle, I wish you would have contacted us directly regarding this. We would have been happy to explain why this is the way that it is.\n\nThe repair shop that you brought your device to has the capability of micro soldering a new charging port to the existing cable. We do not have that capability which means that we must remove the entire flex cable to change the port. The problem with that is the navigation buttons that are on the phone are sealed under the screen and wrap around to the charge port. Meaning for us to get those out we must lift the screen after heating it substantially. It\u2019s very risky and leads to cracked LCDs in most cases.\n\nWe NEVER want to take advantage of anyone. We set expectations for everything. We would rather you know the entire truth before going with our service.\n\nNow, to the battery. We buy batteries in bulk which do not come in \u201cretail\u201d packaging. We would have gladly given you a full refund on that item if it was not working up to our standards.\n\nAs you can see from most of our reviews, we go above and beyond for our customers. A $40 battery would not be worth losing a customer over.\n\nI will still gladly refund the $40 if you come in and ask for Jessie.\n\nAs I appreciate the feedback I believe a 1 star review isn\u2019t warranted in this case. We just lack the capabilities in making that specific repair cheaper.\n\nThe reality is the explanation you were given is 100% accurate because we would need to replace the screen as well which cost well over $100 just to get it to our shop.\n\nI am happy that you were able to get it fixed elsewhere and for cheaper. We cannot speak to other repair shops capabilities, only our own.\n\nThanks for your consideration and please come see us for your refund.\n\nJessie"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d7349200629:0xa1f9cde73259baf4"}

Cristy says she won't be there because it's Halloween but I can drop off my phone and pick it up if I want to come in.  Although I had plans for Halloween,  I cancel so I can get my phone  fixed.  It took longer than expected but was repaired and by looking at the reviews, I am lucky my phone  is working properly.  I was told I would receive a free screen protector but when I picked up my phone was told they didn't have any in stock.  Overall it was not a positive experience and I am pretty sure I paid a lot more than I should have.

A disheveled employee approached me--he was polite--I'll give him that\n3. I asked about a new screen for my iPhone 6S+\n4. He said, \"Wow, those are so new and hard to get. The screen alone will cost $299.00!\"\n4a.--The above is NOT true--the screen even at the most expensive offering is $180.\n4b.--It is NOT hard to get\n4c.--If you go to a true Apple store (i.e. Summit Birmingham)--they will replace your screen while you wait for $149.00. CPR with their prices could literally take your phone to B-ham and have lunch and still earn over $200 per phone (when you include labor). Wouldn't be surprised if that is what they do. The guy that waited on me knew the price at the Apple Store when I mentioned it. That is pure speculation on my part; but, this CPR place is a mess and totally unprofessional.\n\nMy advice--take a trip to the Apple Store (get an appointment first) and the folks there will make your phone like new for $149. The money you'll save will more than pay for the trip and you'll have enough left over to enjoy a nice lunch at all the great restaurants at \"The Summit.\"\n\nIf you MUST get your phone repaired in Montgomery--I suggest \"Total Cell Phone Repair.\" They charge parts + $55 labor--or $235. That's still expensive; but, at least they are honest on the price of the screen. CPR charges $299 JUST FOR THE SCREEN alone--Absolute \"Rip-Off\" If there labor charges are the same as most--$55.00/hour--that would be $350.00 price tag!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2aff2bb6f42d:0x58cd2a6eddd97f48"}

I have never in my life dealt with such an unprofessional group of people. Before I brought my phone to these people, every single thing on it worked perfectly. The only issue I had is that there was a scratch on the left side of the screen that irritated me. So I tried to do the right thing and support a local business (or at least a business in the area). On August 5, 2015, I prepaid $161.49 for a screen and service for an iPhone 6. I was told that I would be notified when the parts arrived.\n\nDays go by, and I don't hear from them. I had to call on the 11th and finally ask what exactly was going on. They had an excuse about how their delivery of parts was delayed. Either way, they'd have it the next day. So I'm pretty understanding, and I agree that'd be fine. I take the phone in on August 12. Again, they do not call me - I had to turn up and see whether it was done. I wait approximately 10 minutes after arriving since they were apparently still working on it. Everything looked good initially when I got it back, but I started noticing problems almost right away on the phone.\n\nThere was an absolutely immense battery drain on the phone, but more importantly than even that was the ambient light sensor not working, the backlighting at the top of the phone was WAY off, (and they should have noticed that if nothing else if they repair phones for a living) and the proximity sensor wasn't working. If you don't know what a proximity sensor is, when you hold a smartphone up to your head to talk, it shuts the screen off so it doesn't register contact with the screen. It makes it very difficult to use your phone as a phone when it isn't working. The next day, on August 13, I call them back and explain the issue. They agree to take a look at it again and see if there's something they missed. I understand that sometimes, these things happen.\n\nCan't make it there before close on August 14, but I do arrive on August 15th. Another employee looks at the phone, and says that there's just an issue with the screen at this point. They'll have to order another screen to resolve these issues. It's frustrating, but I understand, and I agree, and ask them to contact me when it is in. I waited 10 days, and heard nothing from them. Called a little late in the day on August 25th, and I was told that they got the part in either the day before or that day. So, I mean, thanks for the heads up, right? Can't make it there that day, so I take it in on August 26th.\n\nOn August 26th, I drop the phone off yet again around 12:00. The employee says they're a little backed up, but they should hopefully have it ready in about 2 1/2 hours. I told him it was fine. Close to that time later, I got a call saying the screen was on the phone, and they were going to test the other functions. Got another call later, and they told me that the screen was working fine, but that they could not get the proximity sensor to work. They claimed to have tested different parts, but they simply could not get the proximity sensor to work on the phone. I asked how we intended to resolve this issue, especially since it worked when I brought it to them.\n\nI was told that they could either place a damaged screen on the phone (not my original screen in this case, but one that was much, much more damaged) and get a refund, or that basically, I'd have to live with it. This is literally three weeks to this point, and I absolutely need that telephone. Time I don't have it almost always translates to lost productivity. So essentially, my choice was to get my phone back in worse shape than I brought it in, and get my money back, or to keep the screen and they don't fix an issue they caused. I essentially had no real choice in the matter. I am contacting my credit card company to get my money back. They are a terrible business, and your money would be better spent anywhere else.

Terrible products (their brand) Good luck getting in touch with the manager. The reviews here must be from employees.\n\nI had a screen break. They fixed it. Took an incredibly long time. I walked around for a little while and the guy who started fixing my phone was texting his fingers off until I interrupted him to ask if he was done with my phone (Of course not). After getting my phone back and insisting on an Otter Box the employee (Ferris) convinced me that the glass screen protector he had could break, BUT IT WOULD SAVE THE PHONE'S SCREEN. He even showed me where it saved the store's IPad. Having a thinner phone than with the Otter Box had its appeals, I even bought a minimal case to be extra sure. After a week of babying my phone, I made the mistake of bending over with it in my front pocket (3ish ft fall). Glass protector and the screen shattered. I was pretty pissed.\n\nWent back to the store. New girl (Magen) seemed a little overwhelmed with helping other people so I was relatively nice to her. She told me that Ferris was promoted to manage his own store (watch out).I told her the story and asked for a refund of the defective glass screen and plastic case (both failed at doing their job and cost me another screen). She refused because she didn't have the authority. I asked to speak to the manager and she called him from her cell phone and walked outside (abandoned kiosk in the eastdale mall could have been costly) left me there and came back. Nope, the manager wouldn't do anything either, and I wasn't allowed to speak to him (STORE POLICY!!!!) She cut $10 off the new glass screen and gave me the managers email address.\n\nI am only writing this after attempting to contact the manager for the past two weeks(Chris Vick) I'm normally not the kind of guy that would do this. However, this business has terrible products that promote future phone screen replacements (kind of brilliant), have terrible customer service and even worse management.\n\n$400 taught me a valuable lesson about Cellairis...If I ever break my phone again, Ill support the Arabs a few kiosks down.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2bd6bfae039f:0xfdc231c1c62d09d8"}

I had my iPhone X screen replaced with a refurbished screen, but it had some issues initially. The first replacement had scratches under the glass which I didn\u2019t notice until later. He replaced it for free since it was damaged. The second replacement I got worked for the majority of the time but randomly would get ghost touches, click instead of scrolling, and held down keys. It took me a little over a month to be sure it was a problem with the screen and not iOS glitching. Even though I wasn\u2019t able to replicate the problem, he took my word for it and gave me another replacement! Just an outstanding warranty and customer service.

The OEM original copy we work with, offers you lifetime warranty from the manufacturer.\n\nApple stores of course know the difference since they are the only ones authorized to replace the Apple original screens and they know when you fix it somewhere else, they care about it because you didn\u2019t fix it with them. As a retail store we put our stamp behind the screen to validate the manufacturer warranty and when Apple stores see our stamp they will tell you that it is not their screen.\n\nPlease come back to our shop and give us the opportunity to test your device and validate the warranty we offer you. This will not cost you anything and we will check the reason why your Face ID is not working properly, also we would like to know the location where your device was fixed and when it was fixed.\n\nWe like to share with you that our goal is not just to repair devices, it is to make sure you are satisfied with our service by doing it right and keep our customers happy because we care about all of you. Every day we try our best to satisfy our customers as we stand behind our repairs. As I mentioned before we will take care of your device and will make sure you have the OEM original led screen and as I said it already you don\u2019t have to worry about it, it is under warranty and we will do our best to make you satisfied.\n\nPlease email me for future questions or concerns at Tuscaloosawireless@gmail.com\n\nSincerely,\n\nStore manager, Abe."}, "gmap_id": "0x88860282ed6c3989:0xf70abf01cadf6e71"}

I tried the phone out when I returned and it worked fine.\n\nGreat service and great people, I will be back again if I have any problem with my phone, or computers.\n\nEverett", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88860282ed6c3989:0xf70abf01cadf6e71"}

Steven M, their technician, cannot tell the location of the screen, or even if it has been ordered (even though he supposedly placed the order). Steven doesn't seem terribly concerned about checking the status until I show up in front of him. There is no response to my texts and certainly no pro-active checking on his part. Today I decided that if they cannot even tell whether a part has been ordered or where it is, then they certainly cannot be trusted to actually perform a repair.

Told them exactly what (SPSPECIFICALLY AN INTEL PROCESSOR, expandable RAM, motherboards, lcd screen,) I had and they told me to come on. I went to probably irritating lengths to confirm that they bought these highly specific parts. In retrospect, I thought the name,odd, but after a long day didnt put the \"mac\" portion together....or I'd have asked SPECIFICALLY if they bought non-mac items. So,  I drove out from Theodore during rush hour....and they declined everything because it wasnt MAC (wed discussed what I had, mind you) and because they couldn't test board soldered parts.... He said that in refereme to RAM memory chips, a desktop cpu, and my 500gb hard drives...they only take solid state now, he said. And so on, and so on...\n\nI dunno what the game they were playing was, but I think experimac owes me a half tank of gas and an appology. Take the gas from the guy's paycheck (if you're paying guys who think UPGRADABLE RAM is soldered to the board, anyway. And processors and graphics cards for that matter) for so politely convincing me to bring it all out there after being given models and brands.  Everything I could do to maintain some class before I left. Nothing worse than going out of your way to ensure its not a fruitless trip, only to get there and find some genius has given you bad info...and then instead of owning it....lying through his teeth ever so easily with a smile on his face. Aparently my cloths from a day under my cars hood, disguised my occupation as an aerospace engineer.... and I looked like someone who believed hard drives require soldering. In the parking lot now trying to figure gasoline vs. Dive distance.\n\nRESPONSE TO BUSINESS: No, I'm passing. At this point, I believe ive done what's necessary to prevent this happening to someone else. I've made them aware. You know who screwed the pooch, you know what they did...and for that matter, the african American young man who provides the quotes (according to the Liar) knew, and yet hid in the back and let the guy I dealt with do his thing. I'm wondering if THAT is in the fact Cosmo you speak of. In which case, he didnt do anything then, so I dont believe hed do anything NOW. I dont believe your store would have poated a response at all, if not for the star by my name.\n\nYou intentionally ignored my suggestion of gas compensation, and while your words are very well put together to give the impression of being amicable....the previous young mans words were pretty enough to get me out there. Fool me once, sir....yet not twice.\n\nA whole paragraph you've written in response that says essentially... Nothing.\n\n2 weeks Later: See folks? Still no response... Just ran and hid.

I was informed that this ribbon cable tear is why the speaker and antenna were not working.  When I leave the store for the 2nd time the speaker is now working and I have several bars of service so I assume problem solved.

I return to batteries plus and they take my phone back and look at it for 30 min or so and tell me there is nothing they can do to fix it.  I tell them that this problem occurred due to the repair work they performed.  The technician tells me that they could not verify the phone was working 100% prior to them working on it so there is nothing they can do to help.  They suggested I do a software update...I do it and after the update my antenna is still messed up.  I understand they couldn\u2019t test it because it was dead and it wouldn\u2019t take a charge.  I also understand there are unhonest people out there that would take advantage of a repair shop but that is not the case here.  I had a fully functional phone that has never given me any problems just a bad charging port.

I take it out to show the guy and he presses all over it, and while he is telling me my battery is swollen and causing the screen to bend, he turns it on and my screen was split in half! I couldn't use half my screen! I work 2 blocks away and have been very careful with my phone (have had a bent-ish screen for months!) so I really don't think this happened in my pocket. I called him out on it as soon as I saw the screen and he said \"Look, you can't even use the screen now\". He proceeded to talk about other things with my phone and didn't address the problem of him breaking my screen. He priced a screen and battery for me, but I declined and walked out because he broke my screen and absolutely refused to acknowledge it. I went back to the office, called this place and asked to speak to the manager. He asked what was wrong and I told him about the staff breaking my screen. He reveals that the guy I'm speaking with on the phone is the one who \"helped\" me in the store, and said that he is the manager and owned the store. I calmly explained to him what he did and how I watched him do it right in front of my face. He REFUSED to take responsibility and tried offering a $10 discount for both screen and battery instead. I said no thanks, and to have a nice day before hanging up. I am SO upset - I ended up just buying a new phone since it was about the same cost of what he would charge for a screen and battery.

I broke the LCD screen of my Samsung Galaxy 6 and brought it in to be repaired. They asked for my phone number (I clarified that they wanted the number of the phone I was leaving with them), and told me to come back in a few hours. A few hours later, I come back and they haven't done anything yet. They said they'd have to replace the frame of my phone (because it would break when they removed it) as well but they didn't have a matching gold one in stock and needed my permission to use a white frame instead. The guy said \"we called you but couldn't get in touch\"...well yeah, you called the phone in your hand. So whatever, I come back a few hours later and it's still not done and I have to wait another half hour. I finally get it back and the frame is extended a few millimeters from the front of my phone- hard to describe but made it more difficult to press the home button and felt very fragile. A few months later, the frame is starting to peel off and I hear a crackling noise every time I press the screen. I took it to a different phone repair place back home, where I was told the first repair was incredibly sloppy. The guy there told me the first repair hadn't even glued the frame back on and it was a miracle it hadn't fallen off yet. For less than $50 (and in under an hour), he glued it on correctly and my phone looks new (aside from the mismatched front). I'm giving 2 stars because I understand things like the mismatched frame isn't their fault, and I knew it was going to be pricey, but overall it was not a good experience at all.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1573606687003, "text": "Please contact us and let us know how we can improve.

I say just give me my phone and a refund I'll take it elsewhere. I had already spent money on another phone that I brought home and doesn't work but I wasn't going to say anything about it.so then he says we can't do that ! I asked why and his answer was store policy ! It's my phone I own it ,it's my money ,I have had no service plus at the time it was 13 days far from the original 2 or 3 I was told .then he couldn't find my phone so I waited approximately 30 mins and the white guy comes out and says and you could see he was stalling.and said so what are you going to do?I said I'm waiting on my phone and my money.the Arab guy comes back hollering at the back find that phone .said I wasn't listening and I wasn't getting anything and proceeds to pull a sticker off my phone.I said I want my phone my money and leave that sticker on it .he said he didn't have to.took the sticker off and my phone to the back.at this point I was outraged,grabbed his moniter layer it over a said give me my damn phone and he called the police,police said it was a litagation issue when I talked to them and the thievery was not a 911 police matter .also if you look at the mama's of the 5 stars on this page you will find common ground in 85% of the names ! Today is day 19 one extra day from the last time I spoke with the liars at the phone clinic, I'll be returning to check in on things today with a real phone tech.and offer them one last chance to let them make it right,today ! The business is out of my way and would have never even went there had I not called ahead of time and was told the normal wait was a hour  ! I expect some kind of lie as a reply on here and I also feel I've been robbed by this business at this point !

Those are installed during manufacturing to prevent scratches and has to be removed for full functionality. Please check and make sure there isn't anything blocking the ear speaker itself, if so please remove it. If that is not the problem, please bring it by and we will take care of the problem for you. Don't worry, we will do everything in our power to make sure you are 100% satisfied with your visit.\n\nThank you very much,\nMing"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4cd6e4d39e05:0xe5df27fa39089580"}

When you called a month ago, I explained to you that the charging port that controls the charging portion of the phone is part of the motherboard and not something that can be damaged during screen repair as we transfer over the whole motherboard. If it was damaged, it would not have been able to charge at all. I recommended trying a different charger to see if it was a charger issue and if not, bring it by and we would help take a look at it for you. When I didn\u2019t hear back from you, I assumed the problem was resolved.\n\nCharging issues like that are usually caused by charger going bad, broken solder joint on the charging port (caused by accidental bend of charger while plugged in), or sometimes if the battery is going out. So I think it is very unfair to us to give us such a bad review without giving us a chance to look at it and try to resolve the issue with you. Being a small local business, reviews like that can hurt us in a big way.\n\nSo if you can please give us a chance to properly diagnose your phone and resolve this issue, I would really really appreciate it.

Drove 45 miles to their store was told it'd be $300.00 just for parts.  Found another place that fixed it for $85.00 in 45 minutes. I hate being lied to to get business.\nEdit for reply:\nMy wife called Tuesday 1/5/21 and told whoever answered the phone, after telling them my issue (power button on my Samsung Galaxy S10 plus fell off). She was told that it wouldn't be a problem and no appointment needed that it'd be $79.00. As I mentioned before I live 45 miles away, I had to leave work early to make sure I had ample time to get there and to get service.\nYes, you are correct,  there was not a record or service ticket made because the guy there looked at my phone said that I'd have to leave it and that the parts would be $300.00 because the board would have to be changed out that the button was all one unit. I value my time and money as much as everyone else and I left without your service. Yes, I do feel like the initial phone call was a bait and switch just to get someone in the store. You know that $19.99 oil change costs $500 because you need tires,wipers, injector cleaning and \"blinker fluid\". It's just strange that my wife was told one thing and I was told another. I called another shop  told them exactly what was wrong, they said same thing. No problem, no appointment needed.  Took phone, they looked at it and the fixed it for the amount quoted.\nFunny thing that one shop said one thing and the other one did it.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1610116073880, "text": "Jason, I cannot find a repair ticket or record of your name, are you sure you have the right place? If so, I would like to reach out to you to find out what happened, as we do not give bogus pricing to obtain business. Mistakes do happen and if this indeed did happen, I'd love the chance to make it right!\n\nWe have a proven track record of being transparent throughout our entire repair process and we pride ourselves on having some of the best pricing in the industry. I especially appreciate this review because it gives me a chance to explain our repair process.\n\nBefore I start, i'd like to point out one thing, there is a giant discrepancy between $80.00 and $300.00. The only phone parts that cost this much are some of the Genuine Samsung Display Assemblies. If another shop was able to resolve this for $85.00, it was a small part repair, like a charging port or proxy sensor, for example. (If parts were needed.) My point is, our prices would have been comparable.\n\nWhen a customer calls in to obtain a price on a particular repair we do our best to go over the details of the problem or issue they are experiencing. If we are confident we know the solution to the issue at hand, we then will give you a price or at least a ballpark figure, so they know what to expect. If we are unsure what the solution is to the issue, we will ask you to bring the device in to be diagnosed, before giving you a price on the repair.\n\nThe Process.\n\n1. Once you come into our office, we go over the details of the issue you are experiencing with your device. We will then go over repair solutions or inform you that it will need further diagnostics to obtain the solution to the issue.\n\n2. We then obtain all your contact information and create you a ticket. We may at this time give you a price on the repair. Below are a couple normal situations.\n\n*Lets go over a couple examples, an iPhone 8, the screen is damaged, everything else on the device is working as intended (we verify this,) we give you a price on the display assembly replacement and an ETA for expected completion.\n\n*Now, lets say its a Gaming Computer, it is randomly turning off or blue screening. We will not know what the issue is without diagnosing all the hardware. In this situation, we will inform you that we will need to perform additional diagnostics to know what it will take to repair this device.\n\n3. Once we have obtained the device, we then will start the diagnostics or repair in the order that it came in. We have other repairs in front of new repairs. Your device will go into the queue and will be worked on when its ticket is next. There are two exceptions to this. Most phone screen repairs, if we have the parts on hand (which we do for all iPhones and some Samsungs,) are completed in an hour or less. (Time will vary depending on the particular repair.) The other exception is, we offer a rush service, this service is paid at the time of when you drop off the device. This is paid to have the device worked on immediately, otherwise tickets are worked on in the order they are received.\n\n4. Once the repair or diagnosis is completed, we then will email, text, and/or call you, to go over any final or further details.\n\n5. Pick up your device and pay for the repairs. Once a repair is completed you can come by and pick up your device at your convenience. We also offer payment options, you can pay in person with cash or card, or you can pay your invoice through our online portal.\n\n**One quick notes, due to COVID-19, we are not allowing our customers to wait on repairs in the lobby. They must either drop them off, wait in the their car, or outside of the building.\n\nJason, thank you for allowing us to go over this process with you and potential customers that may be reading this. Feel free to reach out to me, Clint Silver, owner at ProTek. I would love to know what happened and would love the opportunity to make it right. Thank you and as always, thanks for choosing ProTek!"}, "gmap_id": "0x886268c27f02ac7b:0xf37cf7fc81bd790a"}

I debated leaving this review because I know how harmful bad reviews can be to a small business. Unfortunately, my experience with ProTek was so disappointing I felt obligated to share.\nWhen replacing my screen ProTek compromised the integrity of my water resistant IPhone XS causing it to be hyper sensitive to moisture. This resulted in my phone being corroded by light water exposure only 3days after the iPhone repair. ProTek then refused to refund me the 200$ for the faulty screen replacement which essentially destroyed my 1000$ phone. Let me be clear that my IPhone had been exposed to water on previous occasions to the screen replacement with no issues. ProTek even assured me that there was no water damage prior to the screen replacement. I had expected to have a better experience with ProTek because I had confidence in their customer reviews. Sadly, I have to say I was dissatisfied with their services. At the very least I hope others will take my experience with ProTek into consideration and proceed with caution in regards to ProTek\u2019s remarkable ineptitude with apple products.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1589823914117, "text": "I am very disappointed by this review, i'll explain why. Unfortunately for phones, we are in the warmer months and people like to be on the water and when you're on the water, these type of things will happen. I want to start off by saying that we repair and/or recover data from thousands of water damage devices. When you first brought the iPhone in for a screen replacement it was because you left the iPhone in the rain and it ruined the screen. (We informed the customer that the screen was the only thing damaged by the rain.) We replaced the screen and put a new screen seal on it, (as we do with all repairs.) The phone then came back with standing water inside the device, this amount of water is concurrent with other phones we see that have been submerged into water. The customer asked for a warranty on the screen, unfortunately we cannot warranty water or physical damage. (Simply putting a new screen on this iPhone would not resolve the issue, given the current condition.) In a case like this, with standing water inside the device, we would need to let the water dry (we have tools to speed this process up.) After the water has dried, it will leave corrosion behind, which will need to be cleaned. We would then remove the logic board from the iPhone housing, clean it with our Sonic Cleaner, and then test the device for further component damage. We then would replace the components needed to repair the device. More than likely we could have saved this customers phone, had the customer let us complete the water damage assessment on this device.\n\nPlease remember that iPhone's are not water proof, they are water resistant, and each iPhone has its own water resistance rating. We have seen water damage happen in pretty much every way, from being in your pocket and sweating, to being on the bathroom counter while taking a shower, and to drops in the ocean. Each iPhone handles each exposure differently, because in each exposure, the conditions are different. If you are going to be around water, buy a water proof bag, put your phone into the bag and use it from the outside the bag, only to remove it if you need to make a phone call. This will drastically minimize the chance of water damage. I hope this reply has answered any questions as to how we handle water damaged phones here at ProTek. If you have any questions, concerns, or just want some friendly advice, feel free to contact us at your convenience!"}, "gmap_id": "0x886268c27f02ac7b:0xf37cf7fc81bd790a"}

I refuse to walk in this store for business and will take my devices else where as long as she's working and if the Tech guy isn't there.

Also very hard to take someone serious working on my devices with a big piece of metal sticking out of their lip.\n\nNow as for the ACTUAL TECHS, I've had nothing but great customer service, devices done an ready when they are said to be ready. And always courteous and professional. Very helpful when it comes to explaining what's wrong with the devices. For someone who has done several reviews for several stores on their performances and what they can do to fix it to welcome more business, The manager needs to get some Professional act right, this is a Booming business all over the country not many people can handle this kind of work and all it takes is ONE person to make it to be a bad place of business.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1462910907186, "text": "Hello Kayla I\u2019m sorry to hear about your bad experience.

In particular, the manager at this location.\n\nI work for a phone carrier in the same mall and I had a customer approach my stand, asking if the \u201cApple Airpods\u201d you just sold her were really a legit Apple product. From a few feet away, they looked legit, but upon further inspection, they were definitely a counterfeit. I sell plenty of Apple products out of my store on a daily basis and have for 5+ years. I can tell just by the fit/finish, packaging, font, etc that these are definitely not a real Apple product, or even a refurbished unit.\n\nFrom what your customer told me, you reassured her that they were a legitimate product, and refused to offer her a refund, only store credit until she threatened to get mall management and the police involved.\n\nShame on you for preying on elderly and unknowing customers trying to get Christmas gifts for their families. She told me she spent the last $90 of her fixed income to get these for her daughter as a late Christmas gift.\n\nYou are selling items under false pretenses and not disclosing the authenticity of the products. Makes me wonder how many other people you have ripped off with this same scam. This is some shady business practices and unfortunately it can tarnish the customer\u2019s trust in cellular/mobile vendors and repair companies alike.\n\nPictured is the \u201cApple AirPods\u201d you sold her and the last picture is a stock image of the legitimate product from Google from a trusted device review source.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889292125aff38e7:0x6260c591fe0e3f11"}

A week or so passed and they called and said the part was in. I took my tablet in for repair they said they may not get to it that day because they were busy... understandable. Well I came back late the next day and they said they still haven't got to it and they would leave a note to do it first thing the next day. Well the next afternoon I called and they still didn't have it ready. So a few more days passed and they called and said they had broken the screen and had to order a whole new screen. Told us we had to wait for the tech to get paid because he had to pay for the new replacement parts. It took more than 1 month to get the new parts and for them to finally call us and say it's ready. We get to the store and ask to pick up the tablet and it is in horrible condition the back panel wasn't even put back on properly and had spots where it was raised up enough I could see the internals on the tablet. We refused to take it that time because it was not repaired. We also learned the the money we origanally paid them to fix it was refunded to the tech who had broken the tablet. The employee/tech refused to try to repair the tablet saying \"I'm not going to try to press that together and break that tablet.\" She was referring the the back panel I mentioned was raised up in places. We told her to contact the manager and she pulled out her cell phone called the manager and said \"These people are refusing to take the tablet and I'm so mad I'm about to just walk out\" the manager told her to tell us she would take a look at it tomorrow. A few days passed they called again and said it was ready so we went to get it and it was better condition but still it is very scuffed up on the trim all the way around the screen and the back is still slightly raised up in a few places. We took it anyway out of pure frustration with the employees and the manager. This place is a joke DO NOT take anything here to be fixed or you will regret it.

She tore the conductive ribbon strip from the home button that lets it depress and click the dome switch underneath. She claimed that it was not her fault did not offer any kind of apology and told me it was unfixable.

If I could give less than 1 star, I would.  We took an iPad 3 to iFix on December 20th to have a broken screen replaced.  We called later that evening and went to pick it up after they said it was complete.  We tested the iPad while at the store in front of Tyler, an iFix employee, and the power button wouldn't work, the magnetic closure to put the iPad to sleep wouldn't work, and you couldn't lock/unlock the iPad.  They also scratched the body of the iPad around the edges when they replaced the screen.  Tyler made a note of the issues and agreed we could bring the iPad back for repair after the Christmas holiday.  While we had it, the screen detached from the iPad body.\n\nWe took it back to iFix on or about January 9th.  We had to swipe (erase all content) off the iPad for them to repair it, so we had to buy a new one to replace this one in the interim.  We have received NO communication from anyone with iFix since that time unless we've called for a status.  We have called numerous times to speak with the manager, David and Tyler the original employee dealing with us on this.  Each time it's the same story...they're working on it and since that time, David is no longer with them.  I emailed all of the contacts on the Corporate iFix website and never received a response.  The employee we were dealing with, Tyler, can't tell us anything and he said the district manager was now handling our case.\n\nAmber Wells, the District Manager with iFix, and they would not agree to refund the $196.19 we paid for the screen replacement and she said they can't repair it.  I filed a Better Business Bureau complaint in March and iFix never responded to it.  The leasing manager, Rhonda Clark, at Wiregrass Commons Mall has attempted to get this resolved with the owner but has not been successful.  Apparently there are other customers who have complained to the mall management because iFix won't stand behind their work, lack of work, or whatever you wish to call their shoddy attempt at service.\n\nAt the very minimum, they should have refunded what I paid for the repair.  Unfortunately now, I have no confidence that the iPad will ever work the same even if someone else replaces the screen.  PLEASE don't make the mistake of taking any devices to this store.\n\nAs of September 24, 2014 they STILL have my iPad.  Nearly 9 months later and nothing from them...no attempt at resolution at all.  iFixandrepair has yet to contact me.  Apparently they have no interest in resolving the issue.  I'm taking them to small claims court to try to get this resolved.  Again, I would NOT recommend them for repairs of any sort based on my personal experience and the lack of concern of their staff.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1462910926173, "text": "Hello Donna I\u2019m sorry to hear about your bad experience.
