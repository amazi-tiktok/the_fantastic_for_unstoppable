Since posting this review, I've had a few lengthy conversations with a couple of the \"head\" personnel  at St Martin's. We have come to a mutual agreement and I am satisfied with the outcome. I am NOT removing or changing anything in my initial review, so one must proceed with care and make sure EVERYTHING is explained to you in its entirety.   ORIGINAL REVIEW: This is a LONG read, if I could rate with less than 1 star, I would, but this NEEDS to be shared!!! NEVER USE ST MARTIN'S FOR IN HOME CARE!!!!!!! I recently had to have major back surgery, and as I have no local family, I opted to use St Martin's \"in home care\".  I have NEVER used this type of service EVER, and I must say I was COMPLETELY taken advantage of and the service was HORRENDOUS . Because, I had never used this service,  I had hoped that they would understand my needs and assist me in setting this up. Oh they SET ME UP all right.  TWENTY FOUR HOUR SERVICE, even while I was in the hospital for TWO weeks.  The hospital did not let them do ANYTHING. (Hospital policy), so ALL they could do was SIT there, maybe assist in putting on those \"stupid hospital socks\" , cover me when I got chilled and uncover me when I warmed up. I had NO idea that I could PICK AND CHOOSE when I needed them. I was left with the impression that once I started their service, that I was STUCK with them until I was released by the surgeon.\nI KNEW that I would need help once I returned home, but NOT 3- 8 hour shifts. I was in the hospital almost 2 weeks and during that time the program manager was to set up my in home care. I informed her that I did NOT want a parade of different faces coming into my home. TWO WEEKS, she had to get a \"team\" put together. THIS DID NOT HAPPEN!!! When I returned home; A DIFFERENT person almost every day AND some shifts not even covered. How could I heal, if I had to STRESS every day about my care?? This is MY home, I was not capable of moving around, so I couldn't very well see what was happening around my home. The 11pm till 7 am shift was the WORST! I did NOT require anyone to WATCH me while I slept, so I PAID A LOT OF MONEY for these sitters to SLEEP, WATCH TV, AND TALK/PLAY ON THEIR CELL PHONES while I slept.\nI know that the sitters were supposed to be bonded/insured, BUT how did I know things weren't moving out of my house. YES, I have trust issues with strangers, but that is NOT the point. The POINT IS... The \"Care At Home\" program is NOT SET UP CORRECTLY, THE PROGRAM MANAGER IS OBVIOUSLY NOT WELL TRAINED IN HER DUTIES,( I heard that she hasn't been doing this long)  AND I, THE CLIENT,  feel TOTALLY abused and \"taken for a MONEY ride\".\nI could rant on & on, but I AM DONE!! I truly hope that this review opens up some eyes at St Martin's AND future clients.  <1 star!! HORRIBLE! NO EXCUSE!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888910f661fbbe1b:0x44d09ccda56ec317"}

SECOND, I nor anyone in my family has a vested (personal or business) interest in Lakeview Estates. Now for the review:\nOur mother was at Lakeview Estates on (2) different occasions. The first time was for approximately 6 months while completing rehab following (successful) cancer treatments. The facility, management and staff were excellent and it was an pleasant experience. Our mother's second \"stay\" at Lakeview was a couple of years later and this \"stay\" was for approximately 2 years. Initially, we were \"less than impressed\" with Lakeview and stated our opinions in the \"end of the year\" survey...I am sure that I was not the only one that was not happy with the facility! Approximately 6-8 weeks after the survey, a new manager was hired (Callie Simmons) and IMMEDIATELY things begin to change. First, it was the facility became cleaner, painting, new carpeting, new furniture in the lobby, etc...However, the most significant improvements were that the residents and the staff were NOTICEABLE happier (my wife told me that when the residents and the staff are smiling that this is the sign of a well managed ASL). Eventually our mother passed away; however, the staff and management at Lakeview were nothing short of WONDERFUL (in every since of the word). The staff CONSISTENTLY went \"above & beyond\" What they were required to do in the daily care of our mother. The director (Callie) was frequently in communication with us...consultations, discussions regarding the future \"care\" plans, and phone calls when problems (potential or otherwise) arose. A couple of months after our mother passed away, I went to see Callie and told her that we would like to purchase a gift for the staff and told Callie \"if it helps the residents; that is wonderful; however, we want to let the staff know of our appreciation for the manner in which they (the staff) cared for our mother.\" After thinking over this for several weeks, Callie back to let me know what the staff needed and we immediately purchased the item(s) and had these shipped to Lakeview Estates. Several times over the past couple of years, I have been asked (by my peers) \"what was our opinion of Lakeview Estates\" and I tell them (what is in this review) and then add \"as long as Callie Simmons is the director of Lakeview Estates; it will continue to be a well ran ASL that cares for its. patients.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888922b2f2f96b31:0x5179ee53183df8e9"}

He needed more care than this one provided. This facility is more for seniors who are able to prepare their own meals and don't need as much support. The facility doesn't provide 3 meals per day and does not have an RN for every shift. IMO, if the senior is in reasonably good health and just needs an occasional \"look in\", then it could be fine. I felt as the seniors needed more help with daily living activities then that's when the facility really makes their money. I will be honest and say these are my opinions and everyone knows what that means. The 2 bedroom apartment was nice esthetically,  the staff seemed nice. It just wasn't a fit for my parent.

My mom called me one day around 730pm and stated she had been calling for someone to come change her diaper since 3:30pm.\n2. My mom suffers from CHF and needs a low sodium diet. Whatever she would chose from her REGULAR menu to eat, the kitchen would send her whatever they wanted her to have. Usually something processed and high in salt. Now my mother retains fluid very badly.\n3. After seeing other areas of neglect, I researched better facilities and put in to transfer my mother. I put the request in, in person on a Thursday morning. I came back Friday afternoon and it had not been send. I checked on it Monday evening it was finally sent. Then there was the transportation issue, the family pays, WHAT no one told me. Well Magnolia social services didn\u2019t help me, nor did they offer guidance or contact numbers. So I called the transfer NEW facility and admissions said \u201cwe will take care of this for you and we will get you the lowest price possible, we will try to make this transition smooth\u201d. About 15 Min later I was set with transportation.\n4. They are always short staff, once my mother had a very bad case of heart burn. She pushed her button for help, a hour later mom called me and I called the nurses  desk. The supervisor came, took her BP, said she will be back with some tums. An hour later Mom pushed the button. No one came. She called me, I called the desk, the new shift nurse said the supervisor WENT HOME! So I got dress and went to the store and drove from the South side to Gardendale to take mom some heartburn meds.\n\nWhen you enter Magnolia Ridge the smell of OLD urine and bowels will meet you at the door and it lingers in the hallways.

They can very easily rectify matters, but so far they refuse to do so. It has to do with the beauty salon.\nIf you\u2019re loved one wishes to get their hair done they may make use of the in-house salon. There is a form that the person responsible to pay the salon charges fills out. You may leave a credit card on file and you may opt to just have your card used whenever the resident wishes or be asked if you\u2019re in agreement with your family member having their hair done before being charged. This is so that a family member who is losing their mental acuity doesn\u2019t decide to go get their hair done too often, which was our situation, and we stipulated on the form that we\u2019d like to be contacted first.\nHowever, our card was charged several times with no permission request beforehand. To the tune of approximately $500.00. With our busy life we didn\u2019t catch these charges as they were incurred. Once we did see them, we called and got them stopped.  To their credit, The Blake admitted they were in the wrong. However, it has been over a year of requesting the fraudulent charges be reversed or having a check sent to us. We\u2019ve been in touch with the beauty salon, patient representatives, the facility manager and a regional manager. We\u2019ve allowed each person along the way ample time to make it right, sometimes two months before we call again, but no resolution is ever forthcoming. Now, they\u2019ve stopped taking our calls.\nWe will now pursue this with our credit card company.\nOur family member passed away in May of 2020, so they are no longer a resident. I would hate to think that is the reason we now are not even getting our phone calls answered.\nIf you\u2019re wondering why our family member passed away, it was due to the virus. We were told she was the only one in the whole facility to contract it. A subsequent email from The Blake that was emailed to families of the residents claimed to have zero cases of the virus at The Blake.\nI suppose no place can be 100% above board at all times, but these things concern us.\nPlease don\u2019t misunderstand us. We realize the virus is strange and can effect some and not others. We have no ill feelings in that regard. These things happen.

My mother was a Memory Care resident for 2 months 25 days before removing her from this facility.  Once home she was examined by our physician along with labs received from the Blake.  She had lost approximately 20 lbs, was poorly nourished (per lab work), had a large pressure ulcer on hip (never reported by staff), cellulitis in lower extremity (never reported by staff or wasn\u2019t being treated).  She walked in on admission and was wheelchair bound upon leaving. As I said that is the SHORT LIST of issues we had with this facility.  Don\u2019t be fooled by the\n\u201cnice facility or friendly staff\u201d.  My mother was neglected physically and medically.  I am not just a disgruntled daughter. I worked in critical care for years, served as nurse manager of a critical care unit and a cardiology outpatient clinic.  I know poor care when I see it!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1601312298132, "text": "Hi D,\nWe apologize that you\u2019ve had a negative experience with our community.

If he became angry, and he might have, it was because he was scared!  However, 2 hours later when the ambulance did arrive, he was asleep in his chair.  He is now in the hospital with pneumonia.  These residents are not safe! Oh! ...and I had left him a gift bag with a variety of items the first day.
