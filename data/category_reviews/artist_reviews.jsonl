The only time I have ever used anyone else is when she took a short break to finish college.\nThe very first piercings Sarah did for me were my nipples. I was very nervous because I had always been told how painful male nipple piercings, but Sarah made me feel calm and relaxed by assuring me that it was worse in my head, the piercings were a little painful but nothing like I thought it would be. She did such an amazing job, so I've recommended her to everyone. She is always very professional, nice, gentle, and most important quick with a needle.\nSince then, Sarah has also pierced my industrial, several other cartilage piercings, 6 Frenums, and my lobes using 6 gauge tunnels. The most recent piercings she did were both of my daiths for migraine relief; the first time in 7 years I have been migraine free for 3 months!!!\nEvery piercing she has ever done on me has healed perfectly and I have made sure to follow her aftercare instructions to the letter.\nHowever while she was on break I went to 2 different shops nearby for piercings, one with a female piercer and one with a mail piercer/tattoo artist. I had a standard cartilage piercing done by the female piercer. She (along with staff at that shop) was very rude, charged almost double the price, offered no aftercare, insisted on using a ring instead of the bar like I was accustomed to, and told me they were using titanium jewelry.\nI used the same aftercare that I've always used but the constant movement of the ring caused my ear to become so infected that I lost 2 completely healed piercings in that ear also. Later I found out that the jewelry they used was not titanium at all (not even titanium coated), it wasn't even nickel and lead tested surgical steel! When I went to the male piercer/tattoo artist's shop the place so sketchy and he was such a jerk that I left immediately.\nI WILL NEVER LET ANYONE BUT SARAH PIERCE ME AGAIN.

I went back to show them the tattoo and the first thing that was asked was \u201cdid you get it here\u201d .... KNOWING that they had JUST seen me.!! Then I was directed to another artist there who DID NOT do my tattoos and wasn\u2019t even there the day i had got them and he clearly knew that something wasn\u2019t right because he asked \u201cwhat have you put on it.?!?\u201d And I replied \u201caquaphor\u201d because that\u2019s what they recommended and that\u2019s also what I used for my other previous tattoos. And then he tried to get smart saying how long he\u2019s been in \u201cthe chair\u201d and they couldn\u2019t do anything until it \u201chealed\u201d But the thing is when this heals they wouldn\u2019t be able to put ink on the spots that are MISSING SKIN and they KNOW IT. I was extremely polite until they tried to pass it off like they didn\u2019t see my skin and the colored FLESH that was showing because the artist dug wayyy too deep. I was even okay with the artist not making the tattoo the color i wanted because he claimed he \u201ccouldn\u2019t see well\u201d that night so i went with a whole nother tattoo look than i was going for.& I thought it still turned out nicely until things took a turn for the worst.  I know how tattoos are supposed to heal because I have them and have went to MULTIPLE ARTISTS so It\u2019s not me being \u201cpicky\u201d or rude . I at least wanted them to be more concerned but I couldn\u2019t get an apology, an offer to make things right, or even my money back. But I have contacted my lawyer and I will have to make the necessary steps.!! Like I said the man who did the tatt was  NICE as ever but he dug too deep and it left permanent damage on both tats and it could\u2019ve went differently had they at least acknowledged what was wrong. Truly sad the way things were handled/not handled.!! No one wants to have messed up skin especially in a place where it\u2019s visible to people. I trusted them with my skin and the art but got done horribly.. this is why I believe with some places you need to just pay half or pay after the work is done and even if you pay before hand, if something goes wrong because of THEM and you go to them in a polite manner even though this is your body so you have a reason to be alarm and HEATED ....then they should at least do everything in their power to make it right and pay you back and try to fix it. But like I said there\u2019s no fixing this and they knew it that\u2019s why I had to take legal action. Not trying to bash their business or anything because my first initial thought was \u201cthey\u2019re pretty nice people and it\u2019s a cool space\u201d when i first walked in to set the appointment but as far as my experience and things .... I definitely won\u2019t be going there again and the way they handled my situation.. I highly wouldn\u2019t recommend and that\u2019s just me.!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1593571746452, "text": "Looked through all paperwork\u2019s was not ever tattooed at my shop..."}, "gmap_id": "0x888bb172c55c3801:0x63d2bf04b66beb89"}
