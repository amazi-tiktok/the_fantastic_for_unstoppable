I couldn't bare it so I walked in the hallway crying out to my husband.

I originally was seeing one doctor who told me my baby had a 50% chance of having spinia bifida or some other defect I was also mailed the wrong lab results. Not only that she called and corrected herself and said she was looking at someone else\u2019s results and my baby was fine. I switched over to another doctor at women\u2019s healthcare and today I was made to feel super uncomfortable. They sat outside the room and questioned my motherhood and why I came in/ called so much with blood pressure concerns. I also was told to get undressed because I explained I was having pressure but upon hearing someone say I don\u2019t want to go In there I put my clothes back on a refused. I\u2019ve been having pressure and light bleeding since Sunday and it\u2019s sad I don\u2019t feel comfortable enough to call my doctor or see my doctor. I really hope people learn to show compassion because there is already so many mean people in the world.

There are 3 waiting rooms each almost completely out of sight of the reception desk area.\nI arrived with my older children for my appt to take a pregnancy test. I had been informed over the phone that this was required before I could make my first prenatal appt. I hadn't experienced this with my previous pregnancies but everywhere is different.\nThe reason I was given for this requirement as a lot of women in the past have either lied about/ misread at-home pregnancy test results.\nI arrived before my scheduled appt time, checked in, paid the $11 fee to take required lab test, informed that the practice was completely paperless so I wouldn't be given a checkout slip, asked to come back to the reception area to check out, and told to wait in waiting room 3 until the lab called me to take the pregnancy test.\nI was seated in the waiting room 10 minutes before my appt time. I had one of the first lab appt times available so there were only a couple people in the waiting room. The waiting room is almost directly across to the open ares of the lab. The lab had several nurses/techs waiting around for more patients to arrive. I noticed that everyone who had arrived after me were being called immediately back to the lab. I waited 35 minutes after my scheduled appt time before I went to the front desk to figure out what was happening. When I asked one of the front desk if it was normal for new patients to wait this long just to take a pregnancy test. She was surprised and said the lab must have forgotten I was there. She called back to the lab and told me to go back to the waiting room. I could hear the lab nurse/tech say \"Oh, oops. Yeah, we'll get her in.\"\nI waited another 10 minutes before I was called to back. The nurse/tech asked how my day was going. I told her I was a bit frustrated with waiting so long. She told me that it wasn't the lab's fault as the front desk didn't actually check me in for my appt. The lab had no idea I was even waiting. She said it was also really my fault for not trying to figure out the problem sooner. After using the cup I had been handed, I returned to the lab area to find the nurse/tech. I waited in the lab area for 5 minutes before she returned. 60 mins after my appt time, I was informed that I was pregnant and the at-home test was correct. Everywhere is different and the practice had never seen me before so I kind of understand(given their past history) that I had to prove to them I wasn't lying. She wrote on a piece of paper my last cycle date and calculated due date. She told me to give the test results aka the paper she had just written on to the front desk to check out. So clearly, they aren't completely paperless. When I asked her where the test results actually were on this piece of paper she was confused and said \"that the actual lab results didn't matter as I would be using their prenatal care anyway.\"\nI went to the reception area to check out  and asked if I could get a copy of the paper aka the \"test results\" for myself. I was informed that would be against Federal Law for them to give me any of my test results. Then was told I would need to pay them upfront over double the amount of money I had been told over the phone. When I explained what I had been told by their insurance lady, I was told I was wrong. I asked them to call her which they did after complaining. Long story short, I had the correct info.\nWhen I told them I would be going to another doctor practice. They were confused why I didn't want to continue to use them. They called records so I could get a copy of my test results. I was then informed I couldn't get a copy until it was put in the computer system and signed a general released(I did) and there wasn't a timeframe when they would mail me a copy.\nThis practice was the most unprofessional, rude, disorganized, misinformed practice I have ever gone too.

I came across Dr. Conrad and all the great reviews so made an appointment to be established. He had a good bedside manner and listen to all my concerns. I knew eventually I was going to need a hysterectomy and read that he was one of the best. March 2021 I went to see him and discuss surgery. We both agreed it was time. My hysterectomy was April 13th and procedure went well. Post op I kept having cramps and very uncomfortable sitting up straight, was told at 4 week checkup that it would take time. 9 weeks post still had problems so made an appointment. I was told it was NOT normal and they did an ultrasound to make sure I had not developed cysts on my ovaries (that was all that I kept). No cysts but the vaginal ultrasound was painful and I've had plenty in my life to know they don't hurt, just uncomfortable. Dr. Conrad then expressed concern about the pain during the ultrasound and recommended I get some lab work and a CT scan. July 6th I go to hospital and get the scan with IV contrast. I get a call a few days later from a nurse saying that my tests were normal. When I proceed to ask medical questions I'm asked if I had a followup appointment scheduled. Of course not, I was told to get these tests done then we would go from there. She then tells me she can get me scheduled to followup and ask questions.. yeah so I have to pay more money! I've already spent several thousands last few months. I can understand a nurse calling you about normal bloodwork but this is we ALSO a CT scan. When I messaged on patient portal and asked for Dr. Conrad to call me and if this cramping was just something that may eventually go away with time.. the same nurse responded that I could give it 2 to 4 more weeks and if still having problems to call them. Ridiculous! I thought highly of Dr. Conrad until now. Even a followup call would have been nice. I guess I'll be on another search for a new Doctor.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88621331e705d1e9:0x8379b1c9c7d55128"}

Although we always arrive 15 minutes early we always wait over an hour past our appointment time to be seen.

We pride ourselves on offering the very best care possible to each of our patients.  There are a number of things which can cause delays like what you've experienced.  First of all, our doctors really make every effort to be there to deliver their patient's babies and babies obviously don't always schedule what time they arrive.  Many practices will leave deliveries to an on-call physician, but we have found that most patients want \"their doctor\" to be there for the delivery since they've been seeing the physician for 9 months.  Our doctors do everything they can to be with the patient all the way through delivery which is not typical for many practices.  As a result of offering this level of care, there may be times when wait times are a little longer, but rest assured, our doctors will make every effort to be there for your wife when she delivers.  They do everything they can to make sure it's a familiar face in the delivery room when it's that time.  Additionally, our schedule has been additionally challenging because of the constant changes in elective surgery practices our physicians have had to adjust to (due to COVID-19).  Normally, each of our physicians have a set day that they do surgeries, but both of the hospitals have had various different policies on surgeries lately and it's caused our physicians to sometimes have to do surgeries before they start seeing patients and many times these surgeries are scheduled last minute due to the constantly changing policies of the hospitals.  While this is not ideal, we don't have much control of this and are having to do surgeries when we can right now.  This, unfortunately, has caused several delays as well! If you're ever at our practice and your wait time is unacceptable, please know that our nurse practitioner or another one of our physicians will be more than happy to see you.  We try to mention that availability to our patients, but feel free to ask one of the receptionists or nurses if your are interested in this option.  Also, in the last month or so, we've had a number of staff shortages that we've had to work through.  While this is not an excuse, it's just something we've been trying our hardest to work through.  We're excited that help is on the way though, because we're hiring 5 new employees that will start on January 4th.  All 5 of these new employees have between 10 and 25+ years of ObGyn experience and should help our office move much more smoothly!  Finally, some of our physicians are busier than others since some of them have been practicing in the area for a longer period of time.  If your wife is interested in seeing another one of our physicians that is newer to the area and not as busy, please let a staff member know and we'll do our best to accommodate you request.  Again, we sincerely apologize about your experience so far and please feel free to reach out to us directly if we can be of any assistance to you or your wife."}, "gmap_id": "0x88621331e705d1e9:0x8379b1c9c7d55128"}

Said specifically we would find out risk levels AND the gender of the baby. Said normal wait time was 5 to 7 day. I said yes, so he takes me to their lab area to get my blood drawn. During this same appointment he said I had a cyst that I should get scanned again in two weeks. When we hit the 11 day mark of not hearing about the blood results, we called to find out why. After a day of back and forth we hear back they never took the correct blood. They only took the blood for the normal blood work, not the genetic screening. Strike one.\nThey apologize and say that they will get me in right away to get it taken. Since I had an appointment in 4 days (to check on the cyst) I said I would just wait until then to get the blood drawn.\nI go in for my appointment that was supposed to scan for the cyst. Literally no mention what so ever about cyst. They only take my blood for the genetic screening. Strike two. Again, talk to the doctor and he says again, he should have the results back in 5 to 7 days.\n14 days after the blood draw we call because we still have not heard anything. They call back saying that I am low risk, which is good, but they did not have the gender results. When we asked why, we were told that they did not request them. What. The. Hell. Also, if they had the results, why did they not call us????? Why did we have to call them to find out? Strike three!\nThe doctor specifically told us on both occasions that we would be able to find out the gender of our baby.\nAnd now, because it is after hours, I can't even leave a voicemail! Their voicemail system sucks during business hours to begin with.\nI have zero understanding how this practice is so well rated.

However, plain and simple, we dropped the ball in several areas in several areas of your care and have tried to make sure something like that never happens again.

This is because we are required to have 24/7 phone coverage in the event of a medical emergency that would require one of our physicians to immediately respond.  As a result, when we receive calls after hours, they are routed to this answering service instead of our office which would allow the ability to leave a message.  Our normal phone system does allow you to leave messages, but when we're not here, that is not an option and we are required to forward to an outside call service.

Get a call back from Advanced OBGYN saying they do not have them and that I will have to call the hospital and gave me a some numbers to call. I don't know of a doctors office that doesn't keep their patients records from surgery but maybe that's just them. But I called the hospital once again and same thing, they did not have anything. Called Advanced OBGYN back again and left a message for them to get back with me and to confirm with Conrad that he did indeed take pictures. The girl calls back and says she \"thinks\" its protocol to take images during a surgery. She then goes on to tell me that they can't call and get my records... They can't get records for THEIR patient from a surgery that THEIR doctor preformed? Any medical personal will tell that's a load of trash. When I said okay I guess i'll just have to cut my losses I was told to have a good day. I then decided that that was ridiculous and her lack of concern after being told another doctor I am seeing needs these to review, is pathetic. As medical professionals it should've been handled completely different. If a patient is having an issue obtaining their records that the office is claiming to have done,  why would they not call to help?

At the same time, we keep detailed records on all our patients as well in accordance with the laws and regulations.  Sometimes the hospital will have certain records related to surgeries or procedures that we don't have on our systems but can access.  About 2 months ago, Huntsville Hospital converted over to a totally new system and we don't have any access to it at all like we did with the old system.  As a result, while we used to be able to quickly access this type of information, their hospital system has had numerous issues with the new software that has created a nightmare for our practice, other practices, and patients going through their facilities.

I then called pathgroup like the office said to, and they were rude to be as well. They told me they don't choose the charges and to talk to the office. So it was a circle of no answers with rude employees. Needless to say I won't be back.\nTo add I always pay my bills, I would like to know what I'm paying for though.

I noticed a pattern that a lot of reviewers complained of the wait time and I will say that I did have a couple appointments where I waited a little longer to be seen. It really wasn\u2019t that long so it was barely worth mentioning but I figured I would since it seems to be an issue with other patients. But knowing what I know now I understand why. Dr. Voss is amazing. I came in for my pregnancy and ended up being high risk. She explained everything in great detail and what the plan would be for my pregnancy. She even addressed why there may be a longer wait time sometimes, which I didn\u2019t even bring up, but I thought it was nice that she did. It shows that she\u2019s aware of patient concerns and doing what she can about it. They see patients for regular appointments but also unscheduled appointments if there is an issue that isn\u2019t severe enough for the ER but still needs to be addressed quickly. This was me on a couple of occasions. I called in the morning on 3 separate occasions and was seen within a couple of hours due to complications with my pregnancy. So I really appreciate being seen so quickly and will take waiting a little bit longer for scheduled appointments because of it. The entire staff is very friendly and attentive. When things got serious with my pregnancy Dr.Voss was on top of it and I couldn\u2019t have asked for better care. Things could have gone a lot worse for a lot of reasons but her quick action due to her vast knowledge made sure that the outcome was best case scenario. She followed up with me a couple of times after everything to make sure I was doing okay and I really felt like she took her time. She spent a considerable amount of time talking with me about everything, which is not always the case with some doctors. Very often I feel rushed when I am seeing a physician so in the situation I was in it was nice to feel like I had her ear and care. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to come back to Dr. Voss for future pregnancies or any other needs.

As for my Aesetician - we work together as a team we will always work together as a team as that has always created the most beautiful outcomes for our patients.\nDoctors who rush through bruising injections do not create the elaborate beautiful outcomes that I have with Christy - who has achieved the status of master aesthetician- and who spends time understanding the contours and the nuances of need and translating them to me as we work as a team.  This is precise injecting work that I am trained and certified to do - as well as an artistic level of teamwork that I don\u2019t think anyone else achieves especially around this region and therefore anyone who criticizes us has no understanding of what we really do and possibly intends us harm  and ill wishes - which is a very sad (and abysmally low) method of demanding a refund.\n\nWe adhere to the strictest guidelines in hygienic standards and we have some of the most creative combinations of med spa packages that are unlike any around as we are not just any MedSpa but we are gynecologic med spa and we have everything female just for you and more ;)\n\nPlease take some of the negative comments below as encouragement for us to get better especially with our waiting room time -we run into obstetrical emergencies and take immaculate care of our patients and apologize in advance for waiting room misfortunes. We are constantly taking these as constructive criticism for us to get better as negative as they may seem.\n\nHowever I do take exception to one very negative comment below as you will see I believe this person has reflected more of her own self explanatory emotional disabilities than anyone else\u2019s.

After reading all the horrible reviews online,I was a little hesitant about keeping my appointment but,decided to proceed and give it a chance. Upon arriving walking in at 11:00am my appt. was at 11:15am, I was a little confused by all the dermatology products and was unsure I was in the correct building until I asked the receptionist who was very polite and helpful. After filling paperwork out for a new patient visit,I was asked to urinate in a specimen cup. I went to the bathroom,sat my cup in the lab window however,I noticed about 6 other cups full of urine with patients names labeled on them as I also work in the medical field,I thought this was VERY dirty and also a HIPPA violation,I proceeded anyways. I was called to the back fairly quickly,there was only one other patient waiting. I was sat down for the nurse to get vitals,then told to sit at the chairs near the lab until I was called. I waited there about 30mins. The nurse then took me to the exam room, as I sat there for at least another hour maybe a little more. I became anxious but,tried to be patient. Dr.Voss walked in,she was very polite however,I felt as soon as she come in and I gave her my reason for seeing her she was showing me all these brochures about weight loss and dermatology products. I weigh 100lbs.,I was not interested in any of this but, listened. She spent about 20mins or so in the room with me she explained everything in great depth and reassured me questions that I worried about were nothing to be concerned about. I then got dressed,went to check out,which was 2:00pm. I had a good experience other than the urine in the bathroom and the long wait time. It wasn't a horrible experience but,I suggest they change some things. I also was concerned that my last period was in February and it is now June,no pregnancy test was done nor was could you pregnant asked, that is a major concern for me even though I knew the answer they didn't seem to ask.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88928d90d74cf4a3:0xc1fb9798454c799a"}

I immediately switched to Dr. Heim whom when he saw the size of my son could not believe that I had him vaginally.

Why would I pay money to be gaslit by a \"medical professional\"\n\nNever got the results from my PAP.\n\nI had an IUD for a little over four years, the last year it had been causing me severe, sharp pains. I asked for it to be removed because of the pain. The nurse said it was impossible for the IUD to cause me pain so it must be something else. But I could have my IUD removed since it was almost at five years. She made it very clear that they would not remove my IUD if it wasn't close to being due for removal. When they removed my IUD they got angry that I refused another. The pain went away when the IUD was taken out. At a followup appointment I said I was no longer dealing with pain since the IUD was removed, and I was told that it was impossible for an IUD to cause pain, so I must have imagined the pain. So if I had been in my first year of the IUD they would have refused to remove it, and let me suffer. Also, I was never able to get my PAP results. I wouldn't be surprised if they lost it.\nSo no thanks, I like to spend my money on a doctor who takes their patients seriously and provides medical care when needed.\nThe Huntsville womens health clinic is much more organized and professional.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88621356be61bab5:0x46f1c07002ab5863"}

Additionally, her billing staff are disorganized, unprofessional, and I had charges on my account for services I did not yet receive.

I think they are a great place if all you want is an annual, but not for delivering children. I just recently transferred to another doctor and will not be returning. Also, they do not know how to work with HRAs (health reimbursable accounts) if that is important to you. I don't mean this as a slight, but I think they work with mostly Medicaid customers so I felt they did not understand how to work with BCBS insurance. The receptionist even suggested that I should apply for Medicaid if I am eligible to avoid paying my deductible.

For I had lost two prior because of an incompetent cervix. My third pregnancy, which resulted in a live birth, still did not give me enough Hope to see a positive pregnancy test a good thing. I did not rush to a physician because the pregnancy had already shown I was losing this baby too. My sister had Dr. Jacqueline Sylvester as her prenatal physician and recommended her. I scheduled the appointment and long behold my body was rejecting this pregnancy as well. Dr. Sylvester scheduled surgery for the next morning. The surgery was for a cervical cerclage to close the premature dilated cervix. The surgery went perfect, I only missed a day of work. The dreading days leading to the infamous 16 week mark was lighten by her elated spirit at my appointments. Walking in the exam room saying, \"We are making it.\" Every week and every appointment she walked in with the same energy saying the same thing, \"We are making it.\" Dr. Sylvester was not there when I lost my first two. But just that sentence and that energy made me feel less alone this last pregnancy. She made me feel like I had her support and it comforted me. Although I still hadn't come to terms that this baby would make it she made me feel for twenty minutes the baby had a chance. I carried what is now my last child for 37 weeks. I had never made to what you call a full term birth. I had a beautiful healthy 6lb 14oz baby girl. Because Dr. Sylvester did not give up on me even after seeing how my body had given up on itself. The joy of having her deliver my miracle was the best ending a troubled mother could ask for. Dr. Sylvester was able to be with me full circle on the biggest miracle I've seen GOD do so far. I knew GOD had introduced to me Hope with my third. But my Faith grew with the help of Dr. Sylvester with my fourth. Thank you for being my doctor and thank you for reminding me how far Faith the size of a mustard seed will go.

I was extremely uncomfortable during the examination and was literally screaming for the nurse to stop and the only thing she kept telling me was to \"relax\". If a patient orders you to stop that means STOP. Secondly, it took almost a month for me to get the \"results back from the pap smear, and they only called me back because my mom had to call and remind them. It's almost impossible to get a call back. The nurse Amanda that called me last week to so called give the results from my forced pap smear sounded like she was half dead. After telling my mom about the called she called back and demanded to speak with Dr. Sylvester, Sylvester came up with any excuse as to why we couldn't get call backs in a timely manner, she went on to say my paper work was siting on her desk for 3 weeks but she just didn't get around to doing it.WRONG ANSWER. She began to over speak my mom saying that we needed to find another doctor that would suit us. This Place is a total JOKE.

I went back in December for my annual which is suppose to be covered by my insurance and was charged $65 even when a normal copay is $40. I had them run some tests which cost me close to $400 and had the same test run by a walk in clinic just months later and never received a bill for it. I was told by the walk in clinic someone with their office probably coded it wrong which is why I received a bill. While there we discussed birth control options and Gardasil (which is something they have pushed both times I have been there). While I was interested in both I asked about cost and what insurance might cover, etc and was told she wasn't an insurance guru and I would have to contact my provider and get back with them. This was upsetting because I was being sold something I both wanted and needed but yet could not be told what it would cost and would have to come back and pay another copay once I figured that out. Not to mention I had coworkers that have gone to other medical professionals for various reasons and they have never had an issue with someone letting them to know what to expect with or without insurance. Any questions I had I felt were met with luke warm interest about as equivalent as a shoulder shrug. While I know the ultimate decision is left up to myself I asked for opinions based on their expertise and knowledge and got little to nothing in return. My pap smear came back abnormal and the medicine that was called in seemed to only give symptoms versus relieving any which I never had to start and ended up having to go to the walk in clinic for them to prescribe me something to get rid of it. I returned the other day for an unrelated issue and the staff, as usual, was unwelcoming. It reminded me of going to the DMV where you pull a number and wait to hear \"Next\". After I gave the reason for my visit to 2 different people I can hear them in the hallway discussing what to me is a very private situation and it was a busy day so I know other patients could hear them which only added to the embarrassment, stress and anxiety I was already feeling. After my examination I was again given options for treatment and Gardasil was pushed (which, once again I would have been all for) but was told they could not check to see what my insurance would cover and would need to contact my provider to find out and return if I decided to go with that option. The PA looked down at her watch at one point making me feel like she didn't have time to spend with me to answer questions. In those situations you don't always know what to ask and I know they see the same thing day in and day out but we as patients don't so I don't feel like it's a lot to take the time to educate your patients on what they are facing. I shouldn't have to learn more from google than I do from my healthcare professional. At the end of it all the medicine was never called into my pharmacy. I made a trip to pick it up to find out they had not received it and when I called the following morning to check the office told me it had not been sent over but they were doing so then. I asked if they could send it to one closer to me and was told I could call the pharmacy and have them transfer it. I called the pharmacy later in the day to check and still no prescription and their office has already closed. I will not be returning and my advice to anyone who is seeking a facility that is warm, welcoming and nonjudgmental and a doctor who listen and cares for you to find somewhere else to go other than here.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bb6300a9ae5:0x1bc870e501e49b9f"}

After I finished filling out paperwork, I asked the front desk personnel if I could go ahead and relieve myself and give them a urine sample due to the fact that I believed I had a urine infection. They said ok, showed me the way and I did the usual sample in a cup through a lab window. Being called back to the office was pleasant because they did not insist I get undressed and prepped immediately so that I could meet the Doctor for the first time and get to know her and discuss things with her. She did come in with a smile on her face and introduced herself although she only looked down at the paperwork I filled out and flipped through it as quickly as possible as if she was reviewing it then only asked me my husbands' name and how long we had been married as well as where I worked. She left me to prepare and was gentle but did not address any other issues on the not one, but two pieces of paper I had to fill out while in the waiting room. For instance, the only thing she asked was what kind of birth control I used to be on and wrote me a prescription for something completely different after I told her it worked well... then when I told her I had been diagnosed with hypothyroidism when I was 18, she told me she would do blood work and left the room. I proceeded to get dressed and they walked me to the lab where there were two other ladies who just sat there talking as I waited. After about 10-15 minutes, one of the ladies got up to go find the nurse who drew my blood. They threw away my urine sample and did not test it for a bladder infection/UTI as well as called me and told me that I did not need my thyroid medication because my TSH levels looked fine. So I received a different birth control I have never used before, zero antibiotics for my bladder/UTi infection and they believe I magically grew out of hypothyroidism because they tested my tsh levels for the pituitary response which had nothing to do with my T3 and T4 levels that I needed tested for my thyroid. Then, they found a knot in my breast and just made an appointment for me without even asking when I could come in and today when I called to ask them what building and floor I needed to be on for that appointment, they were not even open. They made an appointment for me at 8 and I'm the recording that i was given, it said they did not even open until 9 and tried to redirect me to an emergency number.

I spent an hour completing their forms just for them to say that though they had my insurance prior to requesting me to complete their long set up process, they would not set me up an appointment with my insurance company which they admitted they accept. They said they would set me up as cash pay but would not attempt to charge my insurance company unless I selected a primary which I had been unable to do due to covid and no local drs taking new patients or their waiting list was 8 months out.\nI called my insurance company to ask about options, they said since I had PPO coverage I did not have to select a primary to receive coverage and they would pay for my womans care. My insurance company conferenced called this clinic to tell them the service would be covered, but the lady continued to admit she did not know how to read the coverage, so the insurance lady read it to her very kindly three times. The clerk continued to say she was setting me up as cash pay instead of charging my insurance for my own benefit because she wanted to help me.\nThe insurance agent and I both very confused asked what that meant. (All on a recorded line that I have).\nThe SWS clerk said she just wasnt sure and would have to get management, instead of her going to get her manager so we could clarify this and get my appointment set up, the SWS clerk hung up.\nAfter spending an entire day trying to set up an appointment with this clinic, I called the one in Mobile with a 4.9 stars and they had my appointment for next week set in under 10 minutes. I got off the phone bewildered how easy setting up my appointment was at the MOBILE CLINIC.\n\nI called hoping to make them my regular womans care doctor because of the reviews. Due to just receiving a new medical package this year I had no previous primary care physician in this county. After receiving my medical package after COVID I had called around to set an appt for primary care physician origination, but due to recent times, either no one was accepting new patients or were 8 months out for initial appointment. so currently none set up. When I called here they had me fill out their online documents which took over an hour and even requested my credit card information to be held on file, which I did. Then I called happy and excited to set up my appointment now that all the paperwork was complete.\nThey told me they would not give me an appointment until I picked out a primary car physician. So I called my PPO Blue Cross Blue Shield policy and they advised me that I am still covered for service, I am just not eligible for the $10 co-pay discount but all other services are still covered the same, so we called the clinic back but the lady continued to argue with my insurance company saying I was not covered. My insurance company repeated, \"WE WILL PAY HER SERVICES, SHE JUST DOES NOT GET THE DISCOUNT.\" but the receptionist could not understand this and said she would have to get her manager. but instead of getting her manager she just hung up. After spending an entire day trying to set up an appointment with this clinic, I called the one in Mobile with a 4.9 stars and they had my appointment for next week set in under 10 minutes.

So I went somewhere else for my yearly exam this time, hoping for real help. (She was my first gyno visit, I wasn't sure then if this was just how these appointments are.) My new doctor examined me without causing additional pain like Dr.Robinson did, she was so rough during my examination and she acted like I was being oversensitive! She applied so much pressure on my ovaries during the exam that they felt bruised the next day. My new doctor put my fears of birth control pills at ease instead of treating me like I was being over-paranoid and put me on one that made it so I can live normally even during my period! (I can go to the gym during it now!)\n\nUltimately she belittled my concerns, made me feel as though my suffering was my fault (even though I tried to tell her I've been fit before, I've previously been on a track team and swim team simultaneously, back then my periods caused black-out, light-headedness, plus some of my other problems) and then did nothing to resolve a problem that had plagued me for years.

This is my first pregnancy and I needed a new doctor, my previous doctor having recently moved out of state. Unfortunately, it was very difficult to get in touch with anyone at this practice.\n\nNo one answered when I tried to schedule an appointment, and no one returned my call when I left a message. When I finally did get to speak to a person and got an appointment made, I asked to be put through to the nurse as I had a concern. The receptionist forgot to send me through, hanging up instead. So I called again and left a message for the nurse, explaining that my concern was time-sensitive (I needed an answer before the next morning) and also explaining that I was making a long drive out of town and to please leave a message addressing my concern if I'm unable to answer. The nurse called me back about 8 hours later and, still driving, I missed the call. Instead of addressing my concerns, the message simply said to call them back. I did, just 6 short minutes after the missed call, only to receive an automated message that they were closed and would charge me $25 to speak to someone if they deemed my problem not urgent. I needed an answer to my concern before they would be open the next morning, so there I was, out of town, first time pregnant, hormonal, and sobbing to my poor SO because I wasn't sure the right thing to do to keep our baby safe. Sweet SO ended up contacting his mother, a nurse, who consulted a doctor she works with, and I was finally able to put my mind at ease.\n\nI understand doctor's offices are busy, but the result is that I felt unimportant and uncared for, and I have cancelled my appointment and found another practice with which to entrust my pregnancy.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888917a3ecbc62e9:0x58743e7d808a1f53"}
