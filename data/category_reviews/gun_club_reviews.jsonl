Takes all the guesswork out of the experience.\n\nI fired my pistol, and was pleased with the range itself. The design is new and clean. And with the RSOs keeping an eye on everything, it's a great environment to enjoy your firearms.\n\nI tried the 88, and it performed beautifully. I added some extra cushion due to a shoulder injury. For those that would ask, you can't shoot bird shot here. But you can fire buck shot and slugs. But I'll tell you, it's fun firing a shotgun at this range.\n\nAfterward I wandered around and struck up conversations with some of the staff, and showed me a selection for sale.

The range facilities are up to date, very comfortable and the RSOs are very professional.\n\nHowever, I made the mistake of using the gunsmith services. This has not gone well. This particular saga has been going on since the end of November. I always had to call or email them to get any status and the answer was always the same...it will be ready Saturday, it will be ready next week, it will be ready \"sometime next week\". I do not believe that they have devoted any significant time to my project. The first time I checked in with them after a week, that is when they informed me I needed to bring in other components. They never reached out to me. Very frustrating. Now that it is in Jan I have given up working with them and I am now taking the project somewhere else.\n\nI get the feeling that they want to work on things when they feel like it, have no obligation to provide status or time estimate to the customer.
