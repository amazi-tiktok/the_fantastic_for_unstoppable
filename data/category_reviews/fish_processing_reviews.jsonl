They did have red snapper and was able to prepare it for cooking just as Whole Foods does. Their prices are higher than Whole Foods which wasn't a deal breaker. We purchased 2 whole red snapper at $52.61 and a half of filet of Salmon at $27.13. They politely provided ice for the ride as requested. Before we could get home we started smelling a foul smell from the fish. This has never happened on our ride from Whole Foods which is a farther distance. We are not fish experts by any means- just seafood lovers. Anyone who does fish would know that one of the fish that we were sold was spoiled and should not be eaten. Definitely an owner or employee of a seafood market would know this. I did some research to determine the signs of bad fish (Spoiled fish has an unpleasant, sharp smell of trimethylamine (bad fish) and rot. Eyes of fresh fish are bulging and shiny. Eyes of old fish are cloudy and sunken into the head. Gills and fins of fresh fish are moist).\nOne of our fish had all of the signs listed (I posted pictures of the two snappers we were sold).\nSo what was meant for dinner for two is now dinner for one for @ $52.61.\nThis was my first and last experience at the Hoover Seafood Market.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNATU6XldunLINz-JN-nOTTZwB9oIs5fqLJdHcJ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888921d89afd6587:0xdb4d19b7faf174e6"}
