As I left, I noticed that they turned the 'Open' sign off.  I cannot believe this.

Let me explain, I\u2019ve been coming into this place to get full-face IPL treatments done for about a year. I\u2019ve had three total treatments done in the span of a year. The first two treatments cost me $150. The second time I came in my specialist informed me that the prices will raise to $200 per IPL session. No problem for me, well... I came in earlier this week to get only CHEEKS and CHIN done and she charged me $350$!!! NO ONE informed me it would be that high! Last time I came in I was told $200. $350 for a partial face treatment is absolutely insane price. I\u2019ve been getting these treatments done all over the country and I\u2019ve NEVER had anyone charge me that much for a partial face IPL. Honestly, she should have told me before the treatment that it would be that much! I\u2019ve seen her three times. I didn\u2019t want to make a big deal about it by the time she charged me because I didn\u2019t want to cause a scene but I\u2019m honestly very unhappy with the lack of communication from this business. And what a shame because I really liked this place. ):", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1618703875244, "text": "Hi Savie. We informed you at your last IPL appointment there was a price increase expected.

The stylist seems to be stressed about how long it was going to take to cut my hair. She did not attend to the details and how you can see every layer in my hair if you don\u2019t cut it properly. She ran out of time before her next appointment and sent me to someone else to finish drying my hair. She never came back to check on her work. It was so choppy and uneven.

Neither of us could style our hair to make it look presentable.  I ended up cutting my own hair and my sisters to clean up the mess.
