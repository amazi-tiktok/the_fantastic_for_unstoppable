Online waiver was simple to fill out the night before. Easy to find the location.\n\nStaff working the front desk was very helpful. She did a great job taking the necessary COVID precautions, and gave me a brief but helpful tour of the facilities.\n\nThe routes here use a 1-5 \"dot\" grading scale, plus a smiley face for beginner routes. 1 dot is easy; > 4 dots, I'm not even sure Spider Man could do. + sign is in-between dot \"grades\". Simple enough, and similar to the color / ski slope systems I have seen elsewhere.\n\nMost routes seemed to be in the 2-3+ range. Normally I am a v3-v5 climber, depending on the route and gym. I was able to do every 2 I tried, and one 2+. These routes are tough!\n\nThe setting was done well, with a strong mix of holds and problem types. I wish I was good enough to do some of the harder ones! They looked really fun. But even their 2 dots had some challenge to them, and forced some flagging, hooks, dynos I wasn't expecting on initial read. The geometry was comparable to Walltopia, very curvy, lots of inversion, which definitely adds to the difficulty in many cases.\n\nThe Forge area looked amazing. Moon boards, spray walls, campus walls, it was truly a sight to behold. Biggest I've seen anywhere. Unfortunately I did not have time to train in this part of the gym but rest assured I will be firing up the moonboard app and failing miserably here next time I'm in Birmingham area.\n\nOverall, I'd say B2 is pretty top-notch.
