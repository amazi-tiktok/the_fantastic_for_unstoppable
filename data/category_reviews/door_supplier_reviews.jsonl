He built the quote quickly in our home and had us look over it to make sure the number of windows/style of windows were correct. John called Julian to get the best price for us. We were impressed by the number that they were able to get to, and we signed on the dotted line! They have quoted us 8-9 weeks for the windows to be installed.

I'm incredibly disappointed. Our order was managed poorly - the left hand doesn't seem to know what the right hand is doing - and we're still waiting 6 months later for 3 doors to be installed. From this experience, it's hard to say whether I'd recommend Champion again. I like the product a lot, but I'm very disappointed with the progress of this project.\n\nWe were so pleased with Champion before, that we decided to hire them for 4 new doors around our house. January, they came and measured the doors and told us they would be installing the end of Feb or beginning of March (can't remember exactly). They show up and one of the doors is just right, one door is the *wrong* door, and the other two were not measured or manufactured properly. Ok, mistakes happen, I get it. So they tell me they'll order new doors and get back in a month. It's a busy time or something, right? They tell me the doors won't be ready until May. May rolls around, nothing. I start calling in June and nobody knows what I'm talking about, I have to tell the representative what my problem is and she tells me she'll have to contact the local office, gives me her number, and tells me to call her the following week. I call her the following week and she doesn't answer. I call the HQ and the rep has to take all my information again because my record isn't clear to her. I call the local office, nobody answers. I call HQ again, nobody answers. I finally get a call in JULY that *one* door is ready to be installed. \"One door,\" I ask, \"we are waiting for 3 doors.\" The rep is confused. All he has in his records is one door. I'm contacted by another rep the same day who says she got in contact with the local office, who weren't able to tell her whether the door had even been ordered and, again, I had to remind the rep that we had ordered 2 other doors.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1580132983886, "text": "Champion appreciates the feedback in order to improve our customer service.

He informed us that these pulls were soft pulls when in fact, they were hard pulls against his credit report. I was livid!!

After paying and getting the measurements, it took 2 months for the windows to be installed. During this time there was 0 communication. We tried calling and left several messages with the receptionist, but no one ever returned our call. Finally, we called our sales rep and complained. Suddenly, the windows were ready to be installed.\nThe day of the installation, the company sent two workers who told me they would be finished by 1. The workers showed up an hour after we were told they would. After our old windows were removed, I overheard them talking about how our windows weren\u2019t measured correctly. When I asked what was wrong, they assured me everything was fine. Later, the workers and their boss were screaming at each other over the phone about the correct way to install the windows, the result of which was another working coming to explain the correct way to install and why the windows maybe looked too small. At 4:45, I informed the workers that I had to be somewhere at 5 pm and was already going to be late. They left, and promised to return the next morning at 8 am to finish the installation. The next day my husband stayed home from his job to be there to let them in. At 9:15 they arrived and finished the installation.\n\nThe overall quality of the windows was fine, but I have never dealt with more unprofessional people in my life. We\u2019re still waiting for our gutters to be installed (we originally measured everything the week of July 4th).

I would NEVER refer them to anyone nor EVER use them again.  They are the absolute worst in customer service.  The salesperson is the face of the company and that\u2019s about as good as it gets.   It is difficult to contact them by phone and when you do no one is ever around who has any answers.  The receptionist or answering service must always get back to you, and usually never the same day.  I don\u2019t know the criteria for Window World being ranked as the #1 replacement company in America, but it can\u2019t be based on any contributions from Window World of Dothan, AL, at least not for doors and shutters.\n\nWe contracted with Window World of Dothan, AL on 1 Oct 2019 for 10 sets of outdoor shutters and a front door.  The install should have only taken a day. The install began on 16 Nov in the late afternoon and still has not been completed as of today, 9 Jan 2020.  The individual sent to install the shutters and door obviously didn\u2019t care about the job because the quality of the installs were substandard.  We tried to give him space and let him do his job, but that was a mistake because when we looked closer at the tall shutters they were installed with only 4 pegs instead of 6 (industry standard) and did not place the pegs uniformly (symmetrically) into the mortar, some directly into the brick.  When asked if 4 pegs was a Window World standard, he said it didn't matter.  We also asked if he filled the old holes and he stated \"some\",  which we knew meant \"none\". His defense was to say there were lots of holes in our house.\n\nThe installer completed the haphazard shutter install and departed because it started to drizzle and he didn't want the caulking to get wet. He was supposed to return the next day (Friday) to install the door.  He sent a text on Friday to say he was still on a job in GA and wouldn't arrive until the afternoon. We responded that we didn't like afternoon appointments because he would be rushing the door install the same way he rushed the shutter install and make more mistakes.  He agreed to return the following day in the morning.  Meanwhile, my wife attempted to call Window World, Dothan several times to ask about the standards for shutter installation but no one ever called her back.\n\nAs he was installing the door on Saturday, we let him know the door was not square in the frame.  His ongoing response was to tell us that our house was the reason the door wasn't straight. Once the install was complete we continued to let him know we were not satisfied with the way the door looked in the frame.  As he prepared to install the storm door, he realized the frame had to be shimmed and stated he would return on Sunday to finish the job.  When he returned at 9am we told him that the thresh hold needed to be adjusted more because we could see car lights under the door and feel the cold air. He appeared a little agitated. He became more agitated when my wife asked \"hypothetically\" what would happen if we wanted to discuss the possibility of getting another door. He then said he could fix the door.  My wife asked him if that was the case why he hadn't fixed it in the first place.  He proceeded to tell my wife that she complained about the shutters and every little thing about the door. He then stopped what he was doing and left the storm door uninstalled.  He told her that day was his last day at Window World so he didn't care if we complained.\n\nMy wife called Window World the following Monday  and asked to speak to the owner.  Instead of being contacted by the owner, the salesman was sent for damage control.  He stated he would have the shutters reordered and expedited.  Another installer was sent to correct the door install.  He made some additional adjustments that helped but was still not the quality of install we expected.  It is currently 9 Jan 2020 and we have not heard from Window World about the shutters or the fact that we are extremely DISSATISFIED customers.  Their lack of care, concern, and communication speaks volumes about the organization.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1578694241397, "text": "Mr. Gatlin, we appreciate the time spent sharing this information with us.

I suggest everyone do this! Seeing several sunrooms already set up truly helps in your decision process versus just seeing magazine quality sunrooms in their catalogs.\n\nCharles even brought us to the back of where products are custom made for every sunroom. These are not kits. We went for the 6in depth walls. Seeing the sun rooms in the office and showroom also convinced us to go ahead with additional products. Charles was not pushy at all. We made these decisions on our own.\n\nBoth Matt & Charles also gave us their personal cell phone numbers and we have called them several times. They have always been available -immediately-.

Champion will contract your job out to unprofessional, inexperienced, cheap laborers. Their sub-contractors repeatedly left our house completely open to the elements for hours and even days at a time which led to many issues for which Champion refused to accept responsibility. We spoke to Corey, the install manager, Rob McCauley, the regional manager, and even a national customer service manager - all who insisted the issues we experienced were not Champion's fault. Corey's temper when we involved Rob in communicating our concerns was completely unprofessional. Rob offered to give us a gift card for dinner as a compensation for the trouble we experienced (what a joke!). The national customer service manager threatened me and swore at me when I insisted Champion make the right the issues we experienced.\n\nThis company is full of dishonest, unprofessional, and unexperienced people charging high prices for a product of average quality.\n\nUPDATE IN RESPONSE TO CHAMPION'S RESPONSE: If nothing else, please take Champion's sarcastic response to my feedback as a token of their lack of professionalism. You can see from the reviews of others that our experience is not an outlier, but rather the norm for how Champion operates. Of course we noted our windows had just been replaced - WE SPENT OVER $12,000.00 ON THEM.\n\nCHAMPION WILL LIE TO YOU, SEND SUB-PAR CONTRACTORS TO INSTALL THEIR AVERAGE-QUALITY WINDOWS, AND THEN STEAL YOUR MONEY AND DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MAINTAIN THEIR FACADE TO TRAP OTHERS - DO NOT FALL FOR IT!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626545c36f5ab7:0x6fb3859ed0eacb75"}

We have a home that has 32 windows. These windows were from the original build back in 1999. Over time these windows failed, broke internal components, were loose, didn't stay up and let so much air in between them; it really hurt our HVAC bills. We decided to look at new windows. We went through the hoops and ringers with various window companies in the area and the big box stores. The price ranges were all over the place and the functions, options, features and price points were the driving factors in this big home reno purchase. We called Champion (CW going forward) and had our salesman Whit come out and give his sales pitch. He did a great pitch and was at our house for 4 plus hours. Going over every detail and question we had. He was not afraid to say \"I don't know, but I will find out\" and called ahead to ask with us on his speakerphone right in front of him. He never stepped out to his truck to ask; he just did it right in front of us. We wanted an answer and he went and got one. Good bad or indifferent there was no empty promises or sugar coated answers. We were explained all the finance options and the promo they were having during our consultation. We beat him up pretty good with our wants and needs for the windows. After that was done, Cory then came out a few days later and walked me through the measurement process; again answering my rhetorical questions and others I missed with Whit. He took meticulous measurements of ALL my windows and explained what my casements would be and how they would sit in the frame. I walked through the house with and he asked questions to me about each room as he measured and took detailed notes. We discussed the order that was first taken to verify everything was right...the first time. He explained the install and what was done with that process from top to bottom. As well as what to expect with financing options again. Making this as streamlined as possible. He explained our order, what timeline for delivery was and the timeline of the install process once the windows arrived from the factory. Once our windows arrived in Huntsville, we were given a few choices on the install. We picked the date that worked on our schedule and a timeframe that made sense for the install. Once again, were explained the who what when were and how on the install team. The install team was on time the first day with everything ready and planned out so they could hit the ground running. Jimmy Mashburn and Brandon Clark were the install team and they were incredible. I have OCD about fit and finish and so does this install team. Jimmy talked with my wife so she would get the understanding of the install and what she could expect. He didn't make her feel silly for asking and was very professional with each question. We, of course stayed out of the way, but if either side had a question about a window, my wife and or Jimmy/Brandon made sure both parties were on the same page. They took their time and set everything right the first time. We didn't care how long it took and they were very meticulous and detail driven on each window. They were not in any hurry to just set 'em and forget 'em. It was done right the first time. I'm no installer but I'm a homeowner that bought 32 windows so I was wanting to find something wrong or find a shortcut that I saw...NOPE! I couldn't find anything that I felt was incorrect or not done in a make sense manner. Everything was top notch work. All my old windows were removed and stacked out of the way. Drop cloths were placed inside on each opening to make sure the removal was as clean and clutter free. All of the windows were set correctly, openings were cleaned from past dirt and debris. Professional 100%!! I felt that my money was going to the right company for our home. These are big decisions to make when getting new windows and the value of the CW product met our families need. We are truly very happy with our windows and would recommend CW to anyone!! We are very happy we went with Champion!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1572873361192, "text": "Thanks so much for taking the time to leave this great review.

They installed a garage door that is faulty.  Many times when you hit the button to open the door, it doesn't go all the way up.  Because you can't see this when you are in the car, we have backed in to it several times (damaging our vehicles).  We have asked Door Doctors to come fix their faulty door repeatedly.  They did come once but couldn't figure out how to repair it and now they won't come back.  We have taken pictures to show them the problem.  Because they installed a faulty door, they should stand behind their product and replace it.  It has been such a disappointing experience.

I called 11/20/19 to get a lumber package delivered to save some time. I knew it would be a bit more expensive but more convenient. Delivery was quick and early 11/21/19 unfortunately delivery is at wrong address 100 yards from where it should be and about 15 boards were incorrect. Still no biggie just let them know and I would think it would be taken care of. First call was 8:40 am. Left a message for Dino with another salesman and on his cell phone. Second call was about 12:30 pm, third call was at 3:00 I was told he was still with a customer. I asked the person on the phone to please tell him so that I could hear him answer I needed a call back today, and he did. 3:30 pm Dino calls I explain 15 boards were to be pressure treated and the delivery was in the wrong spot (address) I was then argued with that I didn\u2019t order pressure treated I wrote down the prices quoted and if it wasn\u2019t p.t it was expensive white wood. He put me on hold when he came back to the phone he said the contractor that came in and paid told him the location. I explained it was all done over the phone and there was only me. Where he described is exactly where I told him to put it. Unfortunately that\u2019s not where it was put. He said he would call me back and get it straightened out. No call back, so 11/22/19 I called and left a message with a nice young lady for the sales manager.(I was told his name is Jason).No call back!! I go to see if the package has been moved that afternoon. I have pressure treated wood but package not moved. So much for convenience. Now I will have to pay someone to move the wood.
