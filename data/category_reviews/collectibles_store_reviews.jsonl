I drive from Daphne to visit his shop near the University of South AL and his booth at the Flea Market in Mobile. I do this because Scott, the proprietor, is not only knowledgeable but also genuinely friendly and accommodating! I have been a customer of his for many years and have purchased an Xbox 360, Xbox 1, Nintendo 64, Wii, and, more recently, the hard to find Nintendo Switch. Besides selling consoles dating back to the \u201980s (Nintendo, Sega, Etc.) Scott has a vast selection of games and accessories for all the consoles. Plus, he has repaired my phone screen more times than I can count. Scott provides returning customers with great discounts and bundle deals. He has also offered me store credit or trades that I\u2019m comfortable with; Unlike the unsatisfying offers, other establishments offer that will leave one feeling remorseful. Game-N-Trade also has a selection of comics and figurines, but I don\u2019t know much about those. So, cheers to Scott and Game-N-Trade for making my family and me delighted customers. I\u2019m confident once you visit his unique establishment and see the quality merchandise at exceptional prices, you\u2019ll understand why he has so many satisfied, returning customers.

As such, We are used to being treated a certain way by the staff when we visit the store. Today was NOT a pleasant visit, as the girl at the register had an attitude from the start as, as if our coming in was an inconvenience to her. We were trying to trade in an Xbox 360 for store credit towards our layaway purchases. She proceeded to tell us she could not take the system because of bugs, which we do not have in our home. Admittedly, the system sat in our closet collecting dust, dirt, and dog hair for 2 years. I explained this to her to be told \"I'm looking at bug legs and droppings.\" I argued the fact and proved my case by pulling out the dog hair to show her. She already had her mind made up that she wouldn't help us and couldn't fathom the idea that she was wrong. I guarantee this... my next visit to the Pell City store, if she's working the counter, I will walk out. I will refuse to deal with her ever again. She was very rude, snide, and ignorant.
