I had one nurse who called me back after 4 days and she tried to tell me she knew exactly what the Doctor had ordered me to do with a certain medication and when i ask her how she knew, she tried to tell me she was in the room with the Dr. which I called her out on because she wasnt in the room with the dr and I. A lady by the name of Jordan was, this ladies name was Gloria! When I confronted her and told her NO MA'AM you were not in the room Jordan the dr and myself were the only 3 people in there that day, she put le on hold and later came back to the phone with a different attitude, but informed me that my Dr was out of town and guess what HE HAD NO FILL INS.. I have worked in the medical field and bo that Drs cant just leave their patients without ANYONE to help them with their medical needs!! Long story short I went without my medication from Thursday until the following Thursday! 7 FULL DAYS!! It was no big deal to this lady at all!!

All this sorry excuse for a Dr will do is give you medication after medication..and a nerve block....which none of it ever worked. And months have passed with migranes everyday and watching her suffer. She never wanted to order more tests or even try to find out what's causing them. My fiance passed out at work from a migraine and was rushed to the ER via ambulance last week  so we immediately made another appointment with Dr Sanders  she didn't even act concerned that she passed out which is absolutely not normal  instead she just tried to give her another medication to see if it will work. We didn't expect her to be a miracle worker but we did expect her to actually care about her patients which it's obvious she doesnt. She didn't seem the least bit concerned. We expressed our concerns at our last visit with her about all the medication she keeps prescribing and her response was \"if you don't like it don't come back.\" So we will never waste our time and money and will never return. Do yourself a favor and see another doctor don't waste your time and money on this Dr that takes the lazy route by throwing prescriptions at you instead of actually trying to fix the problem while billing your insurance company for tons of money. The bottom line is we have no problem with her being honest and upfront and saying that she has no clue but give it some one prescription after prescription after prescription and having to wait a month in between prescriptions when none of them work is ridiculous and it's very cruel to the patients if we at least saw some effort and concern on her behalf she may have been headache free by now.

After my current pediatrician, Dr. Rivas, advised it was time to transition to an adult provider. During the time he was my provider, Dr. Ginevan worked alongside my psychiatrist to continue maintenance of my ADHD and when necessary, he worked with specialists to manage my delicate GI condition. This included references to appropriate clinics and scheduling of applicable tests ie. Colonoscopy, EGD, etc. I truly trusted Dr. Ginevan and was incredibly grateful to have found such a wonderful physician. I never minded the fact that his office was always moving locations or that his appointments had become a nightmare to secure. I still referred only my closest of friends and family to see him. Always assuring them they'd be nothing less than satisfied with him as they're provider. Those were the old days... in 2013 I moved away to live on base with my then husband. I moved back in 2015 and returned to Dr. Ginevan. He and his staff had undergone a complete restructuring as they were now a part of the mega-merger trend and had merged with the tri-cities health giant Shoals Primary Care LLC. Due to the merger Dr. Ginevan no longer had any of my previous medical records from all of my time spent under his care which led to massive complications to my continuity of care. (I now understand the importance of my responsibility to secure medical history documentation and maintain my own current updated personal medical record.) Also, SADLY, due to the implementation of a governmental-esque standard of operating procedures, it is my opinion that Dr. Ginevan no longer maintained the level of patient care he had became known for. His office staff has always been grade-A; to be commended. If you are considering seeing Dr. Ginevan as your primary care provider this review is for you. In closing I want to say that this review in no way, intends to slander or cause malice. This review is my personal experiential reference/opinions of Dr. Ginevan meant solely for the purpose of socially informing fellow peers.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d48b48019956d:0x80858f3d5bf2d029"}

I ignored that fact and still decided to give the doctor the benefit of the doubt because I could understand things sometimes happen. However, upon my scheduled visit as a first time patient it was for 7:30 am, and I arrived at 7:15 am for new patient paper work. I signed in and no one even showed up at the front desk until my appointment time, where I  then asked for my paper work and filled it out. About ten minutes after that, another woman called me by the wrong name and when I corrected her, I was made to feel as if I had done something wrong. Also, you can not hear when you are being called because the TV is loud, so people are talking over the TV, and I have two ear infections. After filling out my paper work, I was then called back to the window, where I was asked to write down my SSN, but I had already written it down twice on the form already. This told me they obviously were not paying attention to the information they were entering. After this, and already feeling on edge from just the front desk experience, I am called back by the doctor's nurse practitioner who tells me to step on the scale, and with a horrible tone says, \"you're going to have to take some of that off.\" Meaning my purse. I ask where I should put it in case of a designated area, which seem to make her even more annoyed and she replies with, \"I don't know.\" Very snappy. I am a new patient and felt like I was asking a very simple and non offensive question. We then walk to the exam room where she informs me that I would not be seeing the doctor and that he also would never been doing my exams or ever seeing me other than a quick peek in the room. Which, as someone looking for a long term doctor, it does not feel comfortable not even meeting my doctor on the first visit. When I tried to explain that I was uncomfortable with the fact she would only be relaying my issues to the doctor, and that I didn't feel comfortable having my health looked after in third person, and that I didnt understand why they wouldn't tell a new patient to begin with when making an appointment that he or she won't be seeing a doctor. She then got upset about it and told me I could reschedule or abort because she had been doing this for 40 years. Which is fine and I explained to her I was fine with her seeing me, but that I didn't feel comfortable having a doctor diagnose me without speaking with me and knowing me as a person. She gets more upset and I said I think it would be best just to cancel because at that point, being someone who has been diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder, I was overwhelmed and ready to go home. She proceeded to then say to me, \"Fine then. Adios.\" I feel as if the entire situation was unprofessional on many different levels. I decided to keep searching for a new doctor. I would not advise this practice if you want to get to know your doctor for long term use, or have anxiety issues, seeing as how it is the only doctor's office I have ever been in where the lobby is loud and over packed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d48b48019956d:0x80858f3d5bf2d029"}
