They had ample time to finalize our closing documents, because the property almost sold, that buyer backed out at the last minute, then we purchased it. All told, they had around 3 months with the property documents and still asked for 2 extensions. At our closing, which was the last possible day our financing was approved (because of the 2 extensions), our closing appointment took over 3 hours and we didn't finish. Our closing agent became very upset with us for \"rushing\" her into the closing and repeatedly told us in the room that we should have given her more time. Then, she waited until after 5 pm to contact our bank, so they had already closed and she accused us of choosing a \"bad\" lender. Thankfully, we had a great realtor (Tracy Gardner) who went back there the next day to finalize everything for us. This included getting our refund, because the closing company never even told us how much money to bring to closing, because she \"hadn't gotten that far yet\". All through the process, they never returned calls, they were rude and very unprofessional. Other reviews online show we're not the only ones to experience this horrible service.

I told them I couldn't and they said come in Friday Sept. 18. Ok...\nFriday came and at the table was the first time I saw my ALTA and it was wrong in several places. They failed to find and list my mortgage. Unfortunately, I disclosed I had a mortgage. They said \"whew\" thanks for being honest... Really? They also listed several sewer leins that I am NOT responsible for. We went round and round and round for days! They apparently do not know Jefferson County mor do they know what a compliance letter is. They tried to strong arm me by saying \" they needed to close this now and I work it out later\" Really? After 29 emails I finally spoke with the owner of the company, Gill. He passed me off to some other attorney named Tyler who actually cared about me and said I was correct and not responsible for the leins.  Duh! That's what I was telling them for days..... I asked them to refund me the attorney fees associated with the closing and they refused. The buyers closed on Monday Sept. 21 as scheduled but I did not get resolved until the following Friday Sept. 25. When I finally received a correct ALTA I discovered they did not refund the attorney fees. Horrible.!.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888917a04c6b529d:0x10f5af08018e"}

After bringing it to the attention and questioning W. Patrick Cockrell, he became rude and very unprofessional. He began accusing me of having an attitude and how he didn't want to complete my closing. However, I stated several times I didn't have an attitude only concern about not being contacted. He insisted I did. Another lady from the office asked another employee to stay in the office during document signing. While signing he rudely slung documents across to me. I have never experienced such an cruel, unethical, and unprofessional atmosphere( in which he set the scene). If only I had a choice, this company would not have been my choice.
