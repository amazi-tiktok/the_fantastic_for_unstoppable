Already, I was pleased to have wonderful customer service over the phone. A few times going in and Chase Shelton putting a name with a face, I can walk in now and him tell me, \u201cHey Mrs. Wolfe. We got that prescription ready for you now,\u201d without saying a word. I have asked Chase and one of his awesome staff members, Josh, more questions than I do the doctor when I am sick or someone I love is sick. Chase is very knowledgeable, professional and at the same time very approachable. And, as awesome as all those qualities are, the reason I come back every single time and recommend him to family and friends, is because Chase is truly honest. Chase is not there to make a profit; Chase is there to make a difference. As some of my children get to an age where they can drive themselves around and one has a child of their own, they continue to go to Chase for their needs and their children\u2019s needs. So long as Sheltons pharmacy is around, I will not do business anywhere else. Chase will have my business as long as he\u2019s in the business.

I had a horrible cough during that and developed a hard pressure in the upper center part of my stomach which is pushing on my ribs and heart (possibly vagus nerve) I explained all of this to the doctor that I seen and told him I was having problems breathing since it started, much worse when I sat down. I also explained to this doctor that I had been taking meds for migraines but had ran out and needed a refill. Once this doctor found out I was a smoker, he seemed to not even care at all. He blamed everything on smoking. I had my 12 year old son in the room at the time and this doctor literally drew a graph of how long I was going to live on the bed paper. He terrified my son!!! I knew then I'd never see that man again! Instead of checking to see what the pressure was and instead of refilling a med I had been taking for 12 years he put me on Buspar. The first night I took that Buspar the pressure increased so bad I could hardly move! I'm also now having to take bp meds since all of this. I'm 34 years old, I should not have all of this going on and for it to hit like it did all at once. And instead of this doctor trying to help me he terrified my son! He also prescribed me Naproxen which luckily I didn't take because I went to St. Vincent where they done at egd and found I have chronic gastritis as well as reflux esophagitis so the Naproxen could have caused a stomach bleed... I've seen another doctor here who is better than the first but I am still having the same issues. I'm honestly believing a stuck hiatal hernia or something else has been missed. The new doc put me on zantac which didn't help either. I feel no better, in fact I feel worse than when I did when I went to try and get help here about 5 months ago.

Other pharmacies here in town pack the shelves, counters, walls, & etc. With all types of unnecessary items that are pushed to sale & the items are most definitely not \"drug store\" or \"pharmacy\" appropriate! This can be very overwhelming to some. Westside pharmacy was free of clutter & stocked with the appropriate items that bring people to make a visit to a pharmacy in the first place. Anyhow, I handed my prescription to the pharmacist & provided very little but needed personal info for my first time visit. I was told my prescription would be ready in just a few minutes. They immediately started working it and in less than 5 mins, my prescription was completed, handed over, then totaled out (extremely reasonable cost for what I had filled) & on my way out the door. Definitely, a pleasing atmosphere, smiling friendly faces, & affordable prescriptions. I actually saved money here compared to elsewhere.

They were always on top of ordering one of my  meds they didn't stock regularly, and having it for me by the next day, even if the next day was Saturday, whereas at CVS, I had to wait until a certain day of the week, usually Tuesday I think, to get it. One disadvantage is that they don't store coupons on file, so if you have a coupon, e.g., for a brand-name medication, you need to bring it with you every time you fill it.

The first prior authorization was DENIED incredibly despite my doctor saying it \"doesn't seem wise or prudent\" to have to rapidly stop the medication.\n\nI am really blessed, so I could afford to pay out of pocket to fight with the company for 6 months, using coupons etc. while I got \"approval\" on a second prior auth. Again, I am blessed to have some medical knowledge, reasonable time, and afford to find other resources to pay. However, I KNOW FOR SURE that a lot of folks don't, and that this could have been catastrophic (I.e. couldn't get right meds - more PCP or heaven forbid ED visits which then just waste time at PCP/etc offices). This company advertises how \"great a workplace\" they are and they are \"saving money\" for companies, but all of these review are pretty clear HOW they are doing that.

I will say that it is a small pharmacy, it has that small town homey feel. The only downsides to that are the limited stock of over-the- counter products are limited and the prices here seem to be a bit higher than other pharmacies. I like that they are close to home and they have drive- thru pickup for prescriptions. That comes in handy when you just need to pick your prescriptions and don't want to bother with going inside.

I was greeted the first moment I walked in like I was appreciated as a customer.\nMy daughter takes ADHD medication, and I give part at home and send part to be given at school. I needed the medication in two different bottles and half of them cut. I haven't had to tell them again. It's done correctly, every time.\nI go there now, exclusively, for all my medications. The second time I walked in, the Pharmacist addressed me by my name. I was shocked. I was bringing in a new prescription, and I talked to him for a minute and told them I would be back to pick it up, when I was told it was ready (literally 3 minutes).\nThe Medicine Shoppe is a pharmacy that takes pride in their work and service, and far succeedes any other I've ever been to. I even recently received a letter in the mail from them thanking me for being a customer. It was typed, but was addressed to me, and hand signed by every employee and the owner, John McGuire.\nVery few businesses, operate with this kind of customer appreciation.

I have never taken the time to leave a formal complaint before, but I took the time to bring my experience to the manager\u2019s attention. I have to say I have never felt so belittled or offended by someone in a place where patience and a sense of comfort should be paramount.\n\nI called in a refill of my prescription of simple generic birth control around 2:40pm. I was informed it would be at least an hour. So, when I came by to pick it up at 5:15pm I was surprised to find my prescription was somehow at the downtown location. I was informed by the staff that it would be a 30 minute wait. This was in a clipped exchange where there was no apology or assurance. Unfortunately, my husband had to go back to work so, I told them I would pick it up tomorrow.\n\nUnfortunately, that is not the end of this story. I had time later that evening to go try again around 6pm or so. When I walked back in I actually heard them whisper and groan, \u201cIt\u2019s her\u201d. One pharmacist, a tall, thin woman with glasses, exasperatedly began to tell me just how many prescriptions they had to fill that night and how when I said tomorrow mine had been pushed back. This was my prepackaged birth control that they had in stock. I could be wrong but I am fairly certain that it only requires a print out to give it, or at least that's all I have ever seen. I was informed that they could manage it in 15 minutes, and so I waited and inquired about how to move my prescriptions.\n\nSo, I waited feeling belittled and absolutely uncomfortable. I decided if I had 15 minutes I would make a complaint to customer service. Once that was done I went on my way, but as soon as I got home and spoke to a friend she too had a series of stories about the tall pharmacist with glasses.

However, you may have gotten a compounded medication from us. May I ask if this prescription was a compound? If this was a compounded medication, we should have let you know that compounds will take at least 2 working days to make. This 2 day delay is because of the time it takes to hand make a compounded medication. Also, we are not open on the weekends, so these 2 working days may be stretched to be 4 actual days before you can pick up your compounded medication. Compounding is a very labor intensive and precise task that cannot be rushed if we are going to produce a quality medication to the exact specifications of your prescribing physician. I apologize if we failed to mention this delay when you came to fill with us. I would like to make things right by offering a $50 store credit to apply to any future purchase with us.

AND, I get text messages to remind me if it is time to refill my prescriptions! AND, I can go online to refill them! The employees there are empathetic, caring and knowledgeable!

I go here today and was told that it would be $160. Only reason being is that \"the manager chooses not to accept any coupons.\" No GoodRx or even the coupon from the website that my doctor used to send the prescription electronically. I ran out today, have to work a 10 hour shift in the morning, and I can't work without my medication. So I was basically forced to pay an extra $120. I am fuming. Who does this person think they are to not let someone use something to help them get what they need? This is one of the worst \"because I said so\" scenarios I've ever encountered. I want a refund of my $120 that was unnecessarily spent and I'm calling in a complaint to corporate.

They stock most medication that a chain-type pharmacy stocks - if they don't have it, they will have it the next day.

I found myself an Endocrinologist here after being off of all my meds for 6 months and got new labs done.  I gave the Endocrinologist my old labs Dr Campbell did and the new Dr said that Dr Campbell didn't even run the correct tests to determine I had hypothyroidism, low HGH or other low hormones!!!!  I do not have hypothyroidism or low sex hormones.

It's truly remarkable to find such a Gem amongst so much cold and igneous ruffage, splayed out into the deep horizon. Now I said brevity earlier.. And because of how good this place is, it's just hard to say less than you've read here. These people care about health and will care about you. I urge you to go here and see for your self.\n\nStandard info : they take most insurances. They have the best Pharmacy team in town and are license profesionals. They have a walk in clinic, and multiple, highly skilled and experienced doctors. GOOD DOCTORS.( I don't think I've ever seen a pharmaceutical rep trying to sway opinions in the place even once. Every other place I've been it's maddening. Big pharma is there smooozing with the decision makers... Buying lunches and giving away expensive travel packages to get them to start prescribing you some new med that's more expensive than the others that do the same thing with less side effects.) No blonde hair rolling briefcase bombshells messing with your treatment walk these halls. They are with a sense of humor that's quite good. Going in feels like visiting friends. Best bedside and counterside manner I've ever seen. highly interested and driven skilled individuals who are not only the practitioners, but also patients. These are doctors that take their own medicine. That is to say; they would perscribe treatment to themselves or their loved ones exactly as they would to you.  I am 199% convinced of their convictions, and that they know what they are talking, doing and recommending to you about health. And when they don't know something.... They don't prioritize and lean on ego, and brush off your questions, and do a hat and dance show. NO! INSTEAD: I have had a conversation like this while in treatment, \"I don't know about this area of the suggested treatments.. So let me confer with a specialist who is a friend of mine and I'll be right back. Please wait here five minutes. Would you like some water?\".\n\nSo in essence I'm saying...\n\nGO HERE!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88621353e5d2d78d:0xa892ef2a551e1ac5"}

My family and I are very grateful to have found this location and we personally drive out of our way to this pharmacy because Lisa and all the other staff are so helpful and welcoming. Another major plus is they can fill an RX in 10-15 minutes vs. our local pharmacy taking hours/days & sometimes weeks in the past.\nLisa is a great asset for CVS/Target and we hope she will always be there.

Here's 2 examples, one of the medications I take just recently had generics made available, well after having a really bad reaction to one available generic, my store ordered some from a different manufacturer, but this store lied and said that Walgreens doesn't have the ability to order a different manufacturer, so they would rather put a patient's health at risk than order a small supply from a different manufacturer. Also, I have been on a doctor ordered quarantine while I awaited my COVID-19 results, so after a telemedicine appointment, I attempted to call a d see if they could take my card information over the phone, bc my express payment was not completed before the Dr called in my medication today. Now I know we can do this bc I did this for a patient the last day I worked before my quarantine started, and yet again, another pharmacy employee lied and said that they aren't able to do this. It is ridiculous. The only employee I have personally encountered that knows what customer service positions entail is the shift lead, Donna. Every other PHARMACY EMPLOYEE at this location needs to undergo some extensive customer service training, or they need a manager that understands customer service is the most important part of retail work. After I pick up my last 2 medications from this location, I will not be back unless the manager makes some serious changes because it has just gotten worse and worse the past few months, and I'm not going to spend my money at a Walgreens chain if they can't even treat their customers with a basic respect, that I guarantee every single one of them expect when they are on the other side of the counter.

She then began to be ugly with me and hung up the phone in my face. I then called back to speak with Tim and she hung up on me again so I turn around and called back because I really wanted to let Tim know how she was treating his customers. By the way I\u2019m not the only person she\u2019s been rude to. But after the third attempt to talk to him she still refused to let me she said my manager is standing right here beside me and heard me repeat the number back then she went on to repeat the number I said that\u2019s all I wanted from you in the first place and then hung up the phone. So she lied about repeating the number I had two different people listening while I was on speaker phone talking to her. Then she was suppose to inform me when my medicine was taken care of and I never heard a word from them.

I am now giving this store a 1 star because  of employees. I guess the nice employees that were helpful and kind are gone. I was in your store today 10/28/20 between 8:30-8:45am. I needed help scanning a pack of chicken because the bar code was split and and wouldn\u2019t scan. I asked the worker managing the fast check out for help and she already gave me an attitude. She said she was the only one there and that I should have taken my things to a cashier because I had too many things. I thought the self check out lines with the long conveyor belts were for that reason and frankly I can check out myself a lot faster and can sort my groceries better. This is a worker who was rude to me before especially during the beginning of the pandemic. At that time I decided I wasn\u2019t going to shop here anymore because she was so rude. Months have gone by and I decided to give it another try.  Sometimes she\u2019s a greeter and when I come in to shop she never greets me doesn\u2019t even look my way. That\u2019s fine I don\u2019t care. But today with her rude attitude i just felt like it needed to be addressed because it makes me not want to shop here again. She fixed the problem for me  but not without complaining. Mostly complaining because she was manning the express check out alone. But no one was  checking out at the time I asked for help. She was wearing  an animal print mask and has medium length hair, older woman. I tried to see her name tag but it was flipped over and her hair was covering it. Sorry for the rant. I usually keep to myself but that was just unacceptable today. I buy A LOT from your store and you may have just lost a customer all together. Also one other woman is rude to me. She\u2019s also older with straight hair and blunt bangs. And smokes. I onlly know because I see her take her breaks by the soda machines and she\u2019s smoking. They have the same attitude. Never kind or friendly, at least when I\u2019m there. If a worker has that affect on a person where it makes them not want to shop in your store, then something\u2019s not right. Sorry.\n\n*****original review******i shop here quite a good bit and the staff is always so friendly. There is one tall, young lady who helps people at self check out who is so friendly and social. I always appreciate her. The produce department is not the greatest though, wilted greens, moldy strawberries, not fully stocked. I cook (privately for a small community) for a living and I always buy fresh, but this store isn\u2019t the best place to get any produce. Some of the bakery bread that I see at the big Walmart doesn\u2019t sell here and I wish they did. If I could 5 stars to staff only I would, but unfortunately, product is just as important.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889227464377463:0x586371779166bb58"}

I live maybe half a mile from this place and I find myself going to other stores just to avoid this poorly run establishment. Where to start? Well, the customer service is a JOKE. I think most of their employees view this place as somewhere where they can cut up, joke around, slack off,and get a paycheck. Most of them should be sent to Publix for a day or two so they can learn how employees should treat customers and maybe how to have a little civilization and manners. You don't get the \"hello sir or mam how can I help you today?\" like you would get at a Publix. At this location you get a \"what you need?\". Also, call me crazy, but I'm not big on stockers and workers walking around with pants drooping so low that their underwear is exposed, but that's common here. Other then that, the store isn't very neat and tidy. Its usually messy with misplaced items all over. The store usually doesn't come off as clean either. All I know is that I go to other Walmart Neighborhood Markets and they are night and day compared to this one and you have to ask why..In my opinion this store is a prime example as to what happens when management doesn't do their jobs and tolerates kind of a no pride attitude from their staff. Horrible store. Also, watch out for an employee named Lynn. She works in customer service and literally treats people like they're inmates and she's a corrections officer.

I've since switched to using Snider's for all of my family's prescriptions.\n\nPRICES:  I was a little worried about a local place being more expensive because surely they don't have the same buying power of the big guys.  However, to my pleasant surprise, the prices/co-pays from Snider's are in-line with the national chains and even beat the chains on some prescriptions I've gotten.\n\nIn short... I highly recommend using Snider's.  They provide top notch service with a great personal touch that you can only get from a locally owned establishment.  Give them a try, I bet you'll be as impressed as I am!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88893fa89ccc1af7:0xc96bde7f9c5f3b10"}

I was experiencing PTSD and extreme distress during my service and was admitted to this hospital\u2019s behavioral health unit twice within a year. Here\u2019s my story:\n\nThe first time I was admitted, it was voluntary...\nI was going through a lot on base, where I lived. My chain of command in the military allowed me to admit myself for a short period of time. They wanted me to get myself together and have me go back to continuing my service.\n\nThe neglect for patients here was disgusting to say the least. The staff allowed my chain of command to enter the unit without my password. They were the last people I wanted to see. I was sure that this was illegal and requested to speak to a supervisor, who told me it was my mistake for not turning them away. Being a soldier, I knew she did not understand that I could not do that and she clearly did not care about the law that her staff was breaking. This was not the only kind of neglect I witnessed/experienced. The geriatrics room was so sad. The older patients are sat down in chairs all day and night, in front of a tv. One of the older men was taken into a private room with a female tech. When they came out, he had a bloody mark on his forehead. Some of us patients noticed but felt that nobody would do anything about it. Another older gentleman in the geriatrics room died while I was there. Nobody knew the cause but he was wrapped up in a sheet and placed into a giant gray bin and wheeled away in front of all of the other patients!\n\nDuring this first stay at this hospital, there was a day where a group of student nurses were visiting to observe the staff and patients. They were observing a therapy group where the therapist was breaking HIPAA laws and verbally exposing each patient\u2019s diagnosis in front of all of the other patients, as well as the student nurses.\n\nThe second time I was admitted, I was court ordered. My command knew I was in distress and did not know what to do with me. I was sent to this hospital a second time and knew that it would not be a long stay. I was met by two giant men, telling me I have been court ordered to the psychiatric unit. I knew that something wasn\u2019t right and that the court order was not justified. This time, they admitted me to the third-floor. There were beds available on the second floor but had decided that I would be better off on the third floor. Anyone who has been to this unit, knows that the third floor is for patients with severe mental health issues... this time, there was a poster on the wall with all of the patient rights (that wasn\u2019t there before)... I read all of my rates and noticed that it said that I could request a patient advocate and a lawyer. When I approached the glass window at the desk, I requested Mary Anne, A wonderful recreational therapist that I remembered from my first stay- as well as a lawyer!... I was met with a nasty attitude and told to sit down because I was court ordered. At this point, I was panicking and angry so I threw a fit in order to get the attention of whoever was above this woman telling me to take a seat. When I got the supervisors attention, I requested that lawyer and therapist. The lawyer asked me if I had been \u201cBaker Acted\u201d but I had no idea what that meant. He pulled up my information on a computer and informed me that I had not been \u201cbaker acted\u201d and could leave anytime I wanted. I was out of there within a few hours!\n\nWhat a horrifying experience this was. The neglect and abuse here is disgusting and I would never EVER recommend anyone admit themselves to this hospital!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88928d9733f9a99d:0xdd43af3d45a5a602"}

When I poured the medicine into the dosage cup it came in up to the 5mL line I knew it looked like way more than 5 mL. So I drawled the medicine from the dosage cup up in several other droppers to see and it was actually 10mL instead of 5mL. The dosage cup that came with the medicine was way off and I could have overdosed my child if I didn't catch this. I called the number on the back of the box to let them know the dosage cup is way off to prevent other children from being overdosed and they said this has actually had a recall since back in January and they were supposed to be removed off the shelf. But Bendall's did not remove this off the shelf! It was still on the shelf and being purchased almost a year after it's been recalled!!
