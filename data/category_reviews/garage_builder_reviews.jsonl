First, they did not make the custom tarp that we requested (specifically we asked for a special front and rear flap and did not get it). They did not give us what we asked for, they gave us what they wanted to give us. This has created many problems with the loads we haul.\nSecond. We realize that there is no tarp that is puncture proof, so we state that, in comparison to other traps we have had in the past, the material of these tarps is not performing nearly as well. They do not hold up as one would reasonably expect when exposing them to standard use. Further, we have one area where the simple vibration of the straps, melted the tarp.\nThird. The strapping has ripped out in several areas. The sewing that our tarps got, was clearly below industry. This has rendered the tarps useless in areas we can no longer control with bungie cords.\nLastly, the font that they used to put our company logo on the tarps, is so cheap and so awful, you can't hardly read our company name.\nThat said, the people we worked with were kind and the tarps were completed on time. The price was fair....but given the issues we have experienced, we have decided to give the tarps away (I don't feel I can charge anyone else for these tarps) and purchase a new set. We are in to these tarps about 2 years and they have only been used to tarp about\n25 -30 loads.\nI cannot recommend this companies tarps at this time.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892ed07386fc6fb:0x3b97f43617521d8a"}

We had another issue where the trim was coming off after the storms that came thru just a few days later because the installers had not screwed it down properly or with enough screws.  when i called to tell them that it had blown off and did not have but one screw in it the owner preceded to tell me he was not responsible for wind damage.  when I told him it was not wind damage because the same carport was put up in the side yard with over twice as many screws and it was fine that the installer had not properly screwed in the trim he got mad at me and repeated his spill about wind damage.
