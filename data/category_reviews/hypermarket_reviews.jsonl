I am now giving this store a 1 star because  of employees. I guess the nice employees that were helpful and kind are gone. I was in your store today 10/28/20 between 8:30-8:45am. I needed help scanning a pack of chicken because the bar code was split and and wouldn\u2019t scan. I asked the worker managing the fast check out for help and she already gave me an attitude. She said she was the only one there and that I should have taken my things to a cashier because I had too many things. I thought the self check out lines with the long conveyor belts were for that reason and frankly I can check out myself a lot faster and can sort my groceries better. This is a worker who was rude to me before especially during the beginning of the pandemic. At that time I decided I wasn\u2019t going to shop here anymore because she was so rude. Months have gone by and I decided to give it another try.  Sometimes she\u2019s a greeter and when I come in to shop she never greets me doesn\u2019t even look my way. That\u2019s fine I don\u2019t care. But today with her rude attitude i just felt like it needed to be addressed because it makes me not want to shop here again. She fixed the problem for me  but not without complaining. Mostly complaining because she was manning the express check out alone. But no one was  checking out at the time I asked for help. She was wearing  an animal print mask and has medium length hair, older woman. I tried to see her name tag but it was flipped over and her hair was covering it. Sorry for the rant. I usually keep to myself but that was just unacceptable today. I buy A LOT from your store and you may have just lost a customer all together. Also one other woman is rude to me. She\u2019s also older with straight hair and blunt bangs. And smokes. I onlly know because I see her take her breaks by the soda machines and she\u2019s smoking. They have the same attitude. Never kind or friendly, at least when I\u2019m there. If a worker has that affect on a person where it makes them not want to shop in your store, then something\u2019s not right. Sorry.\n\n*****original review******i shop here quite a good bit and the staff is always so friendly. There is one tall, young lady who helps people at self check out who is so friendly and social. I always appreciate her. The produce department is not the greatest though, wilted greens, moldy strawberries, not fully stocked. I cook (privately for a small community) for a living and I always buy fresh, but this store isn\u2019t the best place to get any produce. Some of the bakery bread that I see at the big Walmart doesn\u2019t sell here and I wish they did. If I could 5 stars to staff only I would, but unfortunately, product is just as important.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889227464377463:0x586371779166bb58"}

I was tired, and I'm disabled.  I normally shop at other stores closer to home.  But, WalMart has a huge selection!  So, I figured I'd give them a chance.  It only took one....  \"One and DONE,\" as they say.\nI purchased a number of diet coke 2 liers, as they were on sale.  And, when I got home...the 2 liters ended up all over my driveway...rolling toward the street!  Why??  Because the person who bagged my items, apparently didn't double bag many of them!  And, GET THIS...some of the double bagged 2 liters...ALSO ended up on the driveway!  So....I grabbed some of those SAME KINDS OF BAGS...from Kroger...and rebagged them!  The SINGLE Kroger bags were much stronger than the DOUBLE Walmart bags!!  That tells me one thing...Walmart executives are IDIOTS!!!!  They purchase CHEAP bags that fall apart...to save money! Right?  But in order to keep groceries from tearing apart...their check-out people have to use THREE TIMES AS MANY!!!  Where did these idiots get their educations???  They OBVIOUSLY have ZERO COMMON SENSE!!!  As a 27 year banking executive...it blows my mind, at the shere incompetence of these people!!\nAnyway...I'm finished venting.\nAll I know is, I will NOT...be giving anymore of my money to walmart.

I live maybe half a mile from this place and I find myself going to other stores just to avoid this poorly run establishment. Where to start? Well, the customer service is a JOKE. I think most of their employees view this place as somewhere where they can cut up, joke around, slack off,and get a paycheck. Most of them should be sent to Publix for a day or two so they can learn how employees should treat customers and maybe how to have a little civilization and manners. You don't get the \"hello sir or mam how can I help you today?\" like you would get at a Publix. At this location you get a \"what you need?\". Also, call me crazy, but I'm not big on stockers and workers walking around with pants drooping so low that their underwear is exposed, but that's common here. Other then that, the store isn't very neat and tidy. Its usually messy with misplaced items all over. The store usually doesn't come off as clean either. All I know is that I go to other Walmart Neighborhood Markets and they are night and day compared to this one and you have to ask why..In my opinion this store is a prime example as to what happens when management doesn't do their jobs and tolerates kind of a no pride attitude from their staff. Horrible store. Also, watch out for an employee named Lynn. She works in customer service and literally treats people like they're inmates and she's a corrections officer.
