I'm like okay why can't you just called and told me that from the get go?! SO whatever I call for another house she told me to call back on April 1st so I did. Called back, Brenda said the same thing she going to tell the broker. a week flew by still no callback. So, I called back asking why? Brenda said that Carol son died the week before. Okay sorry for your loss but Brenda could've called back and told me so! UGH! SO finally in the middle of April I get a surprisingly phone call from Carol! Finally right.. she said she going to show me the houses the following Tuesday morning. We went to go look at two. SO Carol told us that we just 95 for the application for everybody. (me, husband, sister, her b grandma) we said okay. so we return the application in and Brenda was like we need 95 for each application!!! WTF! I called her told her what Carol had told me. She okay Ill talk to her and call you back. Oh she call me back quick this time. (of course theres money involve now) She said sorry she was under the impression that it was just me and my sister.. WTF! I just said whatever so we we paid 95 each (three application 285!) SO we got a call back on Monday from \"heather\" this time saying that we are not eligible. So I was like well  got a co signer but she insisted no. SO basically they just wanted that application money. there was no helping or anything.

While I have had (sometimes) different points-of-view with the office, they all have spoken nicely to me. When there was a big issue, Rod got involved, and he has been very professional. They provided very detailed pictures of the home upon move-in (and so any move-out issues should not be a problem). The only note about the move-in pictures is that they are small pictures without being able to see all the small details. Many of the houses (like mine) are old houses, and so that comes with old house issues just like with any property management company that deals with older homes. So if you are reasonable about your expectations and what a property management company is or is not obligated to do, then they will work with you fine. What this property management company will do is talk through things with you and come to a mutual understanding. But you need to understand the challenges of any property management company and do your part as a tenant (they have engaged every conversation and so there is no need to be argumentative; just stick to the facts and you will be fine with this company). A note about communication: if you google the property management company, then you will get different phone numbers on their google business page from their own paperwork. Make sure you are calling the office number if you want immediate attention. Also, use their website portal for faster service (their website portal is actually pretty good). I have seen improvement with customer service, especially when things got more complicated. A full 5 star experience would be difficult with ANY company who rents older homes. I have not been the easiest person to work with, and so they could have just written me off. But they did not. They got the job done. These random notes of a review stem from a complicated case that was partly due to my own personal situation of renting. In this regard, some of their work went \"above and beyond\" what you would think they had to do. So bottom line, I think they are a company worth trying out if you are looking at one of their homes online. You are required to view the home before signing the lease anyway, and so some of the reviews of others about their homes may not be as relevant to you (future tenant) since you can go see for yourself before you pay any money. I would only note since they are older homes to look in every corner, turn on every appliance, and give it a really good look. If you do your due diligence with the home before signing, then you may have a better experience than these google stars make you think. They have a regular office in Huntsville, so just stop by when you are in the area if you have any doubt.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886268a08d4865c1:0x83bfefeb2e75299b"}

I was interested in a home they had listed, but this home wasn't available for viewing until the end of the month. Linda (leasing agent) told me she would not lease a home prior to at least a FaceTime tour of the home being completed, so I had called ahead prior to submitting my application to ensure that my app was transferable to another property, if another one became available in the meantime that I liked. I was told yes, it was. Well, one popped up so I inquired about this other house. After setting up a FaceTime tour of this home, Linda e-mails me to say that I'm actually not approved for this home because it's a different price from the one I applied for (even though it's still well within the 3-3.5x rent range for my income). Oooook... I asked about a different house, and I'm initially told it's available. Great! A day later, I ask to set up the tour, and Linda says it rented yesterday.... yesterday, as in the day we discussed it and you said it was available? She also informs me that the home I originally applied for has another applicant, and that it isn't going to be available much longer if I couldn't commit to it. (Remember when Linda told me she wouldn't lease a home without completing a facetime tour? Ya, I don't know what happened to that either.) Here's the kicker, when I asked about how to get approved for a more expensive home, Linda said she wouldn't be able to do so without starting over and running my credit again, resulting in another inquiry on my credit. Two problems with this:\n\n1) Their application never ran a hard inquiry on my credit in the first place, at least not one that showed up my credit reports\n2) When I asked how long my application was valid for, she said the credit report was valid for 60 days, so that long. If the credit report is valid for 60 days, why do you need to run it again for a different price range?? The report is still valid.\n\nLong story short, I feel like I'm being mislead and given the run around, at best. Flat out lied to, at worst. I either bothered the wrong person, or they decided I wasn't an applicant they were enthusiastic about working with. My credit isn't perfect, so I could understand, but if you tell me I'm approved I expect to be treated as any other prospective tenant would. Not told after the fact that I was approved, but only for homes within a specific $50 price range that basically left me with zero options. I will be filing a complaint with the BBB.\n\nAll that said, I do like to find silver linings where I can, and I suppose that if this is they treat the people they work with and rent to, I should call it a blessing I didn't rent a home from them. Also, I gave it 2 stars because Kim (the realtor) was nice. I liked her.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886268a08d4865c1:0x83bfefeb2e75299b"}

We had problems from day one and we were misled at move out and lost some of our security deposit. If you do not read further, take one thing to heart - DO NOT TAKE MS. HAHN AT HER WORD! Make sure you get a written move out inspection or it's very likely she will do whatever the new tenants ask and take it out of your deposit.\n\nMy favorite Lynn Hahn quote was, \u201cI never do anything in writing, Josh.\u201d This was after a heated argument on the phone when I called back asking her to give me something in writing that my full deposit would be returned. She had said I would get my deposit back but refused to put it in writing. Later, she deducted money from my deposit for additional cleaning and repairs that were not based on a move-out inspection. They were based on the request of new tenants. Outrageously unethical in my opinion but apparently legal, which I found out the hard way.\n\nThe lease that was used with us is evidently heavily stacked against the tenant, which I found out the hard way through small claims court. The line about the owner/agent being required to compare move-out inspection to move-in inspection is apparently trumped by other clauses because it did not matter that she never did that style of inspection.\n\nI requested a pre-inspection after a group showing and Ms. Hahn asked me for some cleaning and other items, which I completed. When I asked about the final walk through, expecting to get a written inspection, she didn't want to do it and asked me to just drop the keys off. It was a mistake on my part to oblige. I was worried she might go back on her word and I took a ton of photos but it didn't matter.\n\nWhen the new tenants moved in they complained about some things that were not cleaned to their standards and they also complained about the condition of a few of the walls, which was patched and painted by me in multiple places but had heavy wear and tear when we moved in that I unfortunately did not document. At any rate, additional cleaning and repairs were made at the request of the new tenant and they were deducted from our deposit. This was all testified to in small claims court.\n\nDuring the trial, the new tenant was brought in and testimony of their complaints, and subsequent repairs and cleaning, were actually part of the defense. And it worked. She even admitted to not doing a paper move out inspection and from the way she said it, I don\u2019t know that she ever does a real inspection. I didn't get any explanation from the court other than a judgement saying that we had lost, but my attorney believed the lease was worded too strongly in the Owner/Agent\u2019s favor.\n\nMs. Hahn also made a false statement on the stand. She testified that she had told me the house was filthy and that I had to have it professionally cleaned during the pre-inspection, which I mentioned earlier here. This is absolutely not true. She told me to have the carpet professionally cleaned, clean the window sills, clean the laundry room floor, and paint a patch I had missed. That\u2019s it.\n\nA month later, when arguing about how she had deducted from my deposit and well after new tenants had moved in, she told me that the lease had a line for professional cleaning, something I had missed. But that was the first and only time prior to the trial that Ms. Hahn said anything about having the whole home professionally cleaned. Prior to the trial, when I had pressed for details on what needed cleaned she had mentioned something like, \u201cneeding to get a list from the [new] tenant.\u201d At the trial, though, she just said the house was filthy.\n\nThere is so much more but there\u2019s a character limit to these reviews. Our A/C was out all summer and it was such a hassle to get it fixed. When we moved in, the home wasn\u2019t cleaned even though we had made arrangements 3 - 4 weeks prior and were promised cleaning.

Appears that one of their own property managers left a five-star review.  And four of their five-star reviews come from people with the last name Hayley, same as the owner. (Maybe it's a coincidence!) It's almost funny.\n\nRead through these reviews and you'll notice a trend that explains Hayley's poor ratings everywhere: they start with poor quality and end with scamming you out of your deposit. My pregnant wife and I spent 3+ hours on our hands and knees scrubbing our rental house top to bottom before we moved out. It was far cleaner than when we moved in. We discovered $100+ was kept from our deposit because we \"didn't have it professionally cleaned\" -- which is not even a requirement of the lease. I provided photographic evidence that we cleaned up messes that Hayley had never addressed when we moved in, proving that we left the place cleaner than Hayley did. (See photos below for before and after.) Their lawyer said our photos were selective and that we were \"belittling\" their efforts -- says the person who penalized a pregnant woman for cleaning 3+ hours. Nor did Hayley specify what we failed to clean, much less photographic evidence to prove it. All this to say that Hayley appears to automatically deduct $100+ from deposits for cleaning yet doesn't use that fee to clean the place to their own supposed standards.\n\nThis was just the last of many frustrations. Ants and roaches were present when we moved in. Here too we picked up for Hayley's slack and hired exterminators. Hayley's lease requires tenants to maintain the yard but when we moved in, we discovered the yard filled with bamboo and 1+ foot of pine straw (no wonder there were bugs). We asked Hayley to fix it; they sent a maintenance crew that cut the bamboo and left everything else. I spent all week raking it up.\n\nFinally, the property was quite literally rotting on the outside. (Again, no wonder there were bugs.) The owner clearly was attempting to put as little maintenance into the property as possible. I think Hayley is coasting on the Auburn housing market, but it won't take much for a competitor to pick up their slack.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvN2eQVtoi0SQGAcfy6tyL1GD7aSxMtFDS5nyR=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSfYxcEl8eRiaOGP1OssoaPdCvsGHf96xhNusd=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvQ7HCQqySLqwzzIj8c6iqas_rXgF4NpKj9L1j=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtSfISquaxR8YozlqLVBOYJ2IUaUhwzaAYLeer=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSw48agcU-r-6MKBgRiTUjkbWGuV3PWYknDcww=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9hJgmOGevlVyoSahL4BQ_deo6QZn3dgaSywZD=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBklQXQranYZFILQmYpaAMjIxW1vyCfFpNfWYZ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzAOK_yUoBfVrwwsLXa9E_3ZhjPWJLrS4lTy7U=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8VVTgat3HNyRvPJzk4vn_CiHKXSqBNHgsBTQA=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf38d2b54ee29:0x30062a908557f332"}

Instead two years later we have reports from an environmental mold specialist ongoing us that the upstairs and room beneath where water leaked is covered in black mold.

Haley was paid to do a job and clearly did not. My guess is because they knew we would not be extending our contract at the end of those four months when our sons moved in.

The size and location weren't bad for the price, and the one time pet fee made having a dog in college actually plausible. Unfortunately, that was pretty much all Hayley got right.\n\nThe yard was always a mess, with massive patches of dead grass and poor irrigation that caused the yard and our sidewalk to flood whenever it rained. There was also an issue where the owner of our property had requested that Hayley not sign anyone to a lease after our first lease ended so that he could sell the property, but Hayley signed us to a second lease anyway. This lead to confusion between us and the owner over whether we would be able to even live there the next year at a point in the year were most properties in town were already taken.\n\nHowever, the worst offense was their predatory security deposit handling. During our second lease, our new owners would visit often and always thanked us for taking such good care of the property. On moving out, we followed Hayley's checkout list in full and left the place better than we found it. Despite all this, instead of getting our security deposit back, we received a bill stating we owed $1600 in damages BEYOND what our security deposit covered.\n\nWe were surprised to hear this based on how we kept the property, so we requested proof of the damages we were being charged for from Hayley. We were told that we would have to schedule an appointment for that, but any subsequent attempts to schedule an appointment were ignored.\n\nFunnily enough, a friend in the same neighborhood who also rented from Hayley received a very similar bill upon moving out and has had the same experience in being ignored.\n\nIt seems as though Hayley's strategy is to scare young tenants out of their security deposits by asking for a ridiculous amount of money and then silently slinking off with an extra month's rent. To make things worse, this money isn't being used to clean or renovate the properties either, if the state of our property when we moved in is any indication.\n\nSo in summary, just avoid this company. Don't be fooled by the reviews here (if you look closely, almost all of the good reviews are years old with no comments and the recent reviews are much more scathing).

If your question regards anything dealing with money, you will unfortunately never receive an answer. However if you're looking for a job though, I would highly recommend trying to become a manager for Haley Management. This is because every time you ask to speak to a manager the receptionists say that they are on \"vacation\". Sometimes they can be on \"vacation\" for weeks at a time. So if you're looking for a job that pays you to do nothing at all and gives you more paid vacation time than any business around, being a manager at Haley Management could be the right job for you.

I first want to state HMC was very point blank and aggressive and I find them to be unreasonably rude, making use threats and unnecessary means of manipulation to obtain rent EVEN THOUGH I WAS READY AND WILLING TO MAKE A PAMENT. After a recent Identity theft and a severe life threatening illness that left me homebound for several months I was very hesitant to send large amount of money to a company that I had never heard of. All this happened over text message too at that, though they Implied that I(who have had a great rental history prior to my current very difficult landlord) \"Had just been ignoring them and they had been trying to make contact\". All their problems were my fault. They show absolutely no desire and put forward effort to make my rent payment easy to make, just threats. even after the check I wrote them was RETURNED TO ME DUE TO SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY. Excuse my language but i didn't even know where the goddam office was. This is an inexpensive company that at the moment appears to care nothing at all about about the well being of their tenants. This is just a personal note, but I can give the impression of that of a low income person in trouble (when in reality that was not the case) and I get the impression that this company has been using the fear and threat of security as a means manipulate their \"less desirable\" clientele regularly for some time now. they seem very practiced. My advice, don't do business with people who use fear as a business model. I will be living my very well enjoyed home to work with a company that values my business and perhaps more importantly, value me as a human worthy of respect.

My daughter lived at this apartment complex for two years. When we got the house assignment before my daughter moved in they had completely changed the type house that my daughter had agreed to rent. Then they said directed me to the place in the least small print where it says they can switch you to any unit they please. There was nothing we could do about it. While we were in the unit the hot water heater was replaced going to a gas hot water heater and because the gas was in my name they charged the hot water heater to my account. It was charged to my gas account and debited out of my checking account, $1800 without my permission. I had to wait three months to be reimbursed and I also had to wait on a coupon from the gas company to be reimbursed. We could not wait to get out of there.\n\n\u2014\u2014I did receive a phone call a few days after posting my review from the corporate office about my negative review. I want to clarify that Spire didn\u2019t charge my account without the On-site management people at Creekside letting the gas company into the home. I nor my daughter was there to let them in and the only people that authorized the charge and transaction was Creekside and Creekside refused to call Spire and correct the problem by billing them or the owner of the condo. Also, the small print indicating they could and did switch the unit that we wanted is a fact and an issue that future tenants need to understand. It makes you realize that they could and did show a nice unit in the style, location, and price and switch you to whatever they want.  They placed our daughter in a unit that was at the entrance to the community, high traffic, high noise, and her Eno was stolen off the tiny porch the first week.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1611094898192, "text": "Hi Mrs. Stanfield!

It blows my mind that people write about how the staff is unprofessional and rude. I promise those reviews are people who broke the rules in the neighborhood and were held accountable for their actions. I want to say just how beautiful the houses all are. There is a huge grass area for your pups to play! But most importantly, no matter what issues arose, regarding the neighborhood, my house, other residents, you name it, Kristen went so far ABOVE and beyond to be the most genuinely caring person. She is the sweetest manager you will ever meet. She didn't have to do 99% of what she did for me while I lived there and I can never say thank you enough for the staff of Creekside. Truly a luxury living environment. I spent a couple years living here and never regret it for a minute!! If you are looking for a place to live Fall or Spring you have to look at Creekside or you'll miss out BIG time! Also shout out to Charlie in the front office for helping Kristen pack my WHOLE house and move it to my new unit for me while I was abroad.

Some of it is good, some of it is bad, some of it could go either way depending on what you want out of a place to live, and some of it is just unavoidable as it is targeted to college students.\n\nSome aspects of the property are really nice. The clubhouse is pretty nice (though the weight room is a joke; I don't know why any Auburn student would use it instead of the top notch campus facility). The common areas are generally well-maintained. I say generally because while the landscaping is kept up, the gates are not. I've been trying to get my name added to the call box for three years and it still hasn't happened, yet I know residents that moved out years ago still in the list.  The gates are frequently broken and they keep nobody out. If someone wants to get in, they will get in. They will simply wait for someone to open the gate and go in after them. If you are going to be a \"gated community\" then be a gated community. In my opinion, Creekside should just get rid of the gates because they really don't accomplish anything except annoy the residents.\n\nCreekside does not tow. This could be good or bad depending on your point of view. I never had an issue with parking. On busy football weekends, perhaps I'd be 10-12 spots away from my front door but that was about the extent of it. However, other parts of the complex may not have quite as abundant parking so that could be an issue. I'm really not sure. It was nice to not have to deal with visitor passes, etc. but it would be very frustrating if there wasn't enough parking near your home.\n\nCreekside does not enforce many of its own rules. The one that really annoys me is the pool. It is supposed to be limited to residents and residents are allowed two guests I believe. What it ends up being is tons of people who might know one person in Creekside... or in some cases just show up without knowing anyone. I pay good money to live in a place like this and don't feel like my money should be going to clean up after non-residents who break chairs, leave beer cans and bottles strewn about, etc. Some would say I'm a party pooper... but I like to think of it as being irritated by trespassing. People (many times non-residents) bring beer bottles and dogs to the pool routinely... both are supposed to be fineable offenses... but I've never seen one handed out.\n\nMaintenance is a mixed bag, but mainly poor. To get a broken door repaired, it took about a dozen phone calls over a two month period. Simply absurd. I also reported a broken toilet two different times. Once, it was repaired promptly. The other time... I was told they'd be out there \"in the next couple of days\" and nobody ever came. After about a week, I fixed the toilet myself. Also, I should point out that *OWNERS* are occasionally treated as second-class citizens by the on-site management. Essentially, the homeowner's dues should get me the same rights as the renter's... but when I file a maintenance issue that is supposed to be covered by the HOA dues, they handle all renters first... I guess to make sure they get people to resign because they know the homeowner is unlikely to sell because of a small issue like this. Or, in the vast majority of cases, it isn't the actual homeowner who lives in the house; It is often the parent of one of the residents who probably never even hears about the issue.\n\nThe last issue I have is with the TV/Internet Service. It has been nothing short of awful the entire time I've lived here. In 2015, I don't think people can really appreciate just how bad I have had it and what a negative it is. The internet is slow, often less than 1 megabit/second so forget about streaming Netflix during peak hours; You'll be lucky if you can just get a YouTube video to play in 240p, nevermind HD.\n\nAll in all, it is a decent place to live. You could definitely do a lot worse. I think I'd rather pay for a location closer to campus rather than the resort style amenities, but that is personal preference.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1586452516041, "text": "Thank you for the valuable information"}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c3710357e3:0xc8afc14b7cb32308"}

Oftentimes people who come to the pool don\u2019t even know anyone in the complex (I have no idea how they get in). Adding to their being unwelcome is the fact that they, along with actual residents, throw empty beer cans and cigarettes into the pool, making it disgusting and completely unable to be used.\n\nCreekside also advertises itself as a gated community. Unlike other gated complexes, however, Creekside uses a barcode scan system, which is usually broken. Thus the gates are open 24 hours a day, including weekends. If the gates are closed and the scanner is broken, there is no code to open the gates, which led to three broken gates because of cars driving through them in the year that I lived there. Why they chose a system with no backup way to get in is beyond me.\n\nCreekside is a magnet for irresponsible students who love to party loudly. I did not understand how there could be such a high concentration of people with such habits, but then I discovered that much of Creekside\u2019s advertising involves half of drink specials for residents and other alcoholic incitements. There were obnoxiously loud parties that could be heard two rows of houses over and up the street nearly every weekend and even on weekdays. These parties were rampant with underage drinking and lasted until four a.m. or later. The courtesy officer never picks up his phone, so the police usually come. This is an inconvenience and an annoyance for the officers, especially since Creekside hired someone who is supposedly responsible for taking care of such noise disturbances.\n\nThe Internet is abysmal, and it is nearly impossible to get someone to come out and fix it. Our Internet didn\u2019t work for three months, and the management refused to give us a refund on the portion of our rent that went toward cable and Internet.  They also refused to let us get our own router.\n\nManagement threatens to fine its residents constantly, but never follows up; therefore, what looks like a beautiful complex from outside the gates is full of porches that are littered with beer cans, cigarettes, trash, and beer pong tables. Any complaints about the state of the porches will go unnoticed.\n\nAll in all, Creekside is a place for rich kids whose parents don\u2019t care if they drink excessively underage and blow off classes in the morning due to a midweek party.

I have never once written a review like this, I have worked in Customer Service for almost 10 years, and I always give benefit of doubt.  In this case, Walton and Tower absolutely deserves this review:\n\nI recently moved from Kansas to Alabama for work, and due to the Pandemic, could not travel to view homes prior to my relocation.  My family helped tour properties, and I saw pictures and videos to help make my decision.  The home I found in Odenville, AL looked amazing from the initial pictures. Walton and Tower Real Estate made many promises that the house would be in \u201clike-new\u201d condition by the time I arrived. So I loaded up a 26\u201d U-Haul, signed a lease and headed to Alabama. My nightmare started the day I walked through the doors for the very first time.\n\nPrior to leaving a rental property, it is a standard that the property be professionally cleaned/repaired/painted prior to another tenet moving in.  Every time I move out of a property, I pay to have a professional group clean it, out of my pocket. I was given assurances by Walton that this would all be handled prior to my arrival, especially given my situation.  To my shock, it was a mess.  During a Global Pandemic, this company did not have the house professionally cleaned or sanitized in any meaningful way.  Here are just a few examples of things I had to deal with on my first night (before I could even start to unpack):\n-\tThe ceiling fans had a half an inch of dust on every arm (hard to miss even for an amateur cleaning company).\n-\tHUMAN HAIR in the bathtubs and floors.\n-\tFood particles and stain in the microwave, and on the cooking surfaces.\n-\tThe counters in the kitchen were sticky with grease, food, and god knows what else.\n-\t All the Stainless-Steel appliance surfaces had stains.\n-\tTONS of dust above the fridge, cabinets, edges, fans, and several surfaces throughout.\n- The kitchen/bathroom floors had not been mopped, one pass with my Swiffer mop and the pad was solid black.\n-\tSpiderwebs still hanging in the breezeways inside the house.\n-\tThe worst part was the carpets, walking on it in socks you could feel your feet sticking to sections of it.  Gallons of black SLUDGE filled my own personal carpet cleaner after running it in only one room of the house.  The carpets had NOT been cleaned.\n\nThe house was disgusting, and the reaction of W&T was even more disgusting. In this Global Pandemic, cleanliness matters\u2026 I spent hours scrubbing surfaces, carpet cleaning, mopping, and using specialized cleaning products on every corner of the house.  One wipe with just a damp paper towel would pick up handfuls of dust and grim.\n\nWhen I called the management group for help, their response was nothing short of inappropriate, I did NOT get a callback, but instead an EMAIL saying they found the cleaning of the home to be \u201csatisfactory\u201d. Imagine you go to the hospital to have surgery, and afterwards you wake up and the doctor tells you, \u201cWell, I didn't do everything I was supposed to, but I think I did a satisfactory job\u201d,  no one would be happy with that result.  I have given this company multiple chances to help in any way to fix this issue, and at every turn they have either ignored my requests, or shrugged me off as a \"difficult\" tenet ONE WEEK IN.

Both this review and reply are being written after only two weeks of occupancy of the house. As mentioned, the tenant had multiple family members view the house prior to leasing. Both emails and phone calls have resulted in threats by the tenant to harm our business after a demand for cash was made. We do not \u201cpay off\u201d tenants to keep them from leaving negative reviews. We are sincerely sorry for the overlooked dust above the refrigerator and on ceiling fan blades, but we do not believe that these items show a lack of concern for tenant safety during the pandemic as is asserted in this review.\nWhile we believe things like streaky stainless steel are subjective, timely payment of rent is not. It is part of a binding lease agreement-signed by both property manager and tenant. The first two rent payments due from the tenant were late resulting in $215 in late fees. As the tenant seemed to be unclear about the terms of the lease he signed, we initially refunded the fees as a one-time courtesy only to receive emails threatening to contact the property owner or \u201chandle himself\u201d if he was not given money for what he deemed an unsatisfactory cleaning. He made good on those threats with the above review. We do not pay off tenants. We made efforts prior to his arrival to make for an easy transition by arranging for the key to be at the house rather than being picked up from our office as is standard procedure, fielded calls from family members about matters that had been responded to days before and again, waived late fees that were a result of a failure to comply to a binding lease agreement. As mentioned by the tenant, we also had someone from our office go to the house to discuss his complaints in person.\nWe cannot find reason where none exists.

I have been renting with them for around 14 months now. If you qualify and meet their standards they are wonderful to work with. If you are paying your rent in full and on time, they will go above and beyond to meet your needs. However, if there is an unexpected life turn, even notifying them will not help. I was laid off at work and could no longer afford the rent. Even their qualifications say that you must make 3x the rent in a months time. I now make less than 2x the rent. I notified them of my life changes thinking that was right thing to do, but as I had forgotten, just remember they have a contract in place and that is what they will go by like any other business. They are still a great company despite my disagreements and misunderstandings on some of their business practices, but if are going into renting with them knowing there is even a possibility of financial changes in your life, I would not recommend them.\n\nAdding in response to owners reply. They did offer me release option, but ultimately that is continuing to pay the rent in full as usual until it is released, sold, or until end of your lease (which ever comes first). This is extremely risky option for someone who cannot afford the rent in the first place. Can\u2019t afford their rent, but they want you to pay two rents while waiting for them to find another person to lease. Great idea guys. Even when I offered to pay 3 months rent, plus them keeping deposit to end lease ( 6400 total).  They claim they can get it leased in a month or two (3200 total) so why not take the 6400 total and let me go? Hmmm, wonder if it\u2019s because they cannot/ or don\u2019t try to immediately lease it out??? Just a thought. You have to move out before they will begin to show, again paying two rents. Not a great option when I cannot afford their rent, so no that\u2019s not helpful as he claims. Not sure how that helps me at all as they are \u201chelping me out of a bad situation\u201d. And I have signed and returned the release option papers, so I am unaware of what that is about. I even got confirmation emails they were received, which I am happy to provide to anyone showing the dates of his post vs the dates of the emails. Also, I highly doubt I am the only person that has gotten frustrated from being in a financially binding situation, so not sure how that deems me the most difficult with this type situation. Again, great company, until you are in a financial situation where you cannot make rent.\n\nUpdate on this (today 7/30/19), as if the owner below saying I did not sign and return the forms in June wasn\u2019t enough, just got a call saying they did not have the forms (supposedly) and could not process anything. I told them I had email confirmation that all forms were received and would be glad to forward that over. Was told that worker was on maternity leave and they could not access email to get the forms. Not sure how that\u2019s my problem??? But sure, I\u2019ll redo everything again since you cannot properly arrange cover while employees are out on leave. \ud83d\ude04", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1561389386223, "text": "Cindy,\nThank you for clarifying the fact that we hold renters to the agreement that they signed.

We didn't file a police report as there was no evidence that a break in had actually occurred. When Rudulph repaired it and didn't charge us, we thought there was no issue, since nowhere in our lease did it indicate a police report would be necessary.

Upon speaking with Mr. Rudulph, this was how they recouped their investment in the door repair.

We were hopeful that Ms. Jefferson would appreciate our efforts advocating for her even though she was legally responsible to pay this owner. We value integrity, and we honor our established guidelines, signed agreements, and thorough Move-Out process.  It\u2019s unfortunate when a former tenant doesn\u2019t take responsibility for minor items and subsequently tries to damage a business with an alias account on an unregulated review platform. The only way to combat such reckless libel is to give readers access to the facts.\n\nAs for the move-out charges, we provided Ms. Jefferson an itemized deposit record per our agreed upon lease agreement. Despite our right to charge $279.88 to Ms. Jefferson for minor damages and cleaning, we advocated to the owner on Ms. Jefferson\u2019s behalf to allow us to refund her $250 deposit. This property owner ONLY made an exception with this specific tenant\u2019s deposit because of her long term tenancy.\n\nCopy and paste this link to view the documents (https://goo.gl/7rV1Tf), which include the 4th page of the lease with the applicable areas highlighted, the move-out form with photos, the original deposit letter, and the final adjusted tenant ledger.  A review of this information shows we were justified under the lease to make these charges. It is a farce for Ms. Jefferson to think the threat of a frivolous lawsuit \u2013 and not our intervention \u2013 was the reason she obtained any refund at all.\n\nOur goal as a property management company is to have both satisfied owners and tenants, which sometimes puts us in a difficult position. We do not operate any facet of our business arbitrarily (for \"no reason at all\"); our reasons and policies are factual and transparent and are found in our lease agreement. We are saddened to hear that even after we advocated for Ms. Jefferson she still chose to leave such poor feedback. However, she stayed with us for over 3 years and renewed early each year \u2013 which is some testament to our good service, a point unmentioned in her review.\n\nCustomer satisfaction is very important to us, and we are disappointed we could not resolve this situation more amicably."}, "gmap_id": "0x888602ebf9152bd9:0x85412d49794a4d9"}

The previous tenants said the mold is the reason they left. The house is not properly sealed so all types of bugs get into the house. My latest issue is my AC unit. I\u2019ve been without AC going on 3 days now. According to my lease this meet the criteria for an emergency. The only response I get from their customer service line (which I\u2019m convinced is not in the U.S.) is someone has been dispatched. PLEASE save your money and rent somewhere else!

I rented a 3/2 house in April.  1 bathroom is unusable due to the fact that their plumber plumbed it incorrectly. I had raw sewage running in my backyard from May til the middle of July.  When I first moved in NONE of the bathrooms worked properly.  Flush the toilet & it all came back up into the sink and tub.  After many emails begging & then threatening, they sent out a plumber who took the cap off the cleanout.  When I complained to him about it his response was \"Lady, sometimes you have to choose if you want it to back up into your house or into your yard.\"  NO AC vents in one bedroom or the only working bathroom.  The only \"working\" bathroom is plumbed incorrectly & my toilet tank fills with hot water.  On July 9, I put in a service request because my AC stopped working on half of the house.  No one has been here yet & it is July 22.  NO ONE answers your calls.  Sherry Floyd in maintenance will respond to emails & she seems to try as hard as she can but apparently, her hands are tied. I had broken windows when I moved in, paint all over the floors & windows, cracked bathtub, no shelves in the pantry or linen closet - making them useless.  Half of the electrical outlets don't work, cheap plastic faux wood flooring is popping up in every room.  Windows painted.  They even installed the kitchen cabinets doors backwards & I couldn't use two of them. New stove in the kitchen...not installed because the plug didn't fit the cord so they just left it sitting there.  I had to go out & buy a new cord so I could use the stove.  Ground level windows had no locks on them, I had to buy & install those.  Sliding doors don't lock, I have to use a pole. Most unresponsive company EVER.  It's obvious that the only thing they care about it getting your rent every month.  They couldn't care less if the house is habitable or not.  You might ask \"if it was that bad, why did you rent it?\"  To which I would respond:  I honestly thought it would all be taken care of before I moved in because the leasing agent assured me that it would & they had two weeks in which to do it before I took possession.

I only leave reviews on google to warn people and give them a heads up of what could happen so the same thing that happen to me dnt happen to other. We rented a house from Alabama Rental mid January of this year and moved out mid April. The first day we start moving boxes in the floors immediately start to come up, one of the toilets wouldn't work, one of the tubs didn't drain properly and the sink in the bathroom was clogged up. My husband texted the maintenance man with a list of issues, he came out but only the floors was fix. The maintenance man said the house should have been gutted. The pipes had black roots in it that did not get fixed and we didnt get a new toilet we was only able to use one of the bathrooms but thats not the reason why im writing this review. Im writing this review because I do not like to be played with. We was only at the home for 3 month we had to leave to come to Virginia since my husband renewed his contract with the army and is active duty. When we received our deposit back they had the nerve to take out 450 dollars just for paint, thats a whole house worth of paint they only should have took out enough  for one gallon of paint for the 3 months we was there the walls was fine. I have called the pass few days talked to two different people they said they was going to tell the property manager to get in contact with me still haven't heard anything back cause I need to know when we left the home what repairs was they doing with my money cause I was told by someone in that neighborhood they was working on the outside and inside of the home. I believe they using some of my deposit money to fix the issue that was supposed to have been fixed before we moved in and saying its paint just because it was some small scuffs on the wall from the furniture. Since you can reply to other Google reviews call me ASAP cause I need my money.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1625618504158, "text": "Hi Mrs. Marbury, I was able to speak with your husband today about this.

When a work order is reported they NEVER respond. They write the order off as if they have completed it. Our toilet has been running for months. My wife and I have put in work order after work order. While our upstairs bathroom has continued running the pipes under it have also been leaking. The pipes leaked to the point in which the ceiling fell in under the toilet. We again reported it. The company stated that they would send some one out for the order. This was Thursday June 24th. I called them back on Friday, June 25th. Again they stated that they would once again send another worker out. Friday passes by still no response. On this date June 28th this matter still has not been resolved not even a telephone call. This company does not care about their tenants they only care the rent at the end of the month. I would not recommend them to my worst enemy if they were homeless and thanks to the runny toilet in which I reported months ago, my water bill is now $750 for the activity of the previous month, but guess who is not going to care? Thats right Alabama Rental Property. Customer Service is not valued by this company. They only care about the dollar at the end of the month. If you consider this place to do business with, please do not waste your time and do business elsewhere.\n\nEdit: what a joke.

I have been renting properties for 10+ years and never had such a terrible experience. I viewed a property I thought I wanted to rent and spoke to a leasing agent about some maintenance issues I was concerned with due to being handicap. I was assured the issues would be fixed prior to moving in  (2+ weeks lead time - and yes its written in the work order to be completed prior to move in) and I trusted their word and went through with the approval process/lease signing. THIS WAS MY FIRST MISTAKE. After signing the lease I went to the property to retrieve the key. Upon arrival I noticed the repairs were not done and there was now more damage to the property. I took pictures, sent them to the leasing agent, called the offices, and never got responses from anyone. I then waited 4 more days over a holiday weekend and started calling first thing the following Monday to try and speak to someone. After several attempts of communication I received NO RESPONSE. I still have not moved in any of my belongings and am in limbo. Finally when someone came out to \"fix the issues\", only one issue was fixed which was a lock on the garage door BUT NO KEY WAS LEFT FOR ENTRY nor was a knob even placed on the door, just a dead bolt? This is when I finally got a text saying the work order had been completed. I still to this day have not been given a key to access the garage. I then finally received a call Monday night at 5PM from someone who I had never spoken to before. I discussed with her the many issues I had and asked if we could terminate this agreement all together. At this point I had paid $2400 for a deposit and first months rent and felt this company had done nothing that was agreed upon. I did not even move one belonging to the property!  This company had created a very uneasy feeling with me and I realized I had made a big mistake by putting my name on a lease with them. The house was not even cleaned prior to my \"move in\" date even with the covid pandemic!  The woman assured me someone would call be back the following day with an answer to my concerns. I just received the call from someone who did not identify herself. She told me the company was not responsible for providing locks or a knob on the garage door but they did so any way and that the other repairs would be completed today. (oh gee, thanks.. still can't get in there without the key...) and that they were in no way willing to work with me on terminating this lease.  I asked for the contact info for an attorney to contact them and she told me she would email me and quickly ended the phone conversation. Its been over an hour and no email or further contact from the company. PLEASE STAY AWAY!!!! After much research on the company I have now found out that one of the only good reviews on here is a review from AN EMPLOYEE. This company is misleading and dishonest. STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS. I will update this post with pictures soon. SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bcf4c4c5ce9:0xba28af18b1516380"}

I understand that the office team is all currently working from home (I presume, because the office is closed), however, the lack of communication is very frustrating. The tenant relations manager helped us get through the lease signing process and was very helpful with my questions. We were told that the day we signed our lease we had appliances ordered; they were scheduled to be delivered on the 21st and the movers would call us to set up a time. The appliances have not been delivered, nor has anyone contacted us for an update on our appliances. I have reached out to both ARP staff that I've been in contact with, and neither have responded. I ended up contacting another leasing agent by mistake (a post was made on their FB page with a different number for my leasing agent than the phone number I already had, but turns out it's a mis-type and the number is actually for a different agent), and this agent has been very swift and courteous with responding to me.\n\nOn top of that (lack of communication and no appliances), this past weekend, while attempting to install our internet service, we discovered that our home is not equipped with a coax cable outlet. The outlet is needed to hook-up the modem for our internet service. I placed a maintenance request to have some one come install the outlet (surely previous tenants have had internet), and I was just notified that my service request was denied.

I've been told numerous times that certain properties are available and once I apply, then I'm told the home is no longer available.  I feel it would be better for business to update your list of available properties right away, once you receive a deposit for the home, that way it's very clear to the customer what's available and what's not.  The whole process of having to upload your picture ID would be fine if your system worked every time but I feel like when the system doesn't work there should be a second option available to access the homes, like texting a link to the potential renter so once they arrive at the home they can give the lockbox code and be able to access the home. It's very stressful looking for a decent place for your family to live and you would think your agents would be more compassionate.  Also, majority of your homes have bad landscaping, it's like you all don't think it's important for the yards to look presentable.   I hope someone will read this and address these issues. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only customer that feels this way.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bcf4c4c5ce9:0xba28af18b1516380"}

I REPEAT, DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY NO MATTER WHAT THEY TELL YOU! I have been renting for almost a year now. You CANNOT get in touch with them, they DO NOT return phone calls. I don\u2019t think there is a maintenance staff because they never respond to any maintenance requests thru the online portal. Once you sign that 2 year lease they don\u2019t care about you and will do everything possible to avoid you and take your money.\n\nEDIT: I am updating my review to once again say that this company has the worst maintenance I have experienced. The maintenance request phone number goes to a third party call center agent who can do nothing except create a work order for you (which is exactly what you can do yourself through your tenant portal). You can\u2019t get in contact with anyone from the rental office, and if you call the leasing office they won\u2019t help you and give you the same call center number. Our house looked nice upon viewing, but after moving in we realized how poorly the house was \u2018redone\u2019. There was a leak in my roommate\u2019s ceiling that has grown mold for the last 6 months. She has called and put in multiple work orders. It has taken months to finally get someone to come look at it... someone finally came out to take measurements. The man had no mask or any kind of protective gear upon entering. However, I didn\u2019t want to turn him away because it has been such a huge process getting them out here. They are finally going to fix this issue next week. They will respond in the maintenance portal asking if our issues have been resolved when no one has contacted us or followed up. In February we had a pipe bust and were without water for 2 days with no response from anyone about scheduling an appointment. I went to the office and waited until I could speak with someone in person. They finally sent someone out that afternoon. The man told me he was going to come back whenever the pipe was finished drying and check to make sure everything was working properly. He never came back. I highly suggest you do not rent from these people unless you just enjoy your house falling apart.\n\nEDIT AGAIN: I can only leave one review so I\u2019m just going to have to continue on this excessive list, but I am horrified at the thought of anyone renting from these people and going thru what I have gone thru. After 6 months of a ceiling mold issue being reported they finally sent a contractor on July 23 to \u2018fix\u2019 it. Whoever they sent literally hacked into and destroyed a huge chunk of my roommate\u2019s bedroom wall. He ripped apart the ceiling and the drywall and discovered that the mold was worse than expected and there was fire damage all over the inside of the wall (from a previous house fire). He couldn\u2019t determine where all of the mold was due to the fire damage. After an entire day of ripping the wall apart and spraying toxic fumes around, he told us that he wasn\u2019t able to finish because the landlord didn\u2019t accept his bid (??). Whatever that means, we were left with the wall/ceiling open to the attic and mold exposed. After leaving voicemails and calling excessively, they sent a different contractor to come fix it. My roommate moved back to Huntsville to her parents house because it wasn\u2019t livable... I had to find places to stay and for our pets to go for a week while this guy came out everyday to \u2018work\u2019. That Friday he said that he would be back on Monday because it wasn\u2019t an emergency! It took another week to complete the job. Every day that he came to the house he would leave for hours at a time saying he needed to get things from Home Depot. I came home one day from work (he had been working at the house with no one there), my front door was wide open and he wasn\u2019t here. He had left to go get things..was gone for who knows how long and didn\u2019t lock or shut the front door. He said \u2018sorry can\u2019t believe I did that!\u2019. These people DO NOT CARE AT ALL.

Still, they were unable to find the source of this black mold and said that it would continue to come back. When my friend brought this matter to the property manager (Amanda\u2019s) attention she was very rude and dismissive about the entire situation. My friend then asked Amanda if there was a way that they could switch him to a different property or let him out of the lease and she was completely against this idea and refused to offer any kind of help or understanding of the situation. So then my friend threatened to get a lawyer and that\u2019s when Amanda said that he couldn\u2019t prove that there was ever any black mold in the home and that she was never told about the findings. Which was completely false because she was fully aware of all mold found. My friend took pictures of the black mold and sent them to her along with a recording of the inspector claiming that it was black mold, that it would eventually return, and that they couldn\u2019t find the source. Amanda then claimed that my friend couldn\u2019t prove that the recording was of the inspector and his conversation and that the pictures didn\u2019t prove it was black mold, even though you could clearly see that it was. She then proceeded to tell my friend that she could start the eviction process for him if he would like. Now guys this entire time that he is living in this house with black mold he also had his newborn daughter and two other young daughters living in the house with him and they were aware of this, as well. Not to mention, the hot water wouldn\u2019t work in one of the bathrooms, the basement flooded every time it rained, the floors were uneven, warped, and soft in places, the main breaker box would start  surging and sparking, and flip for no reason, the dryer plug didn\u2019t work when he moved in so he had to replace it, most of the windows in the home would not raise properly, the toilets would become backed up very easily, neither of the tubs would want to drain at times, and they would send people out when the request was put in but they would quickly and cheaply fix the problems so the issues would happen again and frequently. It\u2019s bad when you are asked to pay 1075$ a month and can\u2019t even be comfortable in your home. Two months was all he was there for and he had issue after issue after issue until the day he was evicted.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bcf4c4c5ce9:0xba28af18b1516380"}

That\u2019s not the case. We\u2019ve been in this home for two months and have had the following issues:\n1. The access code we were given to get the key was incorrect. We waited 4 plus hours on maintenance to come and they didn\u2019t show up. We were able to get the key because the leasing agent provided us with a code.\n2. About a week after moving in & getting keys made, maintenance changed the locks and didn\u2019t notify us. I sat outside for an hour, thinking my key somehow was damaged and no longer working. I finally decided to try the key safe and there were new keys.\n3. We did not have hot water because there was something wrong with the hot water heater. It took them days to come out. I had to call Amanda, Rebekah, and some other lady who was supposed to be Amanda\u2019s superior SEVERAL times and email them as well. They NEVER called back. It took probably 5 emails and a dozen calls before Amanda finally responded to the emails.\n4. Right now, he electrical outlets do not work in the kitchen, bathroom, and part of the living room. We put in the service request 10 days ago and no one has even acknowledged it. We\u2019ve been running an extension cord so we can atleast keep our fridge on. There is no sense of urgency and they could use a tenant liaison. For all we know there could be some serious electrical issues.\n\nAvoid Alabama Rental Property at all costs. The leasing agents are pleasant, but that\u2019s their job\u2014 to show you homes and get you to sign a lease. After you sign, the ball gets dropped.

It is the Buyers responsibility to obtain a copy of the covenants for a neighborhood and to understand them before purchasing.  The Realtor typically provides these to the Buyer.  Once we are made aware of the purchase and the new owners contact information, we send a welcome packet in the mail that includes the covenants.  We also provide an Owner Portal that has all of the Association documents for owner to access.  Spaces is not \"pocketing money from everyone\".  Spaces is paid a set Management Fee by the Association to handle all of the management and administrative tasks for the Association to operate.  This includes paying all Association bills, working with and overseeing vendors, answering Owner, Realtor, lender, and closing attorney questions, creating financials statements, reconciling the bank accounts, administering quarterly and annual meetings, etc.  The annual budget is set by the Board of Directors and is then presented to all Owners to vote to ratify at the Annual Members Meeting.  Spaces then operates the Association within that budget for the year.  Spaces provides regular financial statements to the Board, and approved financial statements are available to all Owners.

For those who do not want restrictive covenants where they live, we recommend looking for homes located in the county or finding a neighborhood that does not have restrictive covenants."}, "gmap_id": "0x8888a83230c148df:0xaac2293f184926e6"}

We did not write them, but they do create a fiduciary responsibility for the Board to make sure they are enforced, which is what we are hired to do.  We cannot speak to how the Association was operated previously, but a primary reason we are hired is to provide covenant enforcement for Associations.  If someone is considering purchasing a home in an Association we manage, they can expect an Association that operates within the budget set by the Board of Directors and ratified by the Members.  They can also expect the restrictive covenants to be enforced in a fair and compassionate way.  We always send a friendly letter for each first time violation to make the owner aware of the covenant violation and provide a timeframe to correct the violation.  This friendly letter results in 95 percent of the violations being corrected.  In the cases where the violation is not corrected, we do have a set policy that is equally enforced to bring the property into compliance.  The majority of violation letters we send are a result of a neighbor reporting the violation to us for enforcement.  By having a set system, it allows neighbors to be neighbors without having to get into demanding compliance with restrictive covenants.  We facilitate that process for the Board and neighbors.

Spaces Management is a third party manager for the individually owned units at Midtown. Our goal is to provide the upmost customer service and respond in a timely manner to all requests. All units are inspected and photographed prior to move in to document the condition of the unit before occupancy. A second inspection is conducted during the residents tenancy to document the condition of the unit in preparation for the upcoming move out. The final and third inspection/walk through takes place to document the condition of the unit once the resident has vacated the unit. The security deposit is refunded less any damages, financial or physical property damages, to the forwarding address on file within 60-days of the lease end date.

We found someone to take over the current lease as well as the next years lease. They were not subleasing, rather they were signing a new lease.

When we called them about it, they told us that we had to submit it all in writing in email format.

Whenever I was in town or moved out and tried to call them, they never pick up the phone!!! I moved out of town in July then received a bill in September, with a service that I never used. I tried to call several times, never get answered. I also emailed, no answer as well. They are doing a fair job at maintenance.\nAnother thing that happened when I moved out was all the UHauls were gone during that week, so I asked the main office if I could have a grace period for one day. The premise for me to ask this was my roommate is still leasing the apartment, and she has not found the new roommate yet. I assumed, if she agrees, then I should be good. I went to talk to the main office, the front desk told me to talk to the office at the Midtown apartment. I went there, the lady rejected my proposal and said they will have vendors checking my room right on the day I moved out and through my stuff out even if I have my roommate's permission to place them in the living room. So, I ran crazy for that week looking for moving trucks and finally moved out on time (actually two days in advance). I returned the keys and everything to the main office and told my story. Another lady, seems like the manager or some management-level person told me a totally different answer. She said if my roommate is keeping renting the apartment and agree to let me put my stuff in there, I could have the grace period!!! This is nuts! I was so upset for that day but decided to not give a bad review on Google review. This time, I really cannot. It is not about money, it is their attitude.\n\nUpdated\n\nAround an hour than I left the one star review, they responded and someone finally answered the call. The answer I got for the charge is because of the wreath we had on the door\ud83d\ude44\ufe0fso I told them that is not trash, that is what we used to place outside as decoration. Since my roommate is still living in there, it should not count as something I left not as trash. The new manager of the office said she had no other answer for my question other than I have to pay the \u201creasonable\u201d charge. Oh, the most incredible thing for this management company is they will change the detail of the lease without notifying. Since I am moving out of the town and my roommate will stay, she renewed the lease. When we started to lease the apartment, we get told that we are only leasing our own room (we were paired up by the management company), which means we do not have to lease the whole apartment if we cannot find a roommate. After two years of leasing, our contract have never changed. However, they changed it this year without any notification, and my roommate did not look through carefully so she rent the whole apartment. This is the reason why I thought I should be ok to leave my stuff in the apartment with my roommate\u2019s permission. Based on my roommate\u2019s feedback, their maintainance worked as well as the office does. It took them over a month to get the sink fixed.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1569606837169, "text": "We are sorry that you did not have a good move-out experience.

The day I moved in I had a leak in the ceiling, I was told it was fixed and moved on. The people seemed nice and I loved the apartment. Fast forward a couple of months, I had another leak in the same spot. This time it damage the drywall. I was told there was no danger of mold, etc and that it had been fixed and cleaned. I took pictures this time. Fast forward another few months, another leak, this time bigger- all of these were from my upstairs neighbors air conditioning unit and/or water heater. Still did nothing  to fix the drywall and there have been water stains and cracks on my ceiling for months. Then last night the water heater broke again and it flooded my upstairs neighbors apartment as well as mine. There was at least a half inch to an inch of water in my bedroom, closet, and living room. It came from the ceiling, it poured from the fan, it came from the vents...it took maintenance 40 minutes to get there and then he walked in, shook his head and walked out. Keep in mind this was 900 at night and I had just worked and extremely long shift and had to work again in the morning. My bed was ruined, my mattress was ruined, my rugs are ruined, my Martin guitar could be ruined. I have renters insurance, and I have been a good tenant. I pay rent on time. I report issues so they can be fixed- but they were never fixed. I was trying to get in touch with Wescott, the property manager, all night. She never answered. She still hasn\u2019t  answered. I will say that TJ and Pam helped me the most, and TJ did try and find me a place to stay last night but I was able to sleep on my couch and opted to stay at home to keep an eye on things. Good thing I did because My apartment is still leaking and it\u2019s 900 AM. For all I know there could be mold in the area where it leaked before that they said they fixed. I know there probably will be now. I don\u2019t feel like this is a safe environment, and the fact that I cannot reach anyone who will help me when needed today is extremely frustrating.

I lived there for a year, and these are all the good and bad about renting from this company.\n\nThe good: All of the staff I dealt with there nice and professional, and were responsive anytime I had to talk to them. They also compensated me for the problems I incurred when I moved out, so that bumps them up from a 1 star to 2 stars. The property was in a pretty cool location with a nice view of the BHAM skyline. Aside from that, there's not much more to add.\n\nThe bad: Now the buildings in this complex are at least 80 years old and in rough shape. The specific unit I was in was a \"renovated\" unit that had a new kitchen, bathroom, and updated fixtures.\n\nBefore I signed the lease, I asked if the unit had new insulation and was assured that it did as well as a new HVAC system (Ill get to this later). There was also various places where water was leaking by a window, a couple places on the ceiling, and the back door. I marked this on my paperwork and was assured that it would be fixed ASAP. A crew came out and \"fixed\" (Their version of fixing water leaks is to spread some mud on the wet spot and paint it. Quality fix) two of the three spots, and left the large one by the back door where water was running down the wall. Due to their \"fix\" the water leaks inevitably came back next time a heavy rain came through. Sent in another work order and they threw some more mud on it, still ignoring the largest leak. At this point, I decided to drop the issue and ignore it since they obviously didn't think it was a large problem and ignored it too. A couple months later, the ceiling fell since the sheetrock had sagged so much, exposing the rotting and moldy wood holding the building together and allowing ants, centipedes, and other pests into the unit. Once this happened, they actually decided to fix it after I sent a firm email to the property manager about it.\n\nThe other large problem I had with the unit is the insane power bills I would get in the winter months. When they updated the unit, they didn't replace any windows or install any insulation (Like I was told when I moved in). This made the unit extremely cold in the winter, and dreadful to live in. I would set my heat to 65 degrees and my heat would run every 20 mins trying to increase the temperature. The heater would pop the breaker frequently because it was drawing so much power. This leads me to believe that the new HVAC unit they installed was wired incorrectly. After multiple techs come out to evaluate the problem, supposedly including an electrician and someone from Alabama Power, the problem was still there. My electricity bill would be between $250-$350 during winter months on a 1 bed apartment. They eventually started sending me credits for the power bills after I complained enough about it not being fixed which as a nice gesture. Fixing the problem properly the first time would have been nicer.\n\nSome other issues I encountered:\n- A colony of fleas moved in on the sidewalk next to my building, and eventually made their way into my unit. After contacting H2, the receptionist told me to call the extermination company myself. I don't have pets, and this was on the outside, common area part of the building. It's not my responsibility to maintain common areas of the complex, this was H2's problem. So instead of fighting this, I bought 4 cans of Raid and did the job myself.\n- My dishwasher was not connected to power when I moved in.\n- I had multiple issues with the faucets, door handles, and other finishings in the unit since H2 cheaped out on literally every finishing in the unit.\n\nI do not recommend H2 to anyone. The lack of care when it comes to maintaining their properties and their \"we will do that later\" attitude is extremely frustrating.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkt5t06KxewsCl_jK8hiAMAGazcFVq0pBwPbx1=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjvhQkisp5GN8iihltKazqZqppaVJn1_vSWkYj=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bb096ce12bf:0x5db2624fb37cb12f"}

As I type this, there is a constant dripping of water coming from my ceiling into a bucket that I have to empty pretty soon.  I think it's reasonable that this group should be called H2O Real Estate because I've had nothing but leaks from the ceiling and walls.  First off, when we saw the unit, there were no signs of leaking or roaches because I believe the unit had to have been cleaned up and painted before we saw it.  The day we moved in we didn't get the correct keys for our front door or mailbox.  Upon entry, guess what? Roaches (and then we noticed leaks soon after too).  Upon closer inspection of the unit, there were gaps and holes everywhere in our unit allowing bugs to come and go.  Whenever it rained, there would be a waterfall in front of our front door because there was no awning.  Upon an even closer inspection of the building and our power bill, the public laundry in the basement was (and still is) wired to our power meter.  After talking with the property manager, we were able to reach an agreement and agreed to pay a reasonable amount for the power after the issue was discovered.  It still baffles me that no one knew or told us.  Shady imho.  Maintenance people responded fast to our requests.  The plumbers involved in the renovations throughout the building began cutting open pipes in my room without telling me they were.  Also, one of the leaks in my bedroom has persisted for over 4 months and still hasn't been fixed but I'm reassured that it has been fixed each time.  I'm convinced the walls of this place are filled with mold.   I'd recommend finding somewhere else to live as other people detailed similar experiences at other H2O units.

The problems never got better and Emily the property manager at Redmont Square really was no help whatsoever. Since moving in there had been one problem after another. Let me preface this with, we did a walk through the Thursday before and pointed out these issues. First, on the day of move in, upon arrival it was clear that the apartment was not ready to be moved into, yet you set a move in date that in involved us paying a proration(something I\u2019m fine with paying if the apartment is ready). Lights weren't installed. Light fixtures were full of dust and debris. My first problem I see is that the weather strip is missing to the front door allowing easy access for bugs into this apartment along with releasing air conditioning. Second I notice none of the electricity in the kitchen works and that the refrigerator is not even plugged in and the new appliance plastic hasn\u2019t been removed from any part of it. I was able to receive no help from any of the maintenance on this issue until Tuesday. Luckily my leasing agent Robin was able to contact someone higher up that was able to give us ideas that I would have to try to make them work(ideas involving me having to flip all the breakers) and one of the ideas did work. This should not have been my job to do this or have to set up the refrigerator. Next, I noticed that in the bathroom the paint was still missing on some of the drawers from where it had pulled off from opening. Under the sink in the bathroom. There was still exposed insulation and direct access into the wall along with missing paint on the inside of the underpart of the sink. One day, we started noticing the toilet not flushing properly(just filling up with water). Tried plunging that didn\u2019t work. Called emergency maintenance and had to insist they come that day. Where this gets worse is I try taking a shower and realize the water is starting to pool up so I turn it off and when I do. I notice something starts coming out of the drain and realize it is actual human fece and not tiny specs of it, little chunks. I called emergency maintenance again to demand they come out immediately. Let me remind I just moved in officially on Sunday before that happened. Maintenance did eventually come but was unable to remedy the situation. So plumbers had to be called and they finally remedied the situation. This total ordeal lasted from 12-8 on a Tuesday. I was told by a worker that this has happened at a few other apartments at this building and also told by one of the neighbors that this place is falling apart and that there is always an issue. This has been true so far. This problem continued to happen throughout the entire time I lived at the property. The dishwasher didn't work well(main attraction to this apartment before realizing that) and wasn't even hooked up when I moved in. The reason I\u2019m writing this review today is because after moving out I am leaving unhappy and believing this to be a pretty amateur company.. Seems a lot like the nightmarish stories I heard about Southside Apt Company. I find this to be unacceptable with all the problems and don\u2019t understand why we were allowed to move in before it was ready. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone and if you are considering it, be ready to have issues.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bb096ce12bf:0x5db2624fb37cb12f"}

I\u2019ll start with saying Sadena Rice helped us get mine and my significant others first apartment and she was very honest, helpful and a great woman in general. She has always been patient, kind and honest whenever talking to her and has an amazing personality during the entire process. If I could request anyone it would be her.\nI am moving out in 2 days of this apartment and I couldn\u2019t happier. First off, the mold is bad here. There was mold in every single vent in my apartment and I\u2019m highly allergic ... I was sick for a while thinking I had covid, finally going to the doctor and it wasn\u2019t covid it was mold after doing my search and knowing I\u2019m highly allergic. I called for 4 days straight about the mold, and finally maintenance showed up the 4th day. All he did was scrap some mold and rust off, spray paint over it and give me new air vents. Mold also is all around the bathtubs, I noticed it when I moved in but it\u2019s just has got worse, no matter how much scrubbing I do, nothing helps. The gas water tank has horrible issues, firstly gas leaked out of my tank and my dog had to go to the emergency vet... and had spots on her lungs from breathing it in for so long and thank god my boyfriend got there in time because I was at work and he took her to the vet. They replaced it and it goes out all the time and we have cold water for days until my boyfriend can finally get the pilot light to stay lit long enough. There is bugs in my apartment ... i keep my apartment immaculate and still bugs so their pest control is a joke. There was dog poop in several washing machines stuck and it smelt horrible... (I lived in a one bedroom and didn\u2019t have a washer and dryer connection). My car was broken into as well as so many others months ago, nothing was done about it. There\u2019s only one camera and it\u2019s going in and out of the complex. My apartment smelt like Marijuana for months straight and I can promise you I don\u2019t smoke that... there is so many people who SPEED through this complex and have their music BLARING at all hours of the night. Also, my neighbors fought for hours and hours atleast twice a week... it\u2019s just very noisy.\nthe pool and the gym are very nice, the staff I think really does try to help, maintenance I think is busy a lot because there is several things that many people have wrong and i am not sure who\u2019s fault it is for all of the craziness but this is not to bash the place because I loved it when I moved in here and it was great.\nit\u2019s just gone down hill since I moved in year ago.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1613776652690, "text": "Sheridan,  Thank you for sharing your experience.

We have called for pest control on numerous occasions and one guy said that apartment needs bombing due to infestation and after that his company never showed back up.

Can the roaches pay their portion of the RENT Please!.\n\nWarning:  Monitor your account ledger quarterly.   We received a late notice and this sparked us to pull our ledger because we always pay them on time.  We have had a credit balance since we moved in year one.  However, they never apply your credit to your account automatically.  Upon a certified mailing request to them, I requested an account ledger reflecting a credit balance.  After pulling my account ledger, I notice that they post payments late to our account with a late fee; then a couple of days later, they credit the late fee.  Accounting System is a mess!.  Rent is due on 1st and I pay on the last day of the month each month.   Watch your money and when you ask questions, they can't explain them; they need to get back to you within a couple of days.\n\nThe service and the outdated apartments are not worth the money!

My partner and I just escaped this place after a long and terrible year living here. Unfortunately moving here from another state we quickly signed a lease here without much consideration and it is the WORST place either of us have ever lived. The $800 rent comes about to nearly $1200 once all of the monthly fees are added on, most of the charges you pay for you dont use and you can't opt out of. We constantly encountered cockroaches, spiders, ants and even SCORPIONS inside of our apartment!! They do no pest control unless it's by request and then they charge you directly every time they come out. The apartment was not move in ready when we got there causing maintenance to be in our apartment weeks after moving in. There was black mold in the trim of the bathtub which was recaulked over, constant water heater problems, all water usage is split by the entire building so minimalists like us constantly overplayed for what we weren't using, there was a massive gap in the weather stripping under the front door; one maintenance broke a marble stone statue I had just recieved as a birthday gift by knocking it off the counter and then took beer out of our refrigerator on the way out. We constantly smelled tobacco and smoke in and around our building and management accused us directly of smoking cannabis on multiple occasions solely because we moved from a cannabis legal state, though it seems we were the only ones in the building not smoking. Our upstairs neighbors dog bothered us for months during which we complained countless times as we could hear it all day and night through the paper thin floor (walls are paper thin too). After months we find out our neighbors aren't supposed to have the dog and are finally removed after we had lost our peace of mind. They shamefully still charged us for a FULL YEAR worth of amenities including pool, rec room, etc. for which they only had open for 4 months that we lived here! I understand covid regulations but we paid for everything and were not reimbursed for any of it! Our license plate was stolen off of our vehicle in the middle of night while parked in the complex in our designated spot, police later called us and stated it was used on a different vehicle in a crime. Managment was extremely rude (especially Angela) and terrible with customer service; it was an awful experience to have wasted a year of my life here.

First off: they moved us into a DIFFERENT apartment than we signed a lease for. on a Sunday. with no one there to fix it. so when I signed up for a beautiful sun room, I got this weird screened room on concrete with exterior siding on the walls. terrible, its never used.\nSecond: I asked if windows could be put in because were are college girls living here and it was unsafe living on the underground floor with out windows at ground level. I was told sure at my own expense and no remorse of the misplacement of my apartment. It wasn't until I contacted corporate that I got blinds placed for privacy and safety.\nThird: I've been charged multiple times for random things that I've had to email and get fixed, they did fix these, but its sad I had to watch my bills like a hawk to not get charged.\nLiving in the terrace level we have TONS of bugs. I call pest control at least once a week for roaches, centipedes, and bugs I've never heard of. I come home to roaches that are dead in my floor daily. which is very embarrassing.\nLastly: I wasn't informed when we moved in that water is split between the entire apartment complex ?? I was told is was just like Tapestry ( their sister property I moved from) (highly recommend they actually know what they're doing there) But WRONG they split this and apparently its not just this apartment but the entire Birmingham City because my water bill for a 2 bedroom apartment that we're in maybe 3 nights a week max is $150+ as I've complained multiple times they just say \"yeah Birmingham water works its bad you know\" ????????

It had been about two months and she still had not receive the deposit, so i decided i would call and ask about it. When i originally called, Blake told me that there was no deposit on file (not true.) When i called back, Rebecca told me that we should have received all but $500 of said deposit within 4-6 weeks (not true.) When i called back again, Alecia told me that absolutely none of the deposit was left due to pet damages. Don't get me wrong, I fully understand that treatments may have been needed and there were small damages, but what i not understanding is why it was my responsibility to replace all carpet when the carpet most likely needed replacing before we moved in. Keep in mind we had a 12 pound cat, not an 80 pound lab. When i asked to be sent all the documentation to send to a lawyer she told me that Lynn would be sending it to me within 24 hours (NOT TRUE) It has been over a month now and i am just now being told i have to request all documentation in writing.

I\u2019ll start from the beginning of the issues with them. First of all, if you work from home it\u2019s best not to move here, as they will tell you you are not allowed to work on a business computer from your apartment. Secondly (and I\u2019ll just speak on my own experience here), we had my boyfriends brother over for the day and were cooking out by the pool. We began to walk out to put leftovers in our fridge real quick and one of the managers from the leasing office approached me and my boyfriend with a rude tone telling us that if we left the pool that his brother couldn\u2019t stay there. We asked her if we could run up to our apartment real quick and that we were coming right back. She said yes that would be fine. As we were on our way back we ran into his brother who had been kicked out anyways and she had been rude with him. Because of this she has another manager tell us that he isn\u2019t allowed back on the property. At least one day out of the month the water won\u2019t work because of pipe issues. We had to freeze the first few weeks of winter because our heat wasn\u2019t working. Then we get a leak in our ceiling over our DINING AREA where we host meals and another leak from our sun roof. They fixed the leak but left the wet ceiling to mold. BLACK MOLD has also accumulated on the master bathroom ventilation area. After all of these problems we\u2019ve decided to leave. Our lease is up on January 14th. Now our last straw and the reason I\u2019m posting this review? We get a call from them today with the lady being rude to my boyfriend as soon as she gets him on the phone. She tells him she hasn\u2019t received 60 day notice of us leaving and he told her yes we will be moving. And she told us that they have to receive a 60 day notice from us (we are already at only a month left until lease is up), or that they will charge us two more months of rent. WE WERE NEVER INFORMED THAT WE NEEDED TO GIVE A NOTICE BEFORE LEAVING. My boyfriend asks her \u201cso we aren\u2019t aloud to leave? We signed a one year lease.\u201d And she tells him \u201cNo you have to stay or you will pay fees and you will pay for two months of rent\u201d. We need to expose places like this. They are NOT good people. They will try to make as much money as they can off of you even if it means being downright deceitful. We pay over 1200 a month to live here and we are not treated nor have we ever been treated like respected guests since we began staying here. I would not recommend moving here to my worst enemy. Nobody should feel like this at a place that\u2019s supposed to be home.

Maintenance team is inferior, tried to have a toilet fixed three times, which they failed to fix.  Eventually I gave up on the toilet.  It took them two times to fix the water heater.  Furnace broke down too.  The complex is always breaking a water main thus leaving you/us without water for hours.  Don't expect to come home from work and take that nice relaxing shower, no no water main broke again.  Staff does NOT answer phones.  After two weeks of signing lease mold began to grow on the walls, wasn't from me because I didn't move in right away.  I found that someone left an odor eliminator in the main AC duct which became moldy and most likely cause the mold to spread.  Maintenance always leaves a light on after they have been in your apartment, which cost you money.  On site laundry mat requires a card not money to use machines and where do you add money to the card.  I'll tell you where you add money.  At the leasing office, which is closed if you work nights or 70+ hours a week, which means you can't add money because the leasing office is closed by time you get home from work.  The way my mind works is, if I need to add money to the \"laundry\" card to use the \"laundry\" machine shouldn't the machine to add money be in the \"laundry\" mat and not the leasing office.  Laundry machines are always breaking down too.\n\nJust save yourself the trouble don't live here.  A friend of mine lived here too, let's just say he didn't renew his lease.  Also they must be getting desperate for new tenants because they approve anybody now.  So just think about that for a minute, the word anybody.  Last but not least I have received a letter three months later claiming that I owe $658.00 early termination fee.  Here comes the funny part, I paid the $658.00 early termination fee along with any other fees (that's how bad I wanted to get the hell out of there).  So now I have to get the lawyer involved.\n\nLIKE I SAID, DON'T LIVE HERE.  DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT MOVING HERE.  UNLESS YOU LIKE HEADACHES THEN BY ALL MEANS MOVE INTO the Ridge Crossings Apartments located at Tree Crossings Parkway.\n\nNow some might say this is slander but what is slander?

Haven't figured out the vent circulation yet, but if you have a neighbor with bad habits (air wise, smoking wise, etc) you will be affected.\n3. Don't like how they do the water bill. It is split between all tenants in the building. Our water bill was higher than a water bill for a 3-5 bedroom house in hoover.\n4. Maintenance issues that have to do with the age of the apartment don't seem to be able to be fixed but just have to deal.\n\nAll in All:\nI\u2019ve never experienced the type of customer service they give here.

Also, the staff will send notices via email before they do anything, such as shutting off the water to fix a water leak. I have nothing but positive remarks about this community. What I did before moving here is drive into the community and ask people who were walking their dogs what they thought. Don't make an assumption of negative remarks on the internet.

I understand if it's an emergency but they could at least send an email when they become aware of the situation instead of cutting it off and leaving everyone in the dark about when it may possibly be back on, since they have no problem emailing me all the time telling me to recommend them.  I also hate the \"valet service\"; it is not a service.  They used to just pick up the trash at a certain time if you put it outside at the time; now they want me to \"sign up\" for trash service using a Facebook or Google account (there's also an option where you can call in and sign up) and then each time you want it picked up you have to make an appointment and allow ten minutes before and after for them to pick it up, and then you have to hand it to the person.  I've never used it but I still have to pay for it, it's easier just to take it to the dumpster.  They sent us q&a sheet about it when it started, and one of the questions was, why can't i leave my trash outside the door?  The answer was because we'll fine you.  Last time my lease was up for renewal they sent me a letter saying rent was going to be a certain amount and when I went to sign the lease it was higher.  It was just a \"mistake\".

I\u2019m OCD and have a support dog to help with the anxiety it brings.  I\u2019ve even seen roaches outside. I wish I could upload pictures.\n\nWe pay$1000/mo for this 1BR. This isn\u2019t my first time paying this amount for an apartment but I sure didn\u2019t experience issues like this. We chose to rent to give more time to find our home instead of rushing but at this point i wish we would have just bought a home and called it a day.\n\nOur apartment is \u201crenovated\u201d but really it\u2019s just cabinets and mirrors painted over with brown paint , sloppily at that. The apartment has no Fans, our room doesn\u2019t have lights besides in the closet . The living room doesn\u2019t have lights either. But ironically our sun room has lights.\n\nMy garbage disposal went out today, no idea why , my outlets for plugs pick and choose when they want to work. For example I have an outlet next to nightstand w my phone charger and lamp plugged in. Well only the bottom works so I have to switch the charger and and lamp out. There\u2019s days where our sink water doesn\u2019t get past lukewarm warm so I have to put ice in my dogs bowl to cool the water.The landscaping coming in is beautiful but by the apartments it is mediocre  at best\n\nPositives : The pool area is nice and the location is nice , being by the highway.

There are days when they skip a day to pick it up but they never \"skip\" to charge for it every month. The utility is VERY expensive here,  just sewer is around $60 a month plus water, gas, electricity, trash, VALET TRASH, \"pest control- is also (NONEXISTENT) and a service fee....(2 trash bills, it is not a mistake ppl). So do not get fooled by the rent price only. They also raise the rent EVERY YEAR. Started out $735 in 2017 for the smallest 1 br unit, a year later with \"early\" bird renewel $835.... Looks like these people here don't want good, respectful, long lasting tenants at all. And when those move out, you can only imagine what's left. No wonder why you see moving\"(out)\"trucks here every weekend.\nThe management is slow, but mostly very incompetent. I went 4 times in the office to complain about the same thing!(barking dog issue). No results.\nI mean I was at the point to contact the corporate office in Irvine,Ca(Steadfast). (Just in case if you need the info in the future)...and you will believe me. The staff is nice and helpful you can tell, but so much they can do when there is a lazy, incompetent management behind them! The office staff is getting commission after they sign up a new tenant, so they will seem super nice at the beginning, but once you signed the contract, you are doomed until you move out. Let's see how cool and funny Blake and Douglas (as i read it) will be when you face a REAL problem. Let me know.\nAnd just like other people say, sometimes there is not enough water pressure so you can't take a hot shower and those email notifications just never arrive....but they should.\nWhen my lease is over I am \ud83d\udc4b. Do not get fooled by that few positive reviews, because that is all what Lyn the manager from the office is doing, since she could care less if there is a real problem what needs to be solved.  Just like other tenants were saying is that, they care more to sign new tenants up, but once you signed the contract ,they will turn their back on you completely. I am the real proof to that. When you move out expect to pay more than double what you would normally pay for rent and utility. Also, please since you are here, take the time to check out Steadfast Living(their corporate office) reviews(barely 2 stars). You were warned, i wish if someone would have done the same thing before i moved in here.\n*UPDATE: It's all talk, no action in the end of the day.

We also had a tree that grew over our roof. It made horrible noises as the limbs scratched the windows. We requested SEVERAL times that they trim the limbs but they never did.

We requested again that they trim the limbs. They said they would immediately, but still never did.\nThe final reason for the bad review was their \"move-out\" procedure. We handed in our written 60-day notice to vacate & requested to set up a move-out inspection with an agent. No one contacted us to do this. We called & stopped by the office several times requesting information about moving out & what we needed to do (all other apartments I have lived in gave a move-out check list). We were told by 3 different office workers that they were planning to remodel our apartment. We were told to clean the kitchen & bathroom, make sure the drip pans on the stove were clean, & just to vacuum the floors because they would be replaced. 3 DIFFERENT PEOPLE TOLD US THIS! A month & a half later we received a notice from Ridge Crossings giving us 2 weeks to pay $1400 to replace the floors or they would send us to collections.

Bad experience rude people. Very rude. It\u2019s all about getting your money. Amy has no respect for women of color. I\u2019ve referred two of my friends and she insulted them as well as me. Once my lease is over in February 2020 I will never do business with TMI again. I moved from one apartment to another. Didn\u2019t receive my deposit from other location. She said it was up to the property owner. I asked for his number she told me she couldn\u2019t give me his information. My new apartment I was told there would be a refrigerator. I called every week up until it was time for me to move in to inform them there was still no refrigerator. They assured me it would be there. Long story short, I went an entire week without a refrigerator. And the one they put in my apartment is molded. I haven\u2019t even called about this issue. It\u2019s just not even worth the headache or bad mood they would put me in. It\u2019s not a pleasant thing to talk to TMI. I rather deal with the issues with this apartment without dealing with TMI until my lease is up. I initially gave a good review bc they lured me into thinking I\u2019d win a chance for some money honestly. I thought maybe that\u2019s a way to get a fraction of my deposit back. But in all honesty do not rent from these people. Bad business.

We asked the maintenance guy not so smoke in the house because we had a newborn, but, he did it any way. it also took him almost 3 weeks to replace a light fixture in the living room. I finally got fed up and called the owner of the house and he was way better to deal with thank TMI.\n\non another occasion rent was due on Good Friday, I went that day to pay rent but the office was closed. so, i was like, \"OK i'll pay it on Monday since there's no drop box\". I went first thing that Monday and they charged me $150 late fee because they were closed the day rent was due so it caused me to be late. when i tried to dispute it the literally called the police on me. needless to say I paid the $150 and  went on my way.\n\nNow its August and our AC just went out and I put another work order in and called the office to tell them that we have no AC in the house. They didn't even seem to care. all they said was \"our maintenance girl will have to look at the work order and well get to you when we can\".

I moved to Auburn 2.5 years ago for my job in property management and have only lived on properties that I worked at. When I decided to move away from my student housing property I wanted to move somewhere that was close enough to campus that I could walk for game days, but that wasn't full of young students and this was the perfect place (Park Hill cottage). It was secluded and quiet, but just a walk away from downtown and all the fun that Auburn has to offer. The biggest downfall for this property was that there is no dishwasher (not a huge deal), no washer/dryer (but there is a laundry mat on site and down the street at Thatch Hut) and it has cinder block walls so it gets really cold in the winter.\n\nI made the decision a few months ago to move to another newly renovated apartment that Chris also managed (Broadway Apartments) that were a few minutes farther down the road. I was so excited about the price and the location is still great, a littler farther from downtown but the apartment is so worth it! The renovations that Chris did are great, I love the flooring, paint colors, it had new carpeting and the room and closet sizes are great, it also comes with a (very small) dishwasher and a washer/dryer. The only issue that I have with this apartment is the amount of noise that I can hear from the people upstairs. Maybe keep the dogs on the 1st floor! ;-)\n\nChris has been a great landlord and I would absolutely recommend him to any serious students or young professionals looking to be in a great place in Auburn.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf31c31a91691:0x5164e38502b4d2b0"}

I went to Badger Properties because I read good reviews on Google and had heard generally good things from people. I went to the office in person and told Chris \"the badger\" my situation. I was just getting out of a 12 month rehab program, and had been working for a Christian Ministry and looking for an apartment in Auburn since I was a student at Auburn University at the time. I was very up front about my bad credit but was working 7 days a week and had many references etc to back up that I was honest and good for the rent every month. After seeing me alone in his office after hours, and asking me to come along (still alone) with him to see one of the properties (still after hours) I agreed because I was desperately in need of an apartment. He took me to an apartment to collect rent from a girl around my age, then he took me to another apartment where he basically showed me a place and then just sort of \"visited\" with some tenants. Every one seemed to like him, the apartments were pretty nice for how old they are, regardless, I was impressed at the time. We then went back to his office (once again, all happening after business hours) and he gave me an application, but before he did that he sat me down in the seating area of his office. We were completely alone and it was very dimly lit, and the front door was locked. He asked me extremely probing and personal questions about my past drug use. Mind you, I was sober for over a year at this point, active in church (still am) and admittedly hadn't even smoked a cigarette in over a year. He asked me questions like, \"So what led you to do drugs?\" \"what kind of drugs have you tried?\" \"how did you do your drugs? did you shoot up? snort them?\" He just kept asking SO many invasive and frankly, inappropriate questions; it was almost sadistic. I answered them as honestly as possible without divulging too much, because I really needed an apartment, I was impressed by the ones he had shown me and I thought that being as honest as I could would show him that I was a good tenant despite my bad credit, etc. After filling out an application and getting my credit checked through the program he said he uses to run credit (which gave a very vague summary of ones credit) I went back to his office once I had submitted my credit report and application. He said he didn't think he could rent to me because my credit report showed that I was $25k in debt; I explained that those were my student loans and that the program he uses wasn't showing exactly WHAT the debt was, just the amount. He said he couldn't rent to someone who was that far in debt. I explained that I am a student and that those are my student loans. I said, I would get a more in depth credit report and bring it to him. He gave me back my money order with the application fee on it and said to come back with a new credit report. My aunt is a real estate agent and she ran my credit for me, this time I had a complete credit report with every single student loan showing in detail, but because I had now ran my credit twice in one week, my already poor credit score was even lower. Despite that I went back to \"the badger\" and told him that the large amount of \"debt\" he saw was indeed my student loans, which were not even in collection because I was still attending Auburn at the time. He said then said he couldn't rent to someone with a credit score as low as mine and with a history like mine (due to my past drug use I had a criminal record. I have not had a single run in with the law in almost 4 years). So all in all, after wasting time, money, energy and being thoroughly humiliated, I would say that Badger Properties only serves those they deem worthy, and they don't believe in giving people second chances, only sadistically probing and dissecting the past of people who have made mistakes despite turning their lives around. A huge waste of time.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1459895750596, "text": "After 15 years of running Badger Homes and Badger Properties, I stand by my record of treating all applicants fairly in terms of their qualifications for an apartment.  They area 1) Credit score, from a tenant or direct relative, 2) Academic progress, and 3) good references from their previous landlord.  As stated above, our screening reports DO only show a credit score, they do not show a full report - meaning, we don't know the type of debt.  Our screening criteria is designed to approve or deny based on the SCORE, regardless of the type of debt.\n\nIf this dispute ever got serious, *I could produce a chain of emails which would explain and clearly show the reason for Denial*.  There was never any \"trade\" or \"back door\" approval process offered, and their never has been since I started the business.  We document every case of approval or denial, so we are ready to defend against accusations such as these.  That is not how we operate.  To have one negative review in 15 years should be evidence of how we do things.  Are we perfect?  No.  But we don't run the kind of business we are being accused of in the allegations above.\n\nOn the rehab comment: I can confidently say that we have rented to people coming from / still in rehab programs.  We have also rented to gay, straight, and many different religions and ethnic backgrounds, as well as singles, married couples, singles with kids, and families.  We have rented to people with low credit scores, also, but they must have a direct relative with a qualifying score be screened and sign as a Guarantor for their lease.  Our records are clear on that as well.  The \"second score\" that was brought to me to qualify was well below our minimum qualification.  We require a 650, the score presented was well below 600.\n\nAs stated above, there was not a qualifying score, and possibly not the required academic progress - but maybe\nshe met that qualification, I honestly do not recall.  We do not search any Applicant's criminal record, only our employees.\n\nAs stated above, I DID refund the Application Fee, and provide a true explanation of the reason for denial.  I do not remember asking questions about shooting or snorting drugs - I don't even know enough about drugs to know what that would mean anyway.  I have never even had a beer in my life, which everyone I've known for 41 years can verify.\n\nAfter hours, most (not all) of the lights are off in our storefront office, and the door is usually locked, but it is a full glass storefront on a busy street full of shoppers - so hardly a threatening or scary place.  I admit I probably asked questions that I didn't officially need to ask, true.  I am sorry if doing so had a worse impact than I expected.\n\nI do remember that the reviewer above and I did go to see an apartment and collect rent from a neighbor, but in most cases our rent is paid online, and has been for years.  I always thought that giving tours after hours and visiting with tenants after hours was a sign of good customer service, not something I would have to defend later.\n\nIf an independent auditor surveyed all of our current and previous tenants - male and female - over the last 15 years, they would come up with a conclusion that we are a little slow on maintenance, tough on noise, but that's about it.  If they surveyed everyone that has applied and that we have turned down over the last 15 years, they would find that there was a clear reason for each denial, and it was based on our written requirements of Credit Score, Academic Progress, and References.  That's it.  There is no evil, juicy story to report.\n\nAshley applied to rent from Badger in Sept 2014 for a Dec 14 opening..  I admit, I could have done better with the questions or the office lighting(?), but I have made no further attempt to contact her or to be in her life in any way beyond the Application period.  I am not sure why in April of 2016 she has decided to bring these accusations/allegations."}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf31c31a91691:0x5164e38502b4d2b0"}

I requested 1 night be reimbursed out of the 7 that we stayed - then after two more emails they never responded.  And apparently this is regarded as a threat by them.\n\nWe arrived and the first thing we noticed is the washer door is open and about 1 foot full of filthy dark brown water. We called and got somebody trying to fix it but was unsuccessful. Repair man was great but stated they have been unable to fix washer over past weeks. I left to go to the beach and let him do his work. After 2 days of not hearing anything back I had to call office and ask about what they were going to do about the water. Somebody came to drain it. After a couple more days of not hearing about repair status I asked and they said it's unfixable.\n\nThe troublesome part about the washer is they knew it was having issues for weeks and never notified us we would be unable to do laundry. A family of 4 on a beach vacation needs this. I would have found another option. The attitude was consistently like we were a burden and it's no big deal to not have a washer. I'm on vacation and last thing I want to do is spend hours at the laundromat - but apparently that's only worth $30 of trouble.\n\nAdditionally there was never anything in the ad about the washer being broken.  Only after my numerous complaints did Gulfsands update their descriptions to say washer did not work.  If you look at other reviews online apparently this has been an issue for months.\n\nAlso we found two huge dead cockroaches each about 2.5 inches long. I guess this was the result of the exterminators that arrived unannounced to apply poison in our condo. Between the washer and the exterminator we had 3 visits from maintenance personnel while we are trying to relax on vacation.\n\nAlso 2 of the 3 TVs were unable to connect to the Wi-Fi. Not a big deal on beach vacation but worth mentioning. Cable doesn't work in 1 bedroom too.\n\nAlso even though Covid restrictions are lifted, Gulfsands is still doing a \"remote\" check in that is cumbersome. It feels like they are using the situation as an excuse to not have to interact with people. The office you pick your keys up at resembles a maximum security prison with all the cameras and just seems over the top.\n\nPositives were tons of hot water, good location across from Waves (groceries, beer, ice, fishing, etc), and normally an OK value if these problems would have been resolved. Condo is certainly dated.\n\nOverall I can't recommend based on my experiences with how the company is managed and the troubles I described with the condo.\n\n*Update*  I think all you need to do is read the response from the owner below to validate they are unreasonable and probably not worth your business :)", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1625955081226, "text": "Please disregard this review.  This was a guest who threatened us with reviews if we did not pay them a free night for their washer being out of service.  This is a $30 credit item, which is the highest to any guest, as most were $10.  This is for groups of 6.  The guest told staff to 'keep it', as we learned after departure that they wanted more than $200.  This is called post exit rental extortion and is common in the market, especially this year.  We did confirm with the guest that if we didn't pay that amount, he would go on web sites to write negative reviews?  As you can see, this is the result.  The other issues appeared only after the request for money, which is also how this game works.  We don't play, as most other agents have stopped as well.  BTW, a large bug as described is a palmetto bug, and it is not from the condo, as it simply walked in an open door to escape the heat.  That's where they come from, outside.  We wish the guest the best, and hope they enjoy our beaches another time.  The water in the washer was soapy, and emptied as soon as requested, as we had to purchase a pump.  We also treated unit with bleach so it smelled clean.  Pest control comes once every 90 days, and not to poison their condo, but to treat pests, as with every condo in the city.  The new washer was on order, and was noted as not functioning in the rental ad since March 2021.  A new timer was installed for the prior guest to gain some life from the unit, and the unit was working for them, then failed again, as we waited several weeks for the new washer to arrive, which it since has.  Stack units were in high demand due to damages from Hurricane Sally and new construction, so they were not available from any source.  We had to wait weeks for it, but compensated each guest fairly.  This is a review done to intentionally hurt us for non payment of an amount that was not going to happen."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a04d07077c445:0x7fb91dc6f41301f3"}

Very prompt response and courteous on the phone. The day we arrived we did a walk through and noticed hair on the floor in the bathroom inside the master bedroom, and there was a strong odor of urine. After raising the toilet seat cover we noticed there was urine on the seat, the rim, and the back of the toilet. We went to the store and bought some cleaner to clean up the mess but could not get the urine smell to dissipate so we closed the door and only used the hall bathroom. It seemed the previous renters had left various children's toys and McDonalds cups in the condo as well. While this wasn't really an issue it made for a disorganized appearance. The A/C was cold, the water was hot, and the view was perfect. I believe your cleaning contractor leaves a lot to be desired and could do a much better job. Knowing that you have various people renting, as a condo owner I would suggest purchasing matching dinner and flatware as well as all cookware. While the appliances were all in working order the dishwasher and washer/dryer were very dated and the stove elements were crooked and awkward to cook on. We absolutely loved the leather/vinyl couch and strongly recommend getting away from fabric furniture unless it is professionally cleaned. I understand the costs of owning beachfront property to be quite expensive, but for the price it could use some updating. You could utilize the cleaning company to check inventory of everything on the day of checkout and charge the renter for anything missing or broken items. Also I strongly encourage you to purchase darkout curtains for the master bedroom as the outside lights and early sunrise made it very cumbersome to sleep. The only reason this got 4 stars was due to the nastiness of the room. We would definitely give this company and owner another chance in the future because we love Gulf Shores and it is our favorite vacation destination so we will be back.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a04d07077c445:0x7fb91dc6f41301f3"}

Although the accommodations were sufficient, they were not as advertised. To begin, we were under the assumption, based on the listing descriptions, that our condo 1202 was penthouse level. Upon arrival we were the last floor before penthouse, but the view was amazing.\n\nThis condo is listed to sleep 6 people. The accommodations read king size bed, sofa sleeper and two bunk beds. Specifications should have said children size bunks. The fold out still had plastic on the mattress and sounded like sleeping in a bag of potato chips.  The couch was more comfortable to sleep on as a sofa.\n\nThe first two showers that were taken in the hall bathroom were ice cold, as turning the knob to H made the water remain cold leading us to believe the hot water heater was broken. Upon calling Gulfsands Rental, we were informed that the hot/cold was reversed, meaning H was cold and C was hot. The exact words of the agent were, \"Oh, that is reversed, try keeping the knob on cold.\" There was nothing posted to this affect in the bathroom, even though this as a known issue by the rental company.\n\nIn the master bedroom, the ceiling fan was not working. When calling the rental company they stated it worked only with a remote of which there was not one. A maintenance request was put in. When the guy showed up to look at it he said the motor was blown and he would have to either order a new part or a new fan. It was not fixed during our 5 night stay. We called on day one about the fan.\n\nOther minor issues were the floor was not clean when we arrived, the wifi connection was unreliable and when eating, the only place for multiple people to eat was on the balcony, 3 deep on the soft or perched on the most uncomfortable bar stools ever created.\n\nTo sum up the review, the rental company should have been more forthcoming about known issues prior to booking. We feel we did not get what we paid for. I\n\nI tried to post this on their website, but all reviews are moderated by them so the likelihood of it being seen on their website is slim to none.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1437582936168, "text": "We regret this review, as the guest was looking at unit 1306 initially, but that unit was not available...penthouse level 1306...and 1202 was and offered with a link to view this unit.  This unit is not, and has never been noted as penthouse level, this was a guest mistake.  Unit 1202 is one level below the penthouse level and 12th floor is no different otherwise.  Nothing special is available on the penthouse floor.  Bunks are photo'd online and ARE described for children.  Sounds like the stay was very good, but not indicated as such.  The shower is actually correct, but we have found the simplest way to note how it works to the guests that have issues is to say its reversed.  There is an arrow on the rounded side of shower arm pointing to the H and C, but most folks miss it, so they assume the arm is to point to H or C.  We regret the issue, but it's just how it was manufactured.  The stools are brand new and heavy duty.  Don't know what else we can say.  This is a wonderful, updated condo with a great view.  We did report the fan not working to the owner, and he is fedexing his replacement for arrival today, as they are special units.  Light worked, and the AC makes the unit very cold, but one fan did not turn during the stay, and we did everything we could to repair it.  We received a 2 star review.  We view this review as inappropriate, as we have great deals and this is a very nice condo.  We feel reviews like this have no place on the web, but they have become commonplace as people will go out of their way to damage a company's reputation with little issue, but the thousands of happy guest won't take the time to note the great time they had.

Our policy is provided up front in our rental agreement and also on our Policies page on our web site to keep folks informed.  Card policies in the accommodations industry continually change and have become quite strict.  We follow all Visa, MC, AMEX and Discover policies as they protect both you and the condo owner.  We did offer the option of sending checks from multiple parties, since we can only accept CC payment from the person signing the agreement, and you did send checks from 2 different parties for payment.  We hope that helped.  With check in, our policy is the same as a hotel, and only the person on the reservation can check in.  We can add an additional tenant prior to check in, but they need to sign an agreement and also have a card on file.  Please know that our goal is to make your stay enjoyable, but we do note our policies up front and have to abide by them."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a04d07077c445:0x7fb91dc6f41301f3"}

I live way out in Brookside, AL. where there's nothing for me. Me and my deaf and C. P. wife had no choice at the time back in Nov. 2014 to move way out here because we loved into an all black neighborhood downtown at Park Place right close to the Jefferson Co. Courthouse. We were told at Park Place at time of signing the lease that the 1 bedroom Apt. we were getting was \"All ready to move into\". The day we moved in we found out there were no heat or air. The whole unites had been removed to replace another unit and there was such a long list of things missing or broken. We had to complain over getting things fixed for 3 months and never got it all. Before moving there we lived on highway 280 south in Apartments that was costing us $920.00 rent plus renter's ins., light and water. At both places our Apt. and cars were broken into many times and Park Place told us they had 3 police cars driving through at all time. NOT TRUE! The 280 Apt. would never fix anything. We lived in HELL at both places. The lost of a $800.00 car radio was gone. Things in Apt. taken. We had to move from both places or loose our lives. But moving has caused us even more problems getting to our doctors and hospitals plus I have to have attendant care morning and night. It's hard to get a caregiver to drive out here. I applied with J. H. Berry for an Apt. on south side at Central Station Apartment but even though our credit is bad from moving out at those 2 other bad managements J. H. Berry even turned us down even with our lawyer Robert Norris offered to to co-sign and they refused him. Mr. Norris even offered to pay J. H. Berry 6 months rent in advance and they turned that much money in advance down. The truth was and is wasn't the credit of ours. The truth is they looked at me in a wheelchair and my wife's deafness and made up their mines they don't want disabled people in their Apt. There was 1 small step up to get into the front door and there was going to need a small ramp for my wheelchair in get just into the front door and nothing else had to be fixed for my wheelchair. They just meant no handicapped person was moving into their apartments. When 6 months rent is offered and co-signing by a big shot lawyer as Norris Injury Lawyers is turned down the question is \"Why? There's no other answer but NO DISABLED PEOPLE IN OUR PLACES!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889197751f8d0f3:0x84397fe7fc02d2ff"}

We had originally booked a different condo that was closer to the Hangout Festival. There was a problem with the owners of that condo, and we were moved to this one. I was a bit upset because we were staying with another couple, and we were now sharing a studio apartment. There was ZERO privacy. It would be a great condo for just one couple or a small family, though. I also have to say that Bender was very sweet about it, and refunded me some of my money for the inconvenience.  I was also scared when I saw the pictures of the place. The pictures DEFINITELY need to be updated. It looks much better in person. It is very very clean, but it needs to be updated. There is no dishwasher, which was a bit of a pain. Also all of the dishes were ceramic and glass, which were not allowed at the pool or anything- I'd recommend bringing some plastic cups and paper plates. The location was AMAZING. Right on the beach. I really enjoyed the patio in the mornings. The pool was lovely, and the beach was perfection. If you are renting this place for Hangout Fest, know that this is quite the walk! We were told it was a mile away but it was actually  1.4 miles, which means that its about a 3 mile walk every day. So be prepared! Overall our stay was much better than expected, but the condo could use some updating and it was a little further than I had hoped for.

I was trying to rent my home while going through several major life events.  Needless to say, I was very overwhelmed.  A friend highly recommended her to me.  I had contacted a few property management companies prior to my first conversation with Carolyn.  To the outsider, another person\u2019s home is just a dwelling without an emotional connection. To me, my home was a blessing from God and a source of pride at being able to independently acquire it as a single woman.  During the telephone interview, I asked her what made her so special or set her apart from the other companies.  Among other things, she told me that as a small business, she was able to provide red carpet service.  I was sold! Over the years, she did NOT disappoint me.  She ensured my home had renters who cared for it and actually enjoyed residing there.  She professionally resolved the few disagreements between the renters and me.  She and her team ensured my home was SPOTLESS when the first renter vacated.  Due to her team\u2019s diligence and tenacity, new tenants were qualified and in place in about 15 days.   On the afternoon of 31 October 2017, Carolyn informed me that the tenants would like to not only purchase my home but also close before Christmas!  I was elated and skeptical at the same time because I knew they were first time home buyers.  I prayed about the situation.  God answered my prayer.  Carolyn agreed to represent both parties and went above and beyond to create a win-win situation for both parties.  We closed on 20 December 2017! That is a BIG deal for first time home buyers to get qualified, obtain a down payment, have inspection issues resolved, and have all paperwork correct to close in 50 days during a holiday period!  Carolyn Dietrich has been and continues to be a blessing and great source of information in recommending companies to perform work in my current home. Carolyn, THANK YOU for all you have done for me! I whole-heartedly appreciate you!

We stayed in this house for 18 months until we were ready to purchase our own house, and during that time the service from Dietrich rentals was nothing short of excellent.\n\nAny time we reported a maintenance issue, we had a phone call within the hour from either Dietrich Rentals or a service company asking when they could come fix the issue.  This includes an air conditioning unit that decided to stop working at 10 pm on a Saturday night in the middle of the Alabama Summer.  Quick response is an understatement.\n\nIn our experience, sometimes even the best property management companies really show their true colors when it comes time to leave a rental.  Thankfully, Dietrich Rentals was nothing like this when we moved out.  They were completely transparent about property condition throughout our stay at the rental house and recouping our deposit after we moved out was extremely easy.

On hands and knees and with help. Yet they charged us $450 for a cleaning lady.\nWe viewed the house we rented as others were moving out. It was in serious disrepair and it was filthy. She assured us that all would be taken care of. It wasn't. The yard was a mud hole and they refused to fix it. I made a seriously detailed walk-through sheet listing every little nail hole.

I spoke with one tenant who lives at Four Seasons and she stated she had been complaining about a branch overhanging.To make a long story short the branch fell on a resident's car Blackwell Nelson claimed it was an act of GOD. But it was negligence. If they had cut the branch it would not have fell onto the car. They are several other complaints as well. I was fired from this company. And when I asked why was I being fired Roxanne told me we should leave it at that. Katrina was there as well. I thought I had the right to know why I was being  fired. She Roxanne was very vague. I then filed for unemployment and found out the reason I was fired was because of going into a storage unit without permission. This is what the company told the unemployment office. They do investigations as to why or why not you should receive benefits .I spoke with one of the residents of the storage unit and they told me that I was fine, also there was a camera on the storage unit as well. I lost an item and was looking for it in the storage because often times we place tools and other items inside storage units. So when I found out this was the reason I was fired I grew suspicious and\nwas very frustrated. I'm going through the process as we speak dealing with this company And I have filed a complaint with the EEOC. These properties are poorly maintained and they  employ young people and mexicans who they get over on. They  have no respect for safety. And there are several violations at hand. I even expressed my concern to Roxanne about this.  I can recall several unsafe practices  at this job. All they do is patch work and find the cheapest way out. I was an employee there. And the only time they fix something is if it is a sever problem the employees have to stress it to them. I was working there from October of last year until June this year. I have pictures of these unsafe practices. Also I can recount several instances  as well like illegally building a fence at Red Top .I was there when the job started. They didnt even have a permit and They very well knew it too. There was another instance where we were supposed to clean gutters and their method was tying a rope around one person climb to the top while the other person is also tied on to the other side\nthe rope. Nothing was securing either individual. This was very dangerous and  the rooftops were very steep. But some employees went along with this process I refused.These people need to be held accountable for there actions and the tenants are right. There are several complaints. There was a guy complaining the day I got fired he was very upset. This is an cancerous organization. I may be labeled as an upset individual and that may be correct . But what I am is a fair individual and I as well as these employees and tenants were and are being treated unfairly.\n\nThes people are Slum Lords I expressed this to one of the employees that still works therer. He may have well been apart of my firing as well. Because the day I said this to him is the day I got fired.\n\nMyself and the two mexicans were the only minority there. Ever one else was White. I dont want to play the race card I'm just stating facts\n\nAll people share this this", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1571342479796, "text": "Blackwell Nelson adheres to fair labor practices.

We often had to wonder who was managing who, because basic issues that should be easily addressed required repeated follow-up with you to make sure it got done.  For example, one of our condo owners had to actually drive to the post office to pick up their mail for close to two months because mail carriers would no longer deliver mail to a box that had no door and we couldn\u2019t get this company to address getting the mailbox replaced in a timely manner.

BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY. My husband, our one-year-old son, and I have experienced horrible flooding in our unit three times in the past 6 months. The neighbors behind us have experienced this as well. The first time this occurred we had to stay with relatives while they replaced the insulation and drywall for most of the walls in the apartment, as the flood was ankle-deep in almost every room of the unit, but they refused to do anything about the reason for the flooding in the first place. Neighbors informed me that the tenants that were here before us dealt with the same issue. Their drain for groundwater to not get it in the apartment is literally a cubic foot and the whole entire area is mud with nothing to catch any water. The next time this happened they refused to pay for any more than 1 week hotel stay when we were informed that the dry out alone was going to take three days. At first they said that they were going to fix the drywall and the floors (which now have mold growing from the previous flood), but then changed their mind. They also sent an email stating that they were in no way responsible for any of this and that the week hotel stay that they were offering was a generous act they were providing. If anyone reading this review would like to see screenshots of that I will happily email them to you. Thankfully our landlord is not a greedy crook like McKay and is letting us out of the lease since McKay management refuses to work with her on any of these issues. We have been packing to move into our new house, and we woke up at 2 a.m. this morning, because our child was crying. When we got out of bed our feet immediately splashed into water. Once again the whole entire apartment is flooded. Thankfully since I knew it was going to storm we had most of our belongings stacked on our couch and countertops to hopefully not have any more of our things ruined. This company would rather people live in a molded apartment that floods all the time WHERE A TODDLER LIVES, than to shell out any money to fix an issue that is without a doubt their fault. So before you move into anywhere where it is overseen by McKay management think again, and be prepared that if any issues arise,0 they will not be taken care of properly, and you will probably have to spend a whole lot of money out of pocket to pay for things that they should be paying for. My sister has been a manager at numerous apartment complexes and it is standard for a hotel to be paid for if your unit is damaged due to something that is the management company's fault. So I'm taking this public and maybe it'll help the next poor soul that has to live here.\n\nRenter of 2829 D at Colonial Park (you can see another review referencing this same building)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889225483498e91:0x2a4b818ecfe9ade2"}

I will say this, it had to take a review such as this to get them to make something happen... They did apologize though... i don't how sincere she was but I accept it... bottom line I was wrongfully charged and they made it right... hooray for mckay!!!\n\nReveiw 1 of 2 April 3th 2018\n\nApril 17 2018 now!!!\n\nI havent recieved a call yet in response to this review I placed 2 weeks ago...\n\nI moved to  Park Trace in April 2016... I'm married with three children a dog and my mother lives with me...   We are black Americans and my wife and I , which are disabled veterans have proudly served in the United States Armed Forces ( Air Force and Army).\n\nI'm not going to tell about every experience but will touch on the main ones because I may have to take Mckay to court before we sell our house because I'm sure I will have Lein on my property after this reveiw.\n\nJust to put it out there, I have received a letter saying I have to pay over 1000 dollars in fines for a sidewalk I did not paint... The fine is supposed to accrue late fees and it has been a few months and I haven't recieved anything in regards to the fine accruing late fees...\n\nNow, I would like to start by saying McKay never showed up to closing and we never recieved any correspondence covering the bylaws, rules or covenants... We recently learned that the swim and tennis club was separate from the actual hoa Mckay... so we had to pay two years of past dues... which is okay-but an inconvience. No one noticed that this was issue? I had to take two years for them to tell us this, wow!\nBefore we could get moved in good we recieved a letter stating that we need to move the trash from the street which was left by the previous owner and even though a bulk trash collector comes regularly to pick up this type of trash yet they still wanted us to have this removed and our name was also on the letter so it was not directed towards the previous owner... I did not think anything of it...\n\nWe recieved another letter stating we have to rid our yard of weeds and we did... but we received another and there was no weeds present... so I emailed them to come out and show us where the weeds were and we recieved no response to date...\nI recieved another letter, among other that I did not mention, for over 1000 dollars for a sidewalk and stairs that were painted  before we acquired the property.\nBTW I HAVE ALWAYS RECORD EVERY PHONE CALL EVEN BEFORE MOVING HERE TO PARK TRACE.\n\nI have sent them proof that these things were painted before we moved in from Google earth... My neighbors also know this and will testify in court on our behalf...\n\nThis all started when our neighbors' dogs were let loose to deficate, urinate and run our company of friends off...\nI tried to resolve this with our neighbors before call the Dog man... he has had this problem with them before...\n\nI have talked to my mental health doctor and I still feel like I'm walking on eggshells around my very own home.\n\nIt should never be this hard to live in something you are paying for...\n\nI told them I will not be paying this because it is false and instructed them to take me to court but they say they will not take us to court and that's probably because they can put a lien on your property for non patment.  And if you take them to court they will find a loop hole or some kind of wiggle room with the high profile lawyers they have in place... in the end you they will get your property because ymif you lose you will have to pay your lawyer and their lawyer fees which will be on the thousands and the end result? Well, you will lose your home...\n\nI have sent in recording and they said I'm still go in to pay... I've called and talked to a lady, will not display her name here but she had hung up on me when I told her I will try something else... she hung unmistakably hard and it was loud and I have it recorded as well.\n\n*****TO BE CONTINUED *****", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1522613409357, "text": "Hello Jill, we're very sorry to hear that you're disappointed with the service that you've received thus far from McKay Management.

One person asked me to send pictures of my issue with my unit area and I did. No response. When I went to my first HOA meeting that person was there. When I brought up my issue I realized the lady I had spoken too on the phone with was at the meeting. The blank and frozen posture she had when I said I haven\u2019t heard back confirmed that she was the one I had spoken too. I\u2019ve called and sent an email about another issue with no response. Reading all these reviews and seeing the blanket response continously given saying we are sorry you are disappointed or having difficulties etc. is laughable to me. If you really care you would return calls and emails and mainly do your job. I don\u2019t expect every request I have to be fixed immediately but I do expect a response to my contacts. I worked retail for many years and have been taught to have excellent customer service. I expect this same service for businesses I deal with yet I rarely see it.\n\nUPDATED REVIEW. I\u2019m giving them two stars now because I finally received a response. The employees I\u2019ve spoken with have always been nice but the lack of response and seeing results is my reason for low stars and negative review.

The charge for the labor was our minimum labor charge and includes the time to go and purchase the materials needed. The costs charged for materials are the actual costs we incur. A copy of the receipt was attached in the e-mail for the drip pans showing the cost and a picture of the stove with no drip pans. The light bulbs that were out were in the master bathroom.\n\nThe ceiling that was painted was the ceiling in the middle bedroom. It had a number of scuffs on the ceiling as well as ribbons stuck to the ceiling. When those ribbons were removed, it took paint off the ceiling. I\u2019ve attached a picture of that as well.\n\nThe charge for painting was a prorated charge. The chart we use from the International Association of Certified Home Inspectors gives interior paint a 10 year life span. The house was painted 6 years ago. That would mean the damage cost 4 years of life of the paint. The total cost of the paint was previously discussed with you. We only charged you for the one ceiling with ribbons on it.\n\nThere was no charge for any cleaning or replacement of carpet or other flooring.\n\nIf you would like to discuss the issue please feel free to call us at 205-682-9106 and we will  provide you more information."}, "gmap_id": "0x888923c884e09865:0xfdb95c2f814f9062"}

I have found the staff at AHI to be extraordinarily professional and willing to rent properties in neighborhoods that other companies have chosen to whine and complain about.

I think that this company will continue to grow and I am very fortunate to have found them.\n\nI told them that if I could ever serve as a person to recommend this company, I want to be such a person.

When we signed the lease there were many things different in the contract than we were told when meeting with an AHI representative, like needing professional cleaners upon move-out. No big deal but it seems like a large entity like AHI could just bundle it in with their own contractors for a better total price, instead of leaving it up to the  tenants to find them. Instead AHI will charge the tenant double of what it would cost to do the same job, then add fees to take away from the deposit. Just seems like a sketchy deal, thankfully we avoided these fees at the warning of some friends who got out of the properties a little while before we did.

I am sorry to hear that you experienced these issues. Your lease began on April 1st. On April 6th you contacted us with complaints about the smell of mold and the condition of the water heater. We considered this to be an emergency case and immediately contacted the homeowner. A vendor was approved to visit the property. Upon inspection the tech found no odor that would be related to organic matter. The home was in need of a good cleaning but there were no visible signs of organic matter as well. The water heater was unable to be checked due to no power being on in the home, the tech did check for leaks and found none in its current state. Other issues throughout the home were noted and included in an estimate, the owner approved for all repairs to be made at your earliest convenience. You refused to schedule with the vendor and requested to terminate the lease. The owner approved your request on April 15th, we are currently in the process of closing your account. If you have any questions please contact our office at 844-793-4948, we will be happy to assist."}, "gmap_id": "0x88891985f1bfc583:0xaa6f2e53245f2f24"}

Within the 60 days we were no longer going to be at that address so I called the office and ask them if they can cancel that check and have it sent to their office and will come pick it up and they said that was fine. We did end up getting the other check before we moved and I held on to it. They told me once to check gets to the office they will call and let us know that it's there. They did not void the check nor resend another one to the office you only have 60 days to get the check and cash it, if it falls within the 60 days you no longer get your $250 back. It would be two months in a week we went ahead and deposited the other check that we already have.\n\nSo just to let you know if you got a criminal background of any kind even if it was just being arrested don't waste your money they will keep the $50 application fee per person and it is non-refundable.

It was our first apartment after getting married. We fell in love with the area and absolutely loved having awesome neighbors and a safe neighborhood. Around the time that we moved out (April 2017), we had a bunch of problems towards the end. We had called up maintenance a lot regarding the flooring bubbling up due to the AC leaking. Also, there was a complete take over of guinea wasps. I had noticed some shavings on the floor towards the sliding glass door.  One weekend our family members came to visit. My aunt had to sleep in the livingroom. When she woke up, she had these AWFUL whelps on her chest and neck.  That's when we found multiple guinea wasps on the floor. Upon further review, we noticed that they were drilling into our ceiling. That's how they were getting into the apartment. Obviously while we were living there, they didn't really do much. One man came an sprayed and then another man came and caulked up the holes the wasps were drilling into the ceiling. We still had a wasp issue, so we continued to spray and caulk the holes ourselves.\n\nI would like to give 4 stars, but the end before moving out was rough. Not only the wasps but our neighbors behind us often left their dogs tied outside on leashes. They were also not the nicest of pooches. They would run at us in the breeze way sometimes.\n\nLiving there drove us to purchasing a house. We are grateful to be our own property managers now. While our stay sucked towards the end, I don't haven't any complaints about the staff. Everyone was extremely sweet.

A lot of what I\u2019ve read on the more recent reviews I find to be very relatable. I\u2019m extremely dissatisfied with my time at Fieldcrest, and I strongly caution anyone else considering an extended stay at these apartments.\n\nI, like most people, simply want to live my life in peace. That is hard at fieldcrest because they are monitoring you and your stuff at nearly all times. My first issue was with my dog. I took my dog out one afternoon and looked over at a congregation of maintenance guys. One of them pointed at me as he was talking to the others. I paid this rude gesture no mind and went on about my business. I got a call minutes later from the front office urging me to pick up my dog\u2019s waste. I don\u2019t remember not performing this duty, especially because I had to buy my own bags on Amazon because their dog waste stations are frequently empty. But it was nice to know I was being watched.\n\nAnother specific issue I had was with my car. I own two cars, one of which is an old project car I\u2019ve had for many years. I don\u2019t keep current tags on it, but I do drive it fairly often. They have a policy that requires all cars to be operational and have current registration. They threw the book at me after a year of already living there. I plead my case, and they showed some leniency. My company was considering me for a transfer out of state so registering my car made no sense. When they were bought out by another holding company, they became very aggressive again threatening to tow my car. I admitted defeat and prepped my car for storage. After telling them this, I received a note that on all caps read, \u201cLAST CHANCE\u201d. This event was very frustrating and made me ill toward them to say the least.\n\nFinally, I was charged upon move out for replacing the carpets. Which is fair. My dog had, to a degree, damaged the carpets.

Another apartment I\u2019ve lived in had a refundable pet deposit that covered those things only if necessary. At fieldcrest, it is a pet fee.

With the exception of maintenance, when I would contact the company, I was usually met with unprofessional customer service or simply did not receive responses. Even while I was giving my 30 day notice, it took me 4 attempts to contact them, twice via email and twice via phone, to receive any information or paperwork.\n\nAfter a storm caused our oven to need to be replaced, it took the company 30 days to finally get us a new oven. I called appliance companies that confirmed they could have gotten us the oven in a third that time even with shipping. When I asked for a concession to compensate for this major inconvenience, I was told that as long as they showed they were making progress, they didn\u2019t owe any concession.\n\nWhen leaving the house, we were given a bill for our entire security deposit plus several hundred more dollars. This is especially frustrating considering that, with the exception of one portion of wall damage that can be fixed with half an hour of labor, all of the damage to the house was either prior damage (which they told me they had catalogued and which should have fixed in between tenants) or normal wear and tear. I never expected to get my whole deposit back, but considering the care and attention we gave to taking care of the house, I was incredibly disappointed.\n\nIn conclusion, if you would like to rent from Becky Hancock, I highly recommend you put aside money for a lawyer or a large payment at the end. But frankly, you\u2019re better off never dealing with this company. Since I have moved, I have only had great experiences with my new property managers.

Becky Hancock refused to replace the AC.\nWe finally moved out in November 2012.  We went on a walk-through with Judy who told us that there were some damages (which we agreed to) but that our security deposit should easily cover it.

Aside from that our, there are many other aspects to consider when selecting a company to oversee your investment when you are not able to do so your self.\n\nI am very confident that the managers never once stepped foot in our property while there were tenants occupying the property. This was huge to us as we found many items that were damaged and not functioning after arriving back 6 years later.\n\nThe quality of cleaning and repairs when the turned the property back over to us was very bad. We had to completely re-clean the entire place. There were many items that required repair, to include the HVAC system and the sprinkler system.\n\nPros:\n- 90% occupancy rate at or above market value.\n- Never missed a payment.\n- Online management software makes it easy to keep track of financial records\n\nCons:\n- Did not uphold their end of the co tract with respect to quarterly visits to the property.\n- Terrible job keeping up with the condition of the property an appliances. (Preventative maintenance)\n- Very bad post rental cleaning standards. I am sure they require more from the tenants when they move out then they actually did for us.

So, if you are a clean individual who returns your place in the same or better condition, you are looking at a minimum of $300 in cleaning fees, $200 carpet cleaning fees, and $50 for pest control. You will be charged that regardless of what you do. Then expect wall damage to be $200+ for normal wear or tear, and higher for anything more. In closing, go through a private renter, or stay on Ft.

The difference between the two was night and day. At Becky Hancock I felt like I was a valued customer. From the day that that I first walked in with my wife to look at houses through our year as a tenant we were always given great service. The apartment we rented turned out to have significant problems, however, that was compensated for by the prompt and friendly customer service we always received when we called Becky Hancock to get things repaired. When we moved on to our next duty station, the apartment cleaning options with Becky Hancock were much more tenant friendly than they had been with Realty Executives and we were only charged for what were truly damages. Our experience with Becky Hancock wasn't 100%, however, it was light years ahead of our experiences with Realty Executives. When the Army moves us back to Rucker we will be renting from Becky Hancock again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88926fa7d513399d:0xd479345346f6500b"}

I'm military and I bought a house from Butch Wright from Re/Max when I PCS'd he I elected for his company to be my property. Everything was great until he retires and Becky Hancock realty bought him out. That is when everything went down hill. 1st off their ability to call you back is non-existant, Belinda is the absolute worst property manager maybe on Earth. She doesn't know how to speak intelligently on the status of your property. She also is terrible at doing move out inspections. Here is why. I had multiple tenants while under Belinda's keen eye. After I closed out my account the fridge was missing trim, my lawn mower was gone and some how she doesn't have any record of it. There were holes in the walls that cost way more then $150 to fix but only charged the tenants $150. Someone had a cat and when I walked in it smelled aweful. Carpet I never was reimbursed for mismatched and appeared to be pieces together. Like a tenant stained or ripped it and put a patch bandaid on it. They lost the two garage door openers that I had with the house. They gave me to two in return but neither of them work. They didn't checked the backyard at all. There are places along the fence where dogs dug and tenets filled it in with random metal pieces and rocks.  Those are just problems with Belinda. Now for the actual company. Their bookkeeping is horrible. And the owner statements I receive do not match or add up to the completely different system the book keeper uses. I found this it at move out when somehow a vacant house used $700 in four months paying only water and electric bills. I strongly suggest never ever working with this company. Lastly managers are non existent I asked to speak with a manager every time Belinda did not call me back. Yet I spoke to them 1 time in multiple years.

For starters, the owner would randomly show up on our property without any notice. The lease clearly stated that the owner was to give us at least 3 days notice before coming onto the property, but she never did. There was another instance where she had some random guy come to work on our fence at 7am, no notice at all. We woke up immediately panicked by a stranger on the property. He didn\u2019t knock, and didn\u2019t tell us why he was there until my fianc\u00e9 went out to ask him. Even the exterminator guy was like, \u201coh she didn\u2019t tell y\u2019all I was coming?

They said that we would get back our security deposit by mail. I just received our deposit back and it is $170 less than it should be, along with a fat cleaning invoice.

No malice intended.\n\nI rented a property from this company from 9/15 to 2/18. I met the owner of Southern Oak, Blake, at the property two weeks prior to move in. There were several small maintenance issues he assured me would be fixed before I moved in:\n\n- No exterior lights working (bulbs)\n- Carpet had very noticeable stains and cigarette burns in multiple places.\n- Carpet had ripples in multiple rooms, needed to be stretched.\n- 6\"x12\" hole in master bedroom closet drywall where they had repaired a damaged water spigot but did not repair the drywall\n- Return air grill was damaged and would not latch.\n- Refrigerator door shelves were broken and taped together.\n\nThey replaced the return air grill, and stretched the carpet, that was it. The guys that stretched the STAINED/BURNED carpet did not even vaccuum afterwards, carpet fibers everywhere. I needed to move in ASAP so I overlooked being too lazy to replace a few light bulbs, repair a drywall hole, and covered the cigarette burns in the carpet with furniture.\n\nFrom this point on this company was reasonable. My problem with them was at move out. There was no move in/move out documentation done. The move out inspection consisted of meeting Blake at the property where he walked around for 5 minutes. It took weeks to get my deposit back. When I finally did get a check back for my deposit it was $170 short. No letter explaining why, no phone call explaining why, nothing. After multiple phone calls to their office looking for an explanation they told me the carpet was not \"professionally cleaned\".

They earned their 1 star review.\n\n***If you rent from this company, heavily document the move in condition of the property, or you'll be paying for it later.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886286829fd26653:0x7530f712f641eefc"}

I try to always pay my dues, assessments, and any increases in dues on time and without complaint.\n\nHowever, this HOA management company leaves much to be desired. The management company's point of contact for my neighborhood could not be reached by phone. Eventually after numerous phone calls, her assistant answered and did not want to transfer me to the point of contact.\n\nI have two properties in this neighborhood and I could not determine which property email correspondence was referencing due to the lack of clarity of neither address being mentioned in the message. I was told I had no email address on file, yet I had email traffic. I was charged $500 to \"set up a new account\" when I purchased a second property in the neighborhood although it was apparent that both properties were under one account when the HOA worker offered to balance the credit and deficit between the two properties.\n\nAmounts could not be explained including what was owed to the company and credits showing on the statements to me.\n\nThe HOA management amount provided for a home closing statement could not be explained and was blamed on the closing attorney. However, the sellers were required to pay the HOA management company for determining this number. It was explained to me that this is handled by an entirely different branch within the company and could not be addressed by the HOA Management representative assigned to my neighborhood.\n\nThis inefficient and ineffective management of my neighborhood dues and the convoluted manner to determine the status of a homeowner's present financial standing with the HOA, along with the collection of fees from closing agents/attorneys to ascertain the status of a property owner's HOA account, and coupled with the collection of a $500 account set up fee each time the same person buys another property in neighborhood,  leaves me with a bad taste regarding where the genuine interest of this particular neighborhood management company lies. I have become convinced that the quality of my neighborhood is not the really important part. Rather it is the profit margin for this management company.\n\nI would greatly discourage utilizing this management company until their priority of your neighborhood's quality of life is clearly of greater prioritization than nickel and dime-ing homebuyers, closing agents/attorneys, and homeowners, without even the courtesy of simple explanations regarding their bookkeeping.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1611943154397, "text": "Hi Paige. First, we\u2019d like to say thank you for your review. Your satisfaction is very important to us, and we hate to hear that you\u2019ve been dissatisfied. We have investigated each individual issue you have presented here in an effort to clear things up and see where there may be opportunity for growth within our company. We do apologize for any lack of communication or miscommunication. In our examination of your account and community, we\u2019d like to offer some clarification. The $500 fee you speak of is an initiation fee specific to your community billed by the developer to fund association operations. This is not a fee from Neighborhood Management in your community nor any other communities that we manage, in fact we actually do not get a single dollar of that fee. We simply collect it on the developer\u2019s behalf. As you mentioned, you have two properties in this community. The email confusion was due to the brand new account being made. We had your email on the older account but not the new one. That has since been updated. In an effort to make this a smoother process for you, we offered to merge ledgers which would in turn merge your accounts; however, you stated you were not interested in doing that. We can still merge them if you\u2019ve changed your mind, just let us know and we\u2019ll get right on it! Lastly, there are some additional details pertaining to your account that our VP of Association Management will be reaching out to you with in an effort to not reveal any personal information of yours here.

Alabama law states HOA companies must give property owners written notice of the assessment and lien by personal delivery OR 1st class mail and they DID NOT!

If this differential treatment continues I will be forced to file a lawsuit naming Monica Eubanks personally and Neighborhood Management separately for detrimental effects to my health due to the stress caused by the constant threats from letters of violations and fines. I know there are other home owners in the neighborhood that would like to end the contract with Neighborhood Management. I will be pushing for this in the next meeting coming up this month. Bye Bye Neighborhood Management. You will be gone from Chelsea Station soon!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888919841987d80f:0x887228cd37e91bba"}

When I initially asked the front desk clerk if it would be okay to pay my 1st months rent,  and since I was there, give her a check for the upcoming months rent. I don't live in Montevallo and the property I was renting was in Alabaster. So since you can't pay rent online, I gave the post dated check so that I wouldn't have to drive back to Montevallo. I was assured TWICE by the clerk that this was okay. Fast forward after I paid my initial deposit as well as first month's rent. They decided to also deposit my post dated check for the upcoming month. Leaving me with an NSF due to the fact that the postdated amount wasn't accounted for in my monthly budget. ESPECIALLY after you already received $2,000 from me within a weeks time. I called and spoke with JOSH who verbally assaulted me and basically called me a criminal for writing bad checks. After he informed me that it's not their policy to take a post dated check and he doesn't know where I got that info from. I LITERALLY GOT IT FROM THE FRONT DESK  CLERK!!!! HE took no ownership, did not apologize, complained about a $50 fee he would have to pay b/c of my returned check and then hung up in my face. The crazy thing about this whole situation is that the check cleared on my end. My bank LITERALLY cleared the check and just charged me an NSF fee. All I wanted was my $30 back. He didn't even have the human decency to listen to what I was telling him before becoming beligerent!! This company is the absolute worst that I have ever dealt with in my life.

The checklist we completed upon move in said the kitchen was filthy and hadn\u2019t been cleaned, the walls needed paint, noted the broken electrical outlets and the nails/holes left from the previous tenant. We had to SCRUB this place. Not to mention all the spiders we dealt with for a month because you hadn\u2019t been taking care of pest control. We would have noted the uncontrollable bamboo, but it was February and it wasn\u2019t growing in the cold months. How can you even begin to think we caused a bamboo problem? The owner himself said he had tried to get rid of it \u201cfor years\u201d. Exact words. Once again he himself saw the yard mowed before we moved out. When I went to check the yard on 5/13, it had not been TOUCHED since we left. All you do is blame your negligence on other people. From the yard to the unmanaged interior.\n\nThe water infiltration issue in the BEDROOM FLOOR was not due to \u201cmassive flooding\u201d. EVERY TIME IT RAINED, water came through the flooring. And EVERY TIME it happened, you were notified and offered zero assistance in fixing the issue. This is not something that happened just once. I will be sure to find the business card from the man who came out from community development and assured me that if I called him the next time there was visible water coming through that he could see with his own eyes that they would condemn the house until the issue was fixed. I also have two other witnesses who were at the house for that conversation. We told them not to worry about it because we were getting out of the house to which he said \u201cI don\u2019t blame you, I\u2019d hire an attorney\u201d. He also said that a mold expert would need to come out to test the MOLD AND MUSHROOMS. Even your maintenance man left the house to get himself a mask so that he wouldn\u2019t be breathing in the mold when you sent him to the house after LYING saying that YOU would send a mold expert out. This is all documented. Every single bit of it. You \u201callowed\u201d us to move out because you knew you were caught. Anyone with common sense will be able to see that. You said yourself \u201cthe mold will dry out. It\u2019s about to be warm outside\u201d.\n\nYou can try to justify it all you want, but mushrooms growing in a bedroom is not normal. I was sick for a solid week after stirring it up while moving.\n\nNot fixing a water infiltration issue that you\u2019ve known about for who knows how long? Negligent, irresponsible.\n\nBottom line- I\u2019m not here to argue with you as it clearly gets us nowhere. That\u2019s what attorneys are for. I can back up everything I\u2019ve stated, unlike you.

This house is in Albertville, an hour and a half away from our office, way too far to be a desirable listing. You begged us to manage this house with your tenants already installed, because you felt all the local people were criminal and corrupt. Against our better judgement we decided to help you out. You didn't want us to send you any rent money while tenant was there, hoping they would buy house and use those funds to help with their closing costs. Your tenants were dead beats, stopped paying rent and were promptly removed. They left the house in terrible shape, with rotting food in fridge, human waste in toilet, old rusting and broken down appliances, a severe cockroach infestation and a property resembling a land-fill with all the construction debris and trash strewn about evenly over an acre of land. The utility bill was attached to their final account with the back rent and other expenses. Their account was referred to collections when they refused to pay what was owed. When they were gone, you wanted us to list this property for sale. We reluctantly agreed to help you here as well. With your permission, we used the meager available funds as best we could to clean property and house for selling. This involved 2 guys over 3 days and 8 round trips with a 30 foot trailer filled with garbage hauled from the property. The house had to be seriously detrashed, scrubbed down and treated for cockroaches. We did the absolute best we would with what funds were available, spending more in fact than what was available in order to clean up completely. But, we were still about $10,000 short of what was needed to get the home ready for habitability, much less marketability and you refused to spend anything more.

I\u2019m here for this review to warn the next renter of the nightmare that is Darin Bashaw, and how poorly this property has been maintained. First and foremost, false advertisement. This is not a 3 bedroom home. It\u2019s a 2 bedroom (one of which is COVERED in mold) and has a sunroom that directs you to the back yard (that is an uncontrollable BAMBOO FOREST). It is NOT a clean home, but rather the complete opposite. This house is NASTY. When we moved out after only 2.5 months, there were MUSHROOMS growing in the bedroom and bathroom. Absolutely NOTHING was done about a water infiltration issue that we reported to Darin 3 weeks after move-in, which resulted in us having to send an official letter to move out without penalty. As if that weren\u2019t enough, we weren\u2019t informed of the uncontrollable bamboo growing in the yard. When we moved out, the yard was mowed, yet Darin stole $120 of my deposit that he was supposed to return \u201cdue to neglect of the yard\u201d THAT HE HADNT EVEN MOWED WHEN HE STOLE MY MONEY. He let that yard grow for TWO SOLID WEEKS after we moved out. The OWNER OF THE HOUSE saw it mowed with his own eyes when he came to check on his house after the CITY came and wrote them up for all kinds of things that needed to be fixed but weren\u2019t. This includes electrical outlets, DRY ROTTED WOOD, poorly sealed doors, the shed out back, and who knows what else. They have not had time to tackle the mold issue since we moved out. I know this because I was there last week 5/13 to get my mail and check out the yard. They hadn\u2019t even cleaned. I know this because the overflowed trash was still sitting in the carport and hadn\u2019t even been taken to the road for pick up. This was such a terrible experience that we now have a lawyer so that we no longer have to deal with this man. I have pictures and videos of this entire experience, which include Darin cussing my husband and being completely irate when we returned the keys. All I can say is TRUST THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. This man ROBBED me of my deposit and three months worth of rent and let my family move into a MOLD INFESTED HOME. He is a crook and a PITIFUL excuse for a professional.

You weren't able to make it?\"  Well, no, no one said it was ready.  We meet at their office Saturday to sign the lease, get keys, and of course hand over money...then we go to the house.  Not cleaned.  Text the mgr to let him know it's not clean and he replies \"The carpet and linoleum are brand new, so you should be able to move your furniture into the house. I will see if I can get someone back, though it has been cleaned and may not get any cleaner looking.\"  No, this isn't cosmetic, this is filthy and lazy. That evening I email several pics of the house and receive no reply.  Three days later still no reply so I call him.  I say hello and who I am, to which he replies \"yeah?\".  I say I'm calling for an update on the house being cleaned.  He says it is clean, just not to MY standards.  He says the carpet and linoleum are new, to which I reply that doesn't mean the house is clean.  I asked him about the pic I sent of the AC return vent.  His reply was that there's a filter.  Oh, so the filth caked up on the outside is ok because there's a filter.  I ask about the storm shelter.  He says they cleared it out.  Well, my pics show otherwise.  I ask about the closet with trash on the shelf and animal hair all over the floor, how a broom has never touched the floors and that I don't want to put my groceries on the filthy pantry shelves.  He replies that he has been doing this a long time, that any other person would've moved in already, how much they have already spent getting the property ready, and that I obviously require extra care so he'll send someone back out tomorrow.  After being insulted I suggested that maybe this isn't the right thing for us and what can we do.  He said we've already signed the lease so nothing.  I asked if this is what we should expect over the course of our lease and he replied that it's up to us, not him, said have a nice day and hung up on me.\n\n**And in response to the records indicating the move in is next weekend and you \"agreed\" to early move in...that is simply incorrect.  Your records may show that as an estimated date but then why would I be told on Dec 4 that the house could probably be finished up by Friday (Dec 7)?  Doesn't make sense. If the house simply wasn't going to be ready then I would've preferred that answer over being stressed that it really wasn't yet.  But I am very appreciative of the effort to have someone out so quickly to clean.

She moved into an apartment we had been managing for exactly one day. The first time I looked at unit was when I showed to her, it wasn't ready by our standards to move into, but she had a moving truck full and wanted it immediately. We honored her request and conducted the screening and had new lease prepared the same day, letting her move in to the apartment in existing condition. She complained immediately about a leaking sink drain in kitchen. The property manager himself fixed that sink within an hour. She had a couple of other minor complaints and was instructed to properly submit service requests through the tenant portal, so maintenance can can get on them most efficiently. To date, she has never submitted a service request appropriately. She was quiet until July 18, when she just came back from a trip and said the fridge went out and all her food was spoiled. I was going to send someone to take a look, but she also said it was working again. Next, she started texting the property manager after hours on Friday July 20th, and then angry texting on Saturday the 21st at around bedtime. She was informed that nothing can be done over the weekend and maintenance would check first thing on Monday. Maintenance did go out on Monday and determined the fridge needed to be replace, she also mentioned the water heater didn't work. Water heater was discovered to have a leak at electrical control panel, causing it to short which is something we considered an emergency, and water heater was replaced the same day that Monday. We have contractual obligation to address any non-emergency issues over $300 with owner prior to spending their money. Sometimes it may take a few days to get in touch with the owner for directions, which will delay our repair response time. This owner approved for a new fridge on Tuesday and one was ordered immediately. We also have a fiduciary responsibility to  owners and have found the most expedient and affordable way to get new appliances is to order online, where we can shop the best deals and take advantage of free delivery and hauling of old appliances. When we do order, we always order something in stock for next or 2 day delivery. In this case, for whatever reason, Lowe's needed a couple of extra days but still, a new refrigerator was delivered by the end of the week. We also have a legal responsibility to tenants to address any health and safety issues within a 2 week time frame. Even if we cannot get in touch with owners or get adequate instructions, we will go out of our way to meet our legal obligations, while also meeting our fiduciary obligations. We strongly recommend our tenants carry renters insurance so they can file a claim for any damages or spoiled food."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626b541142b879:0xeeab7a8b31596fa"}

Was treated horribly because of my skin color. My girlfriend put in her application for an apartment which basically got approved but her boss wouldn't verify employment over the phone (that's okay and a safe thing to do). Instead of letting her know of the problem, she received no notification. She called to find out days later about the status of her application because she heard nothing from them at all and was told of the problem. For a company needing to fill spots, since empty spots cost money instead of make money, this is a very horrible way for employees to be. When she put in her deposit and we asked about a receipt, we were told the receipt from the money order was enough (the tear off tab). I guess receivership of money doesn't require a receipt for this company or Brittany doesn't understand how a receipt actually works.

This is one of the most disorganized and frustrating realty companies I have ever had the displeasure of having to work with. The shame is that the apartment itself is quite nice, even if it wasn't cleaned before I moved in.\n\nInitially, after Red Rock tried to overcharge me, I was charged twice for my security deposit. Then, when moving in, I was told that the only way to pay my first month's rent was through security deposit and that I had to drop it off in person at their office. What a thoroughly archaic way to collect rent! On top of the fact that their office hours prevent you from actually getting to their office if you have a full time job. Regarding their hours, even if you call while they are supposedly open, never once have they actually answered the phone. And good luck receiving a timely callback if you leave a message, as it takes at least a week for them to respond.\n\nFast forward two months, and I receive a notice of 2 months back rent due plus a late fee and my security deposit. Not only have they lost the record of my security deposit, they failed to note that they already charged me TWICE for it. After spending 2 days on the phone and numerous assurances from multiple employees there that everything is settled, I hope it doesn't happen again. Next month comes along, and I am told I am being threatened with eviction due to $1300+ back rent missing from their records. I am still awaiting a call back regarding this new report of incompetence.\n\nThis company is absolutely horrible when it comes to organization.

I have had water issues personally with water coming up thru my carpet to the vent in the bathroom leaking. To hearing about water it self leaking thru the walls in other apartments. To an upstairs neighbor being out of town with a leaking toilet that then started leaking in another apartment below them and maintenance taking days to show up and fix their issue. March of 2017 I called about water coming up thru my carpet and took me calling multiple times to \u201cfix\u201d said issue.

Now I have tested positive for mold in both my living room and bedroom. I did an air test kit myself, so I now know and have proof of it.

I am not trying to cause issues, I just want to be able to leave and move on with my life to better my health.

Read the reviews online. I moved into an apt and 3 days later the worst odor I ever smelt in my life and I had to suffer it for 3 1/2 months before the owner would come out and he was so low down he came out when I wasn't there and removed a dead animal from a crawl space. I saw a dead possum at the end of my building. I made numerous calls & Mark the owner  never  do you need anything  for over 3 months He didn't care. the landlord reduced me to being crazy after the Health Inspector had been to my house twice and sent two letters. The owner said that the letter from the health inspector was not true. I spend a lot of money on Lysol and other products to camouflage the odor and kill the bacteria. the owner to this day still thinks that I don't deserve a dime. and he thinks that he should further punish me by holding my security deposit 5 wks. I have now learned that constructive eviction is not for the tenant it is it is a legal loophole for the landlord to screw you out of your money. Unless you dead or half dead at least in Birmingham Alabama. I finally got the owner to release me from my lease to God be the glory. online reviews or  less than 2.9 now I know why. there was a strong musty odor in the apartment as well.My my eyes would burn a lot I felt my eyeballs were melting . I had headaches & I felt something or someone was dead in the walls to this day I regret not having call the police. Oh I forgot to mention about the so-called preacher Ernest Smith resident manager. Earnest a want to be preacher told as many lies as Mark and red rock. This was the most traumatizing and horrific  ordeal  I do not wish this on anyone. After removing the dead possum from the crawl space I finally got my letter from Mark to release me out of my lease. I moved out the end of June a new tenant moved in the beginning of September. I was told by one of the neighbors a Mexican family moved in at least they had at least two months to clear the air in that particular apartment. Lets name this story the hidden secret why because the apartment was newly renovated. Grandma always said looks are deceiving . I was about a1yr  cancer survivor  and  suffer with COPD with other disabilities. The federal government declared me 100% disabled in the year 2000. Mark the owner apparently thought I was just another hood rat. I lived at 7723 Apartment B 3rd Avenue South. They waited 2 months after I left then moved in a Mexican family. I almost died in there with a stinking possum. I wasn't compensated in anyway. Constructive eviction means nothing in Alabama. Unless you lost a limb or life or a have a class action lawsuit apparently. You call a lawyer and they tell you you should and when you move they tell you to file bankruptcy that's what Jonathan at Legal Aid Society call me with. All the wild suggested that there was no way that legal aid services could assist me. Every 3 months when he's got nothing else better to do he called me stalling till statue has run out. you move they tell you they are glad that you got out of that situation but they can't help you. Calling legal aid is a waste of your doggone time. Constructive eviction as far as I can see is a legal loophole for the landlord to screw you anyway they want to. When you complain they do nothing can't wait till you move don't care about the money you lost. It cost me $1,500 to move in there and $1700 for me to find another place to live. I moved twice in the same year. Everytime Jonathan at Legal Services have nothing else better to do he gives me another call with another bright idea. Is Young still trying to learn his role but I do not appreciate him calling him wasting my time acquiring the same info he got the first time stalling. Whenever you get time Google constructive eviction.

The receptionist called him to let him know that I was there and he said he was on his way back to the office. 15 minutes later she tells me that she saw him pulling into the parking lot that he will be in in a moment. 10 minutes later she said that he is standing in the parking lot and is on his cell phone. Waited 15 more minutes before I finally got up and walked out of their office and left. Upon returning to my office I emailed him (trying to be courteous) to let him know that I understand that he may have been busy but I would like to reschedule our meeting. He never did try to contact me back after all the wasted time that I spent setting a confirmed appointment with him, driving to his office, and sitting in the lobby for over a half hour for our scheduled meeting.

We received our full deposit back plus a return of overpayment on the last month of rent. We were not charged or blamed for any damage caused by previous tenants, and there was a good bit.\n\nIn my opinion, a lot of the housing in\nEnterprise is getting older and more run down. That's just the type of housing you are likely to find around here. At one point, someone came over to our home and asked what we paid a month. He was shocked because of the state of the house and said we were overpaying for its condition. We did have issues at the home a few times, but all work orders were addressed quickly, and the companies sent  out were kind, professional, and efficient.\n\nAs far as the staff at Prestige, some were great and some were meh. The longer we worked with them, the more friendly the office seemed overall. I do not know why.\n\nUltimately, what led us to move was 1) We had a nicer home lined up, for cheaper, elsewhere. 2) We wanted to be closer to work 3) When we were initially looking to move we called the office to inquire about a listing. The woman who answered the phone was very snappy and grumpily said \"No\", to sum it up. It made we wonder if she had known we were currently tenants, would she have been that rude? Did they not care if they thought we wouldn't/couldn't be a paying tenant?\n\nOverall, no. I would not recommend this company or be likely to work with them again. That is based off my experience renting elsewhere in the past and knowing there are better companies.\n\nI would also like to make a note that when moving out you have the option to let Prestige set up the move out clean themselves and oversee the quality of the cleaning. I feel doing this is better than putting in the work yourself only to be told to hire someone afterwards, etc. If you have them hire the cleaners and there is an issue with the cleanliness, the cleaners are responsible for fixing it at no cost to yourself. The cleaners on their list are aware of these rules, etc, to my knowledge. The total cleaning cost was $460 for us, which included the home and carpet.

She didn't come out and show us the property upon our arrival, we had to get the keys from her office and then drive to the property ourselves. It was not cleaned, painted, or repaired. I notated all of that in our move-in paperwork, and my husband requested someone come fix our washing machine and it never happened so he had to fix it himself. During our 2 years there, Theresa never checked on us, which we thought was very odd and worrisome for ANYONE that would choose to have Prestige manage their property. I emailed Theresa at one point about a rotting tree in the back yard and if we could remove it, she said she would email the owner, but then never got back to me and during the next storm this 15 ft tree fell over in the back yard. We had to spend the next weekend digging the roots out, hand sawing it to pieces and replanting grass. We also had an issue with our air conditioner not working, the company came to repair it but didn't properly fix it and Prestige tried to charge us for it, and two months later our unit flooded. Upon move out, Theresa had VERY poor communication, what took my other property managers a day to sign and handle, took her weeks if not longer. We were in another country and it was over a month later before she gave us back our security deposit. Not professional, not timely. Upon speaking with other people in the area that have rented through Prestige, having issues is a common thread. I was told by workers that came to fix our air conditioner that Prestige homes requested them to not speak about any issues with the unit with the tenants, which I thought was odd because if it was something we did, I'd like to know so it doesn't happen again. He said it was their way of controlling the tenants disputing costs. Then the move out cleaner informed me that she hasn't been getting paid by Prestige homes and they were weeks behind.\nThey aren't being recommended by the military community.\n\nEdit: While we were in the process of moving out, Theresa  already had potential tenants checking out the apartment by themselves - prior to her viewing the condition of the property herself.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88926e95a752d9ef:0x499132490a68349b"}

It was so filthy that our 5 person family all got sick with bacterial infections. We were told it had been cleaned prior to move in. After 2 phone calls, several e-mails and my husband finally having to go to the office and provide pictures of the black grout, food still stuck in the microwave and on the ceiling, filthy tubs, toilets and walls, burnt out lightbulbs, broken sinks and windows so filthy you could write a name in the coating of grease and dirt. These things are just a few of the issues. They sent a cleaning lady who told us with annoyance  \"The windows are not my responsibility, the food caked on the ceiling isn't what we do.\" There was dried milk on the wood area of the bar and we were told \"thats not milk and will never come off.\" I used to own a cleaning business and I knew better. of course, it wiped off with a wet paper towel.They stayed on the phone for 20 minutes, while taking breaks to tell me what great friends she is with Wendy.  This was an attempt to shut me up. She poured large amounts of water and solution onto the floor and smeared it around. I had to clean it myself to avoid damage. The microwave, refrigerator, and one bathroom REMAIN broken, a panel from the fence is still missing, the painting the handyman did prior to our moving in is still not fixed. Our AC unit has been dumping gallons of water every few minutes. I have called 4 times for the AC unit only to be ignored. We have provided pictures of everything in our home that was broken and been ignored. We've spoken to the highest person we can find at Prestige Homes and still everything remains broken and now our AC unit threatens to ruin the natural hardwood floors and we've been blown off 4 times. To the point that a work order was issued last week for the AC upon my first call only to be told this morning that our work order had been deleted. Maybe the staff has a personal vendetta because we, as tenants, have tried to force them to do their jobs. Unfortunately, they remain negligent. We own rental properties ourselves and I can say that after years of experience this is not how a property management company operates. If you are looking at a house offered by this company please turn and run as fast as you can. They are negligent to the point of being almost unlawful. They are dishonest and will lie right to your face. We were told \"6 of the walls have fresh paint\" only to be given the run around about that blatant lie upon moving in. 5 bedroom homes aren't easy to find here. We wanted a nice home in a safe neighborhood for our family so that we could begin to build a life here in this town that we love. We pay our rent on time and take care of our home, even months after moving in I am still scrubbing the filth from the previous tenants that they told us they took care of. Nothing you can do as a tenant will get through to these people. They make a living by collecting their proceeds from the rent and then turning their back on their responsibilities as a property management company. If you're a tenant with the same problems we've experienced then I urge you to tell others about this lying, manipulative company. Wendy was our agent and the one who told all the lies, however the office manager has also lied to our faces and failed to make sure her maintenance staff takes care of broken appliances, AC Units, and broken fences that pose a safety risk for my young child. I urge you to contact the homeowner of your property, email and phone numbers are a matter of public record and are easily accessible. Please tell your homeowner about this awful company. I know my homeowners believe that they are getting what they pay for, but in reality Prestige Homes is committing theft and fraud by taking the homeowners money and not holding up to their end of the contract agreed upon by the homeowner and the management company. I urge you to tell everyone you see looking at homes offered by this awful fraudulent company to run the other way.

Many of the negative reviews have nothing really to do with EHM.  They only enforce the covenants that we as a community have in place.

Absolutely not the case with Elite, as I have yet to receive a voicemail box during work hours.\n\nThere app is very helpful.  I have not encountered another company using one.  I am sure some do but I am just saying it is a plus.  Email responses are super fast.\n\nFor the reviewer that complained of Elite not keeping streets cleaned/street swept!!!  Really??  Just Really??  Address that with your HOA board members and have them allocate funds to have it done.  Elite will then ensure it is handled, I can assure you of the latter.

As other reviewers have mentioned, these are lovely properties managed by a very problematic owner. When my husband and I moved out we cleaned and mopped every inch, left no damages whatsoever, then asked the landlord (Ms. Nikki Evans) about scheduling a walkthrough so we could get our deposit back and identify any concerns on her end that we might have missed. She texted us back saying that there was no need for a walkthrough because she\u2019d been to the unit since we\u2019d left, that \u201cwe left it very clean,\u201d and that returning the deposit wouldn\u2019t be an issue. Great, we thought.\n\nFast forward two months later and still no deposit (to be fair she was still within the 60-day window noted in the lease) \u2013 and only after repeated calls and texts did we get her to respond (a regular problem noted by other online reviews). She finally sent back the deposit weeks after she said she would, and it was two-hundred dollars short. We were shocked. When we asked for an explanation, Ms. Evans said the place was \u201cfilthy\u201d and that she had to add a cleaning charge. Since we had screenshots of her texts (which I\u2019d post here if it wasn\u2019t prohibited) extolling how clean the place was, and of us asking for a walkthrough to avoid this very situation, we thought she must have been confusing us for some other tenants. When we brought this up she just stonewalled, then talked about how busy she is running the business all by herself, then plain started insulting us. That\u2019s when we started feeling like we\u2019d been swindled.\n\nWe feel like fools. We literally have photographic evidence of Nikki Evans telling us how clean we left the place and insisting there was no need for a walkthrough, then two months after the fact she skims two-hundred dollars from our deposit and when confronted stonewalls and insults us. I realize it was completely our fault for not demanding a walkthrough and recording every minute of it. Long story short \u2013 if you\u2019re a current tenant, definitely insist on a recorded walkthrough or you will have no leverage if/when she pulls the same move. And if thinking about renting here, I urge you to take similar precautions when you move in and out. In our experience, when confronted with the truth she was quick to attack and seemed incapable of holding herself accountable for anything.\n\nTuscaloosa/Northport are small towns (thankfully) and my husband and I both feel pretty low after the whole experience. I\u2019ve tried to make this review as balanced as possible. I understand this is someone\u2019s business/livelihood and wouldn\u2019t post it lightly.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1568926523343, "text": "Victoria, were you informed that the stove and baseboards were dirty?

The kitchen chairs are odd, small and uncomfortable.   There is a small loveseat for 6+ people to share.  The kitchen barely has the necessities for cooking.  The ice maker does not work.  Buy ice!  Bring your own plates, cups, utensils, laundry soap, dishwasher soap, paper towels, cleaning products- including toilet paper.\nThere should be an outside shower somewhere,  but there is not.  There is an outside spigot for you to wash your feet.  There needs to be some outside hooks for hanging towels, etc.\nLet's talk about location.  The cottages are all in a row from the main street.  If you book, ask exactly how far the cottage is from the main road.  You have to walk across a very busy road to get to the beach.  The walk is fairly short, but would be a challenge for little ones.  Not sure where the pic of the road in the ad came from, but it is misleading.\nDon't bring a toddler here.  There are stairs EVERYWHERE.  If you have limited mobility folks in your group, book elsewhere.\nThe swimming pool is tiny and there is not a shower to wash the sand off before you get in.

Unfortunately, they could not so the next slot available was the next business day. The other homes internet should be in range to use as well. If ever an issue, we can usually pick up from one next door or straight across.  I doubled checked our email system report status of each emails sent out to see if reported sent/viewed. All were sent out but not viewed,  so that may be to why you didn't see the information provided about the internet issue.  Also, we keep a FAQ sheet in our homes with contact number for internet on the weekends for after hour issues.  Both Ally and I were at the cottages several times over the weekend, either of us would have been more than happy to bring ice for you or ran to grab some, had we known it was an issue when dropping off other items requested. The after hour number is the best source to text or call, which is our main number. The number is also provided via emails, website, or in house information sheets for any emergency issues such as water leaks, a/c issues, electrical, or plumbing.  We will be sure to have our maintenance take a look since we are now aware its not working properly. We send out check-in instructions with list of all items to expect upon arrival, which is one set up of household items. This list can also be viewed in the rental agreement, FAQ sheet and terms and conditions as well. I will look into other ways to push the information out in the future to help clarify.  We appreciate the suggestions for the outdoor items and will relay to the owners as possible items to add over the next year.\nLastly, we have several photos, videos, and detailed descriptions of our properties in order to ensure every guest is aware of locations and layout of the cottages. Our photos show different angles from different homes interior and exterior.  Video wise we have several tours of the homes and walks to the beach. The walk from the back entrance less than 2 minutes and from the front entrance 1 minute and 30 seconds. Upon arrival at the red light to cross over, the city installed a cross walk, revamped the side walk area which is over 6ft wide, and dropped the speed limit to 25 mph to ensure safety for all crossing to beach areas. Again we do our best to portray our properties as is and to provide more than adequate information readily available on several platforms for viewing.

I put my trust into this company to insure my rental property would be properly managed, besides rent being collected every month. Per the signed agreement, the tenant was responsible for caring for the rental property, such as changing the air filter every 30 days, replacing light bulbs, cleaning the home thoroughly and trash removal upon departure, and notifying (within 7 days) the property management of any damages and/or problems to anything inside or outside of the home. None of these actions were completed by the tenant upon DRES releasing the security deposit.\nI gave the tenant a 30-day notice, August 10-September 10, to vacate the property (also stated in the agreement that there is a 30 day notice unless stated otherwise). I planned for my family and I to move into my home September 11, but they failed to inform me the tenant was not able to relocate until September 13. I had to write to them days before my family and I were going to move in to find out this information.\nI trusted in Dothan Real Estate Services to properly inspect my home after the tenant\u2019s departure. This was not done properly, and the security deposit was released within one week of the tenant\u2019s departure, before I could make an itemized inspection of my own (which is written in the signed agreement). Per the Alabama Code Title 35. Property \u00a7 35-9A-201 \u201cUpon termination of the tenancy, money held by the landlord as security may be applied to the payment of accrued rent and the amount of damages that the landlord has suffered by reason of the tenant's noncompliance with Section 35-9A-301 all as itemized by the landlord in a written notice delivered to the tenant together with the amount due 60 days after termination of the tenancy and delivery of possession.\u201d\nOnce I moved back into my home (5 days after the tenant) there were numerous things that were wrong. The things that were missed by the inspections were: the microwave no longer works, light bulbs in both bathrooms were blown, the sink in the half bath is leaking, air filter was never changed (or at least not for months) which caused my HVAC system to freeze,  the home was very dirty with dust and debris everywhere, garbage and furniture left out by the street, and there was an unauthorized pet that left urine and feces (which I have pictures) in the hall closet. I immediately notified DRES, looking for a solution, and to my surprise they were not willing to help. They even agreed to the wrongful actions, but still would not offer a solution.   I must replace these things and pull up my floors in the hall closet due to the damage of the pet. I only asked for help with the $200 deposit for the unauthorized pet, but they were not willing to help. They violated their own rental agreement by falsifying all the things this company was willing to do.\nThey still have yet to give me a copy of what they did take out of the security deposit and how much the tenant received. I will no longer consider Dothan Real Estate Services for future rentals nor will I give any recommendations to anyone. As an owner, my first home/rental experience was terrible due to the lack of ethics from this business.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2wG87aaFeBJbG5g7j0YEh7sxzzXUNeDUWL7eZ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6b2u6HIJy_fs58F23XsNY_LwUOJ-ifHnPyizC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892924263a9a229:0x3d0a8ef3608105c"}

Unfortunately that was the last thing that was easy or straightforward in regards to dealing with this company.\n\nThe first night in our new place revealed that the kitchen had a major issue with a German cockroach infestation. After playing phone tag for a week, we were able to get someone to come bug bomb our place while we were out of town. Not only was this completely ineffective, they had used a total of two plastic tarps to cover furniture (actually covering an unopened pack of spare plastic tarps) . This left many of our things  to be covered in poison. And as I mentioned, it was completely ineffective. Finally we were able to get the fridge replaced, which got rid of the roaches (at least in our unit).\n\nThe window AC units in the apartment were covered in a black mold. This took over a month to be addressed. When we were able to get some type of maintenance person out, we were given less than an hours notice for something that took over 4 hours to complete.\n\nOur bathroom sink has a leak that has been addressed by the same plumber multiple times without being resolved.\n\nI guess the one other positive I can give them besides how I said in the beginning that they facilitated receiving our security deposit and first month's rent, is that I've heard that many landlords typically don't respond to maintenance requests at all. This seems to be something relegated to Mobile, AL. So I guess good for them for raising themselves slightly above the mantle of \"Mobile Alabama Slumlord\". We try to take care of our place so it can't be called a \"slum\" but I can't speak for the rest of their properties they lord over.\n\nOn that last note about the rest of their properties, this is completely hearsay, but the person who removed the roach infested fridge also wondered out loud \"why they want to move it to another unit if it has roaches in it.\" So maybe I should wish you good luck renting the property that doesn't have the roach fridge.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRYnmbXQYutNTFPUB5Z_vm5hslK-wEXkVApvR0=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZIs-Jk1QXNe0XbD7pYyxkiPwxptdlGIaKlClh=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4e2d040616c5:0xe8febbbf6fd84c07"}

However, all things change and so did their staff.\n\nWe are trying to get our deposit back of one month's rent and they want to charge us $550 for cleaning and who knows what else.\n\nBeware - make sure you get a copy of everything they write down and put on the rental contract or any pictures they take with you during your initial walk  through.\n\nThe owner of the property we rented out lives next door. They had left items in the garage as storage and Rent Experts (Tracy Hidalgo) made it very clear to not touch any of their items and to leave it. She took pictures and made note of it in our contract review.\n\nGuess what? Now, we have moved out and the Rent Experts team wants to charge us for items that don't belong to us that we were told should remain.\n\nHere's the kicker.... they charged us $350 for a \"full Cleaning\" of our house after we moved out. Granted, we weren't a maid service but it was just as good as we moved into it. When we moved in - german cockroach infestation that took forever for them to fix; mold on ceiling of bathroom that they just had some idiot paint over; Nerf guns from owner and jackets from owner that we were told to just LEAVE; dusty fans that we cleaned off; and faulty instructions on the air unit which needed to have bleached poured down its piping to relieve clogs and drainage (which we had to pay to get worked on).\n\nBut I called Rent Experts and spoke with Christian and he said that $350 was a standard, full clean by the company they had go in there and clean. I called up to Rent Experts, due to curiosity, and asked what company charges $350 for a few dusty fans and items that needed to be carried to the curb (that weren't ours). I was told that Rent Experts does the cleaning themselves.\n\nSo, basically, they paid themselves $350 to go in there and \"clean.\"\n\nSTAY ON TOP OF THEM and DO NOT TAKE ANY NON-SENSE OFF OF THEM.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4e2d040616c5:0xe8febbbf6fd84c07"}

Before renting through independence ask yourself \u201cdo I really want to rent from a company who would evict a 5 month pregnant women with asthma during the middle of a pandemic in which a no eviction bill was just passed?\u201d Got a letter at the end of February in the mail stating we were behind on rent (Clearly we were, they had locked us out of the online payment portal), wouldn\u2019t return any phone calls, hung up on my boyfriend the one time Ashley actually picked up the phone, and set the office to appointment only so you couldn\u2019t just walk in to handle matters. That was the only communication we had with them. Fast forward to March 18th when three Madison county sheriff deputies showed up with some crackhead with an attitude and three guys to set my stuff out. I never received an eviction notice and nothing was ever posted on our door. We had the money but were just unable to make the payment due to the poor professionalism exhibited by Robert and Ashley in returning communications. I have been told by many parties to seek legal help and that is exactly what I plan on doing. I was at work and my boyfriend was home when the sherif showed up. In the time it took him to pick me up from\nWork to rent a uhaul they already had most of my stuff in the yard, and my belongings had already been picked through by the people sent to move the stuff out. Included in the missing items were my gun safe, two lock boxes holding personal information like my sons birth certificate etc, and a box that contained my coach and Louie bags as well as a bridesmaid dress. All valued well over $2000 for the one box alone. It is worth mentioning after such horrendous treatment considering my condition and willingness to pay that Ashley clardy is the wife of billy clardy the officer who recently lost his life on the job. While she is accepting handouts left and right and having her house paid off what she has failed to mention to the community is that she was cheating on her husband with Chris from her plumbing contractor sludgebusters. Before you scream slander it does not apply to factual statements that can proven in a court of law or with the use of lie detector tests. My boyfriend worked directly along side with Chris at sludgebusters and that\u2019s how we got the apt in the first place plus the first hand knowledge of her trashy misdoings. If you absolutely are homeless and desperately need a place to stay I would say try public housing before ever considering renting from independence realty. I am contacting legal guidance regarding the no notice posted, no eviction ban during a national emergency for a high risk mother to be, and for the goods stolen from my property. In 18 years of renting I have NEVER rented from such a poorly run company. I will never recommend this company and if I could give them less than 1 Star I would. The pictures listed on the website NEVER depict the actual conditions of the properties so I strongly urge you do a walkthrough and check all plumbing and electrical before signing a lease.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cb035309d73:0xa1f0f35e6d657cc8"}

This company took over management of the house I live in back in January 2015. They assured they were taking over to make sure things were kept up better on the house- LIE. My very first maintenance request with them was immediately a bad experience. They CHARGED me for the plumbing maintenance, in which this house has had many plumbing issues for YEARS and needed a new toilet- per the plumber. After MONTHS of going back and forth and refusing to pay this charge I had to send a VIDEO to the manager/owner, Robert Taylor, of how there was no pressure in the flush of the toilet. It was replaced. There has been NO up keep of the property other than what I have done myself (carpet cleaning, yard work, pest control, etc). There is a LARGE FALLING tree in the back yard that with time has started to lean more and more. Even my neighbor has called the company concerned about it. After over 9 months of discussing this tree I was promised it would be removed in December 2015... Well, here we are in June 2016 and it is still there. Limbs (8\" round) are constantly falling, ruining any back yard furniture I have. Has even damaged my brand new grill. The carpet and walls have mildew from MULTIPLE leaks coming under the walls and into the hallways. All of which I called SEVERAL times about. This last time it took over a week to get anyone out for the carpet, in which I had to demand several times. The carpet people sucked and didn't want to pull the carpet up to dry it underneath (the leak was coming from under the wall so underneath the carpet and padding), then when they did, the didn't tack the carpet back down properly and now there is a huge gap between the carpet in the hallway.Every since then the house has a really old, dirty, mildew smell to it. This carpet is over 10+ years old and is rental grade carpet. It is literally falling apart from NORMAL wear and tear, I have told them several times that it is in awful condition. I have had several random \"late\" charges added to my account multiple times, in which I have to question and raise hell to have removed... rent paid on time. I am FINALLY moving. I turned in a 30 day notice a couple of weeks ago stating I would move at the end of June. Today, June 3rd, I receive a text about turning in my keys. I call them and am told that the owners (whom I've never met in my life) were under the impression I was moving May 30th... WRONG. The move out date is in writing, and recorded in email. How does an error like this happen? Either they make a TON of errors, or they are highly unprofessional. Not my cup of tea.

The majority of property management companies seem to be more worried about profits rather than having the best homes in the city.  In fact, when my lease runs out at my current home I will be moving into a Main Street property myself.\n\nFinally, let me say to any other contractor\u2019s looking for steady work.... get yourself setup as an approved vendor with Main Street.   You won\u2019t find a better construction team to work with.  My primary point of contact is Superintendent Chris Harris.  Chris is great partner that has years of experience.

They have sent out 4 of their mainstreet techs to look at the dryer outlet, every single one says we need an electrician. They say they'll put an order in for one to come out and they never do. I call again and it's been the same process EVERYTIME. I even contacted the email below and he said he would put an order in after the last guy did the same thing. Yet again they scheduled it to the same tech that was here last time.\n\nDeck finally got fixed after multiple calls and emails. They didn't even use the weather treated wood, good luck to the next few renters who will go through the same thing in the next 5 years.\n\nIF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR SANITY PLEASE GO ELSEWHERE. I've called their service center at least 30 times over a 4 to 5 month span, all regarding maintenance. Most of their call center people are clueless.\n\nUpdate: It's been 4 months, deck still isn't replaced. I had nothing but issues regarding people coming out to the house to fix varies things. Some of the vendors are great, other barely ever will call you back. Our outlet for our dryer has been shorting out for 3 months now and nothing has been done about. I often have to call at least 3 times before anyone will come out to the house. I emailed the email provided below, about 2 weeks ago, haven't heard anything back. The mountain of issues with this house keeps growing and I honestly regret going with this company. I counted the other day and I've called their maintenance center over 25 times in 4 months!\n\nI love the neighborhood and size of our new place, except our moving in experience has been unpleasant. My partner and haven't been in our place for a month and it's been problem after problem.\n\nThe place was suppose to be inspected before we moved in and considering the plumbing inspector arrived a couple days after we moved, it's apparent this didn't happen. He said there was work that needed to be done. Never heard anything after that, until I reported a leaking pipe a couple days ago (the inspector came out almost 2 weeks ago). The downstairs reeks of mildew and the garage also has a leak ( the ceiling tiles in the garage around the leak have mold so it's easy to see there's a leak).\n\nThe lawn hadn't been mowed in 3 months according to the neighbors and it appears to be true.\n\nThe deck is completely rotted and my fiance already fell through once. This problem has been addressed and can't completely blame them for it going unnoticed since it on the side of the house and not directly connected to the back door.\n\nThen today tops it all, the gutters haven't been cleaned in forever so now the backdoor is flooding the back room because the gutter is emptying right in front of the door.\n\nThe application process and our agent that we dealt with was great, but it's obvious there was a lot left undone before we moved in.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1603906045173, "text": "Hi Kenzie,\r\rThank you for taking the time to update your review.

They claim it was an act of nature and they wouldn't fix it. No sir, it was because of that dead tree in yard. I Will never recommend anyone to rent from them besides that's not doing good business.

I even took off half a day so that I can make this appointment as if you're late to the appointment you would be charged a late fee . I went to check out the home and waited almost 15 minutes for the lady to come . We viewed the home but she kept trying to tell me about another property , etc etc. Before we left she asked if I could follow her to another house that I may like better which was about 10min away. I didn't like the home at all but I remember the agent telling me that they had more homes in the Hueytown area . The agent quickly text me an application but I continued to look . After finding a house in Midfield on there website that wasn't ready for viewing yet my brother and I applied for the home bc it was nice from the photos and I had stopped by to check it out myself . Paid the $80 sent in all my information and was  contacted my Robert Bickerton who told me and my brother how he needed to fill in his portion of the application and uplod his documents. Well the  link he sent wasn't working and I tried to explain that to him and all he emailed me back \"please see the email I sent earlier\" I then had to call in and speak with someone else and explain and they reset the link for me .  I saw where my credit had been checked and I said ok maybe they are moving along with the application process . I get a email the next day stating that we had been denied but he couldn't give me a specific reason but did say\" it 's probably your rental history and  Rentgrow will be in contact with you on a couple of days to tell you why you were denied  \" I contacted my landlord whom I have been renting from for 10 years and asked her had they called bc she is expecting them to reach and she said no one ever called her for my rental history . I even emailed ROBERT back to ask him  what he meant about rental history so I can tell him no one ever checked mine in the first place. He never responded back nor said anything else that may help is else  to get  into that home or another home .\n\nLong story short  I didn't appreciate the way that things were handled and I felt as though I paid $80 for them to run one thing and that was it .\n\nI'm so glad that we found another home with another rental company and had proof that they did employment verification as well as rental history verification .

After Applying, I wake up Monday morning to call and check on the property I was told by the Homewood Al office I would receive a call back in 20 minutes, never heard anything back. I get up Tuesday morning 2/3/2019 to go and visit Msrenewal, and check on it one of the property managers introduced himself, got my info and told me that he would check on my application, he later returned 5 minutes later stating that I had needed a guarantee for the house( A Bs excuse) . I\u2019ve been renting since I was 19 years old and I am now 25, never had a broken lease and I\u2019ve also never had an eviction nor late payment, furthermore I\u2019ve never had a problem getting approved for anything, especially when you make the income .This would be my second house. However, I got in my vehicle and decided to check their website and the home was no longer available. I am not a genius but it doesn\u2019t take a rocket science to see that someone was able to apply and secure the home before me, that isn\u2019t the problem. The problem is the excuse I was given and the fact that they left the house available for people to still apply for knowing that they already had potential candidates ready to secure the home , and also the fact that they basically took my hard earned money when simply they could have reached out to me, and explained the situation, and offered for me to apply for another property with the app fee money !

To put in a ticket you must explain the problem in detail, then you wait 2-5 days for a main street employee to come look at the problem you explained in detail. For the maintenance guy to tell you, yes that is the problem. Then MainStreet will call a contractor to fix the problem but you will have to wait for the contractors to schedule an appointment (3-10 days later).

I have only been here a few months and have had a negative experience from the start. The property that i am renting has had plumbing, electrical, and structure problems since the first day i moved in. These were problems that i was not able to see until AFTER i paid my deposit and rent and had my utilities turned on. After many calls and complaints to get these problems fixed, it took over a month to get someone to come address the problems. WHAT PROBLEMS? You ask? Well there were outlets throughout the house that weren\u2019t functioning. When the maintenance guy came out to work on it, he told me that the whole house was improperly wired. So i could not use half of the electrical outlets in the house for over a month. Extension cords and surge protectors became my friends for that period of time. Next, there were leaks from the kitchen sink, from plumbing between the first and second level of the house, from the HVAC system. Water was literally pouring from those places and the company did not seem concerned with sending anyone to fix those problems until i called the health department to inspect the property. Oh yes i have videos and pictures of all of this\u2014- even the mold and collapsed ceiling due to plumbing/ water leaks. And still months after the FIRST call about the plumbing i still have water pouring from the first floor into the finished basement area. None of these problems were apartment until i was already locked into a lease and the company is unwilling to allow me to break the lease nor properly maintain the property! And the list goes in and on about problems... yes and i have copies of all the maintenance requests as well... date and time stamped as proof of this company\u2019s negligence and fraud. And last but certainly not least... this company has put charges on my account for late payment... and when i call to resolve the issue... they put me off by saying someone will get back with me on the issue or try and give some BS excuse for the charges to be on he account. YET AGAIN, i have bank statements showing the dates that payments were made and none of her were late. In fact, my rent payments have been made the month BEFORE they are due.

However as this company never pays the HOAs we never got to use the pool. When I asked about it from the local office I am basically told that there's nothing they can do. Pools are not necessary even though my rent us supposed to include the HOA fees.\nI'm very frustrated right now. Especially since after paying my rent on time for two years they end it by sending my family to collections over their mistake. Someone please contact me ASAP so this can get resolved.\n*****Added -- I have called three different numbers today even a sales rep just hoping they could get me to a person but to no avail. Can someone please contact me!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1551986834137, "text": "Hello Stephanie, We apologize for the frustrating and confusion regarding your move out details.

The weekend past and I noticed that my application was canceled and when I called back, I spoke with someone named Tiffany, who claims that she worked closely with Rebecca. She stated that they had to reapply me and my aunt and call me back later. I later received a call from Rebecca telling me that I was denied by her because my check stub looks fake. First I would say that I am a nurse/ csr and no one at the office had contacted my job or my aunts job. They went on to say that the companies wasn't coming up in her computer. I then asked her to call the jobs and she stated that she had made her decision and that was all she could do. I then asked to speak to a manager and she told me that she was the highest authority in the building. I asked for the corporate number and she told me to Google it. This was very unprofessional of this company. She actually said that corporate gave her the authority to do what she does. Everytime I called, she would say rude things. After waiting about an hour and calling back, Tiffany verified that there were actually 5 mangers in the office and that she lied to me. This company has got to be better. I felt discriminated against because my manager also went through this company and stubs are identical. I am going to get my lawyer in on this and he will be contacting this company.

They put me on hold and came back and said they contact the plumbing company,who was assigned and the would be contacting me to come out.  I still never received call.  I called back the next day and got someone different and the said the would do a new work and send it to a different plumbing company and I would be contacted within 4 hours.  Well I never got a call.  I also had the water company to come out and it's nothing on their end.  They informed me that it was nothing on their end they would be reading the meter again soon for the next bill and it looks like it going to be extremely high again.  I  called main street back this morning to let them know the 2nd plumber never contacted me.  They informed that that plumber service Georgia only.  After a extremely long hold the came back and stated that they had assigned yet another plumber and I will be contacted within a coup or of hours.  We will see how this goes.\n\nUpdate :\n6/20/18\nMain street took over the property I've been renting back in November 2017.  My lease was expiring on 3/31/18.  I receive a notice in December stating I needed to either give them 30 days notice that I would be vacating at end of lease or I need to contact them about applying for a new lease with them and my rent would go from $875 to $1,050.  I began contacting them in January 2018 regarding a new lease because I decided we would stay another year\nI never got a response.  I called and was told leasing team was in a meeting and they would call me back.  They didn't.  I sent another email I'm January, February and March.  Never got a response.  They still continued to bill me for the same $875 after March.  I have always paid rent on time.  I received a letter on June 14, 2018 that was dated June 8, 2018.  They letter stated that my lease ended on 3/31/18 and they would not renew and I had to be out by July 9, 2018, less than 30 days.  I immediately called.  They stated that the owner had decided that they didn't want to rent anymore and wanted to renovate and sale.  I explained I know they have that right but less than 30 days was not enough time to find a new home nor apartment and have funds for security deposit, 1st months rent and other moving related expensive.  I asked if they could give more time they said what the owner said goes and they couldn't do anything about it.  As I go back and look at the notice I received when Main street took over.  It names Main street as the owner not anybody else. This has really put my family and I in a bad position, I have a newborn grandson and a disabled finace and still haven't found somewhere to go as well as the money we will need to move.  I hope everyone's else experience with them will be better than mine.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1512677941831, "text": "Hi Verandia, we sincerely apologize for the delay in repairs being completed and the inconvenience this has caused.

I have a call into the owner and hope to better understand how their business operates. My biggest frustration is items that were not addressed when we moved in as well as items that we found shortly after that are not correct. A simple example of 1 item (keep in mind there are several) is an entry door handle that was installed backwards. My door can be opened from the outside because it\u2019s on backwards. I have pictures. The company agrees it is on wrong but since it\u2019s easy to fix it is my responsibility. The lease agreement is set to basically remove them from doing anything at all unless the roof is falling in. A rental from them is pretty much like being a home owner and not a renter. I have rented and owned so I understand normal maintenance. It\u2019s crazy to think as a rented you have to install a door handle correctly from installation errors. As a renter with Alabama Rental Managers you are responsible to clean up the \u201cblack mildew\u201d on the sheet rock 1 week after you move in. I am using the word \u201cblack mildew\u201d as requested by the Director of Service. He asked me to use that word specifically in place of any other word.\nCrazy to think as a renter your unit will have a pink polkadot on the carpet the size of a basketball. Crazy to be told that the carpet stain would be removed and if it didn\u2019t come out it would be replaced prior to move in. Crazy to think we would spend WEEKS without AC in the unit only 6 weeks after moving in. Crazy to think I would be told to crawl into the attic and locate the AC unit and check several components prior to dispatching a technician out on site. Even crazier to think after 3 service visits the AC unit still did not work but luckily by this time it was fall and not needed. Just all in all I am surprised the service is so poor. Be sure to read the contract very closely as I have found the renter will pay for a lot more than I think they should.\n\nI will add that I have pictures and time stamps of my displeasure. I will also say read their reviews to hear what others are saying. 3 star rating is what they have and someone else mentioned they have bad reviews removed. Not sure there.\n\nAll in all if you want to rent a property but pay as the owner it\u2019s a great rental company. They expect you to come out of pocket for everything before they even know what\u2019s wrong. I can attest to that. I also forgot to mention the AC unit when it was inspected was said to never have had a service. The technician was a third party and we found debris in the drain pan from the install. There were wore strands, wire nuts, insulation, instructions, ETC in the pan. The technician said if the unit was ever serviced the technician servicing would have been expected to clean that. I asked for a copy of previous service history on the AC unit and they would not provide it. I let it go when they finally agreed to cover the cost. Yes that\u2019s right. They wanted me to pay to have the AC unit serviced 2 months after I moved in. Lol. Lots of pictures to share with anyone at ARM who would like to talk and review. Thanks.\n\nI almost forgot that we asked for all the animal hair to be removed the day we moved in. The same day. Once we finally heard back from them a week later we were told it was our responsibility and do we have a pet. So funny. But no we do not have a pet. Either way we did clean the unit. Whoever moved out before we moved in should get the cleaning fee back. I have pictures of the unit not cleaned either. They offered to send someone if we wanted but this was weeks after we were in the unit. We had to clean it ourselves. I asked if I could get a cleaning credit when we moved out and you know the answer... no. I guess it is a GREAT business model. They charge you to clean it for the next person but then make the next person do the cleaning. I bet 99% of the time they get away with it.

All I will say is, if you are a tenant, it is best you read and FULLY COMPREHEND their lease and policies BEFORE YOU SIGN and commit. They follow the lease too the very fine lines and will use that to justify any action you may violate. A lease is a contract, and if you think this company will not follow their own document, than you may need to just keep shopping around. From our experience, as long as you pay on time and do what is required, than they pretty much leave you alone. Maintenance issues are up to the Owner and the company only acts as the middleman to handle issues, so don't really feel mad if they don't fix something for your rental (we never had that problem because they fixed all of our issues); you should feel mad at the owner for making the decision to not fix an issue. We fixed things ourselves mostly to avoid the hassle of begging and waiting, but when we requested help to repair an issue, they were right there to take care of it as soon as the owner gave his approval. If I could do it all over again, I think I would have rented an apartment just to avoid all of the extra costs we had to spend for the lawn care, minor maintenance issues, pest control, and cleaning the gutters. However, I would say this, treat it as a business and do your part as a tenant. Any rental house will require the tenant to do more than they would for an apartment. There are not perfect rentals! WE just made sure our calls were pleasant, we followed the lease line by line, and made sure we had the money to handle extra costs to keep up the rental, and we walked away with our sanity. Good luck!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923adbfd88cd5:0x39eb72ea1fa7e254"}

I see a lot of 1 star reviews and ranting but please allow me to be unbiased. Every homeowner is not a slum lord. Tenants need to understand that they have responsibilities also. If a tenant does not read the contract properly with understanding then unnecessary stress is coming; lawn care is the is one of those things. I cannot speak for other homeowners but if a tenant does not want to provide lawn care then it can be negotiated to be included in the rent. Problem solved. Yes, there is a bit of frustration with ARM not having an in-house maintenance team and yes they do their best to keep homeowners in the loop concerning such things. The company is not corporate. Sometimes I even thought of getting a company that has an in-house team, however, the costs will raise rent. Nothing is free or perfect. This is a growing small business. A tenant cannot determine the type of homeowner he/she will get and neither can a homeowner determine the type of tenant they will get; I have had a tenant from hell that had the perfect application as well as the mature and great tenants I have now. If you have never worked with the public or in public service, please try it. It is extremely stressful dealing with all types of personalities and you do not know the mental state of each person; it can be difficult to discern. My point is respect others and do your best to maintain self control because you do not know if an ARM staff member just got insulted to the nth degree on a previous call by someone who was taking their frustrations out on the staff, or if the ARM staff is trying to resolve the problem for the tenant but a homeowner is being difficult and cheap. Could ARM restructure some things, yes however the cost could be greater for everyone. Everyone desires more for less these days and it is difficult to find the ideal balance sometimes. So do your best to be kind; you truly do not know anything unless you can see the details and gain understanding.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1558632181928, "text": "Kiva,\n\nThank you for your review.

The last month of our lease our water was turned off without our knowledge or consent (water is provided with the unit/paid along with the rent on the portal). The payments manager Krispin Watson was made aware that we were not going to pay rent for a unit where provided utilities were turned off. She didn't seem to care, and we were still charged a late fee\u2026for a unit where a necessary utility was turned off for no good reason. She later insinuated that we were being lazy and causing issues for no reason because we wanted someone from maintenance to finish turning the water on at the unit, and she would charge us $100 if we didn't finish it ourselves. Later someone else let me know that our situation did not constitute that charge, so watch out. Robbe Gay was great and thankfully made it right for us, which was all we asked after the list of issues we experienced. For 6 months of our lease they showed our unit to prospective buyers, so half the year we were emailed and texted frequently to let in viewers/inspectors and to step outside. Our ceiling leaked in rain twice, for well over a week both times, and we had to threaten to break lease before they finally urged the owner to fix it. One of our vents was not hooked up to anything, and cold winter air could be felt instead of heat (our bill was outrageous). They told us to change our air filter to \u201cfix it\u201d. We had to send them a photo from an inspector before they believed us and fixed it. We got many emails the first month or so threatening our utilities, mainly to put our water in our name (which we couldn\u2019t do because per our signed lease it was to stay in the owners name) and that if we didn\u2019t pay our electricity bill they would turn it off (had to send them 3 pieces of mail showing it was in OUR name and WE handle that).

For several months, our dumpster was never taken care of. We had trash overflowing despite a number of calls from several residents in our building. Eventually that was taken care of, no explanation or offer of compensation given. Most recently, our grass was not mowed for a total of two months. I called, emailed, and corresponded with the \"director of quality control\" Mindy, throughout this entire time. She blamed it on HOA and never offered to hire a private service to take care of it. Our yard looked abandoned and it led to a flea infestation due to the excessive overgrowth. My dog would get swallowed every time he went outside to use the bathroom. Eventually the yard was taken care of (two months after I initially complained/informed them of the neglect), Mindy claims a private lawn service took care of the yard, but it was actually the owners of the building next to our unit who took care of it themselves. Again, no compensation was offered to the residents for this inconvenience. I am now being charged an additional $250 for a vendor coming out and checking our air conditioning because he \"didn't find any problems with the HVAC.\" The vendor told us that the unit was poorly constructed and we would have to suffer with the heat, but he did unclog a pipe and refill our anti freeze, yet we are still being charged because he found no issues with the unit (although he did address two problems: lack of antifreeze and a clogged pipe). Despite numerous efforts to reach out to supervisors, directors, and even the owner of the entire rental company, no one has offered clarity or compensation for the ridiculousness that we have had to deal with at our time with this company. My roommate and I are both students who work full time to pay our rent and other bills and the fact that the employees of ARM have been completely unwilling to work with us or offer us explanation for a myriad of problems we have tried to address is beyond frustrating. I am writing this review to warn others not to get locked into an agreement with this company and also to maybe get a response from ARM since regular attempts at correspondence have led me nowhere.

I am not writing as just another angry tenant. I have never even made a late payment, and I have been more than patient and reasonable with them. Nevertheless, they take my hard-earned money and move like molasses when I ask to have maintenance issues repaired. More specifically, I had an emergency with one of their rental properties, and they would not move a finger which led to costly repairs that I had to fix myself. Any maintenance request takes weeks to be looked at. Therefore, I found myself paying super costly repairs that were not my responsibility, per my lease agreement. I am looking to move elsewhere, because I am fed up. I pay too much in rent to be treated like I live under low income housing.

Customer service is totally a lost concept with this organization. Their only concern is getting your money and nothing else.\n\nIf you have a maintenance issue you can be rest assured you won't hear from them. My first year my refrigerator went out and numerous calls (more than 10) were made to their maintenance department and ONLY because a desperate call to the homeowner resulted in getting the problem fixed (this was AFTER 30 DAYS of waiting). Of course all food/milk was spoiled! This was just the beginning of maintenance problems that never got resolved until direct calls to the owner were made. The accounting department is just as bad. We're still owed nearly $500 after having to wait 60+ days after moving out.\n\nI personally own 2 homes and would NEVER hire ARM to handle my affairs. You're better off just managing your OWN property if you want to keep your tenants happy and willing to renew their contract with you year after year.\n\nUpdate from response:\n\nI only stayed the 5 years time due to cost (moving & reorganization). The inconveniences during that time I had to bear. Again, direct calls to the owner were the only reasons we got anything fixed.

Each time the home owner was made aware and they only authorized repairs which were completed each time.  Unfortunately, ARM cannot authorize replacements without the home owner approving the cost for their home.  I do not see a work order that took 30 days to complete.  The last work order for the fridge was in October of 2013 and took 10 days to complete.  I only see 4 other maintenance items during the last 4 years of your stay with ARM.\n\nWe mailed you a full refund for your deposit within the 60 day time period required by the Alabama Landlord Tenant Law.

They just are very disorganized and have a lot of weird practices. Firstly, the security deposit was ridiculously high. I have never paid more than $350, and theirs was $850. After paying this I was surprised the state my unit was in when I moved in. It was disgusting. They forgot to even paint the backs of the doors, and I was definitely misled regarding the size and general appearance of the neighborhood. There is trash everywhere, and there is no maintenance basically. My tubs back up, but the third party maintenance makes me so uncomfortable that I don't ever want to open a ticket. I will be very glad when my lease is up. I have always paid on time, but nothing about the lease is negotiable.

This rental company and the employees I dealt with are pathetic. This is the most unprofessional disorganized company. I found a rental I liked but when I went out to look at the property alone to make sure it looked good it was nothing like what they had pictured on their site. So I decided to call and discuss this issue. Well, when I called I spoke to a Kristy or Krista something like that who is absolutely worthless. I assume she's new bc she couldn't answer simple questions and got extremely rude and aggressive when I called her out on it. I will be calling the owner of this company and informing then how I was treated when I called to inquire about rental properties. The girl lacks class and needs a serious course in customer service. Who runs this circus??? What a joke. Now as I read threw the reviews I see exactly what kind of people run this company. Whoever replies to the reviews needs to be fired immediately. What kind of business owner/employees tries so hard to make the reviewer look bad and claim they are innocent. I wouldn't rent from this company after everything I've seen, heard and  read. It's obvious the problem is with the company not the renters. I hope they realize how bad they make themselves look by the responses they give. They respond like immature kids who have gotten their feelings hurt. Someone needs to come in and train these people. I've owned a business for 30 years and if I had employees like the one that answered the phone she would be fired immediately as well as whoever replies to the reviews. They are the reason this company is getting such a bad name. There is a certain way you deal with people when you work at a business like this and the way they handle things is pathetic. This company obviously cares nothing about it's reputation. If they did the would've gotten rid of the ones that most of the reviews are about. I see a increase in good reviews which it's obvious to anyone what's going on there. Its almost laughable how awful this company handles business. I've read thru the reviews and some of these people should've sued this company. I will personally be reporting this company. This is no way to do business. They lie about the condition of their properties. They obviously don't hold up their end of the lease agreement either. To the girl who had the neighbor who kept threatening them. Take the police reports to an attorney along with picture's, you have a viable lawsuit.

The owner uses a home warranty company that requires a $75.00 fee every time they come out that I have had to pay every time.  They are suppose to call the company and give them their credit card # before they even come to my house.  They have reimbursed me each time but, the renter should NOT have to pay this.  They don't know if I have the $75.00 to pay or not and you can't get anyone on the phone to talk to the maintenance company either.  I went 2 1/2 months without a working shower and TUB.  Our family had to go and take a shower at my parents for a couple of weeks because the one working shower  broke also.  There is no follow-up from the office after having maintenance issues.

I contacted Alabama Rental Managers. Now if I had taken the time to check Google reviews and the Yelp reviews I wouldn't have even contacted them. As a business man myself I can tell you that just from reading some reviews and reading the way a employee responded to them that this is not a top notch, classy rental company. If I owned this business I would immediately fire whomever has responded to these reviews. Very unprofessional. Its obvious the person responding needs a course in Business 101. You don't respond to a  review by turning it around on the reviewer. You don't reveal things about their business dealings with your company. I would immediately fire the person responding or insist on them taking online classes in how to be a professional. From my first phone call to this buiness I saw red flags. The phone was answered by a female who was laughing as she answered the phone. I asked simple questions about several properties that she should've known the answers to. After the third Ummm......I'm not sure, I asked her to transfer me to someone who would know and she got very defensive and very rude saying to me, \"Sir, if you would just be patient and nice I would be able to find out answers to your questions but If your rude again, I will just hang up on you.\" I asked her why she didn't know the answers and her response was,\"Its not my job to know answers to those kind of questions.\" All I could say was, \"Wow.\" Honestly it was amusing. From the person responding to the reviews to the women who answers the phone this is one classless, trashy  business and so are those two employees. I finally asked her to please have an agent or someone with any knowledge about the business and properties to call me. I waited two days and no one ever called me. I can almost guarantee Miss Classless didn't even give anyone a message that a potiential renter wanted to speak to an agent  about a property. Probably because she knew I would inform them about the way she spoke to me. I wouldn't rent with this company now even if the house was perfect for my needs, nor will I reccomend this company to anyone. In fact I will strongly discourage it. I didn't make it past the front desk and I'm so glad I found out how unprofessional, disorganized and completely classless before I gave them my business. Some advice to the person responding to these reviews. Instead of sitting around reading and responding to reviews all day why don't you learn how to be a professional and an asset to this company because right now from what I can tell your far from an asset or a help to this company. Quite frankly your most likely causing more problems because you handle the disgruntled tenants and potential tenants the way you do. This company needs to get someone to come in and help this business and it's employees learn good customer service and how to act like professionals instead of acting like low class trash. Whoever responds to the reviews and answers your phone's cost you a renter and more potential renters by the way they act. Its a huge turn off and it's most likely costing you business, I know it did mine. Big mistake Alabama Rental Manager's, I could've sent you so much business. I'm a relocation specialist for a very large well known company. I help employees find rental homes to live in while they are working in this area.

We are so glad to be out of the house we were renting with Alabama Rental Managers. We were without heat for an entire year, heat was still broken on the day we moved out.

We have a young child and a dog, let alone the fact that heat is the ONE thing they legally have to provide. These people are A holes!!! Jenny Moore (or Jennifer Rudeness, as we all like to call her) is an absolute horrible person, she is extremely rude and it's abundantly clear that she has no respect at all for due process. She needs to buy herself some training in customer service and train the rest of her staff as well, considering they probably developed their piss poor attitudes by watching her actions, or shall I say, \"lack thereof\"! I will even donate my entire deposit ONLY if they use it to train themselves in proper customer care, which I personally have been specializing in since I was 18. Otherwise, I fully expect an entire refund of my deposit as that house is now CLEANER than it was when we moved in. The grout was brown, now it's white thanks to me! If I could, I would give zero stars! We are a military family and we don't always get to choose where we move to, unfortunately we got very bad luck with this location and this horribly outrageous \"Management\" company.

You are blind! I feel it is a mistake to keep your customer service training in house, as I would currently give you a 2% rating out of 100% which clearly means your training techniques are NOT working. You choose to respond to reviews in a way that makes you look good. I have news for you, you are not good at your job whatsoever! And yes, we have been in your office multiple times, And dealt with people in person. AND FOR THE RECORD!!!! We only stopped reporting the heat issue because you REFUSED to handle it properly and I was about to rip my F-ing hair out. I have documented photos and videos of every single cold day we spent in that house. The fact that you chose to show publicly how many times we complained, actually helps my case 100% so thank you for that. I suggest you take my advice and hire someone for proper customer service and house management. It's simple, DO YOUR JOB OR QUIT, JENNIFER PS: if you would like to continue this \"debate\" about the grout, I will gladly show you the differenc in pictures!

Every time you try and contact the company they transfer you to some \"maintenance program\" in another state.

If you don't like dealing with the public then find a new job instead of being so rude and making us feel like we are beneath you. What's really sad is her having to resort to asking FRIENDS to write a good review about her after a bad one. Very obvious too. The REAL tenants that have dealt with her horrible attitude write REAL reviews. If she treated people better then she wouldn't have SO many people mention her in their bad reviews about ARM. I also found out that Kristen lied to me about a rental being taken. I found out she lied because a friend of hers wanted it. I got my information from someone in the company and they were more then forth coming about this and about the \"friend reviews\".Maryann who answers the phone for maintenance, is rude too and acts like your bothering her when u call to report something she must be miserable on the inside to act so hateful when you call. What is up with this staff?? Most of them not all but most act like they hate there job and that they are better then the renters. Why I dont understand because I've seen this group. They have no reason to be cocky. If I owned this company I wouldn't dare continue to employe and pay people who are so rude. The president of this company needs to read these reviews as well as the ones on Yelp and other sites. This should tell you something, the neighborhood we lived in has 5 rental homes. Everyone moved out after one lease except for one family. One of the homeowners in that neighborhood is selling bc of the rentals. The price they charged us for rent you would think the house would've been built well and have nice floors and appliances instead of the cheapest linoleum, cheapest horrible carpet, cheapest appliances and crappy construction. If we hadn't needing something ASAP we would've continued to look. These homes are in Odenville off Kelly Creek and were built in 2015. One of the homes foundation was cracking and the roof was warped looking. When you move out, they make you do everything so they dont have to lift a finger. They even make you hire a professional carpet cleaner. Along with a check list of what your required to clean and the price if you don't. There is a picture of the list on Yelp. One little thing not done and they deduct it from your deposit and they will be extremely picky I assure you. They want to charge 75 dollars if the yard isn't cut but when you move in the yard looks like a jungle. Just read the reviews folks. When there are WAY more bad reviews then good, on numerous sites, then you know it's the truth. All of the bad reviews state almost the exact same issues. Almost all of the good reviews are from people who are just starting to rent with this company and the other good ones seem coheraced, almost like they asked these people to write a good review to off set the bad ones. Go read the Yelp reviews and the Gripeo review. ARM was great to us when we were moving in but just give it time and their true colors come thru. It doesn't take long AT ALL. This company has the worst reviews of any other company in the area and what I find funny is they comment back on  the bad reviews trying to discredit the person and argue the review. Extremely unprofessional. Its obvious they are saying anything in hopes of convincing the reader its not as bad as it truly is. I'm sure they will comment back on this review pointing the finger at me however my former neighbors know the truth about this company and so does alot of others. I'm sure there are some bad tenants but nowhere near as many as the bad reviews. The problem IS NOT the tenants, the problem is this company and the people who work for it. Save yourself money and distress. Rent with a company that cares about it's tenants and the quality of their rental homes. Read the Yelp reviews and the Gripeo review.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923adbfd88cd5:0x39eb72ea1fa7e254"}

There are many reasons why I love staying in my apartment!\n1. My apartment faces pretty much a forest, so if I'm out on my balcony, I have an awesome view and a lot of privacy. I love even sitting on my couch with the blinds open and looking out of the window and hearing the birds chirping.\n2. These apartments are spacious. Kitchen is narrow, but there is lots of countertop space and cabinet storage space. I also have a coat closet, a pantry (probably supposed to be linen closet, but I put my food there), a walk-in laundry room and two huge bedroom closets. My bedroom is big enough for a king bed. The dining area is big enough for my parent's hand-me-down kitchen table and china cabinet.\n3. For the space you get, the price is right. They're always doing rent specials too, so be sure to ask management what the current special is. When I signed up, I got $300 off my first 3 months of rent, and I really needed that.\n4. Dog park! This complex is so dog-friendly, and my poodle loves the dog park. All of my friends want to meet me at my complex with their dogs so we can have puppy play dates.\n5. Pool and gym... they've been under construction, but they look awesome, and I can't wait to try them out.\n6. Community-wide wifi. It's fast and reliable, and because it's community-wide, it's way cheaper than if you set up wifi yourself.\n7. You can save up for apartment upgrades through their \"Dasmen points\" system. You get points for paying rent on time, referring a friend to move in, etc. Points can be redeemed for new shower head, new smart thermostat, or even a stainless steel appliance package for your kitchen.\n8. Super safe. I have walked laps around the community at 9-10 p.m. with no issues or fears.\n9. SUPER FRIENDLY staff! They all seem to know me and my dog by name. They always smile and wave when they see you. Very responsive via email.\n10. Very quiet.  The way the apartments are set up, my living room doesn't share a wall with any neighbors. So you're never kept up at night from a loud TV or music.\n\nMy only complaints...\n1. I'm not a fan of my carpet. My friend lives in a first floor unit \u2014 these have a beautiful vinyl plank flooring in the living room. But I was told that 2nd and 3rd floor units have carpet (for the sound barrier). I'm saving up for a nice rug to put in my living room.\n2. They have stands for doggy bags around the complex, but they're always empty. So not every resident cleans up after their pets.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHtTzlOVTxgRolO0K8qoxnEDPLHFdcr1_OqEWz=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6TQRQoXawTQi5Tm9i86bthHWbapdojpd8sRhX=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMg6TB-cV4BbWkHLe2UmPMNSRzbroyunQJI6-b-=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUPVFZDU-JLTAjaae5M-O-9-PhiHTqb_eQIwHd=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuCPv_ZKs-qXzUzaqsEENzAAsbjVm3R6MxkjkQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwU8P-u51yJJ9rHdq3ksVp1kHOnh0_eKj-DiTG=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1598903153183, "text": "Thank you so much for taking the time to review our community.

I could not say more positive things about this apartment. The management staff is very friendly and truly make you feel like you are at home. There are community events all the time for residents and the management staff know me by name each time I come in or reach out. The maintenance staff is very courteous and quick to resolve any issues (all of mine have been incredibly minor). I live in a one bedroom apartment and I always get compliments on how spacious it is - the space is very smartly laid out. I can fit a full queen bedroom suite in my bedroom which was difficult to find with one bedroom apartments. It is also the only apartment that I have found that actually had a dedicated laundry room rather than a washer and dryer unit being in the kitchen or bathroom. The only negative I would say on that is that technically it could fit a full sized washer and dryer but I went for a stackable unit so I wouldn't loose accessibility to the extra shelving in the laundry room. Closet space in this apartment is PERFECT and I actually have enough storage space (there is extra storage in the laundry room and two large closets in the bedroom). The community is very quiet and all of my neighbors are very friendly. As a single woman, safety is important to me, and I feel very safe in this community and have no reservations about taking my dog out at night.\n\nThe community is kind of tucked away but it is also very close to a neighborhood Wal Mart and gas stations as well as downtown Birmingham so you don't feel like you are too far away from anything.\n\nI would recommend this apartment to anyone.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1547044298849, "text": "Hi Rebecca, thanks for the positive review!

I feel like they are trying to force me to stay against my will. I could understand if i was charged for 1-7 but not for the whole month and how can you force someone to stay somewhere they just don't want to not because of the property but because of management and the office staff.,CONTINUED on 7/17 So i got a 7 day notice and finally got a returned call back, I believe her name is Shannon, this was the same lady that I spoke with when i gave my 30 day notice the same lady that asked me to remove my last review, she really just tried to handle me!!!  she said they are starting the eviction process LADY I wanted to move 7/7/19 you kept me here (against my will just didn't want a negative mark on my credit so i complied) and said i would pay this month rent when I turn in my key because of lies and miscommunication she told me before I just cant trust anything she says at this point, so I agreed that I would pay July's rent in full when I'm moving out you know make one payment and be done, she told me \"that would not acceptable very RUDELY and because they are filing for an eviction I would have to pay the legal fees!!!! I'm sorry but if my memory serves me correctly I didn't want to stay here either!!! I've already paid my 1st month and security at my new house because I thought I would be out of this apartment on 7/7,  however that was not the case, I have no problem with paying my rent, again I've never had a late fee, never had a 7 day notice good tenant no complaints no nothing!!!I just do not trust the office staff so i would pay everything when i turned in the key I have the money to pay i just dont want them to say i owe anything else, Ive asked on several occasion to speak with someone higher then Shannon she says they are going to tell you the same thing, at this point I wouldn't personally  recommend this place to a fleas on a dogs balls, the apartments needs updates and lets not talk about how high your power bill is going to be because the heating and air conditions are older the Christ him self.

On the outside the apartments look nice and are in a good location (hence the two stars), but on the inside they are a complete disaster. To begin with, when I first moved in all the stainless steel appliances they boasted about were not yet fully assembled. When I first opened up the oven and dishwasher I was shocked to find pvc pipes, tubes, and screws just sitting inside them. Also half the light fixtures were without bulbs. I thought maybe they didn\u2019t have the place fully set up yet and called and they fixed it after a few days. Without a working oven at first and having just moved to a new town, I went out and got some microwave dinners... that\u2019s when I found shock number two. If the TV and living room lights are on and you use the microwave for longer than 60 seconds the power shorts out. They had an electrician come look at it and he told me the wiring was all done wrong and there was nothing he could do. Still to this day I only microwave in thirty second increments to avoid having to use the flashlight on my phone to find the breaker box and reset the power. The next issue I found was that the apartment is on a slant and the floors are uneven. So I had to completely rearrange the furniture in my room to keep the drawers in my chest from sliding out or my TV from being dangerously close to tipping over. The next issue was the plumbing... still to this day from time to time after having had it \u201cfixed\u201d three times all the sinks and tub in my apartment will randomly start filling from the bottom up with dirty water. My neighbor tells me it\u2019s done the same for him too. It\u2019s disgusting and I refuse to take baths and only shower because of it. Also when the Neighboor uses his food disposal the gunk starts pouring in from the bottom up on my side... a nasty surprise to have when cooking diner in the kitchen. And another major issue I had was there was no functioning cable connection when I arrived. The cable wire had been cut out of the wall by the construction crew. Charter made me get written permission from the complex to instal a new one, which took ages to get. My installation fee and labor fee came to  $83, and the complex refused to pay more than $30 because that was their \u201cpolicy\u201d, despite having promised functioning cable connections in the rent agreement. I could go on about issues in my apartment forever, but I\u2019ll stick to those main issues. The next problem I want to warn any future residents about is that the complex is misleading when saying they have a gym and self laundry service. The laundry room is under construction and has been since summer so is completely closed, and the gym was turned into a storage room \u201ctemporarily\u201d for several months now as well so is closed too. The pool didn\u2019t open until mid summer and would only be open a few hours on certain days, which apparently the office didn\u2019t know because several times I called to see if it was open before going only to pack everything and get down there to find it chained up with a big closed sign on it. Also the trash valet service is a mandatory $15/month fee, and they only pick up your trash after it\u2019s been sitting out for days. Oh and  the \u201ccafe\u201d is a kerig set up in the main office lol. Which gets me to the main office... good luck dealing with them. Management has turned over hands three times in the year I have lived here. Nobody ever knows what is going on and you get different answers from different people. Not to mention their hours are constantly changing, they will take one and two hour lunch breaks, and they close frequently for the most random of holidays I\u2019ve ever heard of. So good luck if you work a full time job trying to find a time when you are off and they are open to pick your packages up. I would not recommend this apartment complex.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1543349224918, "text": "Thank you for taking the time to give us a review. We are sorry to hear we missed the mark.

We then moved to Vestavia Place, The water bugs was awful the grounds was not kept and I had to make a police report agent the downstairs neighbor for Threatened me and my grandchildren several times, Although I was not afraid I decided to let the Law handle it, and she was evicted.\n\nThe  staff including the management team as changed more then five times in 15 months there is always new staff. The pool and workout room and Laundry room was closed all summer, and never once have they offered the residence any kind of prorated rent for our inconvenience, Our Apartment has several  internal and external problems  . When it rain it rains inside our kitchen and Mater Bathroom we have to put buckets in both rooms to catch the rain I have videos of the rain coming in. All the floors are cracked underneath the carpet , they have sent several floor guys in and each of them stated the floors need to be redone throughout the entire Property being they are over fifty years old, so when walking through the Apartment I can feel and hear the cracked floor. The leaves are never removed they just blow them onto the grass so we never have beautiful green grass its leaves and dirt everywhere, I had to request for them to repair the Hallway Bathroom the flooring was lifting up molding around the tub was coming off all the vents throughout the unit was full of dust it was nasty my husband and I had to do most of the deep cleaning to even move in, They had promised new appliances at move in instead they had old discoloring Mitch matched stove and refrigerator there, after a couple of weeks they finally replaced them.\n\nWhen we moved in we had ATT after the second week they told us we couldn't use ATT every resident must have Spectrum, so we were penalized  for breaking our ATT contract. Spectrum service are so awful everyday between 6pm and 9pm the internet works like a dial up service because so many people are logged on at once in this area. Just when we thought it couldn't get any worse  Vestaia Place/ Mountain Lodge Apt had Spectrum come in and rewire every united, Throughout December their has been strange men six or more walking through my home. Once I woke up to them in my Living room saying they was Spectrum yes the Apartment Manager had gave out everybody Apartment keys for these strangers to enter each united. On Wednesday Dec 19th they returned several of them they were in the attic which is connected to the bathroom in my bedroom. I asked them were was the Maintenance or Management because  I was uncomfortable leaving them in my home with my key. Spectrum employee re-insured me they would not be in the Apart alone he lied! When I returned I noticed things out of place  my husband sliver chain that was on the sink was gone, so I started to check around and notice my 35mm cameras was gone and two  Zizio remotes to both our band new Tvs. I had just deep cleaned my home and laid two remotes under ever Tv I know they were there. The chain I had just cleaned and my camera was on the table next to my bed because I sell online I was just using it the night before.\nThey didn't re hook the cable I had to move everything back and re hook all the cable cords a neighbor said the office never came spectrum locked the door with my key. I am headed today December 21st to make a Police report because the  Property Manager refuse to handle the problem or give my husband the Corporate office number. Before Spectrum she sent five Spanish guys in my Apartment saying they were the floor guys they to had my Apartment key, now uniform business cards nothing yet once again Vestavia Place gave Strangers my Apartment Key.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1545415928837, "text": "Thank you for taking the time to review our community.

Because I have not been so fortunate to experience any of the great things they are referencing.\n\nI'm sure Josh is a kind and hard worker (never met him), but that does not make actually living in this apartment complex a pleasant experience.\n\nI have lived here for just over a year and this has by far been my worst residential experience.\n\nThe rennovations within these units were very poorly done. I look around in my apartment and feel as though this place could fall apart at any moment.\n\nThe plumbing within these units is also terrible. I have completed countless maintenance requests for no resolve. I have also been asked to no longer use the shower in my bedroom, because it causes a leak in the apartment below me.\n\nMaintenance has even come to cut a portion of a wall out to resolve plumbing issues. I never got a completion notice and the wall was never repaired.\n\nYou should also be prepared for the water within the complex to be turned off without notice, for repairs that could take hours.\n\nThe HVAC System also works poorly and the age of this unit causes it to be quite drafty so expect high utilities expense.\n\nThe keys to my apartment somehow were \"misplaced\" by the leasing office. I was not informed by the leasing office, but by maintenance men when they came and knocked on my door asking for a copy of my key.\nIt was very difficult to take this up with anyone in the leasing office, because the turn over here is crazy. Very rare that I've walked into this office and seen the same face twice. (HUGE RED FLAG IN TERMS OF SAFETY FOR RESIDENTS)\n\nThe walls are very thin... You'll hear EVERYTHING your neighbors are doing and the outdoors areas are not kept clean.\n\nPlease also be prepared for whatever goes down your neighbors kitchen sink/garbage disposal because it will come up through yours and the smell is deathly.\n\nAnd the list goes on and on...\n\nMy suggestion: Before you stop into the leasing office, I suggest you drive through this complex and take a good hard look before they glaze you over with things that sound awesome and show you model apartments that would not actually stand up to everyday living.\n\nAlso, read EVERY review!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1539106463454, "text": "Thank you for taking the time to review our community.

We have maintence staff who are friendly and professional while in your home. Issues are usually handled in a reasonable time with some exceptions.\n\nThe seclusion and peace that my little peace of heaven offers is worth giving this place a look if you are in the market for a good stepping stone. I would not suggest this place for long-term living. The high turn over of office staff will make your head spin and there are more than a few foundational issues in the buildings themselves. There was a remodeling project started last summer that has yet to be completed.\n\nI do feel the pool is safe enough during the summer to allow my little ones to splash around and have been graced with a few great neighbors in my particular building. I don't really venture out beyond that. I also appreciate that this is a dog friendly complex. The complex is kind of cut out of and into a wooded area so the dogs get the run of the few grass areas available, but are kept completely clear ofhe toddler-friendly play area. t\n\nThe gym is figureprint monitored which makes me feel safe when I'm in there early mornings or late nights alone. I never feel afraid to walk the complex at night because of the on-site officer and the pleasant people your run in to sometimes.\n\nThis place does certainly have its pros and cons.

They were AWFUL! We had much better management through other companies - who would send someone to fix problems when there were issues. For the last couple months of our time there, the hot water heater was broken. It was leaking out horrible, nasty water (I'd be glad to share a picture here if there is any question on that). I was in touch with them and eventually heard back from an email that the owner didn't seem to want to fix it, so we're left with that. My whole family was sick during this time.\n\nWe were amazing renters. During our two years there we replaced all three toilets (that were stained beyond repair and had flushing issues) with high end TOTO toilets, replaced the dishwasher (that was spitting out black stuff and hair into our dishes and then into empty loads right after we got there), replaced a bench out front (that was broken wood with exposed, rusted screws), put protective doorstops behind each door (where they had gone through the walls behind them before we moved in), and repaired a rotting fence on multiple occasions. Once, and entire chunk of the fence fell down exposing the back yard to a busy road. We repaired that too.\n\nAt the end of our lease they did not return any money, or contact us, within the 60 day timeline. Because nobody would answer our calls or emails, we ended up going into the office after that time. We were first told that they weren't in the office (after the receptionist went down the hall to talk to them) and then she ended up finding someone for us - who told us that he hadn't gotten around to it. We waited. Eventually he came out with a partial check. Apparently after we moved out the owner had the rotten fence ripped down and a new fence installed - and they decided to charge us money for new gates (new double gate is what was circled on the invoice). We never had a double gate while living there. It would have been nice because we would have then been able to take our riding lawnmower into both yards rather than have a separate mower for each yard.\n\nAnd while we have never met the owner - I am inclined to believe that they have just as crappy of service on that side as well. Hence the reason he pulled his properties from them and had them listed with a new company the day after we were gone. Even though our checks were always in before the first of the month, if they had to wait for a check from them like we did, I don't blame him one bit!\n\nIf you want a decent company, whether as owner or tenant, I suggest you look elsewhere. One star is 20%. Management Apex does not deserve 20%.\n\nAny questions? I'd be glad to share more.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b5691bb8583:0x6cf227058ea80758"}

This year, I get a notification that they are still trying to collect on the previous years and when I brought up the arrangement I was told \"Sorry for the miscommunication.\"\nThey are trying to charge me HOA dues for the 4 years I owned my home but did not know there was an HOA.
