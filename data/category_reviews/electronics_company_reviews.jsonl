I ended up receiving the product I initially wanted. After using their product for a small amount of time, I will say again that it is solid and backed by a great customer service team. Will purchase again.\n\nPurchased a surface transmitter/receiver and received the wrong receiver. Called them and admitted it could've been my mistake, but was then told to then email them describing the issue. No big deal. Sent the email and did not receive a response. I called back a week later to just find out what my options were and was told to ship both units back at my expense if I wasn't happy with the purchase. Seems strange to ask a pretty simple question and receive an over the top and almost hostile response. I don't know how I conveyed any displeasure with their service/product before receiving that response (I hadn't used the product yet), but Bradley was under that impression. I didn't feel one way another about it initially, but after just a few attempts to correspond with this company I have to say that they have lit the candle. I don't review a lot of company's customer service, but this experience was unnecessarily negative in my opinion. Could've went a lot of directions, but I guess my $220 doesn't grant me access to the \"unparalleled customer service\" these other reviews mention. After now using the transmitter I think the product is solid and can only hope for issue free operation, but if it's backed by individuals that just brush off initial ordering complications... doesn't sit too well with me. The reps I personally dealt with were Bradley and Bobby. Tread carefully.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1563907322160, "text": "Thank you for your feedback, Jimmy.
