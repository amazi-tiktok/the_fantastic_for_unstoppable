Because of their error, I was billed $200 extra. After long waits on the phone with BCBS, I found out the story above.\n\nAt 9:30 am today I called Stopwatch to ask about how we could have been charged if we confirmed at the front desk that we were covered. They told me they would contact billing and return my call. When I didn't hear back from them in 30 min, I stopped by the office to ask in person about the error. After waiting for 20 minutes in the waiting room, I ended up calling the billing office myself and actually having to pass my phone to the receptionist to get their error fixed. After all that, they admitted fault and adjusted my bill.\n\nMy kid was sick when I went in to talk about billing, so I thought I might as well have him seen now that the billing issue was worked out.\n\nWe waited a reasonable 20 min, they did a flu test, and released us with an RX called in to CVS.\n\nI had to call twice, but they finally said they were resenting my RX. I assumed it'd be ready in an hour.\n\nWrong again. After trusting them to call in my prescription twice now, I went to Walgreens around 12:30, only to have them tell me that it hadn't been called in. So I had to call the office a FOURTH time now, and get them to actually call my prescription in.\n\nStopwatch forgot to cancel the RX at CVS, so I had to call CVS for them and ask them to cancel that prescription so that my finally called in RX could be filled at Walgreens. I got my kid's medicine at 1:30, after sitting in Walgreens for an hour for a prescription that was supposed to be called in and picked up. My sick kid fell asleep sitting up because of how long we had to wait.\n\nDragging my sick kid all over town and having to wait multiple hours because of Stopwatch's errors makes me positive that I'll never use this Urgent Care again.

Only rating it this well because of the wonderful reception staff and physician assistant that I saw on the day of my visit.  The lack of covid-19 precautionary measures is alarming.  The waiting room is packed full of people (many coughing) waiting for covid testing (walk-in appointments). There should be some kind of wait in your car if you're there for covid testing available, entry through another door, make an appointment to be tested, etc, to limit the amount of contact between potentially infected patients and people who are there for things like a sprain or a bite wound. On top of that there was no cleaning of seats in the waiting room going on between patients.\nThey failed to ask for my pharmacy during the triage process, so when they told me I was ready to go, I asked where to pick up my meds as I noticed a pharmacy in the waiting room.  They told me my meds were ready to go at the pharmacy I was asked for in triage.  When I said there was no pharmacy asked for in triage, they asked me for my pharmacy, which then never sent my meds to.  They conveniently closed a few minutes after I left (I was in the waiting room for 2 hours).  When I called the next morning, I was on hold for 45 minutes constantly having my call transferred to the back staff who would never pick up only to be told they were too busy to deal with sending my call to the back again and that I could come to their pharmacy to get the prescriptions.  Which if they had told me that the night before I would have already had 2 doses of much needed medication.\nBasically this place is pure chaos.  I understand that things are hard with covid and healthcare workers are stretched thin, but this clinic is likely creating more cases by their poor planning and crowding of those exposed to covid with uninfected people.
