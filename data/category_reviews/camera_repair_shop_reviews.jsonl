Explained that I needed my screen replaced on my iPhone. I take it out to show the guy and he presses all over it, and while he is telling me my battery is swollen and causing the screen to bend, he turns it on and my screen was split in half! I couldn't use half my screen! I work 2 blocks away and have been very careful with my phone (have had a bent-ish screen for months!) so I really don't think this happened in my pocket. I called him out on it as soon as I saw the screen and he said \"Look, you can't even use the screen now\". He proceeded to talk about other things with my phone and didn't address the problem of him breaking my screen. He priced a screen and battery for me, but I declined and walked out because he broke my screen and absolutely refused to acknowledge it. I went back to the office, called this place and asked to speak to the manager. He asked what was wrong and I told him about the staff breaking my screen. He reveals that the guy I'm speaking with on the phone is the one who \"helped\" me in the store, and said that he is the manager and owned the store. I calmly explained to him what he did and how I watched him do it right in front of my face. He REFUSED to take responsibility and tried offering a $10 discount for both screen and battery instead. I said no thanks, and to have a nice day before hanging up. I am SO upset - I ended up just buying a new phone since it was about the same cost of what he would charge for a screen and battery.

You also mentioned it was dropped on the corner of screen which is a very critical place of impact it\u2019s the easiest place to crack on an iPhone specially if it\u2019s the plus size phone but if you stop by we will try our best to make sure you get a better experience with us with a discounted price and free screen protector.\n\nThank you\nPhone Clinic management"}, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc46fc6b8c9:0x315fad46bea8efd0"}
