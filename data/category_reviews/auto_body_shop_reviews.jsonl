From initial estimate to vehicle pick-up, you can expect calls, texts and emails for status updates.\n\nMost importantly, the work done on my vehicle was exceptional - down to replacing a decal in the appropriate spot.  Every person I spoke to was knowledgable about vehicle maintenance and I never felt \"talked down to\" or oversold.  I did actually have a small issue after I picked my vehicle up that needed to be addressed (due to part delivery and not the work of the shop).  The shop identified it immediately and went as far to pick my vehicle up while I was at my office, and deliver it back to me in incredible timing.  This proved to me that they stand by their warranty and customer service.   Again, the communication, the accessible locations, the quality workmanship and overall experience was unparalleled.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc0aca5b563:0xbf8af900bb8931e"}

That's what I call customer service!\n\nMr. Todd and his team had my vehicle done within the time frame he had proposed. When I saw my vehicle for the first time since dropping it off, I couldn't help but feel like I just bought my car and drove it out of the dealership.

Third, my locks on my door click over and over due to my back door lock not being connected so I have to manually lock the door now. The fourth reason is my window visors,  when they replaced the driver door it had a window visor, they took it off the old door and also broke it in the process and then continued to put it on my new door and glued the pieces back! Why in the world would anyone do that!? I would\u2019ve been happy if they would\u2019ve left it off to begin with. Definitely do not recommend.

Asking about the wheel, the manager and director claim that the estimate for the wheel was in error due to a \"software glitch\", then they said the cost for the replacement was about $300 more than estimated. I was very confused and asked them to please explain because I must have missed something. They then said that the wheel part number on the estimate was for the \"wrong\" wheel. They reprinted the estimate for the updated wheel cost, and this time there was no part number, only the increased cost. I asked them to meet me half way on the wheel but they would discount by only $100; Im used to companies honoring their commitment.

Our experience quickly went downhill as it took 2 months for them to replace the front bumper and radiator. When I got my car back the front right headlight didn't work. We later figured out the headlight unit was cracked and they didn't find that worth telling us. We fixed the headlight on our own. A couple days later there was a leak under the car. We figured out it was the antifreeze reservoir. So we took it back to Lynch and they filled up and said it would be good. After bringing it home it leaked again so we took it back only for them to do THE SAME THING. Filling it up and claiming it was fixed. We ended up having to make two more trips leaving the car there for multiple days each time. After the fourth time of taking the car and Lynch being completely bewildered by the leaking of antifreeze we decided we are not wasting any more of our time with them. As if the incompetence of the workmanship wasn't enough, we had the misfortune of working with Dennis. Dennis was extremely rude and unhelpful.

I was a previous customer and had a great experience, so when my vehicle suffered damage from a piece of plywood flying out of  a pickup truck I naturally wanted to go back. I expected the front skirt to be repaired as easily and as great as before. While the skirt was repaired, my vehicle suddenly had other things not working that was working prior to my body repair. Bottom line is I feel like I was given some song and dance about the situation. Dennis, who was apparently the manager of the operation, has absolutely no customer service skills. He argued with me and made sure I knew how wrong he thought that I was. There's really no sense in airing the argument here because all that will happen is a rebuttal post stating I was wrong again. Dennis heard Christian music playing on my radio in my van and while not directly saying it, he insinuated that I was not acting as a Christian. No where in the Bible does it state that Christians are to be doormats and be trampled on or even taken advantage of. I feel me calling him on a situation is completely appropriate and not ungodly. I also feel like him using the \"I'm a Christian too\" card to try to make his point was highly inappropriate. The problem at hand was not about being a Christian or not, it was about why something else going wrong with my vehicle under his care. I never felt like I got a satisfactory answer. He set up for us to have it looked at next door, but it seemed way too coincidental that the exact thing Dennis suggested was wrong be wrong and it would be about $1200 out of my pocket. Upon further investigation on my own, what was suggested isn't accurate. That would have been a lot of money to spend for something that wasn't truly broken. I also found it super odd that the following day, a Saturday (when the center is closed) another employee called me on my cell from his cell to discuss what was wrong so he could make it right. Red flag! I never returned this Individual's call. Business should be done during business hours and also not on someone's day off on their private phone, especially if you've never talked with this person. I couldn't help but wonder why this happened. Was this guy covering for himself, did he know why a part mysteriously and suddenly went bad in my vehicle? Had Dennis been this was with other customers and he was building a case against him? Either way it was wrong and no way to do business. The only redeeming individual there was the lady at the desk. She ran that place great! She made her customers feel welcomed and most important. She helped to the extent that she could. It's ashame she couldn't have been in charge of fixing my vehicle. One final thing that comes to mind has to do with the insurance. It was a road hazard claim. My agent asked that contact be made directly with his office and not the main 800 number. It took so much for me to convince Dennis to speak with my agent directly. Eventually, He was able to speak with the office and get the ball rolling. He was not thrilled with this. I just kept being told that they were an authorized agent for said insurance. I really felt like if I had gone in as a private pay that my quote would have been different. I was told several times that because of some of the damage to the vehicle that the quote may not be accurate. Amazing. When we had to pay the bill, it was down to the penny quoted. The quote included new fog light bulbs. if I'm not mistaken, and all that supposedly happened was they needed to be plugged back in. Where did that portion of the quote get dropped? I just don't know. It is possible that I did not understand the quote because it's not broken down for easy understanding. I am certain of this, my vehicle left Lynch Collision with a function not working that had been working. I am also sure of this: I will not be back to Lynch Collision as long as Dennis is there. I may reconsider should there be management changes. I do not know. It was a very disappointing experience.

I live about an hour and a half away so I really love it!  I did all my negotiating via email and set up a test drive appointment. Very, very, easy sale for the company. My biggest disappointment is the fact that the car was filthy when I arrived and the battery terminals were severely corroded. I am convinced nobody from the service department even looked under the hood until I made them.  I wanted the terminals cleaned,  I wanted an oil change,  all fluids topped off and a cabin air filter change (Very minimal requests for a car dealership) I stated it would have to be detailed inside. The detail department worked on it but they would only be there until 12 or 12:30. So we concluded our business (paid cash) and I went to lunch without the car.  Well by the time I got back the headliner was much cleaner but it smelled terribly in the car (like stagnant mop water). Nothing else was even wiped down and unfortunately the detail department was gone. There was sticky crusted disgusting something in all the buttons so some would stick in certain positions. Literally the battery terminal was only brushed with a wire brush to knock off the corrosion. I don't think the oil was changed. When I got home the oil did not appear new. I think they put new on top of the old then they mixed together. The cabin air filter was not changed. I removed it to check because everytime I used recirculated air instead of fresh it smelled bad. It has a new one now and it no longer has an odor.\n\nMy salesman was okay, but seriously the easiest commission ever. Wish I would have at least gotten an after the sale phone call. Just to check in. Would have made me feel better about the other issues.\n\nMy complaints are only directed to the service and detail departments.\n\nI am now looking for a truck in the $20,000 range (same as my Maxima) and I am not even looking at this company now.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb264d8d2482b:0xf6be7f6160faedaf"}

I was even hearing what I thought to be something with a truck of interest, Bobby and the crew immediately sent the truck into the shop and informed me of the outcome.

After going through this ridiculous process of trying to prove my income for 2-3 hours and trying to be put in a car  the finance company wanted me to have. I was exhausted, over it and ready to leave. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, someone decided to make a big deal out of nothing. My children went ahead of me and went to the door. They were holding the door for each other and then was holding it for me, waiting for me to catch up and come out. Before I got to the door they were approached by a lady. She told my children to either go out the door or go find their moma or daddy and they they were letting the air out. I was appalled!! I asked her what was the problem. I asked her name and she mumbled something and I asked her again and she told me she didn\u2019t owe me an explanation!!  Come to find out she was the owner. The salesman walked up to me try to find out what was going on. She began to butt in, so then the gentleman walked me out the door to discuss it. it started to rain, he offered to grab an umbrella for me. We make our way into the building and the owner runs up to the salesman and tells him he is her employee and He better not walk me out the door. How pathetic and nasty can a human be over nothing!!\nI\u2019m sick of people  acting ignorant for no reason towards me. So needless to say I left all deals on the table and vowed to make it known that I would never spend a dime with a company that doesn\u2019t value my business or dollar. So it\u2019s above me now!!\n\nAnd so far from what I hear the cars are junk! A friend of mine bought a van and the alternator went out 2 days after she purchased it.\n\nOh and if you plan on buying a car using your business name don\u2019t waste your time.

I was given estimates for when the repair would be ready and they were early.\n\nThe rental car was provided for me at the location and my drop off was also at the location.\n\nThis accident repair occurred during the covid pandemic. Upon entering the office, masks and a sanitation station were provided for customers. The door clearly identified the mask requirement for entering the building. All employees wore masks.\n\nThe work provided comes with a lifetime warranty.

XD\n\nFor Korean customer,\nApril 19, 4 pairs of tires and four pairs of TPMS (air pressure sensor). Total $ 830.\nI had a good tire replacement. Air leak Check well and balance well, old machine, accuracy is lower than latest equipment. Go to a place you can trust in luxury cars with run-flat tires.\n\nExcept for spare parts! TMPS is installed and the coding cost is only $ 160. The TPMS tool you own is TS501 ($ 200)\nFailing to code a new sensor in the car.\nThe OEM sensor is a problem. If it is a car problem, refuse the refund,\nForcibly reset the alarm with OBD tool and exit.\nThe next day, of course, the warning light comes on again.\n\nI visited again and invited you to do it myself, and I was impressed by the video below. \"Come on, now, if you wake up again, study again.\"\n\nI am doing manual BRZ self-maintenance.\nWe are working on engine oil, mission oil, intake filter, kevin filter, brake pad, liner, brake fluid, coolant flush, spark plug, manual clutch pad, various lights, rear camera,\nThe tire was not able to be removed without equipment, so I visited the shop.\n\nThe most inexpensive but safe way of replacing tires through advanced experience,\n1. Purchase tires directly online or through warehouse marts\n2. Equipped with tires in place operated by Mexican people ($ 10 each)\n3. Balance and alignment in the latest equipment shop.\n\nPros: The impression of the boss. Hours of leisure available.\nDisadvantages: old and poor equipment, technological power behind the speed of automobile development, and the ridiculously expensive price.\n\n(Original)\n*This review is written after tire replacements.\n\nDo NOT replace tire in this \"Body\" shop.

This review is not worthy of your response as I've already heard all of your excuses and even read some of them in your responses to reviews. My Mechanic is on vacation, waiting for parts to arrive, dealing with a warranty issue etc. However none of this explains why it took 3 months to render repairs, why were there services on my invoice that had not been performed on my vehicle and why my vehicle is not in drivable condition today. When this issue was presented to the business owner instead of him treating a paying consumer with respect, I was met with, anger, frustration, he himself had a lack of understanding, unwillingness to explain, lack of empathy.

You should look it up. With that said here is our reply to your review.\nI am sorry you are having an issue after the repair but an engine replacement is just that, the engine along with any extra parts that we felt were questionable and they are listed on your invoice. There is not an ECM on your invoice. Please keep in mind that there are several other things under the hood of your car that can also cause future problems. Unfortunately we are not able to detect a component such as an ECM, starter, alternator, Oxygen Sensor, Injector and so on that is about to go bad, it is just impossible. Your vehicle is 11 years old and does have 175,000 miles on and usually parts and components will begin to fail and need replacing after 10 years. This ECM is not covered under warranty because we did not replace this part and it does not come with an engine. I have copied and pasted some information for you that came from a site called my mechanic explaining the ECM\u2019s function to your car. We have ordered the ECM, as you know, and as soon as it is installed and the car is test drove we will call you.\nHere is some information that I pulled from the site \"My Mechanic\" that may help you better understand an ECM's function.\nThe engine control module (ECM), also commonly referred to as the engine control unit (ECU) or powertrain control module (PCM), is one of the most important components found on virtually all  vehicles. It essentially functions as the main computer for many of the vehicle\u2019s engine performance and drivability functions. The ECM takes the information from the engine's various sensors and uses that information to calculate and tune engine spark and fuel for maximum power and efficiency. Erratic engine behavior also indicates a bad or failing ECM. A faulty computer may cause the vehicle to intermittently stall or misfire. The symptoms might come and go and not appear to have any sort of pattern to their frequency or severity. The ECM plays a vital role in engine performance. Any issues with it can cause major problems with the overall functionality of the car."}, "gmap_id": "0x8888e1ecf9f042b3:0x2b83686c18294477"}

My P30 Step Van was towed in to get a refreshing and almost had to be towed away. I heard their ad on the radio, gave them a call and found out they service Cintas vans. I spoke to the owner Matt on the phone and he assured me that he was the place to come to and he would take care of me. I told him what I wanted done, I also left a list with the most important to be taken care of first (fuel tank leak and master cylinder replacement) with the receptionist. I mentioned new tires but didn\u2019t decide what to install, but he did, and installed them without my consent. Later he said he thought that\u2019s what I wanted \u201cthe cheap ones.\u201d He decided to do what he wanted and void my concerns (that I spoke of on every visit). I was charged over $400.00 in parts (radiator, v belt and lug nuts) plus labor @ $74/hour added without my consent nor were they spoken of when I made payments in person. I was charged ($35.00) for an air cleaner that he had left from a previous vehicle and promised that he wouldn\u2019t charge me for since I was getting so much work done. That Monday of week three, I stopped by to realize no work had been done over the past 5 days and I immediately stopped the work and told them I would be back in the morning to pick up and pay off balance. Next morning I waited over and hour for the motor to be pressure washed like he promised it would be done yesterday by lunch. While waiting he then decided that he would for free replace the master cylinder and patch the fuel tank leak with a $6.00 putty instead of replacing the tank like I asked on day one. All while repairs being done there were no actual receipt/list of parts and labor but guesstimations made until I made final payment. After I reviewed the receipt just before I paid the remaining $1,400+ balance I had to request that Matt break down and fix the double charges on receipt (I was so angry that I missed a few issues on the receipt). A week turned into a month and if I had not stopped the work there\u2019s no telling how long it would have taken to get the van back. Now I\u2019m weeks behind schedule on preparing for the van for body work and getting it wrapped.   The total cost was $3,863.68 and $1,417.25 of it was labor. I felt robbed and played. This place is not worthy of your money and will waste your time\u2026. so please be advised!

They drilled holes into my brand new $3200 front end because \"There were holes in the old bumper, so we made holes in the new one\". Wow, how awful. I have a 2013 Lexus GS F-Sport. It originally came from Tx where they require ugly front tags, fortunately in Alabama we do not, but to cover up the old holes the guy before me added a little Lexus vanity plate. So after the accident instead of asking me or just leaving the bent up old plate. They drilled holes into my brand new painted bumper to add a very dented up, paint now peeling off, vanity plate that I never wanted. You can always add it, you can't un-drill the holes, why would they do that? My guess is that they charged my insurance company for a new OEM part at top dollar (verified) and instead put a used part that already had the holes, and so to cover it up they put the previous owner's old dented up vanity tag back on...Thanks for the $3200 of body work.\nOn top of that,  To start with Jim gave me an estimate for the front end damage for my car that was $1300 (ended up $3200, no big deal), and told me that if I got it done there he could fix the little golf ball sized dent in the back for me as part of it since it was small. But after they ended up finding $3200 they later told me that they could not add that dent in because they were already to tight on the project. I could get it out for $300, I just got a quote down the road and they said they will remove it for $100 and that would be pretty standard anywhere.\nSo to recap, they drilled holes into the brand new bumper that I did not want there and didn't remove the dent in the back that the estimator said he would have included. Then asked for more than going rate to have a third party dent puller fix it with them marking it up at least 1/3.\nThey get 2 stars because the work that is done looks pretty clean. But I chose this place over a State Farm approved body shop because I believed Jim would take care of me and the extra dent, well I don't feel taken care of at all.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKSWbwsl2GosgKb0qsnl0QG1fsAQeim4KPmkXW=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqGmW3spDDCYPqVKBXBtuiTd0eodrqU5dDtN5U=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890c9bcf855281:0xdcd89d851aa5504"}

There was a car fax on the car at time of purchase and my guess is it was never repaired properly by the previous body shop.  It was hard to see, so I did not notice at the time of purchase beause the car was otherwise in great condition, inside and out.  We were told about Classic Car after taking our car to the Irondale Mercedes dealership, who informed us that was the only certified Mercedes body shop in Birmingham.  Our tailgate was repaired perfectly and at a very good cost by Classic Car Motoring!  I could not be more pleased.\n\nFast forward, a couple of months later, and someone tried to \"pry\" the back door open while I was shopping in the Hoover area.  I did not notice this until one day it rained and I saw a leak.  I took the car the next day to Chris Baggett at Classic Car, fully expecting to leave it and get a repair bill.  But Chris said, \"oh I think I can do this myself right now.\"  He applied just the right amount of pressure several times to the door using his body weight and strength until the door eventually molded back to the door frame.  He said the doors were made to be somewhat flexible.  My husband and I were shocked and he would NOT LET US PAY HIM ANYTHING.

The  cost estimator was courteous and detailed.  The update emails were helpful. It seems that once the vehicle is transferred to the service staff, the estimator looses contact and or control. To me the estimator is the representative to the customer and should be involved in the entire process and have the final call on the quality of the service.  I assume this is not the case.  Upon arrival to pick up my vehicle I paid the balance due on the invoice and listened to the rehearsed verbiage on pleasing the customer, before my vehicle was brought up to view.  Immediately I noticed a severe flaw in the paint job (peeling) and a flaw in the chrome grill....obviously there was no quality control involved in my situation.  When I pointed out the issues, they were quickly noted and apologies were made. The vehicle was taken back to service.  After a week plus of no updates....I guess the email/text updates are not for correcting mistakes made....I contacted the office and I felt like the forgotten customer.  An update could not be shared and It seemed I had to remind them who I was.  They did kindly offer to get back with me.  I appreciated that and maybe my feelings, of not being on the TOP of the list of importance, are not warranted. I do feel I pre paid for a service not completed properly. Please understand I am not in a hurry, I just want the car returned in perfect order, with all the issues that were verbally discussed, completely resolved (to include an irritating noise caused by the accident).  I am patiently waiting.  I do not feel that what happened to me is the standard of service, but it did happen this one time. I would recommend and would use again.\nThank you.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a43c738908ffb:0xc0f843553c2ca50d"}

I did not walk out feeling as though a great deal on a vehicle was the only thing I got. I walked out of that dealership with an uplifted spirit and felt through the whole process that I was receiving amazing fellowship and as if I were being edified through this whole process. If God sees fit I will absolutely be a customer for life.They were an absolute inspiration and are a perfect model of a working business  plan that is extremely successful. And I\u2019m not talking only monetarily successful. I left with a fire in me that they helped to burn brighter.

I purchased what was told to me to be my Certified 2015 Chevrolet Suburban LTZ.

When I asked why wasn't these things serviced and replaced before I purchased the vehicle I was told the repairs wasn't necessary at the time. I feel the salesman did a great job but the service department made it a bad purchase by not doing their job!!

Things didn't go quite as we had planned. Our SUV was cutting out pretty bad on the highway. It was getting worse the closer we got to Mobile. I contacted my friend who's daughter lives in Mobile to see if she might know of a service place. I talked with her daughter and she informed me that her husband, Kyle, worked for Joe Bullard Cadillac. She gave me the number for the service department and said to speak with Haley.  About this time the check engine light came on in our vehicle. It was flashing on and off, then would stay lit.\nWhen I spoke with Haley in the service department she asked about the service engine light. When I told her it had been flashing intermittently she was immediately concerned and said we should get stopped as quickly as we could to avoid internal engine damage.  She then helped us get started with finding a tow service. We were 50 miles aWay and had four people so their usual towing service couldn't do it, but she got the ball rolling for us. She gave me her direct phone number so I could call if I needed anything.\nOnce we got to the dealership Kyle helped us get a loaner car while ours was being repaired. Haley kept us informed as they learned what was wrong. Our technician, Mike, came in on Saturday to work on our vehicle because we needed to leave to head back to Missouri on Sunday.\nTo make a long story short...God used all of these people to help us during a difficult time. They made this experience so much less stressful than it could've been. THEY WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND TO HELP US! And, they did it all with a smile.

What I didn't like was that the mechanics were excessively rough with my vehicle. I had to have it towed and the towing company left it at the gate. Christian got me a loaner car, which I appreciated very much. When I picked up the loaner there were 2 guys who were trying to get it started to get it up to the shop. I needed to grab a couple things out of my car so I stopped to do that. For some reason they needed to open the back hatch. I was traveling with my animals so I had a large kennel in the back. I watched them put my seats down (rather roughly) and sling my kennel from the back to atop the back seats. It made me cringe but at this point I needed to get going as I had some stops to make and  I thought surely they knew what they were doing, this is a Cadillac dealership afterall and these cars cost a lot. They will surely be careful... When I got my car back, instead of them putting the vehicle back they way they found it, the kennel was still strown across the back. (As a plus though, it was washed! Which I appreciated since I had been on the road and try to take care of my car!) When I went to move the kennel back in place I noticed that there are scrapes across the plastic sides in the back. Greeeeaaaaaat. But, at that point I was leaving to head back to my home state and couldn't worry about it. It was more important to get home safe. They told me in addition to the battery that I needed new air filters, a rear wiper blade, and the throttle body cleaned, all easy enough for me to do myself. So, now I am here doing said maintenance and when I popped the hood I immediately noticed that my positive battery terminal clip has been broken and won't stay shut. Great. I am now back home, 3 states away. I will be back to the area, and am considering moving my family there but if they don't make this right I will find a different dealership to maintenance at.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1517174513045, "text": "Hi Jami,\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave your review and detailed feedback.

Curtis, Roosevelt and Ty were very courteous to me and my husband. They answered all of my questions and worked with us to get to the price we were willing to pay. The Cadillac warranty is hard to beat, especially the 4 years of maintenance and the road side assistance. This is the 6th GM vehicle that we presently own and I know will be the best serviced one by far. I had been looking for a vehicle for 5 months when I decided to look at the SRX. I am glad I did. It has everything on it that I was looking for plus a lot or more features. Everyone at the dealership that walked by you spoke and asked you how you were doing. This is a dream vehicle for me and I look forward to driving it for years. I will recommend to family and friends that are interested in a great luxury car or SUV to get a Cadillac at Joe Bullard Cadillac in Mobile, Alabama and ask for Curtis. I had to use the service department today to get my oil changed and check the routine things out. Christian and the others were very courteous and took care of me and my SRX.

The moment my fiance and I pulled up to the dealership we felt welcome. Mustafa Elastal immediately greeted us and made us feel important. He went out of his way to make us feel comfortable as he walked around the lot with us picking out suitable vehicles. This was very important to me considering I had never owned a Cadillac before. His extensive knowledge of the vehicle I wanted (XTS) and the history of Cadillac itself impressed me by far. The hospitality didn't stop with Mustafa. Roosevelt Harris also did a fine job answering all the questions I had about the different cars and prices. He also mentioned a couple of nice restaurants we could try out while visiting Atlanta, GA which we did and absolutely loved. Curtis Williams came by and personally greeted us and also had a nice conversation with my fiance. Last, but definitely not least, Jon McCartney was absolutely amazing (and not just because he actually knows where Winnfield, LA is located lol). He worked very hard to get the financing I needed to get the exact vehicle I wanted. It was a hard sale for me, but he showed us that he wouldn't give up. I really appreciated all the time that each of them took out to make our experience the best car buying experience we have had. I would recommend this dealership without thinking twice (I already have mentioned them to others), and I will be bringing others to come do business with Joe Bullard Cadillac in Mobile, AL.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da8e0caaef5:0xa8eb3c2a1737d68b"}

We saw one on the interstate and decided to go look at them. When we got there it was freezing and windy and Darren Robinson was in the parking lot moving cars. He offered his help and we told him we were in town to Christmas shop not spend all day at a dealership, we just wanted to try the car on for size. he escorted us inside for coffee and cocoa and went to get the car. we test drove it. we loved it but we were not there to spend all day at the dealership. we left our personal information to be reviewed and were going to shop when Darren notified us that we would be using the cadillac for the day via loaner form approval. we really enjoyed using the car. we Christmas shopped all day and when we returned to the dealership we had been approved for the car with our payments within dollars of request. Jon McCartney had to have been the most professional financial manager i have ever encountered. He was a real person who made us feel right at home and comfortable to speak openly. very friendly and personable. then Roosevelt Harris enters the picture. a gem. a diamond in the rough. so charismatic so joyful and helpful and accomodating. I cannot put into words how much Darren helped to familiarize us with the cue and features. he was so knowledgable of the cars systems. he was an absolute treasure. I cant say but one thing about Joe Bullards team, \"you are doing something right\". I got hugs from everyone when i left. i felt like i was part of a family there. I even got a text message from Darren on Christmas morning wishing us a merry Christmas. i literally spent 2 hrs tops at the dealership and received the most beautiful CHristmas gift I could have ever dreamed of. but the most inportant thing was the environment and kindness that we experienced while there. oh and my son loved the lounge with computers and coffee/cocoa which made his time there enjoyable also. we will definitely reccomend Joe Bullard Cadillac to friends and family and we will definitely be repeat customers ourselves. my only hope is that we have the privilege of having the same staff in years to come.

I chose them based on the reviews but after I had my car worked on, I spoke with others that had similar experiences.  It began unprofessionally. They had my car for 3 or 4 days and did not call. However, when I called them, they said they didn't know they had the work order from insurance but it was in my car. I didn't find them to be nice until I told them about their attitudes which did get better. On to the actual work, it took them 2 weeks on a 4 day job (according to insurance). This caused confusion with insurance.  When I finally got my car back, it wasn't fixed. I was told by them to take it to a mechanic by one of the employees because JH is a body shop. I took it to a dealership which advised me JH did not properly attach hoses. They admitted fault and fixed the problem.  However, other things  that were not wrong, are now wrong. Insurance wouldn't  cover it because the adjuster said it wasn't likely to happen in the accident, which only leaves me to believe it happened at JH. This has been going on since February and I finally finished in May. I had to spend additional time and money on something that was not my fault. This is the same thing I was told from others after leaving them. Before going there, get another opinion from a certified professional.  I will say, at least they tried to fix the problems.

I don't understand how someone could leave anything but a 5 star review. I read one review where clearly an unfortunate series of events occurred, along with some possible misunderstandings. In my opinion Reliable Auto Care and Exhuast is an extremely fitting name. If they could use trustworthy in their acrynym it would be even more so fitting. I've experienced nothing but good service, punctuality, and honesty from all the workers and the master mechanic. If a mistake was made or the progress changed in an unexpected direction I was called immediately and informed of the situation, then asked what I would like to do in order to proceed. I even had a sensor accidentally broken once while they were making a repair and they called me to notify me of their mistake and to tell me that they had already bought another sensor and replaced it at no additional cost. The most astonishing occurrence was last year when I had to have a crack in my exhuast welded up and the manifold tightened, then I proceed to hit a speed bump a couple weeks later and break the weld and loosen where the manifold had been tightened. After one quick call they told me to bring it back so they could repair it again for free. I would recommend anyone to this Auto Shop, even family.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a542a0710eb8d:0x8cd2a2bbe70c0c1"}

My fiance took his daily commute truck there 3 weeks ago and we still have not been able to get them to fix the original problem! The first week they had it from Monday thru to Friday at closing time which we were told we needed to hurry to come by and pay them and pick up the truck because they were ready to leave for the weekend. We pick it up and it barely makes it back to the house. We had to wait to contact them Monday the 2nd week only to find out that the gentleman that worked on the truck conveniently has Monday's off. We took it back because at that point we were already into them for a large amount of money and needed them to fix what the obviously didn't the first time around. They kept it over the holiday week and I assume never even touched it the entire time it was there. Going into the 3rd week we were told we needed to buy an additional part before they could finish the job... Where was that realization the first week you had it?!?!? Three weeks into this simple repair job and we were into a rental for $700 out of our pockets!! They didn't care about that either, knowing this is his daily truck, they sat on this vehicle stalling far too long and in no way tried to make it right. Not to mention the front desk receptionist is RUDE and extremely conceded! She has no concern for what you tell her about your situation. I don't know how many people can afford to have their daily commuter in the shop, but I'm here to say we will NEVER take another vehicle back in the vicinity of that place.

The drivers door had to be closed using a ratchet strap because the spot where the striker went was now just a hole. The passenger door wasn't far behind. Looked them up, saw the amazing reviews, keep in mind dixie body is the ONLY body shop with a 5 star review. Hands down Pete is the nicest professional person you will ever come across. I asked if it could be fixed within my budget and he even beat what I was thinking it would cost. Much lower than anyone else. I brought it in on thursday afternoon, he said by the following friday it would be done and behold tuesday he gave me a text saying it was finished. Let me tell you, when I say you can't tell it's not just as it rolled off the showroom floor, I mean that is the absolute best body work I've ever seen in my life. Pete is a really good person. He is honest and hard working. He isn't like the normal body shops that only care about charging high prices to insurance company. He is out for the average person on a budget. There isn't a shop out there that can deliver perfection like pete can. Dixie auto body is a true jewel when it comes to autobody work in baldwin county. Hell, you would probably have to search state to state to find anyone that can compare to his level of skill, precision, and performance.

They cannot do a simple tire patch on one of the tires that I brought from them? I would have waited on that to be done too. This is poor, and unacceptable customer service.

The vibration was not in the steering wheel but the chassis. It felt like a u-joint to me so I proceeded slowly at 25mph to try and locate help. I pulled into the A-1 Tire Sale & Service Goodyear dealer and asked if they could repair my vehicle and what I thought it was. They said they would look at it and see if the could. After some time the mechanic returned to get the Service Writer and they exited and soon she returned to let me know that what was wrong was both front wheel bearings were bad  and my idler arm and bracket were worn out. I asked how much to fix ans was quoted $446.00. I asked was u-joint bad ?\"no it OK \" I was told. I asked to see my vehicle and when I spun the wheels I herd no noise, when I checked for play by lifting up on tire I noticed none. Then moving tire side to side I felt no play in the Idler arm. Now mind you anything can break at ant time, but I had my vehicle in the shop last week for a tie rod end and front end alignment by men I have trusted for years. So I refused the repairs and for my vehicle to be taken off the lift. The mechanic then came over to where we were, I then asked him \"you didn't find anything wrong with the u-joint? NO was his answer. As he backed the vehicle off the lift a loud ping could be heard, like that you here when you have a bad u-joint. I then drove to another shop recommended by my son-in-law, and when their mechanic walked under the vehicle he could see the u-joint was bad with out touching it.\nU-joint was repaired and $70.00 later I was on the road with no vibration.    So before I let A-1 Tire do any work on my vehicle I would recommend you take it to a honest shop to determine what is really wrong.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892955dfe266a9d:0x660c350c5bf1fd5e"}

I told them that I would pay cash for the overage, so I could avoid a pricey increase in my insurance premium. I just wish they would've communicated that with me FIRST!!! They didn't even bother!

I suppose if you can't get much comms on the front side, makes me a little worried about the comms during the process. Idk...I run a business myself, so this sort of thing is just odd to me.

There's definitely a difference between the new paint on the new fender and the old paint on the hood but otherwise they did a great job and whoever they use to detail the car when you pick it up does a great job too.

Braden, Tyler, and Chelsea are the best. I am very particular about my cars and Tyler and Braden understand completely. I\u2019ve had them work on several of my cars always did a great job. They matched my pearl white paint on my 2013 Ford Focus perfectly. And when I hit a deer in my 2011 Honda Accord they even went the extra mile and fixed things they didn\u2019t have to like some overspray on my left doors of my Honda. They wet sanded it and made it look like new. I swear I could have taken the honda to the dealer I bought it at and could have gotten close to what I paid for it. Actually when I traded it in the Kia dealer kept commenting on how great it looked. I just had them repair some stuff on my grandma\u2019s car and it looked great. It was so clean and shiny and the paint matched perfectly. It was so clean you could see all the little chips in the paint from being a grocery getter and Tyler went around the car and was touching up every little thing on spots they didn\u2019t even work on. We kept telling him that he didn\u2019t have to. The work they had done on the front and rear bumper looked perfect. My family jokes that I\u2019m their number one customer. But I hope to never have to take my brand new car to them, but if something does happen to my new car I will be taking it to Rod\u2019s. A few years before I even knew about Rod\u2019s I took my car to Joe Hudson across the street from them and it took them about a day to just repaint my rear bumper from getting rear ended and they didnt even blend the the paint. And when I had taken my car to Joe Hudson it was done in about a day. But Rod\u2019s they take a few days to a week and you can tell a difference in the work. I know I\u2019m rambling but I cannot brag on them enough. They even invited me to just come up and have a cup of coffee at the shop. They treat you like family. I\u2019m so glad a coworker sent me to them. I will always refer people to them. I can\u2019t wait to see how good of a job they do on my significant other\u2019s daughter\u2019s car.

We were passing through town and decided to stop and grab a bite to eat at the Subway. In a hurry to grab and go,I locked the keys in the car. I called 3 locksmiths and each had thier own reason for not being able to help me. I was at a loss! We decide to eat and think about what to do next. But the Lord had a handle on it. A couple of Firemen pulled up to do some maintenance on the hydrant so I walked out to  ask for help. They said they couldn't but there was a body shop down the road they would ask them. It was only a few minutes later a gentleman walked in Subway and asked if I needed help. I was so relieved! We went to the car and he accessed the situation then pulled out a couple of tools that looked like they were from another planet, but he knew what he was doing. He fiddled and fiddled but that door lock was not cooperating. The Firemen and myself were standing by cheering him on and giving advice as to what we thought would work. Justin stayed steady and with good humor did not give up.  We could see the keys, they were sitting on the console. So close but yet so difficult to get.  Giving up on the idea of pushing the door lock to release it Justin decided to go after the keys by hooking them with that long metal pole. Now things were getting really interesting!  The Firemen were on the opposite side of the car guiding Justin as to how close he was to picking up the set of keys that had at least 10 rings and keys jumbled up in a mess.  He hooked it!!! Now the dilemma was to lift the keys and bring them to the door that had a very small opening held open by a black plastic bag full of air. He was successful getting the keys to the opening and the young Fireman put his finger in the open groove to hold them while Justin pumped up the black bag  to increase the opening so the keys could slide through to the outside. It worked!!!! Yay!!!! Thank you so much Justin and the Firemen, you are MY HEROES!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888d3861c29a1197:0xfba316f6a8782200"}

My husband and I are fulltime RV'ers so our RV is our home and my husband travels for work. So when we found out that our exhaust manifold was cracked we needed someone quickly. So without proper research we took it to these guys. They gave us a crazy estimate but was told that it was JUST an estimate, that it really depended on how hard the exhaust manifold was to remove and if any bolts broke as they were removing it. We dropped it off on a Thursday morning at 8:00 a.m. On Monday at noon my husband was informed that the parts were still not in. Then on Monday at 4:00 p.m. my husband was told that it was ready to be picked up. Since we were over an hour away we told them we would pick it up on Tuesday. My husband was also told that the final bill was $2,990.00. WHAT??? We were flabbergasted because they had told my husband that the exhaust manifold came off easy and that no bolts had broken. My husband talked to the service manager and disputed the bill but the service manager would not budge so in order to get our RV back we had to pay it. Then I did my research and talked to several other diesel mechanics and also talked with some other freightliner and cummins mechanics and was told that they seriously overcharged us for the work that is shown on the bill. The bill states the following \"Pulled unit in shop. removed turbo and exhaust manifold. Cleaned the head and the turbo. Installed and torqued new exhaust manifold and turbo with all new gaskets and bolts. Cleaned inside and out. Ran unit. Checked for leaks none found. Parked unit.\" They charged us $175.00 an hour and claimed 14 hours worth of work for a total labor cost of $2,450.00. No mention of any problems whatsoever in removing the exhaust manifold. In my talks with other diesel mechanics I was quoted anywhere from $1,200.00 to at the most (from another freightliner mechanic) $125.00 an hour for labor. And that it should not have taken 14 hours to do the job if there had been no problems. Another mechanic I spoke with said that if the parts were not there at noon but it was finished at 4:00 then it took them at the most 4 hours to \"install and torque the new manifold and turbo with all new gaskets and bolts. Clean inside and out. Run unit. Check for leaks and park the unit.\" That would leave 10 hours for them to remove the exhaust manifold and that is overboard, especially since there were no issues in removing it. I was given some great advice and I am pursuing this. I was told that in order to hold the Freightliner name that they have to abide by a \"Labor Guide\" and to ask to see it (but we had already paid and picked the RV up so I was too late in doing that) so I have requested the labor guide requirements for this type of job. I have also requested quotes from other diesel mechanics based on what they said they did via the bill. And have contacted the main Freightliner offices. It is sad that we as consumers can not completely trust that we won't be screwed when we take our property to people.\nOn top of all of the above, when we were ready to leave my husband asked for the key and lo and behold they had lost it. They could not find the key to our RV. Really?? What kind of business that works on vehicles loses keys? It was a good thing that we had another key with us. I would recommend to do your research before you make a quick decision like we did.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888602110a7b0ed1:0xc685b4618fec7c7e"}

They are liars and thieves. My husband went to work for WTI in Alabama. Their repair shop is in cahoots with the Freightliner in the same town of Tuscaloosa. Just after a 90 day inspection my husband switched to WTI. They immediately on first day said there he needed over 6000.00 in repairs on his truck. We had no choice st the moment but to get it repaired where he could start work. Freightliner started repair on it. Finished it in THREE WEEKS!! So my husband was out of work for over 4 weeks due to this scam. After he was up & running again here in Pensacola we had to put it in the shop at Freightliner. After a week they found out that none of the parts had been replaced or were either old parts. It took another week to get it approved to not have to pay for the parts and labor on what was done! Then the manager in Pensacola found out that the Work was not even done by a licensed Mechanic in Tuscaloosa!!  Then of course the Pensacola Freightliner found some more things wrong of course. Like they always do. Sigh * we were out of work over 6 weeks due to this. I contacted the owner of the three Freightliner owned by him. One in Tuscaloosa and two in Atlanta area. He wouldn\u2019t call me back at all. If we had had the money and time we would\u2019ve had an attorney. Stay away from WTI in Tuscaloosa & FREIGHTLINER in Tuscaloosa.

Well after being hurried along in signing paperwork so the vehicle could be mine I was very happy with my purchase. However, less than a month later, and still well within my \"warranty\" coverage period I got a Christmas tree of lights on my dashboard. I was told to take it to its dealership and from there I could then make the claim. When I called to make the claim, Auto Nation's warranty service said there was no vehicle with my VIN in the system. I then called the manager there who told me, \"I never signed any contract stating I had a warranty and it doesn't matter what I was told because it isn't in writing.\" I realized the manager was right about this however, I was being told one thing then they intentionally rushed me through signing paperwork so that I wouldn't catch that I never signed anything for my \"warranty\". The deceptive methods of these people shows that they are talented at one thing and, one thing only and, that is lying to people.

I got a diagnosis and repair quote within a day, but word that it would take a week to get the part in. It turned out to be an additional day for the part to arrive, and I was told the car would be done the following day, but  it took two more days for it to get done. We came from the Houston area where we were used to parts being accessible more quickly, so this wait time may be normal for the Mobile area. The pickup experience was a bit frustrating. I picked up on a Saturday and waited 1 hour 15 minutes to get checked out (was told the car was ready but paperwork had to be done). The service rep kept getting pulled away by walk-ins, phone calls, and I'm not sure what else, but it seemed I kept getting bumped to the back of the line.

I explained that my insurance had already paid me, and I was looking for ways to complete the job cheaply but correctly. They said they could repair vs replace the bumper with two days of work. 5 days later (3 days overdue) I pick up my car. The repair appeared to be done skillfully, but the paint job was aweful. The entire bumper had the orange peel appearance. I waited another couple hours and they improved it but still did poor quality work. I signed the paperwork that claimed the work and parts had a warranty. Approx 5 days later, the repair fell completely apart and the materials underneath the bumper fell off. When I returned to show them what had happened, they claimed they would not honor the warranty as it was a repair. This was in complete opposition to what they claimed before the repair. They then accused me of trying to engage in fraud and told me that I should not report this to my insurance company as this would incriminate me. I promptly called the insurance company, they said I had done nothing wrong but b/c they paid me to get the repairs done myself, they could not help. I agreed completely with the insurance company's assessment of the situation. I then called the better business bureau and filed a complaint. Several days later another piece of the bumper came off. This time, they were more responsive (probably due to the BBB's inquiry). In the end, they admitted the repair should never have been done, and a replacement of the bumper should have been done in the first place. They did replace the bumper at no cost to me. They did insist I was trying to engage in fraudulent activities, which was verified as false through my insurance. They simply tried to save a few bucks, and it took them a long time to realize thier repair was outside of their skill set or not possible with the part.

I agreed to pay all charges to repair the car which totaled about $1350.  The owner of the car said it was taking too long to get the car repaired, so she was going to have it fixed elsewhere.  I agreed to pay her directly and get reimbursed by Payne's.  Even though the owner of Payne's promised to send me my money back, it has been over a year and I have not received my money back. I have tried countless time to contact the owner of Payne's but he never returns my calls and is always \"out of the office\".  I contacted the BBB to see if they can help.  They just notified me that he is not responding to them either.  So now I will have to pursue legals means to get my money back.\n\nBeware of doing business with Payne's, and if you do, request the work be done BEFORE you pay.\n\nAs a business owner, I cannot imagine attempting to treat a potential customer in this way.

I was updated about my cars progress every tuesday, thursday, or whenever there was a major event. They truly care about your needs as a customer.\n\nHowever with me what really went above and beyond was when I picked up my vehicle. My radar and sensors were no longer working due to needing recalibration (as far as I could understand) this could only be done at the dealership.\n\nThey didnt put me back on a wait list, they didnt ignore the problem. They saw me asap, sat me down, explained the situation, and went as far as scheduling me at the local dealership to fix the problem. Then when the dealership was having trouble, sent thier own tech to help address what was wrong.\n\nThe work done was excellent, their service above and beyond, and should I be asked to recommend a body shop for any reason.

I could not find 1 imperfection. They detailed  it AND I'm not sure what they did but the plastic  trim even looked refreshed.  Now I'm scared to drive it and it's parked with a cover on it.

Two supervisor called me to talk with me and was all nice but wanted me to give them a call and when something did come up no answer . They raised the price up and was about to put savage parts on from junk yards!!! Then broke my truck down of unnecessary parts , sent me 3 pic of my truck where the damage was and made a mistake and included pic of a Durango include with mine in the estimated online where they dropped the ball at so they could total my truck out. $7,500 their price after I was haggled on what should be fixed or not. The under part that I was told would be looked at by Geico in Macon under and told me that everything would be fixed and even sent a wrecker for it. When I saw this scam I sent for my truck to be taken to another shop of my choice in Trussville where I live at and the price dropped to $2500 . What\u2019s the use of having insurance for 8yrs without any incidents and was deem not my fought and still getting the run around but I guess it\u2019s just a moody thing then , I have a 1,500 rental car limit that I pay for in my and JY told me that it had to be back today mon 2-26-18 or they wasn\u2019t going to extended it til the next day when my truck will be ready I\u2019m the am, how about I called jay (sup) while I was at the shop because they needed to ask him something and he told me he was going to call them and did.

So - this place is honest (again, the panel did not need to be replaced and I'm sure the other locations said it did just to up the cost).  And, to top it off, since he had the paint, the owner/operator also touched up a door ding I had from someone else's door slamming into mine in a parking lot.

My experience at Precision Body & Paint: I had some minor work done to my truck unsuccessfully. Moreover, there was a 2% surcharge for paying with a CHECK, \"Only with cash will there be no additional fee,\" says Scott, the owner of Precision Body & Paint. I asked Scott, \"As a business owner, there is no merchant fee for a check, why do you impose one on your customers? His response: \"How am I suppose to know if your check will bounce or not? For the time it takes for me to chase you, the additional fee won't even cover it.\" Judging by Scott's tone, the owner of Precision Body & Paint does not trust his customers very much. Speaking of which: the work took nearly 3 weeks to \"complete,\" two weeks over Scott's trusted estimate. During that time, Scott did not fix the areas that I had requested. Instead, he would always cut me off mid conversation because he \"had a baseball game to run to.\" This happened three times throughout the three weeks that he had my truck. Regarding the work that Scott did not finish, he promised to refer me to someone else who could but never did. He had me order my own parts, failed to install those parts properly and even charged me extra for installing the parts that he failed to order. My truck has not driven properly since. Scott's business conduct was deficient, abrasive, unethical and condescending. Scott chose to speak down to his customer, fail to complete the work properly in a timely manner and charge an additional 2% fee for paying with a check because the customer did not have a wad of 3Gs in his wallet.

Let me start off by saying im unsure of my internal repairs. Diagnosis was great. He knew what it was... but when i got my car back and took it on a trip to florida I almost didnt make it back. 3 out of 8 of my coil packs where so lose they could have came off. They also did work on my chain guides and tensioners. 2300$ worth of work. The car jumped timing and had to be towed back.\n\nUpdate. They did honor their warranty and repaired the work that was done. They got it done quickly. The only guy that gave me a little issue was the front desk guy. But the owner stood by his word. And I respect that. Their are 2 reasons this is not 5 star. And one is the mechanic did not care enough to check what was throwing the new codes. P2004 and P2005. And what i mean by that was just eye balling it to see if it was anything obvious. But it was very simple. The wiring harness in the back was not clipped back into its holder and was blocking the control arms of the actuator from moving properly. Cleared codes and issue is fixed.\nThe 2nd thing is where my coils were in fact not replaced but the boots were replaced instead of the actual coil packs. It was way cheaper for me to just order all new preformance MSD coil packs (that come with new boots) . If anyone would like to buy my coil boots please hit me up. They are barely used and i have no need for rubber coil boots.\n\nOver all glad to have my Mustang GT back.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c271a9ac65253:0xcca215749ddbacb2"}

The amount they initially quoted me was very close to the final invoice. The car needed front end cosmetics, a new radiator, and the HVAC system needed to be repaired and recharged. I have no complaints as of yet. They seem to have done a great job and the front end looks brand new. They do use pre-owned parts from LKQ but I could care less about that and sometimes it's necessary and saves money on repairs. I also noticed that they washed and cleaned the interior and exterior of my car so that's an added bonus. It almost seems like I was getting into a brand new car when I picked it up!\n\nTIME: I initially took my car to another body shop the day the crash happened but they were booked up for 2 weeks. I asked them for a referral and they sent me to this place. Good decision since they had no wait time and started ordering parts the day they towed my car to their shop. Altogether it was about 1 1/2 weeks from start to finish. I'd rather they take their time and do it right than skip corners.\n\nPEOPLE: The people at this business are extremely nice and talk to you in a pleasant manner, not overbearing at all. They do not try to push anything on you or upsell anything you do not need, Very knowledgeable and professional staff who you can tell have been in the business for a long time.\n\nTLDR: I have had my car back for a few days now and have absolutely no problems as of yet.

I will say that I am completely understanding in knowing that my car did have a great amount of damage, but my frustration is the poor communication. I have spoken to Jeff on numerous occasions to ask for a status of my vehicle. For instance, I called Jeff on Monday asking about status. He stated he would call me today to let me know if the part that was needed came in and if my vehicle would be ready by Thursday (tomorrow). It is currently Wednesday at approximately 4:00pm, and I have not heard of any update as it relates to my vehicle (they close at 5:30). He often states \u201cI tried to reach out to you\u201d but he never leaves a voice message or anything, and I never seem to have a \u201cmissed call.\u201d This is the same type of NON verbal communication I have been getting since my car has been with Landers McLarty Chevrolet Collision Center. All I ask that if you say you are going to call me with an update, DO SO! They give you a call back day, and you won\u2019t hear from them until YOU reach out! A little more effective communication helps in my situation, as I have been without my vehicle for over 2 months! I would like to plan accordingly, as I do work EVERYDAY! Planning accordingly is effective if the communication is effective, which in this case, it is not. I am a very dissatisfied customer! I am now getting ready to call Jeff, AGAIN, because he has not reached out to me, as he stated he would.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626be3100e6051:0xd46f74ef2835c9e9"}

They did great on my minor fender bender with my 2014 Camaro SS so why not my other car, right? Oh boy was I wrong! Since I got my car back I haven't had AC for more than 48 hours total! They recharged it, then replaced a part that was replaced with the initial repair in July 2018 and now after having my car their 2x for rework, I still have no AC in my car! Why you ask? Well according to them it's not their fault all the refrigerant spewed out of the faulty part, which is bad for my AC compressor as it causes it to overheat! Instead it is my fault! Is it? Is it my fault you paid for aftermarket parts and not OEM or is it my fault for not assuming you would use OEM as that's what the car had prior to the accident? Could it be my fault because I brought you my car assuming you could handle it as I expected? I'll let all the people who read this decide!

There were several issues with my car that I did not know about till I called.\n\nThey ordered parts for my car without my permission and thought I was gonna pay for it. Think again! They refused to give a contact for the franchise owner.\n\nOnly after I threatened file a police report they called and told me to get my car. Half done, half out painted. Car looks far worse than when it went in.\n\nAshley the so-called manager was especially snotty. I asked for a specific paint they agreed then used oem as if I wouldn't notice.

Also the \"alignment\" they did was terrible, both front wheels were facing opposite directions and causing my trac sensors to read that I had no traction. (mind they did say couldn't get it \"perfect\" but for it to not even be able to drive it off the lot, that is unacceptable)\nI brought it back instantly and they said they could hear the rattling when I pulled up, again if they ACTUALLY TEST DROVE it they would have noticed. They took it back and put 1 dust cover on and didn't check the other because after I left the same sound came from the other side. The second alignment that they did was just one of there guys under the jeep doing an alignment, no machine, I did not see any kind of alignment system on my Jeep the whole time.\nWhen they finished the manager came over and said \"like I said before, our alignment system couldn't get it right.\" WHAT ALIGNMENT SYSTEM??? YOUR MACHANICS EYES?\nAfter all of that the only thing they worked with me on price was that they didn't charge me for the alignment. But $1200 worth of work and I am still having to take it somewhere else to get it aligned and to double check all there terrible work.\n\nI will never be going back and I will tell everyone to never go to B.Y.O.P Birmingham.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890de40f0002ab:0x8ab3366f666a5423"}

I went to get my breaks replaced. After getting them done I keep hearing a knocking sound. I took it back to the shop and the said they fixed it. After leaving that day I immediately began to hear the knocking sound again. This time I looked for the issue myself and notice the installers failed to put the pin that holds the caliper brackets to the rotors which was causing the entire caliber and braket to slide back and fourth. I took it back again and it seemed to be a pin in place. About a week later I started to hear a grinding noise so at this point I didnt trust the management or installers so I took it to another shop to have a brake inspection. They found were another pin was also missing and this was causing my breaks to slide. I was told before hand to not do business at byop by multiple people but I decide to go anyway. My recommendation to anyone else considering taking your car to this shop is it's not worth it. The price is possibly going to be cheaper but the installers are untrustworthy. If you interact with the owner and his wife they come across as God fearing wholesome grandparents that care about you but they really just want your money. I could have been seriously injured because of the this and after telling them about it they stood by the work of their installers. This is a side note, not all but a few of the installers definitely currently do drugs or did drugs which should tell you even more about how reputable this business is. SPEND A LITTLE MORE MONEY AND FEEL COMFORTABLE KNOWING THE WORK WAS DONE CORRECTLY!!!!

One of the bolts was cross threaded and the other was not put on tightly. The bed of the truck was hopping up and down. Finally a week later it has been cleared to drive and put back together. I would NOT recommend this shop to anyone.\n\nOur truck had some descent side damage. We had gotten an estimate done then filed it through insurance. We liked Madison collison the best out of the shops we had an estimate done with. Called and set our appt. The appt was set for about a week out. We dropped the truck off April 3rd right as they opened. The staff there is very friendly and we didnt assume we would have an issue. They ladies up front took our name, Key and said we will call you when its done. No explination on the process or anything. I called back later to ask how the door would be repaired and was told the finish date was expected to be april 16th and was told someone would call me back with how the door would be repaired. I never heard back. I didnt want to be that client so I just let it slide. I called on the 16th to get an update. They had not even started on our truck. The reasoning was they were behind. Had some high dollar repairs that were taking longer than expected... Ok but why keep our truck for 2 weeks if you werent even working on it?? We should have just gone and gotten our truck and took it elsewhere. They were very apologetic and came back with we will have it done Friday. I said theres no need to use all your man power to rush it. We arent difficult people I just wish you would have kept us informed. We picked it up Friday the 19th and they had forgotten to do the repair on the tailgate. So they kept the tailgate with the promise of calling me the following Tuesday with an update. They didnt call. I called them Wednesday because now the warning light for the gas cap had been on since Saturday (the day after we picked it up) and the check engine light was on. Set an appt for the following day. April 25th. Thank goodness they have a tv in the waiting room and let kids watch what they want. We were there for over 2 hours. The owner came out telling me they had to dig around under the bed and reconnect a sensor wire that controls the air in the tank. Which is why the gas cap light and check engine light came on. Would have been a simple hook up had they not been rushing the repair but they missed it. Fast forward to 6 days later the truck died on the side of the road while my husband was on his way to work. The fuel pump literally fell off!! 2+ hours of them digging around under the bed because they hurried through the repairs. Absolutely no mechanical problems from his truck and now several issues. I called to speak with the owner at 10:30 may 2nd and still have not heard back from him. I cant say that they do great repairs because we have already had issues. Visually the repairs look great. And the staff is very friendly but they dont have any communication skills and cant seem to call people back. Because of the issues weve had we wouldnt reccomend them to anyone and we will not be going back for any further issues. Thankfully they are on State Farms preffered list so the repairs are backed by them and any new issues that come up we can take the truck to another shop.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNO6ZbTB9fdilhQQUzxpU9VgRdiofNGuF3pi18f=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdf6-qQqoY-Eg6yUYaa6--dImkVG6agbHqLX8U=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862689f16085935:0x5fe8e8482aed2fd2"}

It was promised to be done in 1 to 2 additional days but was not done and the excuse was the weather. At this point the insurance company doesn't want to pay for a rental anymore because it has been a couple days longer than the estimate given. So now six days have gone by and my wife has been lied to about the progress by a lady that works there multiple times and she knows this because she has to drive by for work every day and can see that the bumper isn't put on yet. On the 7th or 8th day I'm not really sure which they call and say it's done. My wife goes to pick it up and noticed runs in the clear coat but in their defense they told her she could bring it back and they'll even pay for the rental car while they fix it. We won't be bringing it back to them even if they say it's free. They quoted one price the knocked some off because of the bad job and the time it was taking only to raise the price when she went to pick it up. Maybe if they were actually considerate they would have offered to pay for the additional 4 days on the rental we had to pay for because they couldn't paint a damn bumper in 3 days like the quote said. We will not be using them again. I guess they had the cheapest quote for a reason", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1568577799434, "text": "James, we apologize that the service took longer than we anticipated during this paint job -- unfortunately, the weather does affect our ability to perform our duties.
