The physical therapists didn't believe that he had broken ribs. I was told that the pain he was feeling was in his mind due to his brain injury. This was not true. The doctor who first examined him at Huntsville Hospital verified that he had broken ribs on both sides. HealthSouth was either ignorant or chose to ignore this fact until I chewed some ass and got him some pain medication. They even brought in a portable x-ray machine and still said he had no broken ribs. The physical therapists tried to move him around and were too aggressive for someone in that kind of pain.\n\nI don't know if they lie as a part of their aggressive approach, or if it was a mistake. It's hard to believe it was a mistake when it was in his medical record that his ribs were broken.\n\nMost of the staff is nice and helpful.

This made my experience much better since multiple surgeries have left me with limitations not always regarded by previous therapists.  It can be extremely painful trying to perform the necessary exercises to improve things that CAN be improved.

I couldn\u2019t lift over 5 pounds when I first began treatment at Results PT.  Madeline Arnall was understanding when I tried to explain my pain and limited mobility in laymen\u2019s terms.  She shared her plan for treatment and, along with Ms Lori, helped me regain flexibility and strength.  The two of them equipped me with information that applies to more than what initially brought me there; I learned more about my lifelong health and longevity during my appointments.  Physical therapy is challenging, and it was nice to have patient, understanding therapists to help me through the hard days.  We made plans to overcome setbacks and celebrated steps forward.  Looking back over the past few months, I would say that I am stronger now than before the car accident.  I showed up to my appointments and committed fully to their instructions and am glad to say that I am back to my busy, physically-demanding routine.\n\nThe rest of the staff was always respectful and professional.  Katie is fantastic at explaining all account information and it was fun to share a few laughs with her.

She advised me that my father was receiving inadequate care, that another employee was abusive to patients and that the facility was unsanitary.  ECOLI IS TRANSMITTED IN UNSANITARY ENVIRONMENTS.   The employee then attempted to leverage me for money.  It was classic:  \u201cI am going to look out for your father. He is not being treated well.  I need money..  Let me hold a few dollars.\u201d  The employee actually sent text messages asking for money.  The Director of the facility was advised of the employee\u2019s conduct.  When he was advised, he stated on a teleconference with almost ten witnesses that the employee attempted to leverage me because I was \u201csuccessful\u201d without accepting responsibility for the employee\u2019s conduct.  Unsanitary environment, telephones that don\u2019t work (even though you are charged for them),   etc.  Since the visitation restrictions were imposed 14 months ago, I am concerned that the quality of care has declined.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a0547539fd3:0xc023ecbcce265e8f"}

The response was \"we don't do miracles.\" Mom had TWO UTIs while there. The second time we came close to the room on Sunday to a foul smell.  I checked to see if she was wet. She was wet and the pad beneath her was wet as well. They sent a culture of urine to be tested on Monday; the result was that she had a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI). By Wednesday they were awaiting prescription orders for her treatment.  My mother in law was transferred from there to another facility the next Tuesday. The UTI was still not treated. The facility where we had her transferred handled the UTI immediately. Dementia gets worse when there is an infection or UTI. She's Diabetic: they told me that they don't have a diabetic diet there to give patients. Well, I asked them not to give her sugar, caffeine, and pork. Her sugar was as high as 300+. When she was home, 118 was the highest unless she cheated then 220. She never took insulin shots; she got them there because they sent it up high with the bad diet, then gave insulin to bring it back down. Diabetic patients are groggy or sleepy when their glucose is up. According to them, she doesn't respond to commands. DUH if her glucose is high and she has a UTI, what the heck do they expect?

I had back surgery in 2009 (L5-S1 discectomy) and was strongly discouraged from running by a PT I saw after my surgery.  I had been feeling pretty good getting back into it, but was worried about possible injury both to my back and knees.  Andrew's running assessment and subsequent muscle strength assessment were extremely helpful.  He gave me a couple of things to change while running to help prevent injury and a list of stretches to strengthen my leg and core muscles.  A few weeks ago I ran my very first half marathon.  A few weeks before that, I had tweaked my back doing something stupid and was afraid I was going to have to give up running the half.  I emailed Andrew who encouraged me that all was not lost.  With his expert advice, I not only ran the whole way, but ran faster than I was expecting!  I have since run a 10K and have 2 more half marathons and a 10-miler on the horizon.\n\nSeriously, make an appointment with Andrew!  For anything!  Not just if you're a runner or athlete.  He can help with normal (and not so normal) life pains, post-surgery issues, etc.  Not only is he knowledgeable about how the body works, but he also takes the time to explain the whats and whys and hows.  My only complaint is that he lives in Alabama while I'm in Colorado and therefore I can't very easily make appointments with him!

He created a personalized exercise program to strengthen those areas during the time that my shin was healing. I love how he just doesn't focus on the injury and then send you on your way. He has done so much for me and is always available when you have questions. I am already feeling like a much stronger runner than I ever was before, thanks to him. He is the best physical therapist and I would recommend him in a heartbeat!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1450712681673, "text": "Thanks for the review Amy!"}, "gmap_id": "0x88626c960d0fc7c7:0xf623e5fd94268f63"}

It is not like any pt I have been to in the past. Most of the work you do at home, so there are not a lot of appointments. I've been doing my exercises regularly and my pain has receded and I'm back to running. Andrew not only correctly diagnosed the problem, he takes the time to explain exactly what is going on. I've worked on my running form and with my exercises, I'm a better, faster, more efficient runner than before I got injured.

His approach is very individualized and specific with lots of feedback over email, fb messenger and texting.  I struggled for years with an ongoing hip issue and it got to a point were it interfered not just with sports, but also with my work and daily living. I followed his blogs on social media and finally contacted him in December of 2017.  I am so glad I did!  He responded almost immediately and as soon as I had a referral I was good to go. He assessed my strength and abilities and identified multiple problems.  He methodically works on one issue at the time and helps me build my hip strengths up.  Instead of going 3 days a week for several weeks (which is really hard to do if you are working), I was set up over a longer period of time (once a week, then twice a month, then 4 weeks/6 weeks later).  The phone exercise app he provides, allows me to track the exercises I have to do.  He is very encouraging especially at times when I think I'm not making any progress and teaches you self release methods to relieve pain.  I am now into my 4th month of therapy  (6th visit) and I'm running again!  My hip feels stronger and I'm looking forward to many more miles on trails and roads in the future.  Andrews approach does take self motivation because you have to do the work on your own rather than at office setting for an hour 3 days a week.  But being pain free is a great motivator.  So if doctors visits haven't worked out for you, I would highly recommend you contact Andrew.

I had bought my Trifecta Pass just a few weeks prior after assuring myself that I would recover in time to race.  After weeks of ineffective self care I went to my family doctor. After an X-ray and no real good advice they referred me to an orthopedic doctor. He confirmed I didn\u2019t have anything major and gave me the same useless advice and a prescription ointment that didn\u2019t do much. By this time it was all I could do to walk around the house. I was heartbroken to think that I wouldn\u2019t be able to race. Thankfully I found Andrew through his insightful Facebook posts and gave him a call last January. His wholistic and long term vision for getting better and staying better was exactly what I was looking for. The running analysis he provided revealed so many things that could have stalled my fitness goals indefinitely had they been left unaddressed.  I travel a lot for work as well, so his \u201cwork on your own\u201d method for physical therapy exercises rather than multiple visits per week was a perfect way for me to augment my existing exercise routine without disrupting my work schedule. By March I was able to finish the Atlanta Sprint race - still walking more than I wanted but at least I was on the course and it only took about 30 minutes more than usual.  After about 5 or 6 visits I had made good progress and was on my way to pain free running. By July I was able to run the Asheville Super and only had to pace myself a bit on the downhill portion towards the end of the race.  In August I started having shin splints.  I reached out to Andrew via Facebook Messenger and within an hour had a new set of exercises that took care of the problem in a few weeks.  No \u201cmake an appointment with the receptionist\u201d or other nonsense like that.  The last time I had shin splints they lingered for months and the only advice I got from my doctor was to take a few Advil every day and stop exercising - not an option for me. Now in November I was able to run the Carolina Beast without any pain.  Achieving this goal would not have happened without Andrew\u2019s help and seemed impossible when I was limping out of the store with a knee brace last December.\nAt first I was worried about not being able to have insurance cover my therapy. In retrospect, the investment I made with PhysioWorks is going to save me so much money in the long run.  Andrew\u2019s approach was exactly what this Spartan needed to finally join the Trifecta Tribe.  If you\u2019re an Obstacle Course Racer and have any pain that\u2019s keeping you off the course, I highly recommend you give PhysioWorks a try. Andrew works with a local Crossfit business as well, so he can help with more than just running.\nThanks Andrew!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1509839627753, "text": "Thanks Tag!

My daughter was the first of us to use Dr. Mann.  She came in for really bad neck pain and headaches.  Dr. Mann said it was related to what is now being called 'text neck.' In two weeks of treatment she was completely better! Not only that it's been months now and she feels great- and still playing on that phone! The second patient was my son.  We were told he needed tubes in his ears because he had chronic ear infections for months.  It broke my heart thinking about that so I was chatting with Dr. Mann on one of my daughters visits and he told Chiropractic can be successful in treating that without tubes. So we gave it a try (child adjustments are different and very gentle if you didn't know) and low and behold after months of ear infections they were COMPLETELY gone.  We were thrilled- not to mention we saved hundreds avoiding surgery.  The next patient was me!  I do pure Barre and I was having trouble with my low back and knee.  It turns out that I had mobility issues.  Couple weeks of work and my workout is now a breeze. And finally my husband.  He's had back issues before but not quite like this recent one.

It looks like it's been said her a 100 times but I wanted to say why my treatments here allow me to say how much I mean that and miss being in Alabama!  I spend most of the year in Atlanta now because of work.  I have tried and tried to find a chiropractor here that was as good as Dr. Mann but I haven't been successful.  I called Dr. Mann before one of my appointments in Atlanta and asked if he would mind talking to my chiropractor (bless him for doing that) Even after an in depth conversation about the type of treatments I was receiving with Dr. Mann in Decatur I still wasn't getting the same level of relief from my Atlanta chiropractor that I was receiving at Advanced Chiropractic.  My neck is just not the same when I go to other places.  I only get to be adjusted a few times a year by Dr. Mann now because of the move and it's one of the worst things about not being home.  But every time  I am in town seeing Dr. Mann is on the list!  Another thing I always appreciated about Dr. Mann's office is there is always a plan.  He doesn't just say 'see ya' at the end of your appointment.  If I am working on an injury I always know when I need to be seen again.  If I am on wellness I know I need to be back monthly.  Other places I have been don't give any direction and it just seems less professional.  Be thankful for what you have here!!! He's the best!

At the end I did have a few question but Dr. Mann stayed with me to answer my questions.  Nothing beats being able to sleep, wake up, go through a demanding day, and still feel great every day.  I will most definitely keep using Dr. Mann and his clinic on a regular basis.\n\nUpdate 12/23/19-  It has been months since I have had even the slightest pain! I am back to exercising 3 days a week and doing pretty much anything I want, pain free.  I honestly have had days that I forgot that I was ever in pain all the time.  My son's basketball season started up which means lots of driving and uncomfortable locations I must linger in for hours, multiple nights a week.  With the instructions Dr. Mann gave me my back has held up and I have not missed a second of a single game.  They were able to work me in this morning for an adjustment before I hit the road for the holidays.  Dr. Mann even came out to my car to help me setup me seat cushion to keep my back from acting up on the long drive we have to my wife's family gathering in North Carolina.  I cannot say enough about how happy I am that I found Dr. Mann's office.   Until next time! Thanks again you guys! Have a Merry Christmas!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1565897476593, "text": "Thank you for leaving the review!  We are so glad you have had such great results!

Attempted to realign a part of my body that didn't need it and when he was done after 6 minutes in the room with me he managed to not fix the issue at all now I'm out over $100.00 and absolutely  no relief for a simple pinched nerve, oh but he did set me up on the \"maintenance plan\" which is 3 visits a week at $65 per visit that's $780 a month! That's more then my mortgage for what every single other chiropractor has been able to fix and treat in one visit for under $50.00. Please be wise and heed this as a warning.

Health expenses without insurance can be tough, but that is no excuse for your dishonesty in your review. Cameras show your time in the office was approximately 40 minutes; less than 5 minutes in the waiting room- standard for any first visit. Furthermore, we offer the lowest cash prices for new patients in town and also very flexible payment plans.  You were told the prices before you came in. Our cameras even show you were in high spirits until it was time to pay your bill.  And instead of talking to us and working out a payment plan we watched you go into your car and leave this angry review.  Also, what you tried to tell us was \u2018wrong\u2019 with you was actually incorrect and probably the main reason you\u2019ve had to deal with your back pain for years instead of actullay being \u2018fixed.\u2019 While we have great respect for you and your field, you have to remember- you are not a doctor-  for instance a chiropractor in a car accident should heed the EMT\u2019s instructions because that is what they have been trained to do.  You are also confusing your terminology- maintenance is for wellness patients- and is an optional once a month visit for those who have complete their \u2018rehab\u2019 plan to help stay ahead of injuries and reduce wear and tear on the body. Rehab plans are what you were trying to quote. Certain injuries take time to heal and a proper plan for recovery. You are absolutely right Kris- We do things different at Advanced Chiropractic.  We get so many patients who have seen chiropractors that take shortcuts to treat their injuries and the patient continues to deal with pain for years.  Our goal at Advanced Chiropractic is to HEAL the injury. We have found that if we simply make pain go away we are no different than a pain killer or opiate.  However, with our custom made rehabilitation plans you can escape that continued damage, year after year, which is so important as many parts of the body don\u2019t grow back when you repeatedly injure them."}, "gmap_id": "0x886284764f6fef61:0x2058cd07a41eab07"}

Went to a specialist and after several weeks still no significant results. Went to a holistic doctor- still nothing. I had been diagnosed with everything from migraines to fibromyalgia. A friend of mine told me to try her Chiropractor because she had great results for her low back. They take insurance (I didn\u2019t know that at the time) so that was helpful. My first visit I Came in and the front desk was very helpful. I soon met Dr. Mann and after listening to my history he took some x-rays. He examined them and decided it was safe to begin treatment. Said what I actually had was a cervicogenic headache and that he was confident we could reduce the number of headaches I was having.  Within the week my headaches were almost totally gone. After two weeks of no headaches I am now down to just monthly visits to make sure they don\u2019t come back. My only regret is that I didn\u2019t go sooner.

I never imagined the experience would become so personal.  At my first visit, I met with Robby to discuss all my issues.  He has a genuine nature, a respect for where you are in the process, and a drive to see you return to wellness.  He took the time to evaluate me and was methodical in his design of a plan that worked not only in the clinic but could be transitioned to home. He championed me through tough times with kindness, professionalism, and a warmth that led to a trust which is necessary for the recovery process to be successful.  He is a credit to his profession and an asset to TherapySouth.\nThroughout the following weeks, I worked with Abbey.  Abbey is truly a pioneer in her field.  She is focused and attentive during every session, kind, compassionate, knowledgeable, and helpful.  When I was doubtful, she was always there to encourage me, being honest with me about the challenges I would face, yet reassuring me that I would one day be able to return to a life filled with many athletic endeavors.  Abbey is understanding and genuinely takes a personal interest in how you're feeling.  She always made sure to explain every exercise in depth and also how it would aid in my progress going forward.  I feel lucky to have been guided by Abbey along my PT journey, for it was her encouragement that pushed me through when I was at my lowest.\nHannah is also extremely helpful and efficient.  Being the face you see when you first walk in, she is cheerful and always greets the patients by name.  TherapySouth has an amazing team and, more importantly, great teamwork.  It is modern and very nice, clean, and an extremely well-run practice.  I couldn't be happier with my experience with something I wasn't at all looking forward to.\nThank you to the TherapySouth team for always answering my questions with interest and patience.  You guys have truly made my recovery a more pleasant experience.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1533157199314, "text": "Thank you so much for your kind words Ashley!

We have no idea since we don't know the name of the neurologist he was referring my husband to, so cannot call that office for confirmation.  I don't feel I should have to call Dr. Wilson's staff to make sure the referral was even made.

I found Jason when I was around 35 because I was working a job that required alot of lifting and carrying of a 28 foot extention ladder over long distances about 15 times a day. I had gotten to the point that it caused me such pain to even bend over to tie my shoes that I couldn't take it.\n\nI found Dr Hart at Sturbridge on Taylor Rd. I saw him therethere for a few years and I followed him after he left to start his own practice because he was the most skilled Chiropractor I had ever been to see, but also because of his regard for people and how he saw the way their wallets and insurance plans were treated. What I mean there without going into a full out explanation is, Dr Jason Hart is one of those doctors you rarely find, he cares much more about you and your well being than he does about your wallet.\n\nI'm 45 now and had it not been for Jason and the lengths he goes to for his patients/friends, to learn his craft inside and out like no other.....well I would still be suffering day to day with a great deal of pain.

Just make the drive to Birmingham or Nashville where you can find experienced doctors who actually want to help you. I saw Dr. Cho here twice, he's also the new guy they have to write his name in on the appointment cards. The first time I saw him was to evaluate my neck pain and get a diagnosis, then a treatment plan. On the first day they send you to physical therapy, this is just a given with any surgeon exhausting the possibility of anything working before surgery. Then you will also be set up with a pain doctor in their office, which will take you a week to see the first time then a month or two the next time. I expressed that I had no interest in being on pain medication and taking shots to come to find out was not the answer, nor the prescribed treatment for my condition, the only used option was surgery which he will not do because i'm not the most perfect patient for surgery. The condition i have is forminal spinal stenosis and it is advanced to the point over the years that it, as it almost always does, has exacerbated old injuries to my lower back and put me in a ton of pain. Dr. Cho doesn't care if you have a loss of feeling in you limbs, or you are in sever pain, I mean he doesn't even go over your MRI with you in the office, he puts it in his very formal text book response he creates and sends to your pain doctor. If you do any shots don't expect him to evaluate the area because he won't, nor will he do any physical examination to further understand your condition. The most he will do is set there and tell you what he thinks without discussing anything with you and you are supposed to live with it. I had a second and third opinion after my first initial visit, and both out of respect for their profession asked that i return for the second visit with Dr. Cho before I came back to them, because they were sure that he would do the surgery at least on my neck, so I could heal and work on becoming this perfect patient so he could or they could fix my lower back. The second opinion I had wasn't by my choice, it came when I was hospitalized for loss of my bladder and bowl control at my primary physicians office which is concerning especially when I also was having a hard time walking or standing. The third opinion I had locally just to confirm his and the ER surgeons diagnosis. So when i went back i again expressed my extreme disinterest in being drugged up or shot up every week, because two opinions and multiple medical studies i had read by this time all say the same thing. The only thing that fixes my problem with (in any patient) a near 100% rate of success is surgery. You can imagine my surprise when he went totally in the opposite direction. In short i'm scheduled for my surgery next week in Birmingham after seeing one of the surgeons at the neurosurgery center there, who actually had some reservations as to doing it early but consulted with another physician in the room with me (nice to not be left in the dark) and told me the recovery may take a week or two longer but they can fix the issue. Again, In Short save yourself the time of seeing someone who only cares about the money and how long they can keep you taking shot's, pills, and collecting from you and your insurance company. Not to mention i couldn't be released to my job until i was fully medically cleared, and taking pills and shots doesn't get you cleared for normal duty at your job. I've learned to go with my instincts lately with doctors, some you can tell first off if they are genuinely interested in helping you or are just there to collect as much money as possible. (this was my first instinct with Cho, yet i ignored it) and the rest is history, just hope others heed my advice on this guy.

I was rear ended Sept 18th 2015, Dr Tao, found out where the source of my pain was coming from and fixed it ONE BY ONE. First, I had a C 6-7 herniation, I had cervical surgery on that level Dec 1st 2015, didn't have to go to therapy or wear a neck brace. He used Glue to close my incision, no stitches, gauze or bleeding afterwards. Totally took away all of my neck issues.\n\nI lived in pain with sciatic and back pain in the si joint region for 8 months. He could have done back surgery and it would've failed, because, it wasn't in the upper spine, but in the si joint above my tailbone. He explained this to me, sent me for injections in the si joint, the injections relieved the pain for awhile. By doing this, he knew, this was the area that was damaged.\n\nI had been reading about the Triangular implants designed specifically to stabilize and fuse the heavily loaded SI joint.  which is called I FUSE. We discussed this procedure, and June 21st 2016 I had it done. It's now 7/7/2016 and I have no pain in my back or tailbone area or legs. The day of surgery, I was laying there before my surgery and thought I would cry from the back pain, when I woke up it was gone.\n\nI was on crutches less than 14 days after the surgery, It's fusing, and I am so glad I found Dr Tao and the Neuro Center in Huntsville Alabama. I would trust this group of Doctors, especially Dr Tao with my life. If you've had failed back surgeries, in pain, please go see him today. I'm glad I did. I am totally drug free! Didn't take any pain Killers after my surgery. Some bruising pain will happen for about 3 days, nothing like the pain I had before my surgery.\nDon't be afraid of the I-fuse surgery, at the moment I am walking around on both feet and can't even tell I had surgery June 21st 2015", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1468244078054, "text": "Thank you for trusting us with your care.

Being an active person who likes to hike and lives on a farm, I immediately went to the doctor and was referred for physical therapy. It didn't help at all. Over the last five years, I have tried different doctors who have referred me to different physical therapists, with no change in pain level.\nAt my last doctor's appointment, my primary doctor asked if anything was bothering me and I told him I still had plantar fasciitis. We talked through my experience and he suggested I try a different podiatrist, Dr. Stark. Dr. Stark immediately referred me to Therapy South and asked that I see Robert Harris. I went to the appointment not expecting any different outcome but I am so glad I went! Robert was encouraging, saying he had a plan and he felt confident he could help me. We started with therapy three times a week, addressing first the plantar problem but then working backward to involve the parts of the leg and hip that caused the injury in the first place. Robert gave me four exercises to do twice daily at home and I logged exercise sessions through an easy to use app. Each appointment has been a teaching experience. Robert asks how I'm doing, I tell him how I'm progressing or having problems and he immediately explains and teaches me a stretch or exercise that will help. Robert's goal is to teach me strategies to address problems independently in the future. Each week finds me feeling better, my plantar fasciitis pain now almost completely gone. I am truly thankful to Therapy South!\nI recommend Therapy South and Robert Harris for anyone needing physical therapy.

The injury happened around 1 year before I became their patient.  During that year, I had no luck controlling the pain with pharmacological therapy, cervical steroid epidurals or a previous round of physical therapy. I found myself in bed and in tears almost daily due to the pain the pain I felt. It affected my schoolwork, my social life, and my ability to do general everyday activities like driving etc.\n\nI was very apprehensive about physical therapy when it was prescribed to me for a second time. The first time around (at a different facility in the Auburn area) physical therapy left me feeling defeated and in more pain than ever. However, after my very FIRST visit with Robert, I knew that TherapySouth was the place to be. He took his time to get every detail about my pain level, mobility, daily activities and most importantly, my end goals for therapy.\n\nHe created a workout and therapy plan tailored to my specific needs and abilities.  After every session I felt increasingly better. Nine months later, I am able to do most activities that I want/need/love to do without ANY pain and I have gained muscle strength and flexibility that I so desperately needed.\n\nI really don't know what I would have done without the physical therapists Robert and Emily, their interns, and the wonderful staff at TherapySouth-Auburn. They are all amazing, caring and thoughtful individuals and their skills and knowledge are exemplar.

A year and a half ago, I could no longer live with my shoulder pain, both sides due to torn rotator cuffs.  My orthopedist said surgery was likely the only way to successfully heal.  I did not want that and asked for a PT referral.  I began therapy at TherapySouth in January 2018 and was surprised at how thorough and caring the folks were.  I was asked detailed questions throughout my initial evaluation and follow-up questions during each exercise.  Robert and Dreher would adjust exercises according to my limits and evaluate my ongoing recovery at each session.  By April, I had almost full motion in my arms/shoulders, pain was gone, and I even could reach around back to scratch my shoulder blades!  All without any NSAIDS or other drugs.\n\nSo when I began having elbow pain this year, I asked my doctor for a referral to TherapySouth.  Once again a thorough evaluation of my pain and its source was done by Robert.  By the second session I was already experiencing significant relief from pain that was serious enough to keep me awake at night.  And no drugs!  During my last session, I menbtioned that I also suffered from occipital neuralgia.  Robert did not seem surprised and showed me how complex the relationship with all the tendons, muscles, etc in the back and neck can end up causing pain and trigger points.  Here I am two days later with reduced pain throughout my neck, back, shoulders.\n\nIf you are injured, TherapySouth is the place to go for Physical Therapy.  I've literally been to dozens of therapists over a lifetime.  No one comes close to these folks.  If I could give them 10 stars instead of 5 I would do that.  I'm lucky to have found them and grateful for all they have done for me.

Both were done by the same surgeon. My first surgery was in November of 2015. I did physical therapy at another Hoover clinic (not a therapy south) and I grew to hate physical therapy, physical therapists, anything associated with them. I honestly believed the profession was a crock because of the poor care I had received at that clinic. I didn\u2019t know any better! My hip never got better, it was much weaker than before, and three years later, is still in pain and lacking the function I had prior. My skepticism towards physical therapy as it turns out, was just because I went to the wrong place. After a shoulder surgery in May of 2016, I was referred to Chris and Corey from a friend and my outlook could not be more different now. Not only did they cater my shoulder rehab to my specific sport (weightlifting), they also helped me repair my hip and alleviate some of my pain. I\u2019m a true believer in physical therapy now, even going as far as changing my career path so I can also change someone\u2019s outlook.

The staff are wonderful and extremely caring and knowledgeable. The facility is very clean and open, it does not feel as though you are \"packed in\" and overly crowded like most places. I have been to a few other therapy centers over the fast few years, and they are by far the best. I chose this location because I heard about a treatment called, dry needling. I have 2 herniated discs in my cervical spine and I have tried everything to relieve the pain from massage therapy to multiple steroid injections, a nerve ablation and even CBD oil with no relief. I am currently scheduled for my 2nd cervical fusion surgery in a few days, and prior to dry needling and this round of physical therapy, the pain in my neck and shoulder was at an 8 out of ten on the pain scale. I chose dry needling because as anyone with cervical spine issues knows, the knots in your upper back and shoulders are ridiculously painful. Today is my last day of physical therapy, in just 9 sessions of therapy and 4 dry needling sessions with Haley, my pain level went from an 8 to a 2, which is amazing. I would highly recommend Dreyer Physical Therapy to anyone seeking relief from pain.
