In closing, it took 19 days to do two hours worth of work.  I was never notified nor updated.  When I picked up my lawnmower the only greeting I was met with was your total was $284.80.

After two weeks with no call, I called them and of course, Carla was not in and no one else knew anything about it but they promised to have her call me as soon as she got back.  NOTHING.  I called again about a week later.  Carla said the fan was broken and she would find one and let me know the cost because a brand new one would be expensive.  I said that a new one was fine because I wanted my weedeater fixed and back.  I was willing to pay for it.  Another week ... 10 days ... I've lost track of time through all of this.  The bottom line is this ... Carla NEVER calls you, even though she promises she will.  No one else, especially Barry, knows ANYTHING about your item.  You can call all day, but if they don't answer, TOO BAD, because they don't have their voicemail set up.  At one point when I called, Carla offered to sell me a refurbished weedeater since she \"couldn't find\" a fan, though I doubt she even looked for one.  I said no, I want mine back. I finally just went and picked up my weedeater today (6-4-2020), NOT FIXED and when they brought it out, pieces were missing!  The guy had to go back to the back not once, but TWICE to find them, even after he argued with me about whether or not they existed in the first place.  Then, as I was leaving, he said \"Sorry we didn't get it fixed but it just isn't worth it\".  Uhhhhmmm, it's worth it to ME and since I would have been the one paying for it, THAT is all that should matter.

We bought a pressure washer in January of this year and it started smoking while running it so we were not sure what the problem was. We called Ryobi warranty and they had us send the pressure washer to this company. Quality Tool Repair told us to drop it off on that Friday and that they would get someone to look at it and let us know something by Monday. (Our guy that dropped it off said the men he dropped it off with looked high or drunk on something, which is already terrible for business first off) , to make matters worse...No one followed up with us, we even waited until Wenesday to see if someone would contact us. No one did. So we called that Wednesday afternoon and I spoke with Carla. She told us no one had even looked at it still. Even after the fact that we were told She would get someone to look at it and follow up with us on Monday. So then she stated she would get someone to look at it and then call me back. It wasn't even 30 minutes and she called back stating that they had gotten the pressure washer fixed and that they cleaned the air filter and it was no longer smoking. Which was clearly a false statement! We had our guys go pick up the pressure washer and paid a $45.00 service fee for something that was not even touched! (after we were told by Carla that she would refund the fee if it was still not working) We recieved the pressure washer and brought back here to our shop. The guys automatically tested it and it was as if no one had serviced or even touched anything. It was still smoking. We called Ryobi warranty once again and they had us sent to Home Depot to get it serviced and see if they could fix it. So we dropped off the pressure washer for a even smaller service fee of $18.50. Which was way less than the price we paid at Quality Tool Repair. Home Depot even followed back up with us when our pressure washer was fixed. We never had to call and find out was was taking so long. We received it and tested it here at the shop and it was perfect. We had mentioned to Home Depot that we had taken the pressure washer to Qulaity Tools first. He even was in shock when he seen the air filter and everything untouched. Still had gas and oil in it. He said he had heard bad things about the company many times. Home Depot fixed our pressure washer as to where Qulaity Tools did nothing. Not very good for business at all. I even called and spoke with Carla today (5/10/2019) regarding the refund we were told we would get if it still did not work correctly. And she got very angry, talking over me on the phone, I couldn't even get one sentence out barley. I even told her that we took it to Home Depot and they said it had not even been touched. And she said she will not give us a refund and she does not care what happened or what I read on their reviews. Very very rude. She didnt even want to try to help the situatuion and what we had been through. Very unfair to have another company bring you a tool to fix and you end up doing them wrong in the end. We deal with alot of contractors and different workers that rely on their tools everyday and I will be sure to let everyone I know to NEVER visit this company. I will be sure to send them to Home Depot, a real company that has dignity and pride in their customers. Qulaity Tool Repair is quick to fib and very disorganized. You have lost what could have been years to come with tons of business from us. If you a reading this review do not take your tools here. Even if your tool warranty company sends you here like us....REFUSE and go somehwere else. You will be very disappointed in the end if you do deside to take your tools here.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88892e05ff600225:0x3f9c17c63e2b05cb"}

The only reason I went there was because Ryobi lists it as an authorized warranty repair center for my pressure washer.  It failed to start, and I checked the obvious, so I decided to have it repaired under warranty.   I dropped it off and they said they would call me in about a week.  Two weeks later, I had heard nothing so I called.  The phone went to voice mail and said the mailbox was full and hung up on me.  After the call attempts like this, someone did call me back seeing my calls on callerid.\n\nThe lady that called back said it was a bad carburetor and that it is not covered under warranty, so it would cost me $55.  I said to fix it and asked when it would be ready.  She said next week and she would call me.  A week went by with no calls.  I called and again got the \"mailbox full\" message, so I drove to the shop.\n\nWhen I got there, at first they could not find my paperwork or the pressure washer.  As they were in the back looking for it, I heard them day \"bad carb\" and then \"uh-oh\".  The manager came out with my machine and said, \"you got a bad carburetor, but you got more problems.\"  He then demonstrated by trying to pull the starter chord, but the engine was locked-up.  It was not when I dropped it off!\n\nThe manager said I had probably run it out of oil.  He cheeked, and it was correctly filed with nice golden oil which I had changed earlier in the year.  I asked how could they know it was a bad carb if they couldn't even start it? The lady at the counter said she'd go ahead and call Ryobi and start the warranty claim.  She said she'd call me next week with status.\n\nA week and a half goes by with no call.  I call them, and this time the number wad out of order.  I drive back to the shop and they tell me the secretary had been out for a week do they had not had time to file a claim.  And the manager again reiterated that it was probably my misuse that caused it to lock up and that Ryobi would likely not warranty it anyhow.  I'm actually a hobbyist mechanic and have rebuilt car and lawn tool engines, so I'm no idiot.\n\nAfter 5 weeks of no service and deplorable customer service, I took my pressure washer with me and have since dropped it at another service center.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88892e05ff600225:0x3f9c17c63e2b05cb"}

I purchased the items and was told to let him know when I could bring it back to have the seat put on. He told me he would need a week to get it mounted. i was helping a friend in the area and carried it by early Monday morning and that's when this guys true colors started showing. I passed by there about three or four times (didn't stop) between Monday and Thurs just to see if it was being worked on but it NEVER MOVED!!! I called on Fri morning and told them I needed to come get my mower (meaning I needed to cut my 3 + acres of grass and bring it back on Monday but I did not say that) and the lady I spoke with said she would let him know. I get a call back in about 10 mins and the same lady informs me that he (the owner) said that if I came and got MY mower he would never put that seat on for me. Well after going around and around with husqvarna Corp. They got me set up with a real dealer that knows how to treat people ..i have to drive farther but I don't have to put up with this clown. To tell you what kind of character you will be dealing with, when I started dealing with the other company, they inform me there isn't a suspension seat for my Z554 in the entire husqvarna corporation because it is a brand new model. I wonder how this guy had one? It's a MIRACLE!!!! Also, on Friday when I picked my mower up the fuel gauge on the left hand tank was showing empty, tank was full but not showing it.

I purchased a Hammerhead 250ss go cart second hand and when I purchased it, it would turn over but not start. The owner said the he let the go cart sit up for a year, but it did run but was pretty sure the carburetor needed cleaning. I took it to Basch Brothers in Cullman, because this is where the cart was originally purchased. I told them that I wanted to get the carburetor cleaned  and to look over the go cart for anything else it needed. They called me the next day and said it had no compression. I told them that's odd because when I purchased the cart, I checked the compression and it was at 90lbs. They said I don't know what to tell you but we are only get 60lbs. AT this point I understood they didn't want to work on it and I picked it up and took it to Dr. Joe's in Ensley. They found the carburetor was gumed up and the vacuum line. They return the go cart to me  the next day completely fixed.

I asked that he put the good motor on the good bike. We had a gentleman's agreement that I would pay more than a thousand dollars, and that would include two new tires. After looking closer at the tires I had I found that I had two good tires between the two bikes. I tried calling to check on the progress on my bike, but wasn't able to speak with anyone. Phill, the owner tells me, when I went in to check on my bike, that they got trash in my carbs. He had the carbs off my bike and was supposedly cleaning them. When he called me and told me my bike was ready I picked it up and only two cylinders was firing, the clutch was slipping, and the carbs were pouring gas. I took it back  the same day under the 30 day warranty to have it properly fixed. When he called me that my bike was ready and I went to pick it up he tries to charge me another $350.00. I called the police out to try and get my bike, but they said they couldn't get invovled and I would have to pay the money or get an attorney. I didn't trust him to leave my bike any longer, so paid the money to get my bike. My bike is sitting in my yard with the carbs still flooding out. After more than $1,400 dollars spent and I still can't drive my bike. If you value your property, do not take it to Prattville power sports. I'm getting an attorney and going to court.\n\nToday June 4, 2019, I had the pleasure of meeting the new owners of Prattville power sports. I had bought a new battery from phill when he done the work on my bike. Today I found out that the battery he put in my bike wasn't the same battery he said he put in. That it was a cheaper version, but he charges me for the more expensive battery. The new owner pulled out the old bills and showed me the difference and then gave me the battery that I was suppose to have from the beginning. I now believe and tmhave complete trust in the new owners and plan to do my business with them now that I know phill is gone.

A week and a couple follow-up calls later, they still don't know what is wrong with my mower.  A couple days later, I'm told it's the auto choke in the carb although there is a choke on the handle.  A few days later, they are still waiting on the Honda parts rep to call them back.  Next day, I'm promised an estimate; I hear nothing.  I call the next business day (Monday) when I'm told i will have an estimate by the end of the day, but I told them if I didn't hear back that afternoon (2+ weeks later), I was picking my mower and not paying the diagnostic fee.  Do you think I got a call?  Nope.  At least they're consistent. I picked up the broken mower the next day without paying.  I would avoid this place, for service, like the plague.\n\nAlso of note, they do not use computers to document your equipment's problem, part number, or your contact info; they use a small notebook.

Prior to this I physically visited SunSouth to purchase a mower but was told that I would need to go to a place like Lowes or Home Depot. I used my mower 3 times and noticed that the engine was leaking oil. On 29 Sep (when I noticed the leak), I called Lowes since I also purchased an extended warranty. They said that they would have someone come out to pick it up and that they would call the day before they were supposed to pick it up (scheduled for today 4 Oct) and give me a time. They were also supposed to call the day of pick up to let me know they were on the way.\n\nStill haven't received a phone call and it it currently 4:21 pm. They close at 5 pm. My wife called Lowes back today at about 3:40 pm and they said they would contact them again and if we didn't hear from them that Lowes would call someone else.\n\nNeedless to say, I am NOT happy at all.
