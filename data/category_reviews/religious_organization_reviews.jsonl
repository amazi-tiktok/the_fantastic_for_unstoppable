I did hear about the 5 year old that body was dumped in a driveway of a home, not knowing this location was where the van was picked up from(News stated Hill crest locations) However I enrolled my kids at this center which is inside the church in December. I must say it's a clean center, But the worker are not friendly(for it to be a CHURCH)my 1st problem was my Infant that's now 10 months. from day 1 of him being there when I picked him up after work he was dressed in a change of clothes I sent(didn't think much of it cause I understand kids have accidents) his 2nd day when I picked him up change of clothes again, 3rd day change of clothes, so I kept him home the next day to see what was going on why was his clothes getting messed up? The day I kept him home he did mess up his clothes(because he used it and it stayed on him to long so it started coming out of his diaper)So I knew then that he was not being taking care of while at the center. I addressed it to the director the next morning she was nice about and tried to explain that if the kids get FOOD on them she have them to change their clothes, Okay No problem. But it was not FOOD on my son clothes it was always #2 and I told her that so she said she would monitor it. I go pick my kids up after work go in the baby room to get him he have on the same clothes I sent him in, BUT! the workers are very upset I knew that the director had said something to them because the attitude was at a high they was 100 degree MAD and it showed. so once i went in to see her she asked me how was it, I replied well I know you said some because they didn't speak..I left so as i got home i thought about it I said I'm going to move him because that's not how a CHURCH daycare employee should act, so I tell the director that morning I was going to move him because I didn't like how I was treated from them knowing that my child has to be there with them 8 plus hours a day. so she begged me to give them a chance because Shemeka one of the workers had a bad toothache and that her face was swollen and when I picked him up look at it.. okay whatever I will give them a chance.. However when I picked him up I walk in the baby room speak(No Reply) but Shemeka Immediately placed her hand over her face on the side where I guess the toothache was so I SMH and smiled so while I'm standing waiting on them to get my son ready(Because they now have him in there naked with just a diaper on) Paula another worker in there was getting my son ready while shemeka STILL has her hand on her face like shes in soooooo much pain grabbing another baby with her other free hand(VERY UNPROFESSIONAL) just imagine her grabbing a baby with one hand and the other one on her face(Yeah I know don't look good at all) so I get my son and other kids the director asked, How was it? I said okay and left, but of course it really bothered me so I texted her once I made it home and told her that it's not right that she was making excuses for them because if she had a toothache she should have stayed home( I understand we all have to work) But if she came with a toothache which is not CONTAGIOUS! but it makes me feel that if she was CONTAGIOUS I feel that she would still come to work, she replied again trying to make excuses.. oh well THAT'S HER FRIEND or FAMILY MEMBER. ALL THIS WAS BEFORE THE NEW YEAR & being that school was out my kids didn't go back. So last week on the 9th of January I go to get the kids stopped by the baby room to let them know I was there so they could get him ready cause again he's in the bed naked with just a diaper & undershirt on I go swipe them out get other kids and come back to baby room and he is still in his bed with the same thing on(Shemeka was getting another baby ready to go while Paula was sitting in the rocking chair) So I said ya'll didn't see me come in Paula went to Lie and say I had a baby in my hands (which was not true and even if it was she should have put that child down to get my child ready because I was there to get him)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4dcc3160b0b1:0x7f9dc92f9b0c2d93"}

From what i gather, management has changed.\nI used to would shop at several of the locations at least once a week. I would pick up things for others who were in need as well. If it didnt work for them at thrift prices i could afford to buy it & put it back til i found someone who could wear/use it.\nNow I can't afford to do that. The last time I went shopping there, I came back with 3 used clothing items which cost me around $15. My mom came over with new clothes she had gotten on sell fot $1 at Walmart. The point of thrifting is being thrifty. JCPenny's & other department stores has new clothes for clearance around these prices.\nI enjoy the \"treasure seeking\" process of going to the thrift store but it is more fun when the treasure wasn't wrestling for a spot in your budget.\nI'm not the only one who feels this way. The parking lots used to stay full of customers. Now nit nearly as much traffic goes through there to weed through the donated goods.

I love that they are a Christian organization and make no apologies about it. The founder, Maretta Oswald, is awesome and has been doing this for well over a decade. Now, regrettably, comes a negative note. Ezekiel is affiliated with the LIFT co-op run by Sharon Hubbard who is the founder. LIFT offers additional classes in a classroom setting; however I would NOT reccomend LIFT. They started a decade (or more) ago as a Christian organization. They use to offer prayer and chapel for the students but have veered away from that; it is more of a public school setting now.  They accept troubled students that virtually no other public school wants to deal with. These student play vile music in the parking lot, use profanity, bully Christian students, and make attending class almost unbearable. Sharon does nothing to curb the problem--money seems to be more important. LIFT employs teachers who have pushed liberal ideas (abortion/open marriage) in class. Also, several students have stated that at least one male teacher \"makes them feel uncomfortable.\" Lastly,  there is no mercy when it comes to the high fees involved. If you miss a payment your children can not return to class. I wish Ezekiel would diassociate themselves from LIFT altogether. To be clear, Ezekiel gets five stars.....NOT LIFT!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2c815a273ba1:0x7f22e1a6134cbde8"}

Very unique style congregation of folks from all various backgrounds. Saturday main service begins promptly at 10:30am. There are several segments of their service which are performed by different members. There are several Jewish songs and dance followed by more modern worship songs in English. They also recite parts of the Torah. Everything is projected on the wall for new comers. After each meeting, everyone eats and socializes. It is was an extremely welcoming place full of culture and Hebraic biblical teachings. They also have a segment where they pray special blessings over the children. There even Hebrew classes taught here as well. Visiting the Messianic Worship Center felt foreign for its diversity yet familiar like home.

My family visited there almost 4 years ago and we have been coming back ever since. Walking around their grounds you can tangibly feel the presence of Our Lady & Her spouse the Holy Spirit. Getting to see the witness of the community members over the past 4 years has deepened my faith, has led to a deeper conversion within my family, and has led to a personal indescribable love for Jesus, His Mother Mary, and His Church. The thing that really stood out to me was the love that the community members showed each other and showed my family. I have a fairly rambunctious group of kiddos and their energy only brought loving smiles. Smiles during the Rosary, during the Chaplet of Divine Mercy, and all of their interactions with them. They are a beautiful community focused on introducing the world to Our Lady of Medjugorje to bring as many souls to Jesus as they possibly can.\n\nIf you get a chance to visit, take the time to:  1) Pray the Rosary in the Field of Apparitions where Our Lady of Medjugorje has appeared prior to apparition time (rosary starts at 11:00am in the summer // 10:00am in the spring/fall). 2) Pray the Stations of the Cross on a hike to the Cross on top of Penitentiary Mountain. 3) Hike the mountain across the valley from the Cross to the Grotto La Pluie. 4) Pray the Chaplet of Divine Mercy at 3:00pm.\n\nLastly, satan hates this place because of the community's love of Our Lady & their work of bringing more people to Jesus through His Mother.  People's negative reactions to this beautiful community can only be explained through that perspective.\n\nJohn 15:18-21: 18 \u201cIf the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you.[a]  19 If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.  20 Remember the word that I said to you, \u2018A servant[b] is not greater than his master.\u2019 If they persecuted me, they will persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also.  21 But all this they will do to you on my account, because they do not know him who sent me\".\n\nMatthew 7:16-18: 16 \"You will know them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles? 17 So, every sound tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears evil fruit.  18 A sound tree cannot bear evil fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit\".\n\nThrough Mary to Jesus,\nMike", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88896acde5666be3:0x963bf93c3a056567"}
