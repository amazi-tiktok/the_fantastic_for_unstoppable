The sandwiches we're absolutely delicious and made with an obviously higher caliber of product quality than you will find anywhere else in the area. And for the (on average) $10 you get chips and a drink as well. You can even call in and pick up your order at a later time!

Fresh vegetables and any type of infused olive oils you can imagine.  The cheese display is incredible, and the staff is more than happy to give you a sample of any you would like to try.  Let's not forget the meat!  You can see the dry aging of beef in process.  It takes about thirty days to age the beef.  I bought a ready to cook meal that includes chunks of prime beef, carrots, onions, celery, potatoes, a half bulb of garlic, tomato paste and a red wine jus.  Cooked it in my dutch oven, and it was perfect.  I didn't have to cut up the vegetables or meat, so it was a great time-saver.  Did I mention the filets?  Bought two dry-aged and they grill to fork tender.  The flavor is certainly better than regular filets from the grocery store.  All meat is butchered in-house, by well-trained chefs and the house-made sausage is unique, yes classic.  I also bought pork chops that must have been over an inch thick.\nI highly recommend you buy from this specialty food store!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1517078292301, "text": "Lorraine, thank you SO MUCH for your incredibly kind words.

I don't see how anyone could eat a 12\" alone.  I didn't weigh the meat but I'd guess this was 2X the amount of meat & cheese as you'd get on a 12\" from Subway or Firehouse Subs and that's on a 6\" sandwich.  Bread was gourmet and excellent.  Probably the largest selection of unique sodas and bottled beverages I've ever seen at a restaurant.

She pointed to the drink on the other side of the shelf, so I asked then why is the $1.99 straight under the naked smoothies. She goes around to the back of the shelf when she comes out her exact words were \"they are just misshelfed.\" I asked \"since they are the price advertised that's what I'm getting it for right.\" She procced to tell me \"no I'm not but we have cheaper drinks if you can't afford it.\" On top of all that she said it in front of four customers, which one female customer who was buying the same drink said I'll just go to pilot across street where they dont mistreat they're customers. So I bought the cola fizz and ask the cashier who told me her name was Tammy. Then I ask Tammy how to contact the manager she looked behind her at the blonde from the food area who shook her head no and Tammy said she couldn't give that information out so I ask what the blonde employees name was and she tried to say she didn't know it. After one or two other customers put their things down and left the store saying they wouldn't ever be back as will I unless the nameless blonde does not work there at all, for her very rude and unprofessional behavior.

My coworker offered to go in and pay for the gas so I asked him to grab a can of dip.  He came back out and I realized they gave him the wrong can. He went back in and asked them to switch it , and they wouldn't. I decided I would go in and politely ask them to make it right, as I walked in the cashier and a group of black girls were looking at me and saying \" Y'all don't go nowhere white boy mad , they gone be blood \". I politely asked the other cashier to switch my dip and he explained that the \"laws for Mapco \" stated that he could not exchange it once it left the door. I just politely asked if Mapco laws were different than those in the rest of Alabama. Once I realized he was not going to make it right I left the can on the counter and told them to keep it. I'm sure they pocketed my $3. People like the employees I encountered tonight are the ones that give certain parts of Huntsville a bad name.

I've heard a lot of bad things about this Arby's, but even though there are times that that workers are possibly not \"wonderful\", I dare say that people who write bad reviews likely have more \"bad\" days than most others. That's why they have nothing positive to say about people who are new to the job,  having problems of their own or don't like the job they're having to do because they can't get the job they want or are qualified for.\nThen you have those who just totally enjoy berating others and the business they go to.  They're angry because all they could get was a roast beef sandwich when they wanted a ribeye steak or maybe a T Bone.  I'm sorry you're stuck in a place where you aren't happy with your lowly position and can't afford to go to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse or even get a sirloin or T Bone from Waffle House.  Get over it.  Work hard wherever you are and do the best job anyone has ever done and that will help you get a chance for a position you can work up to. And stop complaining about others. Try being positive for a change and see what a difference it makes in your life and your career.\nI will definitely be going back to ARBY'S to eat.
