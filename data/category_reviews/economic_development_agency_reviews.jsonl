It\u2019s embarrassing for travelers to see a facility that doesn\u2019t even have proper  tarmac, gangway, or an actual baggage carousel .  Literally people carry them off the plane onto a dolly and set them out in the main lobby/entrance area by staff members (untrained teenagers) and then just let all the people crowded around to cipher through all the bags to find your own luggage.\nI can\u2019t imagine this becoming the main airport for Mobile or it even being considered a international airport or hub. Very scary, but leave it to that $ pocketing mayor and old Mobilians..", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4ef36becf113:0x32a1d41abf1f6e16"}
