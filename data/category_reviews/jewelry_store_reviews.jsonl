We set a high standard for ourselves in serving our clients & we're sorry that this was not met in your interaction with our business.  We strive to be as clear & transparent with itemized pricing on our service envelopes detailing parts, labor & totals along with a detailed description of work to be done as to remove any chance of surprise at pickup.  Regarding your visit, we created two separate envelopes because we provided two different services, one pair of earrings with 18k protector backs & specialty posts & one pair of earrings with 18ky screw posts & screw backs.  On each envelope, we included an in-depth description of parts & labor needed to complete your job along with the total.  Each envelope had a total written & differing totals ($257.10 & $300.70) due to different mechanisms.  We DID obtain your signature on each envelope as acknowledgement & confirmation of the details regarding the services BEFORE we proceeded.  We understand that your complaint is that our 10 yr. sales professional, Santana, did not give you \"the grand total verbally\".  It is very typical for a client that may want to pick up their services independently from one another, i.e.:  $257.10 one week & the $300.70 the next week.  Although we may have fallen short with \"verbally\" providing you with the grand total, we were completely transparent with our detailed written description & totals for each signed envelope.  We do value you as a new customer as well as your other family members & hope you will reconsider visiting Jewelry by Design in the future."}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c3ed9f2d5b:0x2fb4de104c11cb57"}

I simply cannot speak highly enough of this store! I brought in a family ring I inherited and wanted to melt it down and create a new right hand ring. When I went in, I had absolutely no idea what I wanted it to look like, I just knew I wanted a right hand ring. Other places I have been to, I would walk around and just look to get ideas, and people would get very frustrated with me or just ignore me. When I came into Jewelry by Design, and told them I didn't have any idea of a style I wanted, they were so helpful and patient and were excited to work with me and show me different pieces. It was actually fun working with them! Not to mention, being a part of the entire process and seeing it be created from beginning to end. It also made me feel so much better that they do everything right there in the store, they don't send anything off unlike other places in town. They also scoped my diamond with me to show me how to identify it so I knew it was my same diamond when I got it back. I will always recommend them to everyone! I am always treated like family when I walk in the door, I just love the feeling of a small town \"local jeweler\" I absolutely LOVE this place!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1464036280207, "text": "Thank you so much Crystal!

I walked into Jewelry by Design with my custom made, one of a kind engagement ring. It has 4 bands that meet in the back. My engagement ring had cracked where the bands meet and one of the bands had broken off. I still don\u2019t know how it happened but I was devastated so I took it in to get it repaired. I took it to Jewelry by Design because of all the great reviews and because the original jeweler was now retired. When I took it in, the service was great and I also asked to resize down 1/4 size because it had been fitting loosely. My first indication that something wasn\u2019t right should have been when they didn\u2019t check to see if they agreed that I needed it resized. When I came back for my ring, I could no longer put it on my finger after only going down a 1/4 size and they had bent the bands causing the halo for the diamond to be out of place. It no longer looked like the same ring and the setting for the diamond was crooked. I went back to them the next day and explained that I believed somewhere in the resizing process/repair that some of the bands looked a little out of place and asked if they would be able to fix it. I also brought a picture of the ring to show how it looked originally. The jeweler at this point was incredibly rude and even asked if the picture was of the same ring. I then explained to him that it was and stated again that this was a one of a kind ring and that it did not look like the picture and also didn\u2019t fit. He then proceeded to tell me that I had not needed to get it resized in the first place and didn\u2019t understand why I had gotten it resized. He also said that he had only done work in the back so anything that was messed up in the front was not his doing. He walked away at this point and his sales rep picked up the conversation asking if we wanted it resized. I said yes and that I would like it fixed to look like the picture. She relunctantly asked me to send the picture to the store email. I was charged more for the resizing than I had been originally and they told me it would take a week to resize it. I should have at this point taken it elsewhere but I wanted to give them a chance to fix their mistake. A week later I got a call in which the jeweler said that he had gotten it \u201cas close as humanly possible to the picture.\u201d He also said that the ring was unstable and that it needed additional structural support insinuating that it was poorly designed. My fianc\u00e9 picked up the ring and much to our disappointment and frustration it looked nothing like the picture. The 4 bands had originally been crossing and now they were parallel to each other. On top of that they removed the 14k gold stamp from the inside of the band. I hope that doesn't mean that they used some other metal when they resized it. I don\u2019t know how he thought that it looked like the picture. I have shown several friends and family members the before pictures and what it looks like now and they all agree that it\u2019s not even close. To make matters worse he added tacks to the ring saughtering the bands together. This was not part of the original design nor had we asked for it and he never called to ask before he modified the ring. The jeweler was again very rude to my fianc\u00e9 when he picked up the ring making comments about how the design was unstable and insinuated the damage to the ring had been some how done by my fianc\u00e9 between leaving the store and giving it back to me 10 minutes later. We believe that our poor treatment was due to our college age and that the piece was from another jeweler. The jeweler who had created our ring had designed most of my family\u2019s engagement rings, had been in business as a family for over 80 years, and was highly respected as a master jeweler for his unique design and pieces. So to anyone who has jewelry designed by another jewler or who is young do not go to this establishment because they are extremely arrogant and have no respect for you or your jewelry.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c3ed9f2d5b:0x2fb4de104c11cb57"}

The only time I have ever used anyone else is when she took a short break to finish college.\nThe very first piercings Sarah did for me were my nipples. I was very nervous because I had always been told how painful male nipple piercings, but Sarah made me feel calm and relaxed by assuring me that it was worse in my head, the piercings were a little painful but nothing like I thought it would be. She did such an amazing job, so I've recommended her to everyone. She is always very professional, nice, gentle, and most important quick with a needle.\nSince then, Sarah has also pierced my industrial, several other cartilage piercings, 6 Frenums, and my lobes using 6 gauge tunnels. The most recent piercings she did were both of my daiths for migraine relief; the first time in 7 years I have been migraine free for 3 months!!!\nEvery piercing she has ever done on me has healed perfectly and I have made sure to follow her aftercare instructions to the letter.\nHowever while she was on break I went to 2 different shops nearby for piercings, one with a female piercer and one with a mail piercer/tattoo artist. I had a standard cartilage piercing done by the female piercer. She (along with staff at that shop) was very rude, charged almost double the price, offered no aftercare, insisted on using a ring instead of the bar like I was accustomed to, and told me they were using titanium jewelry.\nI used the same aftercare that I've always used but the constant movement of the ring caused my ear to become so infected that I lost 2 completely healed piercings in that ear also. Later I found out that the jewelry they used was not titanium at all (not even titanium coated), it wasn't even nickel and lead tested surgical steel! When I went to the male piercer/tattoo artist's shop the place so sketchy and he was such a jerk that I left immediately.\nI WILL NEVER LET ANYONE BUT SARAH PIERCE ME AGAIN.

I have a credit card through their Genesis Bank. I was made to put a deposit down when I bought something I was also told that every time I buy something I have to put a deposit down. When I call Genesis they told me that even if I have an available credit limit they run and check your credit every time you purchase something and if they feel like not approving it for whatever reason they will not approve it even though you have available credit on your card they've already given you. I was not happy with that so I called Jared customer service and what I was basically told was we do not control the credit cards are banks policy is our bank's policy if you have a problem with it call them..\nI'm 55 years old I think credit cards from different jewelry companies different clothing stores and all other places. When you give me a credit card I expected to be a credit card you don't walk into JCPenney's buy $500 worth of clothes and have to give them $60 in advance you swipe your card you sign your paper and you leave.. what Jared is doing is not giving customers credit cards there financing the jewelry like you with your car or your house but they don't tell you that upfront.. so even though the people and the three different Jared stores that I've been to have been very professional and very nice because of your business practices you guys suck.

They have a beautiful high quality selection. We worked with Stephanie and she was so sweet patient and professional.  We purchased a new setting for my engagement ring solitaire while we were vacationing there and my solitaire fell out(after 10 years). They helped me select the perfect ring. We put it in layaway as our 10th anniversary was in December(this happened in June). I forgot to snap a picture of it while we were there so I called Stephanie and she happily got it out of the safe and put it on her own finger and sent me pictures via text message. She went above and beyond! We were shopping with our kids and they offered them chocolates and water. We called to have my diamond placed in the new ring on Wednesday of this week and they placed it on the same day we called and overnighted the ring to me for free. I live 6 hours from Gulf Shores. It was at my door the next morning. It is so beautiful! I am so thankful we went there to see about getting my original ring repaired and ended up with a gorgeous new ring that has special meaning since it was purchased at one of my favorite vacation spots.

The store is filled with interesting products from across the world. There is something here for everyone! The owners even showed me a few of their prized personal possessions which were kept in the back room, making me feel like V.I.P.  The store itself was well kept...which I can only imagine to be a constant struggle considering how many shelves and items must be dusted frequently to maintain the clean environment. Everything sparkles! If you have the chance, ask the owner about the musical vibrations produced by the bronze gong hanging behind the register -- it makes beautiful sounds which fill the space entirely, engulfing it's visitors in a sense of peace and tranquility. This store is just the kind of retail attraction our community needs in this area - Definitely recommend visiting A Coastal Zen as soon as possible!!!

We check in several times up through December 11th and the order had not arrived. This was fine because our wedding is not until February 6th. In mid December, the store manager, Adrienne, realized that the ring had mistakenly been shipped to Oklahoma. I understand there are a lot of shipping issues at the moment so I completely understood. On December  23rd, I called and was told by the store manager that the best direction to go would be to do a completely new order and that is would be scheduled to arrive in mid January. For a wedding on February 6th, a mid January shipment was cutting it too close for comfort considering our experience to this point.

We left with a few solid ideas on the band (this was big progress!). I came back to see Read by myself and selected the band. He then helped me shop for the right diamond, something I was still unsure about. Read has access to diamonds from all over the country of varying qualities, sizes, and cuts. He gave me some parameters of the size and cut he thought would look good in the band. Once I selected a few options we discussed price. All I asked for was a fair price and I truly believe I got it. The other thing that was important to us was for there to be service after the sale. Read Kloss has a great reputation and the times I was in his store return customers would stop by to browse, drop items for repair, or just to say hi. There was a relationship. Bottom line-my wife loved her ring. She bought me a watch from Klos Diamond Center as a wedding gift. I have been back several times for anniversary and birthday gifts.

I'm a newly engaged man in my 30's and having never purchased any jewelry before.  Naturally I reach out to my family and my Step-Dad was quick to say \"Go see Read. He'll take care of you.\"  Read has been my Step-Dad's jeweler for years so I knew who he was but had never dealt with him first hand.  He definitely took care of me to say the least!  From the moment I walked in Read and his staff were extremely helpful, had a great selection to look at, listened to what I was looking for and what my budget was, were extremely patient, and helped me find \"the ring\" that has had people asking my fianc\u00e9e where I got that beautiful ring from!\n\nNow keep in mind that I had actually picked out two different rings and due to certain circumstances had to change my mind twice before finding \"the ring\"!  The response from Read was always the same, \"hey that's fine, not a problem, now let's find the one!\"\n\nAfter that Read, knowing what I was looking for, based on our conversations, found exactly what I was looking for in a ring and then found a great deal on a beautiful diamond in the parameters I wanted and in my budget!  And did I mention he did it quickly!!!  His communication with me the entire time was quick and easy and constant between the phone calls, texts, and emails.\n\nThe customer service didn't stop after the purchase though.  He set up a wonderful, private, jewelry soir\u00e9e for my Fianc\u00e9e and her friends which they thoroughly enjoyed!!  Next, when she went to go get the ring sized, her Facebook post read \"When you walk in to have your ring sized and your jeweler greets you by name and offers you wine. He gets me.\"  The fact that he takes care of my Lady when I'm not there, speaks volumes and is greatly appreciated!!!\n\nIf you're looking for a jeweler to be YOUR JEWELER, that will learn what your style is and more importantly your Lady's style, take care of you both every step of the way, with great service... I just have a simple phrase.... Go see Read. He'll take care of you.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626caac715d171:0x1d7766f286f9159a"}

To his credit, the jeweler was wonderful. I got my quote and was told it would probably be ready by Monday.\n\nMonday rolls around and it's not ready but that's okay. I understand delays happen, and it's not like I need the ring right this minute. I say thanks and on goes my day.. The next day I get a similar phonecall, but it's still fine, I get it.\n\nThe third day past due, my husband gets a call that the rings are ready and they're ready for pick up. He asks if it's all three. \"Three? Um, there's only two.\" No, there are two bands and an engagement ring. \"No, I only see two bands here. I don't see any engagement rings here. Let me look for the order I'll call you back.\"\n\nSo he looks. And he can't find it. Calls back. Some stern words are had regarding the fact that yes, we dropped of a ring for repairs and it should be there.\n\nKeep in mind, this is my grandmother's ring. She is deceased. I have no words for how upset I was during this whole exchange.\n\nEventually they call back. They found it. The order should be complete \"tomorrow\"\n\nNo phone call that next day.\n\nThe following day I called back and was told yes, two rings are here for you.\n\nI swear, I think I blacked out for a second.\n\nGrogan, get your act together before you give someone a heart attack.\n\nTo the jeweler's credit, the ring fits great and looks amazing.

I feel that I should be able to pick out  a picture of the flowers and container that I would like to purchase, pay for it, and have it delivered. When I order an item, let's say a new chair,  I can see a photo of the  chair and know what I am paying for ,and when it arrives it should be the chair I ordered. I don't like paying for something that is NOT what I ordered. While I understand fresh flowers may need to be substituted the arrangement should resemble the photo. Flowers should be similar and the container should be exact.  A container should not be in a photo on the website if it is not \" in stock\". This is false advertising. Each individual florist probably doesn't have what is pictured on the Teleflora websites.\nI called the florist and expressed my concern and followed up with an email with pictures of what I ordered and what was delivered.  I ordered a beautiful sturdy white wicker basket with flowers and what I got was a cheap multicolored Easter egg basket. They substituted the basket and after I complained they were willing to offer me a credit of $2.50. What a joke!  I will not use this florist in the future for any reason and will never use a site that is managed by Teleflora. My thoughts are that the Teleflora company has way too many florist and they do not know what each flower shop has in stock. So when you order from a site like this one, you NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO GET. BEWARE. I wish I could put a photo on this commentary. I paid $45.73 for something that was NOT what I ordered.  Here is the response from the florist:\n\nThank you for your recent order. We pride ourselves on delivering the best, most fresh and most similar arrangements that we can for our customers and we have been doing so for over 38 year in the Shoals area! I am very glad you were pleased with the flowers that we provided for you and your mother.\n\nIn response to your recent request for a 50% refund here is our answer:\nThe basket chosen was unavailable and a similar value was substitute per our substitution policy.\nWe were also instructed to call and leave on the front porch if no one was available. Which we did. Our standard policy is to call and if there is no response, and no one is home, we leave a message as to where the flowers are. Since we were instructed, by you, to leave them, they were; only after a phone call was made. Had you not told us to leave the arrangement, and weather was not good for our arrangement, we would have left a message detailing where the arrangement could be picked up.\nAlso, you did not order from a 3rd party person. You placed your order on our website, which is managed and updated by Teleflora. They are our wire service and website managing team. They have thousands of florists that they service and we all obviously have different items in stock. They do a generic picture, and when a picture is chosen we try to fill the order as best we can with the flowers we have on hand at that particular time. Flowers are very seasonal and have a high turnover because of spoilage. Next time, a  call directly to the florist could save you a substitution since you would know immediately what they had available at that time.\n\nAs far as using another florist, they would offer the same substitution policy as us, so I don't know that you would've been happier.\n\nSince you were happy with the flowers provided in the arrangement and they were Pretty and Fresh I can NOT offer you a 1/2 refund of the product, being as though you were please with it. I will however refund you the \"basket\" charge since you were not pleased with the substitution chosen. I will be adding a refund of the Full container charge of $2.50 to your card. I hope this helps.\nThank you for your business.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d4eb6ed4ce74d:0xf4773df3daae3fbb"}

We timed it out where I would be able to pick up her ring before I left school after graduation and that time passed. We figured it would only be a bit behind schedule, but after 4-5 months of waiting (on a 6-8 week purchase) we had to buy a new band from somewhere else. We didn't receive a single call or email from them regarding the delayed shipment and we had to call every couple of weeks to hear that it was on its way. They had apparently ordered it from overseas and instead of getting us a new ring when ours didn't show up they just sat around and waited for it. it got to be a month before our wedding and we knew we couldn't wait any longer so we had to call them up and demand a refund (because they didn't offer us one even after all that time).

Since our 10th anniversary was approaching, I asked Benjy to help with the redesign.  He asked me to give him an idea of the style I like. I printed out a few images online and we looked through the cases for similar styles. The diamonds from my original bridal set were princess cut, and I wanted them to be the focal point in the new ring. I found a setting in the store that I really liked, but it didn't accommodate my diamonds. Benjy went to work measuring and configuring a new setting based on all these different components. A few days later he showed me a digital image of the proposed new ring. We talked about it, tweaked a few items, took more measurements, and he had an updated image of the design a few days later.  I was very happy with what he'd come up with, so we moved forward with having the mounting casted. A couple weeks later they took my diamonds to be placed in the new setting. My husband and I picked up the new ring this past week. I'm blown away!  It's breathtaking!  Far better than I imagined.

We had an engagement ring custom-made and it took us almost SIX months to finally get the ring back.  We never got exactly what had been promised, but finally got close enough and gave up.   During the stressful course of events, many things happened that were unprofessional and just poor business. Some of the lowlights include:\n\n-the staff repeatedly forgot that we were using our own gems (the whole reason we had a ring custom made)\n\n-staff seemingly just forgot about us multiple times.  they were supposed to send a design and a week, two weeks, three weeks would go by and then i would call to check and they would make up an excuse about their e-mail system crashing or their daughter had accidentally deleted their e-mails.\n\n-Had the ring made a completely wrong size (even after telling them repeatedly in person and through e-mail the correct size)\n\n-After ring had been made the completely wrong size, we were told they would fix it as soon as possible.  I received a phone call two days later saying that everything was taken care of and the ring had been resized.  We came into town the following day to pick up the ring and it had not been touched.  It was still the same wrong size it had originally been made.  Then the jeweler who would have to resize was out of town on vacation for a week.\n\n-When it finally was resized, the bands did not fit snugly against the engagement ring like they had before, and the staff was condescending to my finance and tried to make her think it had always fit that way.\n\n-The staff lost our extra diamonds and gold from the ring then tried to act like we had traded those in, even though that had never been discussed.\n\nThe store looks fancy and the staff looks professional, but it is all a facade.  If you just need to walk in and buy a ring, they could probably get that right, but I would NOT trust them with any custom work and will not be using them again for any of our jewelry needs.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2b79f4c74e39:0x817d54d1b05f7541"}

Well these guys did a quick turnaround at a very reasonable price and not only replaced the stem but my  watch was so clean and polished that I did a double take because, at first, I thought they had given me a brand new watch by mistake. Nope, it is my watch and I could not have been happier.\n\nNow as for the business, they have a wonderful selection of what you expect. Rings, watches, bracelets, earrings, etc. but they also have beautiful local artist pieces that are absolute stunning from inexpensive ocean themed pieces to a gorgeous diamond piece we just saw that range in prices into the thousands. They also buy gold and make custom pieces of your own design right in house.\n\nWe're here to yesterday to get my watch band repaired and they did it in minutes at no charge! That brings me to just how friendly, professional and all around terrific that everyone here, that I've encountered, are.

She lives in the condo complex where we were renting for the week. So I asked her if she could recommend a nice place to eat and if she knew of a good jeweler. She right away told us of some places to eat, then she called her jeweler friend Glenn Manning and got me an appt with him. She told me that Manning Jewelers\u2019s has been in business for over 70 yrs. and how awesome everyone there is. And she was so right about that. And she showed me her beautiful ring that Glenn made for her.\nGlenn took my old wedding and turned it into the most beautiful wedding ring I\u2019ve ever seen. My husband and I were celebrating our 35th wedding anniversary in Gulf Shores. Because our trip to St Lucia was canceled due to Covid! And we had been planning to make some changes with my ring anyway, so this was the best time for us to do that. I believe God puts people in our life path for a reason. So meeting Pepper, then meeting Glenn was a huge blessing for us.\nMy husband was very impressed how Glenn designed my ring on his computer then made a resin ring to hold my stones so I could see how it would look and feel on my finger. I wanted to use my existing center stone as a side stone to represent our past 35 yrs of marriage, then added a new larger center stone for the present, and another side stone to match for the future. Then we decided to add a two sided ring guard using my existing ring guard diamonds. So not only did Glenn design a beautiful ring for me, he also saved us a lot of money. And he recommended a great company to insure my new ring with, which had a better price than our home owners insurance co.\nI was very nervous about having my new ring shipped to me once it was done, just a few short weeks later, but Glenn put my mind at ease letting me know it will be insured and it came over night at my convenience. The whole process was Awesome! As well as the entire staff at Manning Jewelers. So if your heading to Gulf Shores, Al, or just looking for an Amazing  jeweler in that area, be sure to look up Manning Jewelers in Foley, Al. They are worth the drive from anywhere.\nWe also bought a really nice \u201cflip flop\u201d neck less for our daughter while we were in Manning\u2019s  and she loves it. Plus Manning Jewelers\u2019s also has a beautiful pendant called Stray Love that Glenn designed himself and he donates 20% of each sale to their foundation to help save stray animals. Best company to work with for all your jewelry needs.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1598110336782, "text": "Wow! Thank you Dena!

Don't get me wrong, those rings were beautiful, but they seemed overpriced and all looked the same. Even after showing the employees of those stores pictures of rings that I did like, they would still come back with the same ole ring I just looked at. Some of those employees remained professional and would tell me that they didn't offer anything else, while some became very rude and seemed to take it personal that we didn't buy the ring immediately. It was becoming a very stressful and unenjoyable venture.\n\nHowever, we luckily came across Griffin's Jewelers in Pell City after I searched for related images on Google. I had never been there and assumed that they probably had the same handful of rings all the other stores had, but was more than willing to give it a try.\n\nI couldn't have been more wrong! We were very pleasantly greeted by Michael and Stephanie when we entered the store and they remained helpful and attentive without making us feel pressured to do anything. They have a large selection of rings and most of the rings were already unique in their own ways; meaning they actually have a large selection of Different rings! I showed them pictures of rings and because of their knowledge of jewelry in general, as well as their own inventory, they were able to quickly locate rings that had the features I was looking for. It definitely felt as though a weight had been lifted.\n\nI ended up finding a ring that looked even more unique than the style I had originally been looking for and I love it! My fiance didn't complain about the price at all either; he was given a more than reasonable price and would have paid so much more for this ring elsewhere.\n\nWe're very grateful for Michael, Stephanie, and the everyone else at Griffin's Jewelers!

My husband had purchased my ring and I brought it in to get resized. That was my first visit and it was okay. They said to give them at least 5 days but I should receive it back sooner. 2 days later and they called back! I was thrilled! I was surprised how quickly the turnaround was. I left but the ring was too snug. I brought it back and the entire time the young lady was assisting me she seemed like I was a nuisance. Very unpleasant and I just couldn\u2019t wait to get the heck out of there. Again, they had a very quick turnaround and when I walked in not one word was said to me. I walked up and I almost spoke first but I wanted to see how long this would last. FIVE employees there and not one spoke a word to me. When I got up to the counter still nothing was said.

Whenever a jeweler sizes a ring, they then have to follow up on their work by checking each individual stone and tightening it, which can become very labor intensive when you are dealing with rings that have a large number of tightly spaced stones down the shoulder and onto the shank.  When it's all said and done, our objective is to make sure that when you get your ring back, you can wear it with full confidence that everything will remain where it belongs, from the ring on your finger down to the smallest stone on the shank.\n\nAgain, thank you so much, and I hope that helps clarify our policies a bit for you!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888dd4d29378307f:0x3fa4cd5e97e0d99d"}

I forgot to ask when I was checking out because she'd left for the day heading to the UAB library (I overheard her talking).  I called this morning to get her name but April (who said she was a manager) told me that she couldn't give me her name. The young lady this review is about is  African American and wears her hair in a natural afro type style. This young lady is a determent to your establishment.  Upon me arriving, I walked to the rear to inquire about a restroom.  In a very annoyed tone, she says \"Ma'am is there something I can help you with back there?\"  I walked from the dressing room and said \"I was looking for a bathroom.\" I've visited the NYCO at the Summit and familiar with the bathroom being located near the dressing room.  Very snippy, she said \"our bathroom is not open to the public try The Children's Place\".  I said thank you and she begin to talk very sternly to another customer about a coupon that she could NOT accept.  So I left to head to the Children's place, and returned to hear this lady now talking to another customer about the mis-placement of a blouse/shirt.  I was eavesdropping, but I didn't have to try hard because the cashier has a loud, stern, firm voice and it echoed thru the building.  She pretty much was telling the patron that she would not give her a shirt for a price just because it was located in an area that had a sign for a less expensive cost. The message she conveyed may have been true, but again, her TONE and ATTITUDE were horrible.  The customer left quielty.  But that was not the end of the convo for your cashier.  Two other cashiers were talking in whispered voices with the young lady and they seemed to be trying to calm her down.  In her overly loud voice the cashier (again I think her name is Shelby but I do not recall), this young lady repeatedly yelled \"she doesnt know who I AM!  I could be the regional manager!  I could have really shown her who I was, but I'm trying to be professional.  She and her mother...and she is this, and she is that....\"  I was shopping in your store and there were at least 4 other customers inside the store at the time.  So her tone definitely disturbed our shopping experience. I just needed this to be known because it appears that this young lady thinks that her behavior is appropriate.   I was happy to see her go because I did not want her to check me out at the cash register. I hope the lady she was rude to reports her as well. It was inappropriate and lacked professionalism.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890dc81b7d769f:0x1410983c41984a82"}

If I gave a return on a machine we sent somewhere for maintenance I would lose my job.  The man acted like a baby, and my husband was irate that a grown man should behave that way.

Nobody followed up with me regarding the ring or informed me they would not have it by the date we needed it. A week before the wedding date I called up to the store and was told Gary was out of town so I left my name and number and asked to have Cristy call me. No response. Two days later I called and again asked for Cristy by name. The girl came back to the phone and said Cristy did not call me back because Gary knew about my account, not her. She didn't take my call. We did not have a ring on the wedding date, we couldn't even talk to anybody who knew the status. I finally received the ring, well past the wedding date, about twice as long as Gary told me it would take. Gary repeatedly blamed the shop for not having or knowing about my ring. When I picked up the ring I told Gary they dropped the ball and I felt like they should adjust the price of the ring - or do something to make it right. Gary looked me in the eyes and told me \"I will go to bat for you\" in regards to making it right, he said he would contact me in a few days. After a month I called Gary back today to ask for his district managers number, in hopes of finally getting a resolution. Gary said to me, \"I thought we were done when you picked up your ring\". A far cry from going to bat for me like he said he would. I feel like Gary intentionally lied to me to get rid of me.

I took my engagement ring in for its 6 month checkup and to go down a quarter of a size. They told me to come back in two weeks and it will be here. So two weeks later we go in to get it and it\u2019s been ruined when they went to go down a half a size. Had a huge gash in it, popped out two big diamonds and a diamond on the side. We were heartbroken, they also told us that it was a discontinued ring so they couldn\u2019t reorder another ring and to pick another ring. So I spent a couple days looking and just couldn\u2019t find any ring that I liked. So I ended up going to the Kay\u2019s in bridgestreet and instantly falling in love with one. Told them the situation and they were so shocked. They said they had never had a ring be sent off and be ruined at their store. They told me to tell Decatur which one I wanted and they could have it ordered. So my fianc\u00e9 called Decatur asking if they could have it in my size and ordered and the girl said absolutely you can, come tomorrow and we will have it all ready for you. Well we go the next day and the girls calling all these places just to come back to me to say we can\u2019t get your ring in a size for you so pick another ring. I was so upset. They ruined my ring, then told me the night before they could just to have me go all the way to the store to tell me no they can\u2019t pick another one. I was so angry I ended up leaving. I later in the week went back to the bridestreet and they were so shocked with Decatur\u2019s performance to us, they said we can absolutely get you the ring you want in the size you need and they were confused why Decatur told us we couldn\u2019t. They told us to go into Decatur, get our ring and walk out and call customer service. So we did and the store manager himself fixed us up at bridgestreet with the ring we wanted, plus the band, the size we wanted, and ensured us it would be in two weeks in time for engagement pictures. Yesterday my ring came in, it\u2019s absolutely perfect!! It just goes to show Decatur is very unprofessional, their workers are unskilled and the store manager not once came to handle the situation or talked to us about it even when we were two feet away from her.

April and Christie went above and beyond with their customer service to help me with my issue and ensure all my needs were met. I had to get my wedding ring cleaned and repaired as a diamond had fell out. I sent the pieces of jewelry off mid-March and was expecting them back around early-April. My jewelry ticket consisted of one diamond in my band to be replaced, the three separate pieces sautered together, and the final ring cleaned. Upon mid-April, I did not hear from the store on the status of my ring so my husband and I went to the store in person to get an update. Ms. April informed me that the ring was being held because they wanted to make sure that I was okay with how the ring would potentially come out and discuss any pitfalls. I was informed there would be a potential gap in the ring once the pieces were sautered together. Upon me giving the okay, the ring was supposedly sent to be fixed and I continued to wait patiently. During that time, Ms. April helped me find two other LeVian rings that were on sale and that were absolutely gorgeous and suitable to wear at my job. I decided that once my other rings came back, I would get the two new rings resized for my finger. Coming into the first week of May, I discovered my ring was still not back and at this point I was getting very flustered. Ms. Christie spoke with me and ensured that she would get my ring repaired and back to me quickly and had apologized for the long wait. She personally made sure to let the jeweler know to expedite the process. When my ring finally did arrive back, the middle stone of the main ring was still cloudy, there was black residue on the ring bands, the ring was resized even smaller than my finger, and the same diamond was missing when it was presented to me. At this point I was livid, upset, and refused to do any more business with Kay Jewelers. Despite my ordeal, Ms. April and Ms. Christie showed me the greatest empathy for my situation. I was given a comforting and sorrowful hug from Ms. April. Ms. Christie personally took my ring to the jeweler and stayed with it until it was complete so that I would have the ring that same day and not have to wait any longer then I already had. In addition, she ensured that the other two rings that I recently purchased was resized that say day and back on my hand. These ladies truly exemplify the highest standard for customer service. My frustration and anger was not toward these two ladies but toward the poor service I received from the people repairing my ring. Now I do not take my ring off. Each ring or necklace I get from Kay\u2019s is not just a piece of jewelry, but it is a story of my life.

She also told us you have to spend an outrageous amount to even redeem any of your \"$1300\" reward points. That same day I had my ring and band sent off to be resized. The sales lady told me that they would be ready on the twentieth, which was nearly two weeks. I showed up today to pick up my rings, and a very rude pretentious older sales man informed me that neither of my rings were ready to pick up and that I would have to come back another time.

So, naturally I went there first to get some repair done on another ring. The guy that's there now was really rude, condescending and unprofessional. I asked if they did repair work. The lady said yes. The man who does it is with somebody if you want to wait. That's fine. In my line of work, being busy is a good sign. So I waited. I could tell he didn't want the job because he immediately started in with the dismissive tone. I told him the ring is special and we would be willing to pay more than it's worth to get it fixed. It was a 3rd generation hand-me-down that meant a lot to my wife's grandmother. She shelled out all she had to buy it and everyone in the family knows the story. I asked him to throw out a number just to see what budget range I was looking at. He made some ambiguous comments that suggested it can't be fixed. I asked him if he meant that he did not have the skill to repair it. He seemed to take offense to that and quipped back that he did have the skill. So I asked what price range are we talking about. He said it's not about the skill or the price. So here I am wondering... if you do repair work, and you have the skill to do this, and it's not about the money. Then it must just be that he'd rather not. So I asked who the owner was and he said it was him. This guy, apparently he owns the place. What really bugs me the most is that we waited on him to finish with the other lady who he was really polite and professional with and then he treated me completely different. I don't know if it was because I had my kids with me or because I don't appear wealthy in jeans and a t-shirt. Or maybe he looks down on us because this ring that means so much to our family is beneath him to work on. I don't wear my social class on my sleeve, but I do have money. I run a freelance web development business and I do pretty well for myself and my family. We are not ashamed of where we come from. We're actually very proud.

About a month after receiving the ring, it became apparent to me that the main stone was loose (it was not only wiggly and I could feel it, but it was actually rattling audibly). From being loose there was dust/dirt trapped between the stone and the basket of the stone. Keep in mind I had not been wearing it daily so it was surprising it came loose after such a short period of time.\n\nI brought the ring to the foley Zales to have the sterling silver prongs tightened and the basket cleaned. The rep there said since it wasn\u2019t purchased with warranty I had to pay out of pocket for both the cleaning and repair. It would cost $90.00. (Almost as much as the gift itself, but I couldn\u2019t do anything about the fact it hadnt been purchased without a warranty and I wasn\u2019t going to call up the person who gave it to because that would be rude).\n\nWhen I picked up the ring I was ready to pay for services done, except the moment my hands touched it I knew it was still loose. I showed the representatives behind the counter and they swore up and down to me that it wasn\u2019t loose and it was my imagination. They wiggled it and one even got her pen ink on it trying to \u201cdisprove\u201d me.\n\nThey said they could send it back free of charge so I said ok. But I got a bad feeling and since it had become a sentimental gift I felt like I no longer trusted that store to handle it since I felt like they were lying to me about it not being loose. I asked them for it back and they said yes but they would have to charge me the $90.00. I didn\u2019t want to have a confrontation with them so I paid and figured maybe I should just get a second opinion because it very well could be my imagination.\n\nShe swipes my card and is packing it up and I said \u201cI hear it rattling, tell me you can\u2019t hear that! Call me crazy, It can\u2019t be my imagination!\u201d\n\nShe held it up to her ear and to my surprise said \u201cyes! I do hear it rattling. You\u2019re not crazy\u201d.\n\nIm dumbfounded!! Before I paid, she said it wasn\u2019t loose, lied to my face, then the moment I swiped my card, she acknowledged it was loose!!! I am appalled. I\u2019m just going to dispute the transaction with my bank now because there is no way I trust the people working there. And I\u2019m going to advise the person who purchased it for me to do the same. I won\u2019t be making any purchases from jewelry stores like this again. I learned the hard way, at least this time it was only $90 instead of $900", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0e3378b63149:0x38a08331cfe85986"}

They insist they have high standards for the diamonds they select, but they do not. Lastly, I believe they profiled my Latino boyfriend during our shopping experience.\n\nTo give some context, I sold high end jewelry for several years and helped with buying pieces for my store, custom designs for my clients, and sold many different watches and jewelry pieces from my store. I have a strong knowledge of diamonds and jewelry. I shopped at Bromberg in two capacities - both looking for an engagement ring as well as a simple bracelet repair. I'll start with the repair.\n\nI brought my simple 14k gold bracelet to be shortened. The jeweler probably spent about 5 minutes to measure, cut and solder my bracelet together. I was charged $40. I also asked to be returned my spare gold. When I went to pickup my bracelet, they did not have the spare gold and told me the jeweler wasn't in so I could wait for a call. When I didn't receive a call, I called them. They said the jeweler knew about it and would find it for me. It took 4 days total and they then left me a message that \"they think\" they found it, but aren't sure, and asked me to bring my bracelet in for them to verify. I came in and the piece they had did not match, so they took my bracelet upstairs to go look, and did eventually find it. Overall this was a negative experience and the repair was much more expensive than either of the two jewelers I worked for personally.\n\nSecondly, my engagement ring shopping experience. An associate (not Lemka) explained that they have a high standard for the stones they carry and the custom process if I were to go that route for the setting. The 2.01 carat D SI2 I looked at in store was priced well over $20,000, I can't remember the exact price but somewhere between 20-23k. When I went home, I pulled the GIA certification info on the stone and found there to be a massive cavity inclusion on the bottom of the stone that they failed to disclose to me. That cavity would get dirty over time and make the stone look worse. I'm disappointed they would even carry such a stone, let alone peddle it for such an incredibly high price. That stone was wildly overpriced as such and I wouldn't have purchased it, even at a deep discount due to the cavity.\n\nDuring this visit, my boyfriend was with me looking at settings and diamonds, and briefly walked over to the watch counter to see what they had. When he started walking over there, one of the male employees shouted across the store for the security person to go over and stand by the watches. I felt awkward and insulted that they felt the need to call security over to babysit the area when we were already considering giving them our business on such a major purchase. I don't feel they would have had the same reaction if he was white and in a suit. Disappointing for it being 2020 and to still have such an experience.\n\nAfter that event, I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and went back to meet with the jeweler about a custom solitaire setting. He quoted me between 3-4K for a simple solitaire setting that I had handmade elsewhere for around $1550 from a well known local Chicago jeweler with a lifetime guarantee. Between the profiling incident and everything being wildly overpriced, I chose to take my business elsewhere. I love my 2.5 carat oval and custom setting I chose, and would not send anyone I know to Bromberg for any reason. If for some reason you insist on going there, be prepared to shell out extra cash simply for the mountain brook location, and be sure to work with Lemka.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1607632559320, "text": "Elena, we are so disappointed that you had a less than positive experience at our store. Thank you for bringing your concerns to our attention. I have passed your message along to our store manager.\n\nWe hate there was some miscommunication with your repair but are glad everything was resolved for you.

Unfortunately yours involved an extra trip to the store to correctly identify your chain. We appreciate your patience with this!\n\nWe do regret we weren't able to find the right diamond and setting for you. All of our diamonds come with GIA certifications so we can be clear, upfront, and honest about every stone we sell. We try to keep a variety of diamonds in stock to fit all budgets and dreams, but we do sometimes have to order in more stones if we don't have exactly what you are looking for. You seem very knowledgeable about diamonds, and if you would like to discuss our stock and exactly what goes into the pricing, we would be more than to chat with you over the phone, in store, or by email.\n\nAs far as the profiling issue, all our staff members are trained to be aware of potential threats, and it sounds like this was not a threatening situation. We certainly do not make blanket judgments based on race or attire.  We make every attempt to make sure every customer feels welcome in our stores.  Please accept our apology for making you or your boyfriend feel uncomfortable in any way!\n\nWe are appreciative of your kind words about Lenka.

It was a great decision that I would highly recommend to anyone. The atmosphere is very different than the other diamond retailers I visited. Instead of constantly being pressured to place a deposit on a diamond that was \"an incredible deal that is here today and gone tomorrow\" it felt more like I was working with a close friend that actually cared about my goals and was willing to answer all of my nitpicky questions without acting annoyed or rushed to try to land my sale and move on to the next customer that came into the door. If I were a new customer that was coming to give Brombergs a try, I would highly recommend working with Shannon. She worked with me throughout this whole process and helped me out more ways than I can count.

I've been going to Rick's exclusively for all of my fine jewelry purchases and work for many years now and I would never think of going anywhere else!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e855454a90751:0xa2b92bf9df0dcdf"}

I went into Spencer\u2019s looking for shirts that I desperately needed and I bought five that I absolutely loved. When I got home and tried them on, the inside of the shirts were a disgusting and cheap material that I could not stand. I decided to take them back and when I had bought them I payed $15 that was on a gift card and the rest in cash which was $80+. This was already way more money that I was expecting to pay which I also didn\u2019t really have the money to pay that much but I did. So I took them back and got all of the money on gift cards which I didn\u2019t need since the making of the shirts were poor quality. I asked them why this was and all they could say is it was there policy but didn\u2019t tell me anything about it when I payed. I wanted the corporate number but I had already left so I called them and nobody answered it was just a automatic voice. So now I\u2019m sitting here with $100+ dollars of gift cards that I don\u2019t need when what I need is shirts to wear", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1619645180836, "text": "Thank you for bringing this experience to our attention!

Went to Kays about a week & a half ago to look and purchase an engagement ring with my fiance. Starting looking at rings in our budget and was only shown 1 ring which I loved (& the girl who showed us the ring got kinda in trouble for showing it to us) until they said they were having a diamond show & started showing me rings from those cases, apparently they only have a diamond show every so often and I was shown about 3 rings or so from those cases & ended up picking one of the 3 after being felt like those were the only ones in our budget and  I was pressured into it. We were able to get the ring sized that day & take it home.\n\nSkip to week or so later, I decided to just browse online at rings that were in our budget & that said available in store at my local store. Came across several beautiful rings that I was NEVER shown to begin with so I decided to call and speak with the manager who helped us & told her about how I had seen a few online that said they were available in store & in our budget, so I go to the store to see them in person to make sure I didn't pick the wrong ring.\nGot there & the manager who from the first visit was super helpful and nice, didn't speak to me once when I entered the store. I showed the girl who was helping me a few rings I seen online that said they were in store & the first ring she said \" oh we just sold that ring\" the 2nd and 3rd ring I showed her she Said \" I don't think we have it\" & I was like \"why would it say it was in store if It wasnt?\" She couldn't give me an answer. She did everything in her power to convince me to keep the ring I had but that pissed me off even more so I still ended up returning the ring which I know they aren't happy about, but I wasn't happy with being pretty much only shown options that benefited them. They didn't treat me the same as the first experience & u just don't do your customers that way. Regardless. I will do everything to make sure everyone is aware of how crooked this place is.\n\nAlso, after returning the ring (which was leased throigh progressive) we made an account online to see how the process of the refund was going, come to find out our total was double the price we were told it would be in store from the kay employees. The deposit we put down was suppose to be 79 dollars and would also be the amount of our monthy payment & after looking online we discovered they charged us 86 dollars for the deposit & that our payments would be 91.60 WEEKLY! We were told 79 dollars and some change monthly and then it shot up to 91.60 weekly! They never went over the contract or interest rate with us.\n\nAfter the return I asked the employee if everything on their end was done and all we were waiting on was the leasing company to do their part. Called the leasing company to find out that they were waiting on KAYS to send the invoice over to get the refund process done & taken care of.\n\nCalled Kays once again to speak with the unprofessional, rude heifer off a \"Manager\" to make sure they sent the invoice in and to try to get some answers as to why she never vocally disclosed with us while signing the lease that our total was actually double the price she told us, & she would not answer the question. All she would say was \"you made the return, what else do you need, blah blah..\" How they can get away with is beyond me, after asking her multiple times times she actually HUNG UP on us. I called bk & another girl asnwer the phone, I continued to try to get answers we as customers deserved & as I was speaking the girl started pressing buttons on the phone & then hung up on me, incredibly immature & unprofessional. I am mind blown at my experience. I made a complaint with corporate, with the better business Bureau and got intouch with the district manager with the help of another kays manager of a different location!\nKAYS IS A FREAKING JOKE, THEY LIE & NEVER FULLY DISCLOSE THE FULL TRUTH & PRICE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS IN ORDER TO MAKE THEIR SALES & COMMISSION!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a68210bdbea6d:0xd5e4dcdfa346b928"}

The number one answer I received was Mefford Jewelers.\n\nWe could not have been more pleased.  Toddman Thompson, the manager, spent a considerable amount of time talking with us and making us feel right at home.  He even encouraged us to visit other jewelry stores to see what they have to offer in terms of products and services.  I'm so glad we did.  We saw a lot of nice jewelry and met a lot of nice people, but none that came close to comparing with Mefford.\n\nMy fiancee decided she liked a ring at Mefford best of all.  Ironically, we found a ring just like it at another Jewelry store in Florence, but Mefford had a much better price as well as service.  I was thrilled to purchase the ring from Mefford Jewelers because my fiancee and I both know it's top quality at a great price from a family owned business right in my hometown of Florence.\n\nI would say to anyone looking for a jeweler to do business with in the Shoals area - visit Mefford Jewelers.

I cannot explain what sets Goldstein\u2019s apart until I share the negative experience I had at another jewelry store in Mobile, so I will share that first.\n\nLike I said, I had a ring repair somewhere else first. The other jewelry store not only sized my ring down (when I didn\u2019t ask for it to be sized down), but failed to claim fault for it.  My diamond had fallen out of my setting and I asked the other jewelry store to reset the diamond and also solder my wedding band and engagement band together. When I got my rings back from them, my ring was a size 5 3/4 which is 3/4 smaller than the original size, which was a  size 6 (rings also fit tighter when they\u2019re soldered together, so it fit much tighter than before.) I want to also note that their store never sized me in store either, but rather had the ring repaired with no size listed in their system. Goldstein\u2019s makes a practice of sizing you and placing the size in the system, anytime you come in for ring repairs so that it is never your word against theirs.\n\nWhen I came back to the other store, not only did they not apologize, they did not want to take apart my soldered rings and resize them individually (so as to protect the integrity of them) , but they recommended making the two rings into one. The sales associate also sized me as a size 7 which is A LOT larger than the size 5 3/4 ring they had sent me home with just a few days before!\n\nI felt something was off with how everything was being handled, so I decided to not have my repairs done there but instead have them done somewhere else...which would be how I ended up at Goldstein\u2019s a few days later.\n\nWhen I went to Goldstein\u2019s, they measured my finger and reassured me that yes, the other store had sized my ring incorrectly. The rings wouldn\u2019t even fit on my finger without redness and swelling (which the other jewelry store associate said was due to having large knuckles, or perhaps even the humid weather.)\n\nGoldstein\u2019s assured me they stood behind their sizing methods. The other jewelry store actually told me they didn\u2019t guarantee their fit and scoffed over the phone when asked if they guaranteed the fit. Goldstein\u2019s on the other hand, said that they do guarantee the fit they size you with in store. They didn\u2019t make me feel like I was being unreasonable at any step of the way, like I felt at the other store. They affirmed me, as one should do when providing quality customer service.\n\nGoldstein\u2019s measured me as a size 6 1/2  and I noticed they had a careful attention to fit, and also that their ring sizing methods seemed more legitimate than what I was offered at the other jewelry store (they used individual rings to size me at Goldstein\u2019s, and the other store used a keychain of sorts full of various sized rings. I was more impressed with the Goldstein\u2019s method because if you\u2019re getting rings soldered together, you want to see how the two stacked rings will fit your finger and that they come off easily, versus what was offered at the other store, with only one ring being placed on the finger to determine fit.)\n\nIf I had gone through with the second round of repairs at the other store, I would have been paying for extra gold that I would have had removed anyway because they sized me as a 7, and my true size is a 6 1/2, as determined by Goldstein\u2019s (my rings fit beautifully now!) Goldstein\u2019s got it right the FIRST time versus the other store which didn\u2019t get it right the first two times.\n\nAll this to say, Goldstein\u2019s did everything correctly and professionally. They even texted me to see how my rings were fitting a week later. I call that excellent customer service.\n\nIf you want a correct fit the first time with no back and forth issues that make you second guess yourself, and if you\u2019d rather have extra money in your pockets (unlike I do, since I had to pay for correct repairs that the other store failed to provide) then please, go to Goldstein\u2019s!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1601480386580, "text": "Thanks so much for the great review.

If only I knew my experience with them later will be so emotionally and mentally traumatizing, I'd have never stepped foot in that store.\nI had insisted I'd rather patronize a local business rather than purchase online contrary to what my boyfriend wanted. In the store, I chose a ring that was in the showcase. It wasn't my size so I was told they'd order one in my size, also the diamond for the ring was not kept in the store so i had to wait for over a month for it to come in store. Unfortunately my wedding was called off and so I decided to return the rings for a refund 6 days after purchase was made and three days since receiving it from the store. There is a 15 day return policy for a full refund. I was denied a full refund because as the store owner stated; \" Its bad for my business\" and offered a 50% refund instead, which i refused. I don't understand why I  should bargain for a refund I'm  entitled  to. When I insisted to be treated fairly and given my refund,the store owner  Richard Frank Jr,  made comments suggesting bias and racism against my color and country of origin.Insinuating I'm ignorant and stupid because I'm a foreigner from another country and had an accent.  I have never been treated like this in any other store environment and urge any other potential customers to beware and steer clear of this rude and racist  business.

Most recent I was in the store looking for a replacement chain, sterling silver for my granddaughter, who has struggles with speical needs, Angela found the perfect little affordable chain to fit our needs, and even added a little piece of chain, so she could adjust it on her neck, didn\u2019t charge us for her quick fix of placing the small charm on the necklace, that met so much to my granddaughter, I only paid for the small chain and we were out the door, as I was leaving she offered me a water for the road. That is such wonderful service, the kind you don\u2019t get anywhere else. That charm was left at another store for over two weeks, just to be placed on a chain, when it wasn\u2019t ready for my granddaughter\u2019s flight, the jewelry store had a hard time finding our ticket and never seemed to mind, because we were only spending less then fifty. If ever I spend thousands, and I hope to do that one day soon, I will spend it at Goldstein \u2018s. Thank Goldstein\u2019s for caring about the person and not the dollar amount, and a special thank you to Angela, a fine representative of the Goldstein\u2019s name. Sincerely, Mona Wade", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1526243503077, "text": "Mona, everyone who walks through our door matters! We look at all of our customers as they are family!

Unfortunately, our experience was nothing like the reviews.  We wanted to redesign/enhance my wedding set and explained what we were looking for. The store manager took one look at my set and informed me it would cost us more money to custom design a new wedding set using my original stones. She then proceeded to show us settings and told us if we wanted to use my diamond they could put it in one of the settings, made a \"joke\" that I could have two sets and decide which set I wanted to wear based on the outfit I was wearing. Showed us countless settings then informed us to draw a picture of what we had in mind and bring it in.  Throughout the experience, a price point was never discussed.  We feel the store manager made a judgement call on what we could afford based on my current wedding set.

The owner changed my battery and then admitted to me that he had broken the watch crystal (clear glass over watch face). He reassured me that he would fix my watch. He is a liar, thief and con-artist. In the almost two months that they were \u201cfixing\u201d my watch I went 3 times to try to get any information. Finally I just gave up and told them to give me my watch broken. The owner was rude, impolite and intimidating.\nWhenever; I informed him that I wanted my watch immediately regardless of the fact that 2 months later it was STILL BROKEN. He said that he had tried to \u201cmake it right\u201d and that he had been looking to buy me another watch from EBAY. The watch I have is a limited edition Android Prism watch that is no longer being made. He said that he had been unable to find any watch similar to mine. While I do not watch a watch from EBAY; I would like to point out that in the last 4 minutes I have found over 5 watches currently for sale on EBAY with the exact same crystal. These are not cheap Wal-Mart watches; he simply did not even try to find a similar watch.\nThe owner stated that since he had been unable to find a similar watch on ebay (lie) that he would have to send the watch out to Las Vegas to have a crystal custom made. If that was the case then why after 2 months was my watch still sitting on the counter? Why had they not already sent it to be fixed?  It does not take 2 months to drive to the post office. It is apparent that they had no plans on trying to fix my watch.\nWhen the watch was originally broken by the owner, it had a tiny chip in the upper right corner. The watch has received even more damage since it has been in their possession. The original chip has spread to 3 times the size along with a new crack on the upper left. The back is covered in DOZENS of scratches and the hands do not seem to be functioning correctly.\nThe owner did not even try to fix my watch. He did not even offer a replacement. Under no circumstances should anyone ever go to these people. Now all I have is a broken piece of crap, and no way to have it fixed or repaired. They broke my watch and refused to fix it.

In the past I've been helped alot by wes and others who work there,  but the way I was treated last month was unfair, shady and down right wrong. A couple of months back I bought a 9mm Taurus hand pistol we did all the proper paperwork and I was approved. In may I got in a bind and went to redstone pawn as I have in the past and got a loan on my gun. When I came back to pick it up  wes made me take another background check and said that I was delayed and to come back in a cpl of days. First off I should have not had to go threw that process again the gun was already mine and I have a receipt of proof of ownership, I was just paying back my loan and picking up my property. When he contacted me back a couple of days later he didn't call he texted me and said i was denied and kept my gun that I have receipt of ownership for nor did he give the full value of the gun he gave me the loan money back mind you I have an expired gun permit. This was a scam to cheat a customer out of money and his property and i want stand for it, I'll be taken more legal action against this business and show them that you can't treat people like this. I was a good customer to them and they handled me very rough and not fair at all, businesses like this get over because as consumers we dont know the law in Alabama you only have to a permit to carry a firearm not to own one. They violated my second amendment right also no way I failed a background check I work for DHR and I passed the first one I took for the gun nothing has changed so why did I fail this time.

My husband I went to the Galleria location to get my size and we wanted to look at the one I had found. Unfortunately it was an \u201conline only\u201d item. The woman who got my size acted as if she was not only inconvenienced by us but as if she was better than us. So my husband ended up ordering the ring and gave it to me on Christmas Eve. When I took it out of the box and put it on I noticed one of the diamonds were missing. My husband immediately called their 1-800 customer service number and they directed us to take the ring to the nearest Zales and they would decide wether to have the ring repaired or replaced. Being Christmas Eve night the location was closed and closed the next day for Christmas. We went to the Galleria location on December 26th and when we explained the situation to an employee they went and got the manager. The manager then asked what we wanted done. I told them I wanted it fixed. Then they asked if I had the paper work for the diamond bond that came with it. I told them no that it should be fixed period considering it was a brand new ring. After about 30 minutes of talking to the manager she said she would take care of it and we wouldn\u2019t have to use the diamond bond and we wouldn\u2019t have to pay for anything. I even went ahead and bought the extended warranty on the metal and the sapphire. The manager said it should be ready by January 7th. When that day got here my husband called and it was not ready yet. Well my husband got a call yesterday, January 10th, that the ring was ready and that it was going to cost $110. When we got there to pick up the ring the woman that was working was the rude woman that waited on us before and the one that rang up my extended warranty. She told us it was going to be the $110. I told her we weren\u2019t paying a dime that the manager was supposed to be taking care of it. Apparently the manager was not there and had made no notes of anything!! I got extremely frustrated and upset. Eventually, after getting verbal and irrate, another employee came over and tried to calm me down. The woman ended up giving us the ring and not charging us. None of this should have ever happened. I will never buy another thing from Zales again!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889221402e1fc1d:0xdf5089bd7c120266"}

I just left from trying to get my 3 year old daughters ears pierced. She was excited and we let her pick her own earrings out. A nice lady helped us but you could tell she was new and learning. She kept having to ask questions to her supervisors who acted like they were too busy to help her, which ultimately took way longer than what it should have taken to complete the transaction, about 45 mins before we were finally asked to come sit in the chair. By that time my daughter was becoming impatient  and started to get nervous. We went to sit in the chair and she started to freak out. The employees just starred at her. They werent nicely trying to tell her that it would be quick or that it would be okay. They just starred. Previously my husband asked if we could pay after the piercing had been done because we werent sure if our daughter would go through with it. We were told no we had to pay immediately. After a minute of trying to get my daughter to cooperate I asked if we could get a refund. We were told no, they do not do refunds. I asked if we could come back another day after she had time to calm down, again we were told no. HORRIBLE, INCONSIDERATE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

In my opinion I wouldn't buy anything else from this Jewel Time store he had a nice nasty attitude with the intention I believe of causing a scene to provoke angry to have someone arrested.His son and daughter was looking at him in dismay and the son stepped up and proceeded to make a great compromise. The owner was not professional at all and kept  trying to convince security to look at his video. I believe he wanted to cause a scene to have us arrested by just standing up there ignoring us for a good 10 min to make us angry.

Wasn't. Then, at 5pm, I was told she left to pick up my ring, would be back in 15 minutes and I could go ahead and head up there. 30 minutes later I'm there. My ring isn't. An hour and 15 minutes later and she's not back with my ring. An hour and a half later, she's there with my ring. Isn't nice. Isn't happy. Isn't smiling. This is the MANAGER. She hands me my rings, doesn't ask if they fit ok, doesn't ask if I like them, doesn't ask if that would complete my purchase or if I need anything. Throws it in a box, hands it to me without saying a word and walks away! They talked bad about me because I'm already under the pressure of my wedding, getting my rings on time and I'm mad because they've told me lies all day long! Of course I'm going to be upset! I was lied to several times! What sucks for them?? I was preparing to buy a bracelet and a pair of earrings but instead, I walked out. When we got home we closed our credit account with them. TWO stars because my rings are absolutely beautiful. But, I will never go there again! She was sooo nice when she was selling me the rings but after she got her commission, she no longer cared if she upset me or not. She's the manager, yet her and her two employees sat there and talked about me while all three staring at me! So, two stars. For my beautiful rings and them helping me get my rings on time. What really sucks is I already left her a great review from when she wanted my money and sold me the rings. I'd love to speak to someone higher up, but they all seem to believe their employees, even if there are cameras. BTW, when I left, I went to Kay's and bought my earrings and bracelets from them!

This Zales location is where my husband, the man in uniform in the picture below, bought my wedding ring (#19868058) on October 2017. When first purchased from Zales, the ring had a morganite stone, which was beautiful, but I had my heart set on aquamarine. We also purchased the lifetime warranty on the ring, and later another warranty just on the aquamarine stone I picked out. To make a long story short (for character count) during our time at Zales we were lied to, given false information, struggled getting in touch with the store as well as returned calls, and were pressured to purchase an aquamarine stone at a price much higher than previously discussed. Overall, my husband and I were very displeased with the service we received at Zales. Anyway, after a painstaking process, I finally got my ring back around December-January with the new aquamarine stone. Being fed up with Zales, my husband and I decided to go to Kay to have our wedding bands made. We went the same day I got my ring back from Zales to begin the process of ordering our wedding bands through Kay. His wedding band was relatively simple and took only about a month or 2 until we were able to pick it up, however, mine had to be custom made to fit the oval of my wedding ring. I picked the french beaded design Kay had for my wedding band to be made and they put all the information into the computer system. Kay assured us the bands would be ready in time for our wedding and that they would give us a call when I was able to pick my engagement ring up and to review and approve a molding of my wedding band. About 2 months went by and we hadn't heard anything, but I needed my ring for our engagement party. I had it for about a week and was told Kay needed it back to make the wedding band. Finally at about April or May we received the call that I was able to pick up my engagement ring, but never had a molding to look at and approve. In late May, about 2 weeks before we were getting married, Kay called and said my wedding band was ready. Upon seeing my wedding band that we had waited 4-5 months for the first time, I burst out crying uncontrollably and couldn't even speak to the lady. They had made the band in the wrong design. I was told that I either had to use that band to be married with and then we could start the process all over again after our honeymoon or that I wouldn't have anything to be married with. After several discussions with corporate, we were able to get our money back in full for my wedding band. I felt so defeated... I only had my engagement ring about 2 months out of our 9 month engagement period and I had no wedding band to be married with. Luckily, we found a local, family owned store that was able to make my wedding band in 2 weeks. Lou's in fact overdid themselves and made my wedding band OVERNIGHT! I saw the molding one day and was able to pick up my wedding set the next day! They saved us. But back to my aquamarine wedding ring. On the 5th day of our cruise I lost my stone. As you can see in the pictures below, the prong completely broke off and the stone fell out. I searched the ship for 4 hours, sobbing the entire time and finally a little girl found the stone at the bottom of the pool! We took the ring back to Zales as soon as we got back to port and they soldered a new prong on in about 2 weeks or so. Not even a month later when we were in Savannah for my birthday, I was taking my wedding set off to clean it and the band completely snapped in half (picture bellow). I took my ring to a local Zales a few days later, but not until another area on the band broke, leaving my ring in 2 pieces. Since we had the complete warranty on the ring and stone and this was the second time the ring had broken I told Zales that I wanted my aquamarine stone put into a new setting. Well now I have my ring back. No new setting, just soldered in 3 separate places. Now I'm scared just to put the ring on my finger. Why are we treated like this when we've paid so much money?", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_G9nZMWGEKaykUu4_hJqkMuPOTGvyA-tVHezQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkZzymrZ58H7rgSUcx4aAYMPcnQuSVKUFkoJZt=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhIvb-S9YhwDKqyDwFWD3rOrPGXQ9TQd-v51p7=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da185689b79:0x50916a0e1ccfac2a"}

Though I think that having your ears pierced is something of a right of passage that should happen in the pre-teen years, a step closer to becoming a young woman, and she is about half that age, I'm a sucker for my little girl and we decided this would be our event for the day.  I researched online and found a few places that were still offering this service despite this pandemic.  We finally landed on Claire's as it appeals to children in her age group.\n\nAs an added bonus to the day, my niece, who is just a few years older than my daughter, and my teenage nephew got to come with us.  Big Girl's Day and extra help to keep them wrangled.  We entered the store and asked a young woman sweeping the floor near a large unmarked puddle of water how to get started.  Without lifting her head she replied quickly, \u201cyou get in line,\" and stepped past us to keep sweeping.\n\nStill unsure of what to do, my nephew saw the sign situated nearly above the entrance, something that wouldn't have been seen without guidance or turning around to leave.  After waiting in line for about 30 minutes for the 4 customers ahead of us to be seen, another employee asked for my driver's license.  I explained that I only have the temporary PDF version because I recently renewed it, but it is perfectly legal per Alabama Code.\n\n\"We have to have the paper copy,\" she said.\n\nI argued, \"But this is valid.\"\n\n\"I signed a contract for the company that says I have to have a paper copy of your license.\"\n\nI stared, in awe, that she could say that to two excited young girls without even so much as a fake frown, but kept her face as blank and emotionless as Ben Stein's is when he verbally buries an opponent in a trivia competition.  My daughter's eyes welled with tears.  I quickly assured her that this is not a failed evening because I could call someone to bring their license from home and we could still get it done tonight.\n\nWe browsed the thousand's of items for sale while we waited for our help who was only 20 minutes away at most.  The glue-on nails and clearance jewelry was sure to extend the evening's fun.  It was hard to stay focused on the good time, however, when the first woman we spoke with that was sweeping the floors nearly ran into my daughter as she barreled past with a mop, then a few minutes later made a point to put a returned item back on the shelf directly behind my daughters feet, throwing it instead of placing it, and hitting my daughter's ankle.  A simple \"sorry\" may have helped my growing annoyance, but she said absolutely nothing at all.  Nothing.\n\nOnce our help arrived, we cheered together and made our way back to the now empty ear piercing line.  We waited for several minutes, but no one came to help us.  After trying to wave someone down, our hero with the license left us in line to find help.  He was told that they were closing in 10 minutes and needed to mop so they could go home, so they weren't going to do the piercing.\n\nThe look of defeat on my daughter broke my heart and while her cousins comforted her, I placed the souvenir's we intended to buy in addition to the starter earrings on the shelf closest to us and wasn't shy about letting my baby girl know that it's ok, and that because of the uncalled for, horrid way they treated us, we will never shop at a Claire's again, and will make the date a weekend long event by going elsewhere to get it done tomorrow.\n\nI wanted to scream.  What purpose did the nasty attitude and horrendous customer service serve for Clarie's or their employees?  But instead of making my darling feel even worse by causing a scene and publicly scolding those wicked-acting women  like I wanted to, I decided to go the route of public shaming and posting our way-less-than-pleasant experience online for others to take into consideration when choosing the best place to share that memory with their babies.\n\nDon't go to Claire's.  They suck.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da39209e213:0x81182ba20954e921"}

First my fianc\u00e9 (now my husband) and I were living in Washington, DC when we saw a piece that Mr. Davis created! I loved the lady's ring some much that I had to know where she purchased the ring. She referred us to Mr. Davis at Davis Fine Jewelry. We flew down to visit with him about 6 months before the wedding. He was very direct and straight forward about cost, delivery time and steps that would be included in fruition to the finished product. He was true to his word. From the moment he finished casting the mold for my unique one-of-a kind ring, he called to allow me to see the size, demensions and make sure I was comfortable and satisfied with the direction the project was going. Even in the middle of the business's move from the location near Eastdale to the new location now closer to the Montgomery Mall area, he kept me abreast of each step. By the time I saw my ring, even without the stones set, I was estatic! Mr. Davis IS a \"Master Jeweler\"! He will even pray over your ring and marriage! I was equally excited to have Mr. Davis create my ring; since my grandparents met at Maxwell Airforce Base in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nI feel blessed to have such a unique, gifted and spiritual man create my exquisite and beautiful wedding ring ..... that has more substantive meaning for me.

Phil is honest and will do what is right, even when your not looking or don't know everything about jewlery.\n\nMy wife and I bought our wedding rings from Karat Patch, and we will continue to do business with them.  Great people who fear God. (That's rare now days!)  I highly recommend that you try Karat Patch.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d40791b44b9:0x9302b0816d32614d"}

So currently while in the jewelry shop, I inquired with the owner who informed me they have a $30/minimum. I was not told of that the 1st time I inquired. The owner began chatting saying, \"You know, I went to the dealership the other day, they told me my tire was going to be $150, I told them, no, it should be $10.\" Then he said, \"I went to the grocery store, they said my groceries were $100, I told them, no, it should be $10.\" While putting the battery in the watch, he stated, \"You know this watch has the wrong size battery?\" \"The battery is too big.\" I informed him it was purchased at a pawn shop so I have no clue who put the battery in but it worked for a long time. He said, \"Well, that's what you get buying from a pawn shop,\" in a condescending tone. I never requested a lower price on the earring repair. I will not pay for something only to be spoken to in this manner. His level of sarcasm was ridiculous. I will not be a patron of his business any longer nor will I ever refer anyone to him again.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1617377765626, "text": "Hello, glad you have been using us for many years. Sorry you had a bad experience this time around. Hope the battery that we put into your watch stays working longer than the one you got from the pawn shop. As for your earring. You came in the store without it and you did want a price on how much it would cost to fix it. But we can not give a price on any item unless we actually see it. You said you talked with me before the pandemic and I told you it would cost 45 dollars apparently. And like you said in your comment \"that was more than I paid for them\".\nWe don't do any repairs on earrings for free and we do have a minimum price we charge on basic repairs like those. I know you wanted a cheaper price because you complained to the owner about it. That is why he gave you examples of other scenarios like the ones you posted in your comment. Hes by no means trying to upset you or offend you in anyway. He just wanted you to understand that we don't barter with prices and we can't just give you a price without seeing the item. The owner also is very honest and upfront with any problems with repairs. That is also why he was concerned and wanted to let you know your watch already had the wrong battery put in it. As for me, I am the young man replying to your review and I do reply to all reviews that concern me. I do believe calling me unkempt was rude and uncalled for especially since I never said anything bad at all to you and barely talked with you in our store. Sorry my appearance is not up to your standards. As always have a nice day and I hope you have a wonderful Easter."}, "gmap_id": "0x889bb2652292ca55:0x21841c55b0c7bb0d"}

I had a ring I got for our 2nd Anniversary that had gotten to small.\nSeveral other Jewelers told me it could not be sized. So it sat in a special case hoping one day it would fit. When I spoke to Amanda she said she thought they would be able to size it. Just bring it in and they would see. I found out that the reason my ring didn't fit was because I was sold the wrong size. Amanda sized the ring, sized my finger and checked to make sure none of the stones were missing. She was so polite and professional. I felt so comfortable with them I even gave them my engagement and wedding ring to be cleaned. Amanda did the same thing checked to make sure I wasn't missing stones or had loose stones. I got my rings back today and I am so happy with them. Diamond Depot is definitely where's all my jewelry will go in the future. And I already have my eyes on my next Anniversary present.

Didn\u2019t seem right so I decline and they didn\u2019t charge me for the new battery they gave me. I left with a bag full of watch parts. Later, I realized the gasket was damaged, I was missing parts, and with a battery that doesn\u2019t work. This watch is a standard Tissot, and doesn\u2019t need \u201cspecial\u201d parts to change out batteries. I will send my business elsewhere.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1595683816573, "text": "Hi Joseph.  In the 1000+ Watches we work on yearly, we do occasionally have a watch repair that requires a higher level of service than our on site Watch Repair shop feels comfortable offering. In those instances, we send the watch to our repairman in Texas, whom we have worked with for years, and they will repair and send back to us. The service is excellent and the pricing is very affordable for our customers.\n\nOut of all the watches we have replaced a battery on this year, yours was the only one that we needed to send off for further inspection. The reason was because of a damaged gasket (so it appeared) - but certainly it was beyond our comfort level of repair locally. Rather than continue to work with it locally, we felt the need to move it to a higher tier repairman so that we could offer the best service on your watch. Your response was that you had someone in Georgia who has worked on it before and could put the back on with the gasket, no problem. You seemed as if it was no problem and we assumed that was the case.\n\nIt appears that there your repairman in Georgia saw a similar issue that we did - that there was still a problem.   Our repairmen would have had no issue providing the service that was needed to complete the task but I understand that you didn\u2019t feel comfortable with us taking care of the problem for you further. I\u2019m sorry you felt that way.  We certainly do everything we can to provide a level of service that makes people feel comfortable with allowing us to take care of them from start to finish. I believe, as you can see by the reviews, that we have always done our part to make things right and offer a service that ends with satisfaction.  While you may have felt uneasy about letting us finish the repair for you, I do not believe we have any type of reviews or history that would warrant that feeling from you. Instead, I believe it\u2019s just the opposite - that we have a proven record (shown on reviews) of making sure all of our customers are fully satisfied and we work hard to maintain this level of service.\n\nEither way, we are sorry you were unable to do business with us and see our service through to the end. But we wish you all the best."}, "gmap_id": "0x888bb172c55c3801:0xdc319865b7fa1df6"}

I had a loose diamond that I wanted to incorporate into a unique engagement ring. I work in Atlanta, so I decided to visit a well known jewelry designer in Buckhead. She was very knowledgeable, but had her own idea for the ring, and didn\u2019t seem to listen to what I wanted.  Frustrated and disappointed after our third meeting, I decided to scrap the whole project.\n\nWhen explaining the bad experience to a friend, she mentioned that Terry had recently designed an engagement ring for a relative which turned out beautifully. Since I live in Oxford, I figured I didn\u2019t have anything to lose so I dropped in one day to check it out. During our first meeting, Terry really took the time to listen to me, made notes and offered suggestions when I asked for them.\n\nOver the course of the design process, I completely changed what I wanted, but Terry and Amanda were very patient and encouraging. When I decided that I wanted side stones, they arranged to bring in three sets for me to view with my diamond to find the perfect match.  After I received the original CAD rendering, I realized that there were a few things that I wanted to change. Each suggestion was promptly incorporated into the design and a new CAD rendering sent.\n\nI was able to pick up my finished ring on Christmas Eve, and it was more stunning than I had ever imagined. Even though this was a custom design that involved a lot of personal service, the price for the setting was very reasonable.  I have worked with various jewelers on other projects and I can say without a doubt that Terry and Amanda\u2019s design capabilities and professionalism are the best I\u2019ve experienced. Thank you guys for a beautiful, one-of-a-kind ring!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1592333188435, "text": "Michelle thank you!  I hope you're enjoying that beautiful ring!

I took it, along with the wedding bands she & dad wore, and her \"lucky\" ring. (The \"lucky ring\" was found on a trip to PCB some 25-30yrs ago.

Much closer than Atlanta or Birmingham.  Amanda our diamond consultant was INCREDIBLE!!!   She has an awesome personality and was so patient with listening to our needs and wants.   Amanda\u2019s knowledge was also helpful.  We ended up special ordering my ring and could not be happier. Just WOW! LOVE IT!  The Oweners were there as well and adds the nice family atmosphere.   I think it is important to support small local businesses, but We got to do this and get the best service and quality we were looking for.  Their prices and customer service are not beatable.

The atmosphere was several degrees better than your average pawn shop - very clean and well lit, customer friendly, and the folks running the place were very conscientious and genuinely nice.

Even my wife and teenager really liked the place and they are both easily \"sketched-out\" by any kind of second hand store.\n\nI was really impressed with all the good stuff for sale. All of it was very nicely displayed too. There were guns of all kinds and other hunting equipment, tools, musical instruments, high-end sunglasses, games, sports equipment, rods and reels, portable air conditioners, TVs and other electronics - you name it - and LOTS of top quality jewelry. (I'm pretty sure wifey plans to sneak back over there without me :-0 )\n\nThe prices seem fair and are clearly marked, but don't be afraid to ask for an even better deal. I was able to negotiate a great price on a particular item I had been needing for a long time but could never bring myself to purchase.

I was told that the shop would stand behind the ring and wrote the details about the ring on my receipt that they would guarantee.\n\nThe next day I went to a local jewelry store to see what kind of deal I got.  Man was I surprised - I not only got a confirmation of the details of the ring were 100% correct - I was told that the ring was worth 5 times what I paid for it......I couldn't have been happier.\n\nTo know that I got a great deal on a great piece of jewelry alone would bring me back to this store.  Then add the friendly, customer centered, genuine service I received from the staff and  I will be a customer for a long time.

They have become family and friends to me, I am one of the most frequent visitors at their store , and It doesn't matter  how many times  I go they are always pleasant, they know my name I have been there so many times, to buy so many items. All the items I have bought I received a great  deal on. I haven't had any items that I wasn't pleased with and trust me I've spent a lot of money in there, its the best pawn shop in town. If I decide I need something I call and if they don't have it it seems like with in a week they have exactly what I need. I will not go to any other dealers because I get great deals here. just want to put a shout out to FAMILY JEWELRY & LOAN for making my shopping experience one that is very pleasant !!!!!!!!

I won't recommend them and you can bet I'll be telling the man making this jewelry not to refer his customers there.
