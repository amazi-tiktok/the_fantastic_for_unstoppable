Tim and Vickey shared stories from their trip to the California wineries that began their interest as well as details about each of the wines we tasted and the process that goes into making them.  We tasted all the wines in stock and selected our favorites.  This is all logged on a card that they will pull for you when you come back.  The wines were very reasonably priced at $8.00 per bottle and if you buy 3 you get the fourth bottle FREE.  I also purchased a small jar of Muscadine Jelly and a wine glass with their logo.  My favorite wines were the Scuppuernong Semi Sweet, LCV Red and Black Spanish.  The wine is all labeled with Perry County, this makes for a nice memento for someone who has ties to Perry County or for the collector who likes wines from local vineyards.
