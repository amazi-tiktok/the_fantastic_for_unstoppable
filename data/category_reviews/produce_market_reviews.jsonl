There are two separate businesses in Green Valley: the market and flowers and the landscaping.  You can judge the flowers for yourself and should get a good quality product.  I would recommend Porters just across the river for a much larger selection.\nNow the BEWARE.  I hired Ken Irby to do my landscaping.  His crew did a good job.  As soon as the job was done and the sod laid I was very satisfied.  THEN IT RAINED.  I took pictures of the washed-out sod to the business and showed it to one of the landscapers.  He immediately said they did not put pins in the sod so it washed away.  I then went into the office and showed MR. IRBY.  He said he could fix it for over $1000.\nI stated that since it was his workers' error it should not be that much.  He and I agreed to $800 to fix.  I know.  Why should I have to pay anything? As of today, November 4, 2020, I have not gotten responses from e-mails or calls.  I still have a mess and have waited too late to resod because MR. IRBY did not keep his word.  IF YOU DEAL WITH THIS MAN GET IT IN WRITING AS HE IS NOT TO BE TRUSTED.\n\nIn response to Mr. Irby.\nYou try and make yourself look like you will take care of a problem you created.

He (Green Valley Nursery & Landscape) never showed up that day. I questioned him, & he acted like he was doing me a favor by fitting me into his busy schedule. Told me he\u2019d send a bobcat over to finish the job right then... I asked if the gravel was even at the job site, & he replied, \u201cI have no idea! Guess I better check.\u201d Wow! If that doesn\u2019t tell you how unprofessional they are, I don\u2019t know what does? Said he might be able to get the job done on Tuesday. I finally had him nail down a time for Friday, because I like a guaranteed job when I am paying for it. I felt like I had to babysit them to make sure the job would actually get done. Finally, the driveway was installed by people who are supposedly professionals. They literally just dropped off gravel & spread it out a bit. I\u2019m not a professional landscaper, but all the research we found said that the gravel needed to be plate compacted through the process. He said they don\u2019t do that, & he never promised me that. I only expected him to professionally & properly install a driveway... sorry, that\u2019s what I thought they were. Professionals. Nope. He refused to fix the job, even though I was promised I wouldn\u2019t have to pay until I was happy, & he would make it right. He told me he wanted to wash his hands of me, & wished I\u2019d never bothered him. The gravel in this driveway is so loose that the first rain will wash it all out, it\u2019s uneven, has a poorly graded slope that makes it hard to enter the drive without scraping the bottom of your car, & my husband couldn\u2019t fit his Jeep in the carport anymore because there was so much gravel under it. They refused to fix it at the present cost, & said they would plate compact it for another $500. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll bill you, don\u2019t pay it, & I\u2019ll send you to collections. We\u2019ll let the law handle it.\u201d Unbelievable & awful experience. My husband & I could\u2019ve done this job properly for as little as $700, but we decided to hire \u201cpros\u201d instead, & now, we are out $950, & it\u2019s not even done right... meaning more expenses for us now.

At that time I had no time to spend on thinking about meal planning and no money to go out to eat (and not willing to eat ramen), so I decided to take a gamble on a 10lb bag of blue grits instead.\n\nSince then, McEwen & Sons grains have been a fairly large staple of my diet.\nAt this point, I am mostly gluten free, and not even by conscious decision. The way corn or oatmeal fills up your stomach feels entirely different from the way bread or pasta does - and never have I felt physically ill or lethargic from making and eating a little too much (many?) grits.\n\nFor a month or two, I found a local supermarket that offered grits in bulk and thought I'd switch, but despite my attempts to add spices and such they didn't taste like much of anything (they weren't organic and definitely hadn't been refrigerated).\nMaking cornbread using the recipe on the bag was also wonderful! And very easy to make and pack, though is always best straight out of the oven or with soup.\n\nFor anyone trying to eat healthy on a budget - or really anyone who enjoys tasting food at all - I very much recommend McEwen & Sons.\n\nThey offer free ground shipping on all orders over $75, which I try to take advantage of, as it's usually around $25 of shipping that I can now spend on provisions instead.\n\nAdditionally any orders over $40 include a free gift!\nOnce it was yellow cornmeal, which got me hooked on that. This most recent order included blue cornmeal, which I haven't tried yet but am very much looking forward to making blue cornbread with).\n\nCurrent favorite recipe:\n1.In a cast iron pan, cover some garlic and shallots with oil/butter/lard and roast in your oven until crispy.\n2. Add some grits or cornmeal to boiling water\n3. cook on low, stirring until thick.\n4. Add chipotle, garlic and shallots, hatch green chile, some buttermilk, coriander, spinach etc.\n5. Enjoy\n\nA very long review, but I'm spending Christmas morning alone this year and thought I should give something to somebody this morning.\n\nSo long and thanks for all the grits,\n\nAKK", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888945c1a71211f3:0xd5b626ceee42051b"}

They open at 7 and close at ~8-10. Between the oblivious patrons blocking the path, the 'buy me' displays everywhere and the daytime stocking carts it's very frustrating just to move around in the store. There is no room. This isn't the employee's fault as employee's aren't displays or stocking carts. This is a managerial fault. Have daytime stocking or 'buy me' displays. Don't clutter the aisles with both. If I had to sum up my review it's just 'store very cluttered'.\n\nI don't have the same frustrations moving around in other grocery stores.
