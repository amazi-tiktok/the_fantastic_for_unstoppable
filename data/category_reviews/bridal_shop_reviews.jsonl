Sloane...she is is AH-MAZING. I have never experienced such phenomenal customer service. She was so bubbly and welcoming from the second we walked in the door and she went above and beyond to find my dream gown. Sloane was extremely attentive and really listened to my comments and feedback as I tried on gowns. Her experience and expertise are far above the rest.

(Catherine is the seamstress Molly recommended, and she works out of the Ivory & White shop... Super convenient!) They have both been helpful, humble, enjoyable and patient during each of my visits. I came in already having purchased a beautiful dress for a steal of $127, but I wanted to at least try on dresses at a boutique (first dress was an online purchase) to make sure I had the one I wanted. (Plus, I wanted the experience with my mom and sisters there.) Molly knew this on the front end and continued to give me seemingly limitless time to try on as many dresses as I wanted. We all enjoyed her pleasant demeanor and felt like we'd become friends as we had developed some inside jokes before we left that first day. She was incredibly gracious in response to my \"I'm preeeeeetty sure I want that one, but I just can't decide on the spot.\" This resulted in her eventually making a special trip back to the store after they had closed just to let me come and try the dress on one more time that day. I so appreciate her genuine desire to be helpful and to provide personalized, quality customer service. I'm from out of town, and she is what sold me on buying my dress so far from home. I know I can trust her level of service and consideration for this season of wedding planning.\n\nNow to Catherine, she too became a friend before my first fitting was complete. She and Molly both were quite patient with my desire to try multiple colors of white, cream, ivory, etc sashes, and since my mom was trying to help me save money by finding ribbon to make the sash ourselves, Catherine suggested we check out Oodles of Ribbon/Oodles of Gifts (as well as a delicious lunch place nearby) where we found the perfect ribbon for only $10 as opposed to a possible $200. I deeply appreciate these women and their care for me as an individual bride. They truly \"get\" how to serve their customers well, they are available and flexible, very approachable and easy to be around, and while I could go on, I'll simply say please book your appointment today... Even if you think you've already found your dress. ;)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891a1163d71495:0xd263e33c6fd9c1cd"}

A day before my wedding I go to try on my dress to find that pins were still in place were alterations should have been made. When called & confronted they laughed & asked what I wanted them to do about it! I ended up having to get emergency last minute alterations because my dress literally fell off of me hours before my big day.

I ended up getting a partial refund for alterations but literally worst customer service experience of my life! Would strongly advise reconsidering before pursuing any services from Images Bridal!\n\nAs a response to your LIES & FALSIFIED Statement I indeed lost a significant amount of weight (as instructed) over 40lbs to be exact!  I also did indeed  make it to EVERY arranged fitting & appointment that was scheduled with PICTURES to show every instance I tried my gown on(for 4 consecutive months)!

You did not make your fitting appointments on time as we requested, and you failed to comment to us that you lost 20 pounds after you had your initial alteration fitting, then you did not come in for your follow up fitting after Ms. Pat made numerous attempts to contact you, until the day before you were leaving to go out of town for your wedding. Ms Pat did the best she could do under the circumstances. No one meant to be rude to you. Rather than rude, I guess our behavior was one of shock based on the fact we had never had a bride that had not come in for her follow up fitting until practically her wedding day and whom had lost 20 pounds since her initial fitting, didn't tell us, and didn't come back until it was too late to fix, then be upset with us when the gown doesn't fit after a weight loss of 20 pounds without making us aware. Ms. Pat is an independent seamstress, not employed by Image's whom you paid directly. She is an excellent seamstress with over 50 years of alteration experience and even under the circumstances of your 20 pound weight loss she was kind enough to refund money to you after she had spent numerous hours in vain altering your gown when\nthe whole event was your fault to begin with."}, "gmap_id": "0x88891a88bf321a21:0x3b08f7975dc30c7c"}

During prom season things can get very hectic and stressful. I apologize if I was rude in any way. I did not mean to be. If I remember correctly you were purchasing one of our girl's rental pageant gowns for your granddaughter. We do sell them, but not until all previous promised rental dates are fulfilled, of which this gown had already been rented for a future date. It was clearly marked on the ticket, and as I mentioned things do get hectic at prom season. That is why I mark all rental dates visibly on the dress ticket. You had a new consultant helping you that day and unfortunately she had failed to notice on the ticket which was clearly marked that the gown had been rented for a future date and that this particular gown was also promised to be sold to another customer after that rental was fulfilled. This customer who wanted to buy it requested after it had already been rented and was allowing it to be rented until her wear date when she would complete her purchase of the gown. This was an agreement pre-arranged and clearly marked on the ticket of the dress and is why the dress was still on the floor to be rented for open dates to others until her wear date.  My consultant had been trained to read the ticket before showing new customers the gowns to make sure they were available for your wear date. She failed to do this as she had been trained to do. If I got upset my frustration would not have been at you, but due to the slip up on our part which caused you to become upset. Rentals can get confusing that is why I have always marked visibly on a dress every rental date, etc. it is promised for so it is visible to all. I was upset for you. I do remember we found a dress that was almost identical to the first that your granddaughter loved. You bought it and I also threw in a rental slip for her to wear for free. And, yes I do have a lovely group of ladies working for me. I love them and we do our best to assist our customers with the best service possible. I am teaching them to do double checks and back each other up with double checks and to tell the customer to review the dress tickets also, so this hopefully will never happen again. I am sorry for what happened and I apologize for any upset that was caused to you. I do know your daughter said that everything turned out great and your granddaughter looked beautiful in the pageant."}, "gmap_id": "0x88891a88bf321a21:0x3b08f7975dc30c7c"}

I didn't really know what I wanted going in, but she was very helpful in picking out dresses to try and working from there. Ultimately, we basically made a custom gown from a very flexible designer, who was also hosting a trunk sale that week. We had the shop to ourselves and everything was very one-on-one. The only thing  I would have changed at this appointment was maybe shortening the length of the train on the dress more. I give Morgan 5 stars!\n\nJune 2019: My experience coming back to I&B was very different once my dress came in. I scheduled a 5 pm appointment to try on my dress for the first time. I had my make up done and had my hair professionally done for this appointment. I arrived right on time and was met at the door and asked to leave by Tori, the owner, because the previous appointment was not finished. I unhappily waited in my car outside the shop for the group to leave. Tori called about 30 minutes later saying the group was paying, but I continued to wait because the group was all still in the shop. After over 45 minutes of waiting and the group still being in the shop, I left and was not able to try on my dress for the first time, even though I made sure to do everything on my part to make sure everything was perfect.\n\nJuly 2019: When I arrived for my alterations appointment with Elaina, the previous appointment was yet again still in the shop. I was allowed to come in, but I was very uncomfortable. This group was very large and was not properly wearing their mask (if at all) or allowing a 6 foot distance from my appointment with Elaina. Tori, the owner, also did not wear a mask. I also felt I could not walk around the store or sit in my dress, because this group and their stuff was still spread out throughout the shop. The group was present for almost the entirety of my appointment. They were toasting with alcohol, taking selfies and videos, and also had kids with them. This all felt very rude and intrusive, especially after I was made to leave the shop for another client's appointment.\n\nElaina: Elaina is an independent seamstress, who works with I&B Bridal two days a week.

The consultants in the store were very nice and helpful, but it's not worth the headache of dealing with Promenade's lack of good communication skills. I guess they missed the lesson in business school that the customer is always right.\n\nWhen the dresses did not arrive in time for my wedding, they did offer us dresses from another source that were in stock. However, the sizes that my bridesmaids needed were not available. All three of my bridesmaids lived out of town, so having Promenade alter a larger dress down a size was not a feasible option for me, even though the store suggested altering dresses THEN shipping to the bridesmaids. I felt that anyone who knows anything would realize this option was crazy on a timeline of 10 days before the wedding. What were we going to do if the dresses were altered, shipped, and arrived 5 days before the wedding, and still didn't fit?\n\nSo about 10 days before my wedding, I ordered replacement dresses from David's Bridal and paid for overnight shipping. I'll admit that the fact that the original dresses never came in may have been the dress manufacturer's fault, but Promenade did not handle the situation well. The owner did not return phone calls when my mother or I would leave messages at the store, and she did not check the status of the supposed shipment as early or as often as I would have liked.\n\nI requested that the store reimburse me for the cost of the replacement dresses that the girls did not want or even like, but they refused. I sent an email to the owner with the invoices for these dresses, and never heard another word about it until I sent another email, waited 10 days, received no response, and then called the store to follow up.\n\nI don't want to sound like another jaded bride, but the truth is that there are plenty of other local businesses that do a better job of communicating with their customers and valuing customer satisfaction.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d45f35aef892b:0xb0bea7f33837c8f2"}

We didn't find a huge selection, and the one dress my daughter liked had sequins missing and coming off the back; the stitching was loose. Not to mention we didn't find much of anything under $500.

One of my dearest friends is getting married 2 weeks from tomorrow. The other 2 bridesmaids and I ordered our dresses back in December and were assured they would arrive 12 weeks from the time of order. The last dress was ordered December 29th. I called toward the end of March to check on my dress since I needed to make arrangements to get from Tuscaloosa to Tuscumbia for pick up. I was assured at that time the dress would ship on April 13 and arrive at their store in 7 to 10 business days. I called back on April 26th to check on the status of the dress. I was told at that time the that the dresses would be in early this week. I called yesterday and was told the dresses were at the UPS hub in Muscle Shoals and were left off the truck for the delivery and the owner did not have time to go get the dresses. I was assured at that time that the dresses would be in Friday morning and I could pick mine up Saturday with no issue. Friday rolled around and to no ones surprise, the dresses did not arrive. We were again assured the dresses would arrive Monday (less than 2 weeks from the wedding). Call me a skeptic, but I have lost ALL TRUST in this business. We have now come up with a back up plan to have dresses here the week of the wedding from another company. The bride and other 2 bridesmaids have made numerous calls to this business and also been given the run around. Had we not taken matters into our own hands, I am not convinced we would have any dresses for the wedding. I wanted to put this information out there so others can avoid this unnecessary stress and hardship my friends and I have gone through.

Today, surpassed all of my expectations. Today, Mrs. Pat just proved that going above and beyond for something you\u2019re passionate about and loving your customers is what makes businesses like hers successful. Jos A Banks is where John Michael ordered his custom tux for the wedding in early March. Due to the pandemic, their store closed and we were unable to pick it up upon its arrival to the store. Now, the store is closed until May 30th, even though the mall is open and the tuxedo is there; they\u2019re not willing to work with us in order to find a solution to get his custom tux to him, refund our money, or assist us along the way. Last night, after working 12 hours in the ER, around 9:00 pm, I sent a message to Mrs. Pat at Modern Brides. John Michael and I both were so upset. She responded within minutes, welcoming us into her store, and this morning, only 12 hours later: she had taken measurements, allowed him to try on a few tuxedo options, and had a new rental suit ordered that should be here in 1-2 days. Talk about a blessing! Mrs. Pat has been phenomenal! She\u2019s so excellent with customer service, but also just a sweet person. She has extended the offer to other brides, as well. She knows everyone, and everyone loves her because she\u2019s so precious. So, if you find yourself like me, stuck without options due to this crazy time - caterer, photographer, tuxedo rentals - anything to do with your wedding, please contact Mrs. Pat! You will not regret it. I cannot say enough about this sweet, angelic, Godly woman.

Later that day, another bridesmaid called and was told alterations were currently being performed and they would be done soon. Over a week later I called and was told my dress was finished, AND HAD BEEN FINISHED and they were waiting on me to come pick it up. However, no one at that store was gracious enough to give me a phone call letting me know the dress was ready. Other bridesmaids were told their dress was ready when it wasn't; or that their dress was not ready when it was. Alterations were also extremely overpriced for the experience that we had.. Not to mention they looked bad. Please, if you value your sanity, your money, and your relationships with the people in your wedding, DO NOT SHOP HERE, you're better off making your own dress. Heck, a monkey and a sewing machine would probably be less stressful and more helpful.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cb731641629:0xecde2f90485b3aa8"}

The sales staff were wonderful.  When it came time for alterations, which are not included in the price of the wedding gown, was when the problems arose.  They have only one seamstress and it is very difficult to get an appointment for alterations.  We had a family member pick up the wedding gown and maid of honor's dress to save us a three hour trip the week of the wedding.  When the dresses were picked up they were on cheap plastic hangers, like you get at Wal-Mart, and they were in the thin clear plastic bags, the kind dry cleaners use, with a knot tied in the end of the bag.  We were told the nice zipper bags are only used for the short prom dresses.   I guess that they reward you for NOT spending a large amount of money at this boutique.  This sends the message that a prom dress is more important than a wedding dress.  My family member went to another bridal store and purchased a zippered garment bag for my daughter's wedding gown so the cheap bag we were given at Modern Bride wouldn't tear and possibly let dust or something worse damage the wedding gown.  By the way, the garment bag from the other bridal shop only cost us $10, so it can't be the cost of the garment bags that keeps Modern Brides from providing them to the brides purchasing their gown there, after all they do provide them for the much less expensive and short prom dresses they sell there.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cb731641629:0xecde2f90485b3aa8"}

BUT I would absolutely recommend you get your alterations done somewhere else. I was very unhappy after both fittings and was glad I had an aunt there to confirm it was not a good fit even though the owner/seamstress was trying to tell me it was. She was pinning for more alterations trying to assure me it would be better, but I didn't like it with it pinned and was terrified at my 3rd and final fitting I would still hate it. I was about to scrap the whole thing and get a completely different dress (crying over the thought of the cost) when my aunt took me to another tailor who immediately (just by pinning the dress differently) was able to get the dress to fit me MUCH better. Seeing the photos side by side made it apparent Modern Brides was not qualified to be altering wedding dresses (see below for yourself - Left photo Modern Brides pinning; Right photo other seamstress pinning). Unfortunately so much padding was already added by Modern Brides that the new seamstress/tailor could only do so much with the top so it was never a perfect fit and I fretted about it at my wedding and am still noticing the ill-fitting in the wedding photos. Modern Brides was professional about returning SOME of the money on the alterations (as another reviewer mentioned - every time I went in the store there was some new charge on my dress and despite paying it every time I was treated multiple times like I was delinquent) and offered a free cleaning of the dress still, but I needed to post to try to spare others from what I went through. Also, a friend had the same experience just before me and I should have listened and NOT let Modern Brides do my alterations.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKrJZh-qf3QHCmcUriTpRytlIjt2n1-B3NKhxh=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZoyvVOVlVCrNyBdjDQLGo_cglIkDw03MOTqTJ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cb731641629:0xecde2f90485b3aa8"}

I looked everywhere in my area and she couldn't find what she was satisfied with so while reading reviews I noticed that Modern Brides had some good reviews and we decided to go there. The young ladies that showed us the prom dresses were very nice and my daughter got to try on several dresses. While picking out her dress, all workers were as nice and patient as they could possibly be. My daughter did have to have some alterations to her dress and the alterations were very expensive! We started out with a 20% discount off the dress, but every alteration had a price to it. She had to have the length taken off, three layers at $20 per layer! $60 dollars. $20 to take up one strap. Pat, the lady doing the alterations, said it would be done in a couple weeks. After 3 weeks, I had to call and the dress still wasn't finished. When we went to pick up the dress, 1 week later after calling again, the alterations were aweful! It was to short, the strap taken up was to tight, and the chest area was still to big. The front of the dress was crooked and the side without a strap turned under. When I brought all this to Pat's attention, she blamed it on the way the dress was made. Said all the beads on the dress was causing it to turn under. My daughter's prom dress the year before had the same amount, if not more, beads at the top and we didn't have this problem. She charged me $5 more dollars for doing a quick chest take up and when the dress still didn't fit right, she charged $30 more for leaving the dress again so she could take the chest area up right. She wouldn't even take off the $5 I had just paid her for the seam she had just took up! After another week of leaving the dress again, it still wasn't right. The front without a strap was lower than the side with the strap making the front look lopsided! We left with the dress and still had to go purchase body tape and breast push up inserts! Another $30! Be advised that I did read the reviews before purchasing the dress and until I purchased the dress everyone was great, but afterwards, the owner/seamstress was very rude and non-negotiable. Everything she does has a price! So beware before planning a wedding or prom dress affair with this company.

No one ever raised their voice at this customer nor were they mistreated in any way.  They were kindly asked to follow the store policy like every other customer. This customer then left our store after taking up hours of employees\u2019 time, trying on our product, finding her correct size and went on resale sites posting exactly what size she needed and photos of herself in our merchandise in our store trying to find it at a used price. We are a small business trying to succeed after a struggle with Covid and customers like this one are the reason we have store policies in place to try to combat people taking advantage of hard working individuals and businesses."}, "gmap_id": "0x8891ee8623999605:0xd42ceeb5e8ade974"}

The girls got me right back. Shelby was my stylist & she was awesome. I told her exactly what I wanted; which was a dress with sleeves.  I showed her pictures from online & she found all the dresses. I'm a plus size bride so I was scared; I wouldn't have a lot of selections. I was very wrong; they had dresses in stock for any size bride. Shelby found me three great dresses. There was a dress online that had short sleeves. Shelby let me try on the same dress in strapless & told me she could order it for me with sleeves. Shelby explained payment arrangements & credit options to pay for the dress. Shelby broke everything down in detail for me. Which was very helpful for a new bride with a budget. I was very close to ordering that dress. But, I really wanted to try it on with the sleeves. I was so impressed with David's Bridal in Tuscaloosa; I made an appointment the same day at the David's Bridal in Hoover. I was thinking Hoover would have more dresses with sleeves & possibly have that dress with sleeves to try on. That was the worst idea ever. The store in Hoover is a huge disappointment for David's Bridal. The customer service needs to be reviewed at the Hoover store. The employees at that store are very unprofessional. After the bad experience at the Hoover store; I started reading reviews & asking friends. Apparently that is common for the David's Bridal in Hoover. If I decide to order through David's Bridal, it will definitely be with the Tuscaloosa David's Bridal. Great job David's Bridal in Tuscaloosa.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a8363211ca3b:0xc839cac2cd80b238"}

I had a great experience at my first appointment. A very nice, young lady, who was engaged herself, assisted me. She let me try on the dresses I had picked and delivered the style of dresses I was looking for. She was very accommodating to my mother and sister who I had brought with me. We found my dress and I could not have been happier with that first visit. We had a glass of champagne after we decided on it and it was a lovely enjoyable visit.\nThe owner was there and she was helpful and kind as well. When she saw that I was really leaning towards one, she stepped in and let me know what alterations could be made and we ended up changing the neckline a little bit.\nWhen I went to pick up my dress, we had a different experience. In addition to my mother and sister, I brought a couple of friends along to see me in it. I walked in first, and told the lady at the desk that I had an appointment to pick up my dress. She then began to walk back towards the dressing rooms. I didn't follow her at first because 1. she didn't tell me to and 2. my friends and family weren't all inside the shop yet. When I did take a few steps towards where she went, I saw she had turned around and looked annoyed that I had not followed her.\nI put on the dress and she assisted me. After I was in it, I had to ask her if I could go show my friends.\nBy the time I got out and we looked over my dress, my sister and mother had already noticed how unpleasant the girl helping me was. She made us feel like we were a bother to her.\nI enjoyed my first experience tremendously. My second was not so pleasant. The shop is wonderful as long as you do not get the grumpy girl. I wish I had caught her name, but she wasn't friendly enough to tell me and I was too scared of her to ask. I would and do recommend this shop.

However, I felt that the moment I had ordered my dress they didn't care.  It took 10 months for my dress to come in.  I was told it would take up to 9.  When I called to check on it, they said they would let me know.  I had to call 3 different times to see where my dress was.  When I FINALLY got an answer and a new arrival date, they text it to me.  I drove 2 hours from Huntsville, where I live to try my dress on.  It had a 8 foot train and was a wrinkled mess.  I did not feel special trying on my wedding dress.  I didn't even really want to take pictures in it because it was so wrinkled.  When I came back to pick my dress up for my wedding I tried to make an appointment so my maid of honor who was coming from 4 hours away could come with me.  They said no need to call ahead weeks in advance and wouldn't schedule me an appointment.  When my maid of honor and I set a date and I called even days before the recommended \"3 days\" they told me they couldn't get me in.  I had to pick my wedding dress up completely alone.  I reminded them I would like them to make sure my dress was steamed properly so I could actually see what it looked like.  When I arrived for my appointment, they had just started to steam it...I had to sit by myself and waited 45 mins to try on my sort of steamed dress.  It just felt that once they had my money, they couldn't have made my experience less generic and unimportant.  Wish I would have gotten my bridal gown in Nashville where I got my designer bridesmaid dresses.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889163842589e0d:0xadac5917db57ba6"}

Up til yesterday, the alterations hadn't been done. Now you might be thinking \"well, wedding dresses are tricky to fix in a short amount of time..\" , no. It was a simple hem job, and they had six weeks to do it. Six weeks for a simple hem job. And up til yesterday it wasn't done. Fine, alright, you're busy, we get that. But giving her the run around with phonecalls, and promises and then having the audacity to say that my sister is \"hysterical\" and flat out lying about what you've failed to do, and then charging an extra 550$ on a wedding dress that was already paid for, for simple alterations that weren't even done in the allotted amount of time is disgusting. Oh, story's not done yet, they still won't give her the dress.\nSo if you're looking to get married anytime soon, don't go to Bella Couture.

She wasn't familiar with my Georgia venue, so she pulled up my chapel online which really impressed me. That showed me she was serious about helping me find the right dress. Of course I showed her lots of pictures of dresses I had tried on previously and loved. Based on our conversation, she picked about 5-7 beautiful dresses all of which were 9/10s in my book! Each had some aspect I had mentioned to her that I was looking for. Her last pick was my 10/10 and matched my descriptive words I gave her that I wanted in a dress being unique, romantic, and feminine. Meredith listened to everything I wanted and constantly paid attention to how I was feeling in each dress. I can tell she takes her job very seriously and I recommend any woman looking for a dress in the area to visit Bustle.

First of all, when you walk in the doors, the girls working there can\u2019t even put down their phones long enough to greet you or make you feel welcome or actually important like you want my business. Not just one time did this happen but every single time I went in there recently (5+) for a wedding I was a part of. Finally once I promoted then to help measure me for my dress, she totally measured me wrong, so I ended up getting a dress 2 sizes too big. Surprise surprise when I need alterations and it costed me an additional $90. Are you kidding me? That is outrageous.\n\nSo my dress arrives at the shop and I get an obnoxious text that says, \u201cyour dress is ready, you have 7-10 days to come and get it.\u201d Not polite or anything. Not hey, your dress is in, we would love for you to come pick it up as soon as possible or at your earliest convenience. Why so rude? And it\u2019s not just me, every single one of the bridesmaids said the same thing.\n\nDon\u2019t get me started on their alterations lady. I was already mad that I had made the trek to the dress shop to try it on but once I put it on, I said ok way too big can y\u2019all pin it for alterations? Oh no we don\u2019t do that. You have to make a separate appointment with our alterations lady. She\u2019s really busy too so I\u2019m not sure when she can get to you? Um what? So I have to drive over here a separate time for her to pin my dress? You are a dress shop, why don\u2019t yall do that? None of this makes sense to me.\n\nSo I come back to the dress shop to meet the alterations lady, mind you my dress is 2 sizes too big. She looks at my dress and is like on your dress is perfect. Doesn\u2019t need much at all. What? It\u2019s literally falling off of me. Once I prompt her where it needs to be altered, informs me it will be $90. Are you kidding me? That\u2019s a new dress. There was something wrong with every single girl\u2019s dress. Not to mention the bride was having serious anxiety about her alterations bc she had altered a dress previously and it was literally made for a child. Couldn\u2019t fit her leg in the waist. So bride was super anxious about her dress even being correct. One bridesmaid, she hemmed the chiffon but not the under layer. All in all alterations were a mess and not worth the money.\n\nNow let me talk about the tuxedos. What a disaster? Wednesday before the wedding on Saturday, the groomsmen were texted: your tuxedo is in, you have until 5pm to pick it up. This text was sent at 12:55 pm that day. What about the people that work? And not a polite text like: hey, your tux is here, we would like for you to come and try it on ASAP because if there is any issues, we want to handle it before Friday so we can overnight the correct size and get to you by Saturday. Just rude and inconsiderate.\n\nThe grooms shirt was literally made for T-Rex. There were 11 groomsmen. Only about 5 of their shirts fit. And not like oh we can make it work, like completely wrong and look horrible. When the dress shop was told and called, they said oh well the groomsmen can just swap around. What??? Um no. You measured the groomsmen or were given exact sizes, the least you could do would be to get this fixed. Oh and every single one if the groomsmen paid over $200 for this tuxedo that was completely the wrong size including the groom and the junior groomsmen that were both 5 years old. Come on. That\u2019s ridiculous. And most weddings I\u2019ve been in, the shop has given the groom his tux for free, but nope not Cherry Tree. freaking rip off.\n\nNone of the tux\u2019s fit and the groomsmen are scrambling to make it work, one of them puts on his pants, literally 7inches too short. I call Cherry Tree. This is 1pm, the wedding is at 5. She calls me back and says that we will just have to make it work, take the hem out of the pants and go buy some grey socks and hope it blends in. Um what?

Long story short, they ordered me a dress that was not even my size (the dress was HUGE), and I had to go spend over $100 just to get it altered/taken in because the dress was a size and a half too big. The bridal shop tired to tell me that it was the size that I gave with my measurements, but I am an eight, and they gave me a ten. I even measured the dress myself, and the ten that they gave me wasn't even a true ten, it was actually bigger. I told the lady on the phone that (she wasn't the owner), and the lady on the phone would not let me talk to a manager or let me leave my name so she could talk to me. She even told me that she didn't even know when the manager comes and goes from the store...what a joke. There was no refund or another dress offered. The owner even tried telling the bride that this all happened because I did not go to the store location and get measured by them. INCHES are INCHES, and I am NOT about to drive over an hour away to get measured for a dress when a simple phone call should be sufficient. I guess I should consider myself lucky, because according to the bride, the maid of honor was a size 12 or 14, and this bridal shop gave her a 20. A TWENTY. The other bridesmaids had sizing issues with their dresses also. I mean, mistakes will be made, but as a business, they should try to fix the mistakes that they made. I would not recommend this place to ANYONE. They even tried to offer an altering place to get it fixed...and obviously, I would NOT give business to anyone that they felt was worthy after the experience that I had with this bridal shop.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d485de3736e49:0x60d45bb916701c50"}

Well fast forward to now, all events have been canceled. She is a senior, so no need for the dress. Now I'm not a dummy, I know getting the entire deposit back is a long shot, but I figured that I would at least get half, because after all I have not purchased the dress, just made a deposit, and the dress is still at the store..right?... WRONG!  Not only am I informed of the policy of no refund and all sales being final, but I am told I can either purchase the dress, or use the store credit..that expires in 6 month!!!! I'm livid..this pandemic is beyond my control. I understand that it's a business, but how does a deposit to reserve.a dress qualify as a sale, when I do not have possession of the dress?

The paper work that you signed at the beginning of your service, explains that if you are unsatisfied with your hair, your stylist will be more than happy to come up with an arrangement to get your hair where you would like it to be. We truly wish you would have come to us first so we could evaluate your hair and make it right for you without the additional costs of another salon. We have offered for you to come in and have us take a look at your hair to evaluate the situation, and we are sorry that you did not want to come in to work this out. Unfortunately, due to the time your stylist spent with you, product used, and not having the opportunity to evaluate your hair in person, we are unable to refund you for this service. Upon reviewing your paper work, your stylist noted that your hair would need more than one service to achieve the end results that you were wanting. This is due to the fact that your hair was already previously lightened at home before your visit to us. We are always striving for what's best for our clients. In this circumstance, your hair wouldn't be able to handle any further lightening in one visit. It is our understanding that in order to protect the integrity of your hair, you and your stylist decided to go with a darker blonde until your next service. We aren't quite sure what happened between the time you left the salon and now, but after your service you told us that you loved your hair and even booked your future reservation with us. We deeply value you as a customer of ours and we are sorry to see you go. We appreciate your review and we hope you have a wonderful day."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a61f96ea20655:0x14238b725edd250"}

The owner Donna wouldn\u2019t leave us alone while trying to find a dress, she would hover over your shoulder telling you she would take the dresses to the back for you multiple times while just trying to find what you like. Literally she watched us like a hawk didn\u2019t let us breathe.  She also accused my family of trying to steal from her store all because she thought we had more than 5 dresses in the dressing room (when we did not, we had 2) she took all of our dresses to and from the dressing room and then tried to say she didn\u2019t. No offense but, how do you walk out of a store with a huge prom dress when you have no purse or anything because she doesn\u2019t even allow you to bring your purse inside AND while she is breathing down your neck the entire time???? She is not afraid to tell you that something won\u2019t look right on you when it\u2019s not her dress to wear. She also tells people to get out because it overwhelms her when too many people are in her store as they are walking in... heard her tell multiple people this while in her store. Just overall VERY RUDE and I would NOT suggest wasting your time on such a horrible place to shop. Very VERY disappointed in such unprofessionalism.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a43a6a5caf4fb:0x5b50fbb6e349d8d0"}
