I told him I would rather look around for another computer and I would like to pick up my computer. He told me come on by and pick it up the following day. A few days later I decided to pull it apart and see how detailed the work was. As I took it apart I noticed there was no hard drive in it. I called Shawn as he proceeded to say that that happens sometimes and his kid must have forgot to put it back in when they were looking for the issue. Additionally I found the part on eBay new for less than 20 dolllars.

Steven doesn't seem terribly concerned about checking the status until I show up in front of him. There is no response to my texts and certainly no pro-active checking on his part.

I have always been treated very well from them so, NO I did not want to change. After a while of thinking about it SEVERAL MONTHS and my Son hammering me with the RJ YOUNG name, I did it. I purchased a machine from RJ YOUNG.\nAt first I was skeptical and to be honest I really didn't want to give it a chance (The Machine), but I did and after several months and barely using the machine I starting coming more around it and using it a little more & more. Then I began to really like it because it really printed so nice and pretty fast. It only took me  8 to 10 months to like it but you have to understand I WAS A XEROX Man and I thought there was NOTHING out there but Xerox. The Xerox machine has ALWAYS  performed outstanding and the SERVICE was the best, I was spoiled from that. However, I found out that there was more out there than XEROX! I found out that RJ YOUNG was REAL and believe me they have made a believer out of me. The Service that I thought would not compare to XEROX, has showed me they are just as good and if not BETTER. I never thought I would say that but it is so true. I can not believe how fast the Service Technicians reply to the service calls. They are always polite, and get me back up and running in a very quickly manner. They have such good personalities and a smile! As for the Ladies at the Home Office, Oh My How can you NOT like them. They are AMAZING. They always tell me they will have my supplies on the way or a Technician asap. IT IS JUST SO HARD TO PUT IN WORDS what RJ Young has done for my business. This is a very caring company and to be honest I am so glad that I have some of their product and that I was introduced to the World outside of XEROX. RICO machines have made my life SO MUCH Better and I am so happy that I have changed.

He took the phone and came back in 10 minutes and said your phone is crashed. There is no way to recover the data and he could not even restore back to factory settings so maybe I could recover some data from I cloud.I was devastated to say the least.I do not own a computer but I do have an iPad ( old too ) .I found this place and Austin was very helpful, friendly, professional and seemed to really want to help me.He tried about 4 or more times to restore my phone so I could recover my precious data. He was not giving up, he had the knowledge to see the phone had potential to restore from the computer by the way it was trying to reconnect . I recommend everyone if anyone can fix your phone this guy Austin will if possible. He was so nice and really determined to help me.The price was very reasonable and the customer service was outstanding. I will tell everyone about this place, and the geek squad is a joke.They are a bunch of young kids who are just running around with their nose up in the air like they know it all.They definetly do not know much about Apple Products and how the I cloud stores you info.

Told them exactly what (SPSPECIFICALLY AN INTEL PROCESSOR, expandable RAM, motherboards, lcd screen,) I had and they told me to come on. I went to probably irritating lengths to confirm that they bought these highly specific parts. In retrospect, I thought the name,odd, but after a long day didnt put the \"mac\" portion together....or I'd have asked SPECIFICALLY if they bought non-mac items. So,  I drove out from Theodore during rush hour....and they declined everything because it wasnt MAC (wed discussed what I had, mind you) and because they couldn't test board soldered parts.... He said that in refereme to RAM memory chips, a desktop cpu, and my 500gb hard drives...they only take solid state now, he said. And so on, and so on...\n\nI dunno what the game they were playing was, but I think experimac owes me a half tank of gas and an appology. Take the gas from the guy's paycheck (if you're paying guys who think UPGRADABLE RAM is soldered to the board, anyway.

I'm wondering if THAT is in the fact Cosmo you speak of. In which case, he didnt do anything then, so I dont believe hed do anything NOW. I dont believe your store would have poated a response at all, if not for the star by my name.\n\nYou intentionally ignored my suggestion of gas compensation, and while your words are very well put together to give the impression of being amicable....the previous young mans words were pretty enough to get me out there.

Drove 45 miles to their store was told it'd be $300.00 just for parts.  Found another place that fixed it for $85.00 in 45 minutes. I hate being lied to to get business.\nEdit for reply:\nMy wife called Tuesday 1/5/21 and told whoever answered the phone, after telling them my issue (power button on my Samsung Galaxy S10 plus fell off). She was told that it wouldn't be a problem and no appointment needed that it'd be $79.00. As I mentioned before I live 45 miles away, I had to leave work early to make sure I had ample time to get there and to get service.\nYes, you are correct,  there was not a record or service ticket made because the guy there looked at my phone said that I'd have to leave it and that the parts would be $300.00 because the board would have to be changed out that the button was all one unit. I value my time and money as much as everyone else and I left without your service. Yes, I do feel like the initial phone call was a bait and switch just to get someone in the store. You know that $19.99 oil change costs $500 because you need tires,wipers, injector cleaning and \"blinker fluid\". It's just strange that my wife was told one thing and I was told another. I called another shop  told them exactly what was wrong, they said same thing. No problem, no appointment needed.  Took phone, they looked at it and the fixed it for the amount quoted.\nFunny thing that one shop said one thing and the other one did it.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1610116073880, "text": "Jason, I cannot find a repair ticket or record of your name, are you sure you have the right place? If so, I would like to reach out to you to find out what happened, as we do not give bogus pricing to obtain business. Mistakes do happen and if this indeed did happen, I'd love the chance to make it right!\n\nWe have a proven track record of being transparent throughout our entire repair process and we pride ourselves on having some of the best pricing in the industry. I especially appreciate this review because it gives me a chance to explain our repair process.\n\nBefore I start, i'd like to point out one thing, there is a giant discrepancy between $80.00 and $300.00. The only phone parts that cost this much are some of the Genuine Samsung Display Assemblies. If another shop was able to resolve this for $85.00, it was a small part repair, like a charging port or proxy sensor, for example. (If parts were needed.) My point is, our prices would have been comparable.\n\nWhen a customer calls in to obtain a price on a particular repair we do our best to go over the details of the problem or issue they are experiencing. If we are confident we know the solution to the issue at hand, we then will give you a price or at least a ballpark figure, so they know what to expect. If we are unsure what the solution is to the issue, we will ask you to bring the device in to be diagnosed, before giving you a price on the repair.\n\nThe Process.\n\n1. Once you come into our office, we go over the details of the issue you are experiencing with your device. We will then go over repair solutions or inform you that it will need further diagnostics to obtain the solution to the issue.\n\n2. We then obtain all your contact information and create you a ticket. We may at this time give you a price on the repair. Below are a couple normal situations.\n\n*Lets go over a couple examples, an iPhone 8, the screen is damaged, everything else on the device is working as intended (we verify this,) we give you a price on the display assembly replacement and an ETA for expected completion.\n\n*Now, lets say its a Gaming Computer, it is randomly turning off or blue screening. We will not know what the issue is without diagnosing all the hardware. In this situation, we will inform you that we will need to perform additional diagnostics to know what it will take to repair this device.\n\n3. Once we have obtained the device, we then will start the diagnostics or repair in the order that it came in. We have other repairs in front of new repairs. Your device will go into the queue and will be worked on when its ticket is next. There are two exceptions to this. Most phone screen repairs, if we have the parts on hand (which we do for all iPhones and some Samsungs,) are completed in an hour or less. (Time will vary depending on the particular repair.) The other exception is, we offer a rush service, this service is paid at the time of when you drop off the device. This is paid to have the device worked on immediately, otherwise tickets are worked on in the order they are received.\n\n4. Once the repair or diagnosis is completed, we then will email, text, and/or call you, to go over any final or further details.\n\n5. Pick up your device and pay for the repairs. Once a repair is completed you can come by and pick up your device at your convenience. We also offer payment options, you can pay in person with cash or card, or you can pay your invoice through our online portal.\n\n**One quick notes, due to COVID-19, we are not allowing our customers to wait on repairs in the lobby. They must either drop them off, wait in the their car, or outside of the building.\n\nJason, thank you for allowing us to go over this process with you and potential customers that may be reading this. Feel free to reach out to me, Clint Silver, owner at ProTek. I would love to know what happened and would love the opportunity to make it right. Thank you and as always, thanks for choosing ProTek!"}, "gmap_id": "0x886268c27f02ac7b:0xf37cf7fc81bd790a"}

I debated leaving this review because I know how harmful bad reviews can be to a small business. Unfortunately, my experience with ProTek was so disappointing I felt obligated to share.\nWhen replacing my screen ProTek compromised the integrity of my water resistant IPhone XS causing it to be hyper sensitive to moisture. This resulted in my phone being corroded by light water exposure only 3days after the iPhone repair. ProTek then refused to refund me the 200$ for the faulty screen replacement which essentially destroyed my 1000$ phone. Let me be clear that my IPhone had been exposed to water on previous occasions to the screen replacement with no issues. ProTek even assured me that there was no water damage prior to the screen replacement. I had expected to have a better experience with ProTek because I had confidence in their customer reviews. Sadly, I have to say I was dissatisfied with their services. At the very least I hope others will take my experience with ProTek into consideration and proceed with caution in regards to ProTek\u2019s remarkable ineptitude with apple products.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1589823914117, "text": "I am very disappointed by this review, i'll explain why. Unfortunately for phones, we are in the warmer months and people like to be on the water and when you're on the water, these type of things will happen. I want to start off by saying that we repair and/or recover data from thousands of water damage devices. When you first brought the iPhone in for a screen replacement it was because you left the iPhone in the rain and it ruined the screen. (We informed the customer that the screen was the only thing damaged by the rain.) We replaced the screen and put a new screen seal on it, (as we do with all repairs.) The phone then came back with standing water inside the device, this amount of water is concurrent with other phones we see that have been submerged into water. The customer asked for a warranty on the screen, unfortunately we cannot warranty water or physical damage. (Simply putting a new screen on this iPhone would not resolve the issue, given the current condition.) In a case like this, with standing water inside the device, we would need to let the water dry (we have tools to speed this process up.) After the water has dried, it will leave corrosion behind, which will need to be cleaned. We would then remove the logic board from the iPhone housing, clean it with our Sonic Cleaner, and then test the device for further component damage. We then would replace the components needed to repair the device. More than likely we could have saved this customers phone, had the customer let us complete the water damage assessment on this device.\n\nPlease remember that iPhone's are not water proof, they are water resistant, and each iPhone has its own water resistance rating. We have seen water damage happen in pretty much every way, from being in your pocket and sweating, to being on the bathroom counter while taking a shower, and to drops in the ocean. Each iPhone handles each exposure differently, because in each exposure, the conditions are different. If you are going to be around water, buy a water proof bag, put your phone into the bag and use it from the outside the bag, only to remove it if you need to make a phone call. This will drastically minimize the chance of water damage. I hope this reply has answered any questions as to how we handle water damaged phones here at ProTek. If you have any questions, concerns, or just want some friendly advice, feel free to contact us at your convenience!"}, "gmap_id": "0x886268c27f02ac7b:0xf37cf7fc81bd790a"}

My M.2 SSD work hard drive crashed, and after my own IT dep't couldn't fix it, I took it in and it was ALL recovered!  Losing data is very stressful, and these guys were very good at explaining everything.  They returned my call promptly, reminded me that they close at 7pm and were not trying to rush me into seeing them the next day, and offered to assess my hard drive w/out charging me.  In about 5 minutes he came back and said it was all there, and then explained the difference between the $150 cost, and the $300 cost.  basically if I wanted 40GB of files in one folder, it was $150.  if I wanted it to look like it did (folder structure) before the crash, it woudl take more time and therefore $300.  Best extra $150 I have ever spent!  They found info from several previous users, which I'm sure my IT dep't will be thrilled with, lol.  They were great to communicate with, no suprises, met all my expectations, and delivered.  I will go back to them ANY time I need something recovered (or break my phone - didn't even know they fixed phones).

But then I realize I need documents that were stored locally on the old laptop. So searching the internet, I find ProTek. I call and they tell me they can recover my  data.\n\nSo I bring my old laptop and then they say, hey, can we try and fix it? Sure, I say. One week later, they've fixed my laptop, and it's up and running for less then what I paid for a new laptop!\n\nFantastic work!
