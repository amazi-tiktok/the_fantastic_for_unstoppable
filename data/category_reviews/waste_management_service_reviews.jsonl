I called no less than 20 times over the course of a day to FINALLY get a very aggravated woman on the phone who said our service would not be started. A week later and we have their can sitting in our front yard with, once again, no communication for them to come pick it up. We\u2019re so glad that our current trash provider was understanding and made sure to not change our current service. Don\u2019t. Waste. Your. Time.

They go door to door (even when told not to or when people have no soliciting signs in their yard) and tell people they'll pick up twice a week, which if you look at their website for 2 seconds, they only pick up once a week everywhere else. Seems like an obvious ploy just to get people to switch. Don't buy into the shady sales tactics. I've heard of them pre-filling out their cancellation cards before, and even saying that they'll send out the cancellation cards for you causing people to literally be afraid this company is going to try to cancel their other garbage pickup service. I know on the surface an *initially* cheaper and *initially* more frequent garbage service that's coming into town may seem attractive, but remember to stop and think about what they stand to gain from you, and to research if they actually hold up what they promise in other areas. There's a reason that certain companies in this area have been around for literally 5 decades, and it was done by building a clientele through RELIABLE, FAIR PRICING slowly instead of lying to people about services / going door to door price gouging other companies until they raise the prices after those companies go out of business.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fb390038f77:0xfdf085053b546d73"}

I canceled on Monday June 10. I was told they wouldn\u2019t cash the check they were given and they\u2019d send it back. Surprise!! They cashed it and after almost a month of the runaround from calling I was just told \u201cthey\u2019ll issue the checks by the end of the month\u201d.

When I needed to extend the rental past 1 week just a bit, owner graciously worked with me with zero hassle. After pickup, they cleaned so you could not even tell there was a bin.

Drew one of the sales guys made up stories about the situation, told my tenant I had told him things when I hadn't even talked to the guy yet and told two different things ones to me and my tenant .I asked Drew why he did this and let him know I would be calling the office and  he proceeded to call my tenant a couple of times and send me a  6 page text over the situation which I found very unprofessional . When I called to complain about this Jacob the owners son took  up for the actions, was rude to me, did not listen to me and acted like I was bothering him.I was told my cabinets needed replaced when they did not. They pulled the vanity out of my master bathroom that did not need pulled out to begin with  without cutting the caulk and when they pulled the vanity it caused the mirror in the bathroom to fall on the sink shattering my mirror and busting my sink in the bathroom and tried to blame it on the heat in the room.I called  David the head of the construction department several times asking a start date and was told no repairs would be started  until they had 18 thousand upfront, Half the cost, and to ask my adjuster to call  his cooperate office and have Fed Ex deliver it to them.I asked my adjuster about it and he said that they did not that money upfront and was beyond shocked I had been told that.They still have their little lock box on my door a week after I told them I will not be using their services anymore, I have called four times to ask to have removed.I have called and asked  three times to speak to the owner of the franchise and got no response. The office staff is not friendly, they have horrible attitudes and make you feel  brushed off.  Brandy the girl in the office is very rude and  blows me off and acts like I'm a bother to her when I call to ask to speak to a manager or owner  . This is the most unprofessional company I have ever came into contact with in my life. And I strongly suggest people think  twice before using them for any reason. You will regret it if you  use this company, trust me on that.They thought since it was an insurance claim they would  take me for a run and rob me and  my insurance company blind and have caused me nothing  but a headache and  added stress from what happened to my home.\n\nChelsea\ndon't know how to reply to you  but this way.

But then everything got very confusing. We didn't know what was going to happen or when. Then they came in and packed all of our things up, first our clothes and no one told us to keep out any clothes. So we had no clothes blankets or pillows by the time they finished. There was 2 rooms that just had to be cleaned but they threw out our beds and furniture and took out all the carpet. We put notes on two closets and put don't enter.. I found the notes in the floor when we returned. They packed up everything and took it with them but nothing was cleaned it was just in the box they had packed it in.\nThey told us they we're going to clean the duck work, it was not cleaned, the ceiling fans were not cleaned nor were the blinds. We have had to just  about replace everything  we own plus we had use or own  money to eat at the hotel for   for over 2 months. Being nice is great but we had to many people telling us different things..it took a month after we got to come home before they started bring things back. It made difficult to cook. We had to buy new pots just fry an egg.\nWhen they finally brought things back they were very confused about everything because the young guy and 3 woman that packed us up were fired. They didn't seem to know what was ours and what wasn't.  There are quite a few things missing.  Some of the items are antique and can't be replaced.  The thing is these items problem  went to someone else  and they just saw it was old and not there's. Maybe I need to go check the thrift store.  I didn't think this was going to be easy but this has been a nightmare. I have items that have tags on them, but they didn't take them or clean them. My blinds still have soot on them and it is not easy to clean. They we're supposed to clean and check or duct work , not even touched. And we saw the check our insurance sent them and that was way too much for this mess.

{"user_id": "115504932104850664042", "name": "David Solomon", "time": 1482943464951, "rating": 1.0, "text": "For this review, I feel I must first present a little information up front.\nFor the last several months I have been having issues with the plumbing in my house.  My house was built in 2007 with PVC pipe throughout.  Let\u2019s just first say that after purchasing the home I later believed the plumbing was not installed to code, and first experienced several water leaks of which I fixed myself.\n\nSeveral months ago I hired a plumber to come in and resolve a hot water (lack of) issue.  The Hot water tank had made an awful screeching noise similar to what I have been hearing in my modern GE Refrigerator with a water filter. At the time the plumber removed a check valve on the water Heater which resolved my Hot water problem and the screeching noise.  No further investigation was conducted on why the Hot water heater started having issues and I believe that repair cost me around $100.00.\nSo in the last couple of months I have still have that screeching with my Refrigerator and the pipes had been banging whenever we flushed one of the toilets.  Upon doing some research to try and resolve the banging pipe issues I had come across an article on a thermal expansion tank upstream from the Hot Water Heater on the Cold water line.  I located mine under the house just as the main cold water line comes in the house. The tank has a valve in it and is supposed to give a cushion for the water when it expands.  I went to check the expansion tank and when I put on an air tester, water came out, which is an indication of a faulty tank.  I purchased a new one and left the air pressure at the manufacture default and installed it.  Now my pipes started banging worse and the tank started making a sucking sound. I further researched the issue and found an article that too much water pressure can wreak havoc on your water system so I went to Lowe\u2019s and picked up a cheap home water pressure gauge. I tested my system and found that my home was averaging around 130PSI. Based on this information resources indicated that a faulty Pressure Relief Valve (PRV) just up from the home water meter could be the culprit. I located mine by digging about a foot up from the local water meter and left it uncovered.\nIt was finally time for me to call a plumber as I am not one, and only completed the previous steps out of necessity.  I am a retired Enlisted Veteran and have not had a real job for six years and have been struggling to pay my bills.\n\nThe day before Christmas I called B & C Plumbing Inc. and left message on their phone system that I would be needing their services when they could work me in.  Tuesday after Christmas I received a courteous phone call from the B& C customer service and scheduled a Master Plumber to arrive at my home between 14:00 \u2013 16:00. Shortly after that Drew the Master Plumber called me from his cell phone and said he was on his way over because he had a cancellation and would come and resolve the issue.\n\nThis is where the negative experience starts.  Drew arrived at my front door knowing the information that I had already shared previously and I shared that information with him again on what my issue was going on under the house.  His first statement to me before looking at anything was that it was going to cost me $300.00. No indication of a discount for anything or because I was a Military Vet.  Now first off, I expected that he would be crawling under my home and fix some of the issues with the bagging pipes (Non-Code meeting).  He had no time to give me a run down on what the problem was nor what it the cost layout was to fix my issues.\n\nHe proceeded to place a water pressure gauge on the outside faucet and recorded that the PSI was 145. He then went to the Pressure Relief Valve (PRV) and replaced it spending less than two hours of actual time far less work as much of the time was him on the Cell phone.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1487948819020, "text": "Mr. Solomon, in response to your review I would like to apologize for your unsatisfactory experience with our company.

For two weeks, we checked every\nday, no workmen.  We were assured we would be back in by Christmas.  We went through three Project Managers, and\nthree different set of drywall and painters.  The first painting crew stood on my washer and dryer to paint the\nceiling in the laundry leaving dents and scratches.  We had stored the liquor from our bar in tubs in the garage,\nas Servpro would not remove alcohol from the home.  Apparently the painters had found it and consumed a great deal\nbefore they were removed from the job by Darin Ingle.  They also got paint all over our floors so Servpro brought\nin commercial scrubbers which removed the finish on all of our floors.\n\nTo shorten this story, I will cut to the return home.  We finally returned to our home in early March with work still\ngoing on, Painting and damaged floors. The first night home the water under the sink of my brand new cabinets\nflooded the kitchen.  They had to send in dryers and a plumber who said it was not hooked up correctly and\nreworked all of the kitchen dishwasher and sink plumbing. They sent in a professional flooring company  to assess\nthe floors. Their solution required us to move back into a hotel for at least a week so they could clean, reseal\nthe tile and recolor the grout.\n\nThe only thing that saved this project was Darin Ingle who arrived on the project in February.  Darin was sent in from another state to resolve the\nproblems at the Montgomery location that included our home.  Darin took the reins, brought in new crews and came\nevery day to ensure the work got back on track and that it was done correctly.  Darin's arrival was months into\nthe project and while we have never sued anyone, we were on the verge of doing just that to get another company\nto come in so we could go home.  I am not sure if Servpro's executives realize that Darin not only saved our project,\nsaved them from a lawsuit but did an amazing job saving their reputation.  I would only call them again if Darin Ingle handled the job.\nBecause of Darin, I am giving Servpro a 2 star rating and Darin a 5.\n\nAn update to my review.  I was contacted by Mr. Bowen, an owner.  Mr. Bowen was determined to do something to do something for All we had been through.  He offered to send in a crew or something.  While his offer was appreciated, we had already fixed many of the issues and did not feel we could ensure another work crew I agreed to think it over and get back with him.  The one thing, as I explained to him, that distressed me everytime I went into the laundry was the dents and scratches on the tops of the washer and dryer which he eagerly agreed to replace.  With much of manufacturing shut down for long periods, appliances are in short supply.  However, Mr. Bowen and Darin Ingle were able to replace order And have new ones installed.  My frustration is no longer renewed when I walk into my laundry room.  My thanks to Mr. Bowen for reaching out and making this a better experience, and to Darin Ingle for making it happen.  It is good to know they cared to make things better.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1600260211243, "text": "Hi Judy, I am one of the owners and I am terribly sorry to hear about your experience.

Their employees are inexperienced, clumsy, and unable to handle simple problems. If you have an issue, you will be directed to some call center down in Tampa, FL, who are absolutely incompetent as well. The Call Center can, and will only, call the local franchise owner to express your complaint. This franchise owner, never reaches out to his customers, despite the fact that my wife and I both got his cell phone number and left numerous messages.\n\nNow on to what actually happened.\n\nMy wife's parents recently moved and we needed to move her piano out of their house, so we hired College Hunks to move the piano. We expressly told them that it was to move a piano and that was the only thing that needed to be moved.\n\nThe scheduled day approaches. They said they would be there at 4:30. When 5:30 eventually rolled around, so did they. ((Strike One))\n\nThey then moved the piano out of the house and down the first step for a total of about 15 feet. Then for some inexplicable reason, could not move it any further. Not only that, but it was ONLY THEN that they realized that they had no way of getting the piano up on their truck. So they came to a job knowing that they were going to move a piano without the proper equipment and without enough people.\n\nThen comes the worst part of all. Instead of moving the Piano back inside where they originally moved it from. THEY LEFT IT OUTSIDE!\n\nThey Left the damn piano and said that they would be back tomorrow!\n\nWait, it gets better.....\n\nThe next day rolls around and again they say they will be there between 3:30 and 4:30. Well, 5:30 comes and goes and still no word from these stooges. That is when my wife and I started calling that call center and reaching out to the Franchise Owner and even the guy driving the truck.\n\nThey said they were running late and would be there at 6:30. We then asked them if they had a different truck or additional equipment. They told us what they were bringing and IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAD THE DAY BEFORE.\n\n7:00 PM comes along and still no word. We call that Call Center again, and this time they tell us that they had to reschedule and that they would be there the following day, which would have left this piano OUTSIDE for TWO Days!\n\nI finally had enough of these inept morons and called up someone who also owned a moving service. He was able to get out to the house the following morning and move the thing in less than an hour.\n\nTo sum up:\n\nThis company absolutely sucks. Incompetent Employees + Incompetent Ownership and Service. They left my wife's piano OUTSIDE for TWO Days before we finally had enough of their nonsense and hired another company.\n\nI will never use College Hunks again, nor will anyone that I know.\n\nAfter I am done with this review, I will actually be looking into filing a claim against these morons for the scratches that they also put on the piano during their re-enactment of a Monty Python Sketch.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjMMa7LkPZKbI4_q-0AA5lPjSfFBVVIL6CoI2f=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8oJEZPtCRlBvWJ52jF5l2hUQNTZ3NRB06feEh=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCW8NgNglF_OtX0HNlGIbtt_Ssdg7udlz9XPMz=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891ec334a7d1c7:0xd295fc628abd4f5c"}

In fact, I had to hire a random Uber driver to help move things so I can get out an hour early to make my flight which the owner and manager is new prior to the move, but did not care.  They talk a good game, but cannot walk the walk.  Be wary of all these excellent reviews, if you look on Yelp you will see true reviews.

The worker picked up and proceeded to have an extremely unprofessional conversation with me about how he and his fellow worker were overbooked, and how they only have three trucks, and that he was still working at another job, and he was way on the other side of the county, and then refused to give me any sort of ETA (basically, he'll be here when he gets here). All the while, the other worker is repeatedly screaming \"tell her to call customer service\" in a rude tone in the background! Over an hour goes by after that, it was dark and cold by then, so I finally called and told them don't bother, if they even intended to ever come. So, after everything, I was left without several pieces of my furniture, including my bed, dresser, and chest of drawers. Now, I am just waiting until next weekend, until I can get another company to come out and help. Needless to say, I would not recommend this company to anyone.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891ec334a7d1c7:0xd295fc628abd4f5c"}

The people answering the phone are always nice to deal with but they do not seem to have the power to get the service done when the drivers fail to pick up. As an example, last week, they missed the Wednesday pick up. I figured it was because of the Veteran's Day so did not call until they failed to pick up again on Thursday. Called again on Friday. They promised a \"work order\" for Monday. Well, today is Tuesday and no pick up yet. Since tomorrow is the regular pick up, I'll again get the bin to the curb before sundown tonight. That is to be ready in case the pick up is before the normal 11AM or so. Have been reimbursed for no pickups and that is OK. But we need to have more dependable service. The normal reason for skipped pickups is that a \"new driver  missed us\". So maybe is bad training and not bad service. Works out the same from our point of view. Once the service gets OK, it stays OK for a while, maybe months. Sorry about the review but you asked during a time when my garbage has not been picked up for a week. Last period of time when this happened, had to call Better Business bureau to get it to resume. There, I've vented.

We knew it would be costly since the ice maker needed replacing (we figured that) but the estimate they gave us and the estimate we had guessed was the same! No worries about being overcharged, ever. These guys are prompt and so courteous.\n\nWe will always call Riviera for our appliance repair needs. Thanks guys!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0e0d2a3444cb:0x8ecddf4ec0b22777"}

Been paying for their premium internet service which  is supposed to be 40.  Since the date it was connected, November 14th,  I have been lucky to get around 14-20 mbs and not the 40 I'm paying for.  I have tried numerous times to get this problem corrected.  Technical support advised me that there were \"upgrades being made\" which I was later informed that was a lie and evidently used just to appease me.  I've since called back numerous times and left messages which are rarely returned.\nI actually had one lady transfer me around and when I kept getting transferred back to her she sent me right back to their internet help department which I had already spoken to thanks to numerous times for several hours total.  Their internet help department apologized and transferred me back to her and the phones had been switched off saying that they were closed.  After successfully giving me the runaround for nearly 30 minutes she was able to just switch the phone off and be on her merry way.   I left Century Link due to poor internet speed and piss poor customer service.  It appears Riviera isn't much better.  I understand things happen with technological items and speeds vary.  But to never get the speed I'm paying for and to constantly get the run around when trying to get the problem fixed is unacceptable.  If only Mediacom serviced my area.
