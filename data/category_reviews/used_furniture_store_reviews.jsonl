I went to the store, after trying to get the very older gentlemen and very older woman to understand what a slide-in electric oven is, to get a replacement part for my glass oven door, the older gentleman couldn't comprehend what I was saying and hung up on me 2x, verbally thinking I was making up stuff on the phone. Hoping that I could find someone possibly younger that works there that understood what I was talking about, I later took the specs, make, and model of the oven/oven door with me, to assist with possibly finding a glass oven door. This place is like a junk yard for appliances, so I thought surely they may have what I needed or something close. Maybe my experience would be better in person with tangible pictures and info to assist with what I needed. Unfortunately, the older gentleman proceeds to take the info I came with stating that he needed it to help locate what he may had amongst the numerous ovens located on site, yet he will just order it for me online. I mentioned to him I could personally order it online, yet wanted to see if they had something onsite instead. I also wanted to patronize a local business if I could. Anyways once he found the info, he told me he could get it in (order it) within a few days and I needed to put something on it before ordering (aka a deposit). I reminded him that I stated I could personally order it online yet asked if he had anything on site. The older gentleman then became very irate and rude. He started making off the wall comments about how I broke my oven door, and other rude comments as if he knew me personally. Very unprofessional to say the least. Cats were coming in and out of the store and they all over the countertops where we were. I felt like it was time to go. It was my mistake for trying to shop in this county. A simple yes or no, or I cannot or would not look outside would have sufficed. I am unsure as to how these older people are operating this business with lack of knowledge of up-to-date appliances (told 2x I was playing on the phone when I stated I had a kenmore electric slide in range) and how are they operating with very poor customer service. Regardless of who they know to operate here in this good ole boy town, they are a poor representation for how the business looks very close to restaurants and to their customer service.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ec7a4853126a9:0xad05bdc23b523fd9"}
