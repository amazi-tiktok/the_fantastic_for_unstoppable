It is the Buyers responsibility to obtain a copy of the covenants for a neighborhood and to understand them before purchasing.  The Realtor typically provides these to the Buyer.  Once we are made aware of the purchase and the new owners contact information, we send a welcome packet in the mail that includes the covenants.  We also provide an Owner Portal that has all of the Association documents for owner to access.  Spaces is not \"pocketing money from everyone\".  Spaces is paid a set Management Fee by the Association to handle all of the management and administrative tasks for the Association to operate.  This includes paying all Association bills, working with and overseeing vendors, answering Owner, Realtor, lender, and closing attorney questions, creating financials statements, reconciling the bank accounts, administering quarterly and annual meetings, etc.  The annual budget is set by the Board of Directors and is then presented to all Owners to vote to ratify at the Annual Members Meeting.  Spaces then operates the Association within that budget for the year.  Spaces provides regular financial statements to the Board, and approved financial statements are available to all Owners.  We understand that some people do not value the benefits of having restrictive covenants and a managed community, but most people do. For those who do not want restrictive covenants where they live, we recommend looking for homes located in the county or finding a neighborhood that does not have restrictive covenants."}, "gmap_id": "0x8888a83230c148df:0xaac2293f184926e6"}

We did not write them, but they do create a fiduciary responsibility for the Board to make sure they are enforced, which is what we are hired to do.  We cannot speak to how the Association was operated previously, but a primary reason we are hired is to provide covenant enforcement for Associations.  If someone is considering purchasing a home in an Association we manage, they can expect an Association that operates within the budget set by the Board of Directors and ratified by the Members.  They can also expect the restrictive covenants to be enforced in a fair and compassionate way.  We always send a friendly letter for each first time violation to make the owner aware of the covenant violation and provide a timeframe to correct the violation.  This friendly letter results in 95 percent of the violations being corrected.  In the cases where the violation is not corrected, we do have a set policy that is equally enforced to bring the property into compliance.  The majority of violation letters we send are a result of a neighbor reporting the violation to us for enforcement.  By having a set system, it allows neighbors to be neighbors without having to get into demanding compliance with restrictive covenants.  We facilitate that process for the Board and neighbors.

Whenever I was in town or moved out and tried to call them, they never pick up the phone!!! I moved out of town in July then received a bill in September, with a service that I never used. I tried to call several times, never get answered. I also emailed, no answer as well. They are doing a fair job at maintenance.\nAnother thing that happened when I moved out was all the UHauls were gone during that week, so I asked the main office if I could have a grace period for one day. The premise for me to ask this was my roommate is still leasing the apartment, and she has not found the new roommate yet. I assumed, if she agrees, then I should be good. I went to talk to the main office, the front desk told me to talk to the office at the Midtown apartment. I went there, the lady rejected my proposal and said they will have vendors checking my room right on the day I moved out and through my stuff out even if I have my roommate's permission to place them in the living room. So, I ran crazy for that week looking for moving trucks and finally moved out on time (actually two days in advance). I returned the keys and everything to the main office and told my story. Another lady, seems like the manager or some management-level person told me a totally different answer. She said if my roommate is keeping renting the apartment and agree to let me put my stuff in there, I could have the grace period!!! This is nuts! I was so upset for that day but decided to not give a bad review on Google review. This time, I really cannot. It is not about money, it is their attitude.\n\nUpdated\n\nAround an hour than I left the one star review, they responded and someone finally answered the call. The answer I got for the charge is because of the wreath we had on the door\ud83d\ude44\ufe0fso I told them that is not trash, that is what we used to place outside as decoration. Since my roommate is still living in there, it should not count as something I left not as trash. The new manager of the office said she had no other answer for my question other than I have to pay the \u201creasonable\u201d charge. Oh, the most incredible thing for this management company is they will change the detail of the lease without notifying. Since I am moving out of the town and my roommate will stay, she renewed the lease. When we started to lease the apartment, we get told that we are only leasing our own room (we were paired up by the management company), which means we do not have to lease the whole apartment if we cannot find a roommate. After two years of leasing, our contract have never changed. However, they changed it this year without any notification, and my roommate did not look through carefully so she rent the whole apartment. This is the reason why I thought I should be ok to leave my stuff in the apartment with my roommate\u2019s permission. Based on my roommate\u2019s feedback, their maintainance worked as well as the office does.

They kept saying the heater was fine. So he moved upstairs and the new tenant downstairs left because of that every reason.\n\nUpstairs the AC never worked. It was always hot and water leaked continually out of that unit. He kept a gallon pickle jar under it to catch the water and emptied it daily. Maintenance \"fixed it\" (haha) but it never worked.\n\nThe bathroom sink NEVER drained correctly and even backed up with fecal material. He constantly poured drain cleaner down it. And management NEVER did anything about it.\n\nRoaches were crawling everywhere, in the fridge, from the ceiling where some wall was tearing away. Gnawing through food wrappers. It was disgusting. Colonies were behind the fire extinguisher. He left a month early because he was staying sick.\n\nThe owner showed the unit to a potential buyer and my son told him about the bugs and it embarrassed him in front of the potential buyer.\n\nNow they are billing him for a BRAND NEW AC and NEW BATHROOM SINK. and want him to pay for the damage maintenance did changing out a ceiling fan.  $3000.00!!!!\n\nStay VERY FAR AWAY from Spaces Management and River Point Apts!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a83230c148df:0xaac2293f184926e6"}

I let them get started right away and found myself somewhere else to stay.  Well after they finished fixing the leak and redoing the bathroom they just left without cleaning up my apartment.  There was dust EVERYWHERE covering everything in my apartment with a layer of it.  I cleaned all of the furniture myself but the dust was embedded in the carpet and it took almost 2 MONTHS of me calling to finally get them to send carpet cleaners out to clean the carpets.  I'm a little concerned about the health effects of breathing that in for so long.

Amazing folks at EHM, from Chad, Tami, Crystal, Ronette, Ally and anybody else that works at EHM that I haven\u2019t had the pleasure to meet.\n\nAfter reading most all of the reviews, believe me as a current HOA board member, this company is top notch!  Many of the negative reviews have nothing really to do with EHM.  They only enforce the covenants that we as a community have in place.  As another HOA board member noted, the board members and homeowners are the responsible party\u2019s.  Our last Management company was impossible to reach by phone!  Absolutely not the case with Elite, as I have yet to receive a voicemail box during work hours.\n\nThere app is very helpful.  I have not encountered another company using one.  I am sure some do but I am just saying it is a plus.  Email responses are super fast.\n\nFor the reviewer that complained of Elite not keeping streets cleaned/street swept!!!  Really??  Just Really??  Address that with your HOA board members and have them allocate funds to have it done.  Elite will then ensure it is handled, I can assure you of the latter.  I can\u2019t speak for your board members however.  End rant.\n\nKeep up the GREAT work EHM!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1592342763463, "text": "Trey, thank you so much for the raving review!

They were AWFUL! We had much better management through other companies - who would send someone to fix problems when there were issues. For the last couple months of our time there, the hot water heater was broken. It was leaking out horrible, nasty water (I'd be glad to share a picture here if there is any question on that). I was in touch with them and eventually heard back from an email that the owner didn't seem to want to fix it, so we're left with that. My whole family was sick during this time.\n\nWe were amazing renters. During our two years there we replaced all three toilets (that were stained beyond repair and had flushing issues) with high end TOTO toilets, replaced the dishwasher (that was spitting out black stuff and hair into our dishes and then into empty loads right after we got there), replaced a bench out front (that was broken wood with exposed, rusted screws), put protective doorstops behind each door (where they had gone through the walls behind them before we moved in), and repaired a rotting fence on multiple occasions. Once, and entire chunk of the fence fell down exposing the back yard to a busy road. We repaired that too.\n\nAt the end of our lease they did not return any money, or contact us, within the 60 day timeline. Because nobody would answer our calls or emails, we ended up going into the office after that time. We were first told that they weren't in the office (after the receptionist went down the hall to talk to them) and then she ended up finding someone for us - who told us that he hadn't gotten around to it. We waited. Eventually he came out with a partial check. Apparently after we moved out the owner had the rotten fence ripped down and a new fence installed - and they decided to charge us money for new gates (new double gate is what was circled on the invoice). We never had a double gate while living there. It would have been nice because we would have then been able to take our riding lawnmower into both yards rather than have a separate mower for each yard.\n\nAnd while we have never met the owner - I am inclined to believe that they have just as crappy of service on that side as well. Hence the reason he pulled his properties from them and had them listed with a new company the day after we were gone. Even though our checks were always in before the first of the month, if they had to wait for a check from them like we did, I don't blame him one bit!\n\nIf you want a decent company, whether as owner or tenant, I suggest you look elsewhere. One star is 20%. Management Apex does not deserve 20%.\n\nAny questions? I'd be glad to share more.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b5691bb8583:0x6cf227058ea80758"}
