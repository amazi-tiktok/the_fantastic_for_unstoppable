To begin with, the estimator came out and gave me a price on having 2 trees cut down and having the stumps ground - trees are in the back yard behind a locked gate. I was told to expect a phone call that afternoon for scheduling. After 3 days I called the office and was told that they never received my estimate but they would put me on their schedule. A date was set and then was moved several times. I scheduled someone to come do bobcat work around that date as well. I then received a call asking if they could come that day (Thursday) and do the work. I said yes and left my office to go home and meet them. They finally showed up around 4:45 in the afternoon and got one tree down and told me that they would be back at 8:30 am the next day. I had to call the office at 3 pm to see if they were still coming to finish the work since I had to take another day to stay home from work. I waited to hear back and was told that they should be out sometime that afternoon. The crew finally showed up around 5:30 pm. They were able to get the second tree down but did not have the equipment to grind the stumps and I was told that they would come Saturday morning to finish up. Saturday came and went without anyone showing up and no phone call. The following Wednesday I get a call from the office asking if I was happy with the work and to confirm that they had removed all the debris from my yard, I told the person on the phone that they were not supposed to remove debris but they were supposed to grind stumps. She was unaware of this and said that she would make a note of it and have someone call me. Later that afternoon I got a phone call letting me know that someone would be out the next morning to grind stumps. I waited the entire day at home after taking off work, again, and NTS was again a no call no show. At this point I gave up on having anyone come complete the job. A couple weeks later, the company showed up without calling to try and finish grinding 2 stumps. The guy told my wife that he couldn't finish because there was some concrete and rocks that the didn't initially see and that he would need to come back later to finish the work. At this point I have had to call and cancel on my bobcat guy twice, which has cost both of us money. This job was started in April, and it is now the end of May. If you don't have anything to do and want to work with a company that is completely incompetent with communication, then National Tree Service should be ok.

I was surprised at how much care they took to make my yard look as normal as could be. Now, shout outs. First I want to thank Bob Young.  When I first called Eastern Tree I was told that someone would come to survey my job site and give me an estimate of the cost of the job. I figured that it would be about 3-5 days till I saw someone. The very next afternoon Mr. Young arrives and does a very thorough assessment. I was amazed at his knowledge of trees plant life in my yard. And what a professional and gentleman he was. The cost quote blew me away. Not only was it fair it was honest. The second shout out goes to the 2 ladies that run the tree service office. They are Ms. Donna and Ms. Michelle. If you want to talk to the most sweetest, kindest, knowledgeable (about all aspects of the tree service business), and  the most professional office personnel  you will ever meet; then contact them. Oh, by the way, the other local tree service companies ever returned my calls. I was shocked because I used their services in the past.

These guys are unbelievable.\n\nOur neighborhood was recently hit by a tornado causing damage to homes and property.  Within hours after the storm, a neighbor called Eastern Tree Service (ETS) to come help with restoration.  ETS arrived promptly and began calling in its crew and within hours the properties that were being serviced by ETS were transformed back to a livable state.  ETS started removing trees and debris from our homes before noon and by the end of the day they had cleared the trees and hauled away all debris.  The stumps were removed the next morning.   I was amazed by how well these guys worked as a team allowing them to get the job done as efficiently as possible.  They were very respectful of my property and went to great lengths to make sure they didn\u2019t tear down what was left of trees and shrubbery.   I was also impressed with how the owner was working side by side with his employees.   It was evident they took great pride in doing the job right.\n\nLast but certainly not least this company was very reasonable on its pricing.  Prior to this incident, I had several trees removed by other tree services and ETS\u2019 pricing was in line with what I was quoted previously.  I was very appreciative of this fact since I had heard countless stories of price gouging in storm cleanup.  After all the cleanup was complete, the owner stopped by one last time to make sure everything was handled to our satisfaction.\n\nOn a final note, what impressed me most about this company is what the owner did for an elderly neighbor.  Having found out this neighbor was weak from having chemo treatment, he restored his property at almost no cost.  The owner is not aware that anyone knew about this gift which makes it even more commendable.\n\nGreat job guys!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1555590638949, "text": "We are very humbled by your kind words !
