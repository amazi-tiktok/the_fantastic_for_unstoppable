After finding his contact information on the A.R.T. providers page, I decided to schedule an appointment.  I was initially hesitant, as I live in Pensacola and would need to drive almost an hour to get to Fairhope.  I can say that each and every trip I make down for an appointment is absolutely worth it.  Unlike other practitioners that I've seen, Dr. Justin took the time to listen to my concerns and give me feedback.  I didn't feel like another patient on the assembly line.\n\nI was also impressed with his ability to provide me with some immediate relief.  Using A.R.T., Dr. Justin was able to help me alleviate some nagging hip flexor pain, and also give me more range of motion in my knee, in one visit.  While some follow-up visits are required to completely alleviate certain issues, I was impressed with how quickly I felt relief.  It was also helpful to know that Dr. Justin was involved in the same workout program as me, so he really understood the nature of my pain.  It's nice to be treated someone who appears to \"practice what they preach\" in terms of living a healthful life.\n\nAnd lastly, the staff at Eastern Shore Chiropractic & Sports Clinic is outstanding.  I'm always greeted by friendly faces when I walk in the door and have never had an issue getting an appointment at a time that is convenient for me.

I mean an extensive panel of labs!  The proof was right there in front of me.  The Team at Vital Force tailored a program to fit my needs.  It took about 3 weeks of taking supplements and IV infusion therapy then I noticed a huge change in my self. Each week, I was better than the last.  I HAVE MY LIFE BACK !!

He also suggested supplements to take and specific foods to either avoid or eat more of to achieve a completely healthy and balanced body. It's amazing the things that chiropractic care can help with that don't even appear to be related until you remember that your nerves control everything and all your nerves are connected to the spine.

There are 3 waiting rooms each almost completely out of sight of the reception desk area.\nI arrived with my older children for my appt to take a pregnancy test. I had been informed over the phone that this was required before I could make my first prenatal appt. I hadn't experienced this with my previous pregnancies but everywhere is different.\nThe reason I was given for this requirement as a lot of women in the past have either lied about/ misread at-home pregnancy test results.\nI arrived before my scheduled appt time, checked in, paid the $11 fee to take required lab test, informed that the practice was completely paperless so I wouldn't be given a checkout slip, asked to come back to the reception area to check out, and told to wait in waiting room 3 until the lab called me to take the pregnancy test.\nI was seated in the waiting room 10 minutes before my appt time. I had one of the first lab appt times available so there were only a couple people in the waiting room. The waiting room is almost directly across to the open ares of the lab. The lab had several nurses/techs waiting around for more patients to arrive. I noticed that everyone who had arrived after me were being called immediately back to the lab. I waited 35 minutes after my scheduled appt time before I went to the front desk to figure out what was happening. When I asked one of the front desk if it was normal for new patients to wait this long just to take a pregnancy test. She was surprised and said the lab must have forgotten I was there. She called back to the lab and told me to go back to the waiting room. I could hear the lab nurse/tech say \"Oh, oops. Yeah, we'll get her in.\"\nI waited another 10 minutes before I was called to back. The nurse/tech asked how my day was going. I told her I was a bit frustrated with waiting so long. She told me that it wasn't the lab's fault as the front desk didn't actually check me in for my appt. The lab had no idea I was even waiting. She said it was also really my fault for not trying to figure out the problem sooner. After using the cup I had been handed, I returned to the lab area to find the nurse/tech. I waited in the lab area for 5 minutes before she returned. 60 mins after my appt time, I was informed that I was pregnant and the at-home test was correct. Everywhere is different and the practice had never seen me before so I kind of understand(given their past history) that I had to prove to them I wasn't lying. She wrote on a piece of paper my last cycle date and calculated due date. She told me to give the test results aka the paper she had just written on to the front desk to check out. So clearly, they aren't completely paperless. When I asked her where the test results actually were on this piece of paper she was confused and said \"that the actual lab results didn't matter as I would be using their prenatal care anyway.\"\nI went to the reception area to check out  and asked if I could get a copy of the paper aka the \"test results\" for myself. I was informed that would be against Federal Law for them to give me any of my test results. Then was told I would need to pay them upfront over double the amount of money I had been told over the phone. When I explained what I had been told by their insurance lady, I was told I was wrong. I asked them to call her which they did after complaining. Long story short, I had the correct info.\nWhen I told them I would be going to another doctor practice. They were confused why I didn't want to continue to use them. They called records so I could get a copy of my test results. I was then informed I couldn't get a copy until it was put in the computer system and signed a general released(I did) and there wasn't a timeframe when they would mail me a copy.\nThis practice was the most unprofessional, rude, disorganized, misinformed practice I have ever gone too.

I paid for a hotel (200) for wed night so we could stay in huntsville for the procedure the next day. I was called by the center that i was suppose to have my procedure done ( 2pm on wed ) at 6am on wed wanting to know where i was. Well i had not been informed that my time had changed. I spoke with the office twice on friday and once on monday before the procedure and was never informed. I called the office at 845 and was spoken to so rudely by christina (christin something like that) . that i have canceled all my future appointments. I am out 1200$( days missed working , hotel fees, and the cost of the labs and everything i had done before this, for this procedure..and that is just this trip) for this office mistakes but was talked to so rudely and disrespectful. I have been in the medical field 25 years and would never speak to a patient like that especially when it was this offices error. I highly recommend looking elsewhere for a surgeon if the staff is this rude to dr foreman patients.

She was diagnosed with having excess fluid on and around the eardrum, a condition which causes hearing loss and typically causes ear infections. We had taken her to an ENT and pediatrician, and both recommended surgery to put tubes in to help drain the fluid off her eardrum.\n\nAfter her diagnosis, we visited Dr Mix twice a week for adjustments at approx 2 months old. In only a months time, we have seen vast improvement.  Her last ENT visit was a couple of days ago. She finally passed her hearing exam for the very first time in both ears!!! There is still a small amount of fluid remaining, but our ENT detected a noticable reduction in the amount, and has postponed the need for tubes.\n\nWe will continue to seek weekly treatment with Dr Mix, and are so happy that his treatments allowed us a non-invasive approach to restore our  baby's hearing. Dr Mix has been wonderful to work with through such a difficult time. He has taken extra care to go over computer readings with us that have  conclusively shown the gradual improvement at each stage as well. My daughter  has smiled and cooed through every adjustment (no, they don't hurt AT ALL). As a side benefit, one of the computer screenings showed she also had a vertabrae out of alignment which can affect digestion as well. After her adjustments we have also seen improvement in this area also.\n\nParents, DO NOT HESITATE to schedule an appointment for your babies and children at this office. Both Dr Mix and Yvonne are wonderful to work with, and show genuine concern for us at each visit. The office is super clean, and has very up to date equipment too. We have never had long wait times, even when we have stopped by unexpectedly without an appointment, and the waiting room was full.

My huge remorse is I did not do it years ago because of fear! Being referred by my heart doctor to Dr. Mailapur was an absolutely lifesaving experience.  I had Gastric Sleeve surgery in November of 2020. I am now down over 125 pounds and still losing weight. It was like carrying around over two 60 pound sacks of concrete!  My goal is to lose about 160 pounds. The new way of living and using the tool given to me by Dr. Mailapur has transformed my life. I was taking 225 units of insulin a day. Now I don\u2019t take any insulin! I was taking four 500mg of Metformin a day. Now I don\u2019t take any! I was taking two 20mg blood pressure pills. Now I take one 2.5 mg. I feel SO much healthier. Before my surgery I could not get up off the floor/ground without a chair to help me get back up. It is hard to describe the difference in how much healthier I feel. The energy level, mood, aches and pains are so improved. My family doctor has been encouraging me to have the surgery for years. I was just too scared. BUT, my A1C was climbing, my insulin needs were climbing, heart issues were getting lots worse, and my weight was out of control. I had to get help. My heart doctor recommended I have the surgery and said he would only sign for Dr. Mailapur to be my surgeon. He totally trusted him as a surgeon.  I was also blessed that during my surgery Dr. Mailapur found a rare Cancer in my stomach and removed it ALL. According to the Cancer Doctor (Dr. Mailapur sent me to) in about 48 months I would of had stage 4 stomach cancer. I had a hernia Dr. Mailapur also removed/repaired during my surgery. The first few days were a little tough.  BUT, I left the need and desire to constantly eat in the OR at the hospital. My relationship with food addiction has totally changed.  I was encouraged by several people that had the bariatric sleeve surgery to get the surgery. Each one seemed to want to tell me I needed to do it. One offered to carry me. I now understand why they wanted to share this enormous life change with me. It is such a good positive change and blessing in my life. I, myself, now want to share it with others! You want other to have this exciting progressive change in their lives. Dr. Mailapur and everyone in his office has supported me through this journey. I was truly blessed to have this great compassionate team provide me a tool that has literally saved my life!  Thank you Dr. Mailapur and Amanda! And, Jessica for answering all my email questions!

Between the information seminars, the appointments, and pre-op nutrition class, they take the time to ensure that potential patients learn about the types of surgeries that are offered and the pros and cons of each.  Additionally, the pre-op nutrition class and follow up appointments in particular do a great job of informing you of the needed dietary, medical, behavioral, and lifestyle changes that are necessary to properly maintain your health.\n\nIt's been a year since I underwent surgery with Dr. Mailapur.  The surgery went extremely well and I have had no complications with it.  At this point, I have lost 105 lbs from my highest weight pre-surgery.  I am within five pounds of my goal weight of 175 lbs.   This has been lost due to the combination of the realities of the changes made to my diet and eating habits from surgery and my resumption of an active lifestyle.\n\nBariatric surgery may not be for everyone, but it is a great tool to help you to either reclaim a level of health that you once may have had or to challenge yourself to make a positive change for the first time.   I am nearly 45 years old, but I feel the best that I've felt since my early 20s.  I run regularly and I've started to take martial arts classes with my kids.   I don't feel as tired any more.

I struggled with being overweight my whole life, as has most of my family.  I got to the point where I knew enough was enough and I was ready for help.  I went on Google and began doing research on bariatric surgeons in Huntsville and everything that I could find pointed to Dr. Mailapur as being the best!  And from my experience, that is ABSOLUTELY the case!  I have recommended many people to him after my surgery and they have since had theirs done as well, including my wife.  It has changed both of our lives for the better!  Not just physically, but more mentally than anything!  Dr. Mailapur and his staff go above and beyond with you to make sure that you know absolutely everything you need to know before and after your surgery and what you need to do.  It's now been four years since my sleeve and I almost can't remember what it was like to be that guy that first walked into his office at 317 pounds.  In just 9 months after my surgery I lost 125 pounds and have settled at 100 pounds down!  This is what I tell people all the time about having the sleeve done...if you're thinking about it, STOP and just do it!  And, do yourself a favor to see Dr. Mailapur!  The other surgeons in town are great too.  But, none of them go to as much lengths to make sure that you are educated and protected.  Even doing extra tests during surgery to make sure that everything is good!  And, the fact that Dr. Mailapur gets the exact same surgical team every time says something!  He's known as the best and he gets the privileges and respect as being the best.  Dr. Mailapur also removed my gallbladder a couple months ago and it was the easiest surgical experience that I've had; even during COVID.  Trust me!  You can't go wrong with Dr. Mailapur and his staff.  You know it's a good atmosphere when you never see any turnover in the staff!  It's been the same people since I've been going there!  Amber, Jessica, Amanda...all of them awesome!  It's like going to see my friends at every annual checkup!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1615435616288, "text": "Wow Bronson.

I am writing this review as I near my 3 year post-op date and, though my regular visits have ended, anytime that he see me, or even a family member, he ask if things are continuing to go well and offers encouragement or even a \"kick in the pants\" if needed.\n\nIf I were to sum up what an experience with Dr. Mailapur and his office is like it would be: You will leave feeling safe, informed, and cared for!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1601057090649, "text": "Thx Brian.

Your input is appreciated.\nYour perspective on the first visit is different than most of our patients but significant. The intake paperwork asks the patient to list all their symptoms and quantify their health complaints and instructs the patients to quantify their level of improvement over the next 12 treatments.... That is correct. The reason the paperwork addresses a treatment plan is so patients are aware from the beginning that holistic treatment is not a one treatment panacea, it's not a pill and it's not magic. It is a healing process and the specifics are handled individually with each patient.\nA 20 minutes face to face with a physician is unheard of these days and if you feel that was a short visit so be it. In a 20-minute visit we addressed the entire human frame above and beyond the chief complaint plus acupuncture and tongue analysis. The process didn't stop when you left the office but it continued as the tongue analysis was performed by OUM physicians in California and THERE WERE THREE EMAIL CONVERSATIONS REGARDING THE SPECIFICS. That was a step I take out of true concern for the health and well-being of my patients but it's cases like these that make excellent physicians become callus.\nBest of luck on your journey and next time find something to praise about the next person that gives a damn about your health and well-being"}, "gmap_id": "0x8892927a6c918d1b:0x6fa1927cce21bd5d"}

He does them live, but also sends you a link, so you can do them at a time that is convenient for you.  You have no excuse not to do the workout.  He designs workouts for all fitness levels.  He demonstrates options for the exercises for beginners to those wanting a challenge.  In the past I would get bored exercising & end up quitting, especially at holiday time until this year.  I started in June & have stuck with it.  Joe is a wonderful coach who truly cares & wants to help you become a healthier & happier you.  He sends several emails a week filled with encouragement & motivation.  If you are struggling let him know & he will work with you.

I figured since it was a more upscale spa that I would only have positive things to say, but I was very wrong. I went to get one syringe of Restylane. The doctor examined the structure of my face then proceeded to prepare injecting. First, he did not clean off the area he was injecting. Second, he did not wash his hands or put gloves on before touching all over my face or doing the injection. To no surprise because I have sensitive skin, the very next day I broke out in the same exact spot he touched. While injecting, he was sitting on a stool while I was propped up in the patient\u2019s chair. I\u2019m no doctor but I\u2019m pretty certain that as the injector, he should\u2019ve been standing to get a clear view of exactly where and how much product he was injecting. Lastly, he did not massage or smooth out the product during or immediately after injecting!! Which resulted in a lump. It wasn\u2019t very noticeable from just looking at me from the front. However, I could definitely feel it and from the side view of my face you could tell something wasn\u2019t quite right.\n\nI gave it a couple of days for the slight swelling I had to go down and to give time for the Restylane to settle in. Also, he put more than half the syringe on one side of my face and what felt like air in the other side because there was no difference at all.  ALSO, the lump I felt was more so in the lowest portion of my check rather than the actual smile line where it should\u2019ve been. I\u2019m assuming this was due to him sitting during the injection and not having a clear view of what he was doing. 10 days later, lump is still there. I went back to the office and all he could do was offer to inject another syringe for $100 off. I declined the offer because I refused to spend any more money at that spa.

I prefer working out at 4am, and this gym affords me that luxury. I've never had a wait time to use any machine, that's also a major plus.
