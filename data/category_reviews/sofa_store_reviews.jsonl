Ashley did a great job listening to both of us as well as seeing some of our style when she came to our house for the initial assessment.  She was very patient and came up with great suggestions of things that would work well in our space and with the existing furniture we had.  At the end of the process we now have a room full of art that gives us a finished and professional look.  Thanks Ashley!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1551201176830, "text": "Brian, thank you so much for the wonderful feedback!

I walked in to the store the first day knowing specific items we needed to replace, but did not even know where to begin to find what would work best for our home, with things we already have and want to keep. She asked questions, REALLY listened, and that's where her innate creativity kicked in. She has \"nailed it\" time after time with unique suggestions, and I look forward to working with her again as we update this home. I have not seen this 5 star level of customer service that Ashley delivers in a long time, and Ethan Allen is fortunate to have this jewel! And we LOVE our new pieces - the quality is wonderful, too!

Go to Lowes or Home Depot and ask for universal furniture screws!  Called corporate no help! Don't waste your time.
