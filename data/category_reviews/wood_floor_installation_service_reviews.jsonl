Very pleasant experience with Clark with setting up my consultation. Cullen came out and did the consultation with me and my husband. It went well, and the price was very reasonable. He advised me that he would email me the proposal and to call him when we were ready.\n\nI waited for the email but never received it. However, I still called a week later and let him know we were ready to schedule but that I still haven't received the proposal email. I didn't feel comfortable calling to pay my deposit over the phone without a proposal. He wasn't at the office when I called but was going to call once he got settled. When he finally called, I wasn't available but I still didn't get a proposal email.\n\nSo I waited before calling back. Then Clark called and left a msg asking if my consultation went well and if I was ready to schedule. At that time I was not because I wanted the proposal on paper with the amount I was quoted. Never heard back.\n\nSo I called again Monday, 10/12 and spoke with a gentleman about scheduling (yes I was still willing to use this company because the price I was quoted was the best). He got my name and address and tried to look up an invoice or proposal and guess what, there was none!! He asked who did my consultation and I told him Cullen. He said he would get him to call me. Days later, I'm still waiting on my call.\n\nThe other 2 companies I've contacted this week have been very responsive and gotten me proposals within the same day of the consultation. I'd rather pay the extra $ for great customer service and communication.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1602795297698, "text": "Ms. Holmes, your experience with our company is very regrettable.

His estimate was very reasonable, so we asked him to perform the work. To say that we were thrilled with the finished product is an extreme understatement. The set looked better than brand new. We then asked him to do a much harder job, refinishing a hard maple dining room pedestal table and four unmatching chairs (in finish and type of wood) in a stain to match a dining room china cabinet. To make matters even worse, one of the leg bases had been chewed on quite vigorously by a new puppy. Once again, Nick's work was unsurpassed and his estimate was right on.
