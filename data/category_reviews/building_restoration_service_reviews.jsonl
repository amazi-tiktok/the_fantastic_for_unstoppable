The next day Keith (our PM) came back to make sure things were done as he expected followed by our original \"salesman\" (that term is so inadequate) Kyle coming out the following day to walk the roof and the grounds and write up a final \"punch list\".

As of July 20th they still had not finished. We had a vacation planned and upon our return, the unprofessional work ethic and attitude continued so we fired them.\nThe problems:\nThey have installed the tile flooring incorrectly, it is very uneven, has to be removed and replaced. The tile was uneven, grout lines not the same and tile was crooked. They chipped floor tile trying to fix the mistakes they made.\nThey rebuilt the shower walls but made the shower to large. The cabinets now do fit in place. The shower walls have to removed as does the mud bed for the shower.\nThe tile work they did on the shower had to removed because they had a 1 inch bow i n the wall. The bow in the wall was due to APEX's contractors putting inch of thin set or mortar behind the tile, inch thick!\nThe floor pan was not sealed or glued correctly. This was pointed out to me two other contractors who have given us bids.\nAPEX also did not install the left counter properly so they cut the stone back splash and side splash to try to make it fit. They cut the back splash uneven.\nThey broke fixtures in the bathroom.\nI had to make them put insulation back in the walls.\nApex did paint behind the counters in the bathroom.\nApex contractors would show up and work for a couple of hours and then leave to g to another job. At times they didn't even show up.\nI was told not to worry about the job in progress but the end result. If your foundation on the job is not right the finished product will be junk!\nAPEX would lie to us about job finish date. They would tell us we will be done by this Friday, but the tile had not been ordered or was not going to in till the next week.\nThe contractors would sit out back and smoke under my Gazebo! One of the guys had his girl friend hanging out all day. They did fire him after I brought this up.\nI had to tell them to not smoke under my Gazebo, don't put your stuff on my grill, do not smoke on my porch, do not turn on my outside fans and for them to clean up after themselves.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1543339278005, "text": "Please call me at (931)691-3800 I will do all in my power to resolve this issue.

Two days later i got home and I could not believe my eyes. There were two large storage pods in the driveway, all the furniture was removed and stored. All the cabinets and cupboards were removed, the place was completely stripped. There were big fans all over, and the rooms were blocked off from the rest of the house. Once dry, they came in with contractors and started to restore my home. The job when finished was outstanding.

I wish he would have been the project manager on my rebuild. However on the rebuild side.. not so much.. said project manager who I will not mention he knows who he is did not communicate well with the contractors on my rebuild. I had to fix AC vents myself that said project manager had told contractors to fix as I told them not to take down. they taped around them and when they took tape off. they ripped em out... they had no knowledge of it to fix them and were not told.. They damaged my drawer in my kitchen and tried to blame me for it. Broke my kitchen faucet as they should have taken the faucet from the sink.. Instead I find my sink on the floor all willy nilly . On the paint process they puled nails and picture hooks and patched but on other areas they just painted over the pic hooks and so forth. They also painted without using drop cloths on my wood floors and set a paint tray on my wood floor without a drop cloth under it. and I will have to pay someone to pressure wash my front sidewalk as they got paint spatters everywhere when they were cutting and working outside.. They did fix the items in question, drawer faucet and cabinets. but project manager said we will go thru this during the walk thru.. To me it would make sense to take care of this BEFORE THE walk thru.. I am visually impaired and I am glad I had friends to point out stuff they needed to fix.. They got it all fixed but it should have never come to that had the project manager been on the ball. Y'all need to put me on the payroll for this job. and he charged me for a Dump truck that did not get used for hauling away debris.. This was a rebuild no debris to haul away. He got snappy and angry.. \"I am not taking that truck charge off\"  and took it personally when I questioned the Dump truck charge. I am not trying to nickel and dime anyone I just expect things to be as they were before it happened. Said project manager was very aloof and uncaring or understanding. I might be legally blind but I am not stupid. If I was totally blind with no help my place would have been totally jacked up after the sign off. and lastly they put my upper kitchen cabinets in crooked.They had to pull and put in correctly... who does not use a level when putting in cabinets. Very hasty sloppy work that should have been done right the first time.  I understand that folks try to get over on folks like y'all but I just wanted stuff done right.. It was a very painful process Tim Seh", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862685bb93ab1d3:0xbc3925c7e384a20e"}

Drew one of the sales guys made up stories about the situation, told my tenant I had told him things when I hadn't even talked to the guy yet and told two different things ones to me and my tenant .I asked Drew why he did this and let him know I would be calling the office and  he proceeded to call my tenant a couple of times and send me a  6 page text over the situation which I found very unprofessional . When I called to complain about this Jacob the owners son took  up for the actions, was rude to me, did not listen to me and acted like I was bothering him.I was told my cabinets needed replaced when they did not. They pulled the vanity out of my master bathroom that did not need pulled out to begin with  without cutting the caulk and when they pulled the vanity it caused the mirror in the bathroom to fall on the sink shattering my mirror and busting my sink in the bathroom and tried to blame it on the heat in the room.I called  David the head of the construction department several times asking a start date and was told no repairs would be started  until they had 18 thousand upfront, Half the cost, and to ask my adjuster to call  his cooperate office and have Fed Ex deliver it to them.I asked my adjuster about it and he said that they did not that money upfront and was beyond shocked I had been told that.They still have their little lock box on my door a week after I told them I will not be using their services anymore, I have called four times to ask to have removed.I have called and asked  three times to speak to the owner of the franchise and got no response.

But then everything got very confusing. We didn't know what was going to happen or when. Then they came in and packed all of our things up, first our clothes and no one told us to keep out any clothes. So we had no clothes blankets or pillows by the time they finished. There was 2 rooms that just had to be cleaned but they threw out our beds and furniture and took out all the carpet. We put notes on two closets and put don't enter.. I found the notes in the floor when we returned. They packed up everything and took it with them but nothing was cleaned it was just in the box they had packed it in.\nThey told us they we're going to clean the duck work, it was not cleaned, the ceiling fans were not cleaned nor were the blinds. We have had to just  about replace everything  we own plus we had use or own  money to eat at the hotel for   for over 2 months. Being nice is great but we had to many people telling us different things..it took a month after we got to come home before they started bring things back. It made difficult to cook. We had to buy new pots just fry an egg.\nWhen they finally brought things back they were very confused about everything because the young guy and 3 woman that packed us up were fired. They didn't seem to know what was ours and what wasn't.  There are quite a few things missing.  Some of the items are antique and can't be replaced.  The thing is these items problem  went to someone else  and they just saw it was old and not there's. Maybe I need to go check the thrift store.  I didn't think this was going to be easy but this has been a nightmare. I have items that have tags on them, but they didn't take them or clean them. My blinds still have soot on them and it is not easy to clean. They we're supposed to clean and check or duct work , not even touched. And we saw the check our insurance sent them and that was way too much for this mess.

For two weeks, we checked every\nday, no workmen.  We were assured we would be back in by Christmas.  We went through three Project Managers, and\nthree different set of drywall and painters.  The first painting crew stood on my washer and dryer to paint the\nceiling in the laundry leaving dents and scratches.  We had stored the liquor from our bar in tubs in the garage,\nas Servpro would not remove alcohol from the home.  Apparently the painters had found it and consumed a great deal\nbefore they were removed from the job by Darin Ingle.  They also got paint all over our floors so Servpro brought\nin commercial scrubbers which removed the finish on all of our floors.\n\nTo shorten this story, I will cut to the return home.  We finally returned to our home in early March with work still\ngoing on, Painting and damaged floors. The first night home the water under the sink of my brand new cabinets\nflooded the kitchen.  They had to send in dryers and a plumber who said it was not hooked up correctly and\nreworked all of the kitchen dishwasher and sink plumbing. They sent in a professional flooring company  to assess\nthe floors. Their solution required us to move back into a hotel for at least a week so they could clean, reseal\nthe tile and recolor the grout.\n\nThe only thing that saved this project was Darin Ingle who arrived on the project in February.  Darin was sent in from another state to resolve the\nproblems at the Montgomery location that included our home.  Darin took the reins, brought in new crews and came\nevery day to ensure the work got back on track and that it was done correctly.  Darin's arrival was months into\nthe project and while we have never sued anyone, we were on the verge of doing just that to get another company\nto come in so we could go home.  I am not sure if Servpro's executives realize that Darin not only saved our project,\nsaved them from a lawsuit but did an amazing job saving their reputation.  I would only call them again if Darin Ingle handled the job.\nBecause of Darin, I am giving Servpro a 2 star rating and Darin a 5.\n\nAn update to my review.  I was contacted by Mr. Bowen, an owner.  Mr. Bowen was determined to do something to do something for All we had been through.  He offered to send in a crew or something.  While his offer was appreciated, we had already fixed many of the issues and did not feel we could ensure another work crew I agreed to think it over and get back with him.  The one thing, as I explained to him, that distressed me everytime I went into the laundry was the dents and scratches on the tops of the washer and dryer which he eagerly agreed to replace.  With much of manufacturing shut down for long periods, appliances are in short supply.  However, Mr. Bowen and Darin Ingle were able to replace order And have new ones installed.  My frustration is no longer renewed when I walk into my laundry room.  My thanks to Mr. Bowen for reaching out and making this a better experience, and to Darin Ingle for making it happen.  It is good to know they cared to make things better.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1600260211243, "text": "Hi Judy, I am one of the owners and I am terribly sorry to hear about your experience.

They were fast to come out but that is where to positive things stop.  They were also quick to want to get my insurance involved.  They removed the water and the vapor barrier in my crawl space.  They also happened to remove about $1500 dollars worth of hiking, camping and repelling gear as well.  I emailed them about the issue and mentioned that they had also broken all the light bulbs in the crawl space and left my yard a mess from driving in it.  I would certainly stay away from using them.  The crew leader was a nice guy.  They also unplugged the sump pump in my crawl space and didn't plug it back in.
