She didn\u2019t call to make other arrangements or ask if I could mail the rest of the money or anything. After business started to open back up, I went back to take care of the rest of my bill. I paid the money in June. She said it will be after Father\u2019s Day before she could get the head stone over here in Monroeville. I have been very understanding and waited. I would ride by the cemetery daily to see if the head stone was there. With so many distractions going on now a days I have been in touch. Today October 6, 2020, I called to inquire about the head stone. I was talking normal and she was very hostile. I told her I wanted a refund because she had more than enough time to have the head stone here. She the head stone was made but didn\u2019t have a reason why it hasn\u2019t been delivered. She said it was just sitting there and didn\u2019t know why it wasn\u2019t delivered, she was rude, insensitive, unsystematic, and to top it off....\nshe hung the phone up on me. I know money is the root to all evil.... but she was not woman enough to have a decent conversation with me. Who wants to do business with someone like that.

When families are at their most vulnerable, it is at these time that a gentle, kind, and caring person becomes so important.  When my father passed away, Ms. May and the rest of the staff treated our family with respect and they worked very hard to help guide us through the most difficult time of my mother's life.  They did not try to push us to purchase things nor try to play on our grief, but instead they listened to what mattered the most to us and then helped us to achieve those goals.  Even though the funeral home was extremely busy and Ms. May probably had about 100 other things on her \"to-do\" list, she never rushed us or made us feel like we were bothering her.  The services provided by the funeral home and by the staff were above and beyond and I would highly recommend Jefferson Memorial Funeral Home and Gardens as your choice for funeral services.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890db94ffd306f:0xe9addfba459c1a9e"}
