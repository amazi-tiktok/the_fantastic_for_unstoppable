The project involved demo of some existing kitchen cabinets, replacement of a cook top and stove with a range, replacement of a vent hood, installing new kitchen lighting, laying tile, painting cabinets and bookshelves, painting trim, and painting walls.  All of this was handled by David's crew without having to sub out any work. The quality of the work done was really top-tier.  We used David's decorating consultant, Lindy, to help pick out colors, and the result has significantly brightened and beautified the two rooms where we spend most of our waking hours.\n\nWhen you undertake a project that takes this much time, you quickly realize that you have invited some strangers into your home for a lengthy stay.   Well, the guys David sent did not stay strangers for very long.  They were cheerful, friendly, and helpful to us.  They added, without cost, some features to the project at our request, even though these features were not in the original contract-- for example, installing a dimmer switch in the kitchen, replacing flood lights in our dinette area so they would match the color put out by our new kitchen lighting, cutting out the trim along one wall of our living room so our bookcase could lay flat against the wall, and installing wall outlets in our bookcase.  They cleaned up after themselves every day and hauled away their own trash.  When they moved furniture around to do some painting, they always put it back where it had been.  It got to where we enjoyed having the company at our house.  At the end of the job, we were glad it was completed, but we were sorry to see the guys leave.\n\nAll the work was done with great attention to detail.  They found and installed tile to match our existing kitchen backsplash tile.  They worked on our project every weekday for three weeks.  On some days, they worked on our cabinet doors and bookcase at their shop, but on the days when they did not come, David always called us to let us know they would not be there and what they would be doing that day.\n\nWe will certainly call on Lisenby Construction if we undertake new remodeling projects.

Rep showed up at our home and that was the end of the beginning.  He did not listen to us.  We did no want re-facing but he continued to measure existing cabinets which we did no intend to keep.  I asked to look at the books he brought in.  He asked rather snarkily, have you checked out our website???  Yes, but since you have books can I look?  At the  end of a very awkward meeting, he said they have a designer that could help with what we want.  We have not heard anything from this company 4 months later.  The end.  Would not recommend this company.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889cd9e2e74f8b1:0x90e1ce673d96709a"}

I needed help taking the right steps to quickly stop the damage that was occurring and I did not know who to ask.  I happened to mention my plight to an ICS employee who had dropped by the business where I work, and the ICS team literally did the rest. My project manager, David Prejeant, contacted me,  took the time, and made every effort to baby step me through the proceedures with little worry on my part.  Once the day was set, their install team efficiently and professionally installed our new roof. Once the job was complete, the install team left very little evidence that anyone had been on my roof and my property other than the roof was obviously new and the leaks had stopped.  Then,  the thing that was the ultimate reward for having done business with them, ICS sent an inspector back out after completion to insure the work met their high standards of quality.  On this inspection trip,  the gentleman took extra time to run a magnet around to check again that no troublesome tacks were left behind.  I am thankful I shared my plight with the right person that day!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d4eb552a6bdbf:0xbdd68da85f9c3807"}
