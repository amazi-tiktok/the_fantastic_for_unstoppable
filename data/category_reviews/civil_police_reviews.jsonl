They work with a terrible DA, Brandon Hughes, who is known for sleeping with several police officers and other people that work for the local government. Maybe the police should do their job and protect everyone not just the people who are well connected. Maybe they should start investigating people like Brandon Hughes and Mary Roberson instead of people walking home from the bars.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2e3c18255c3:0xd48e0ce741c5a4a5"}

The first time it took them over 20 mins to get the my work place and the vehicle had left and the asked me for details of the vehicle after I told them I had went to the back of the building where there were no windows for my safety. And the second time I have called was due to someone knocking on the door saying it was a delivery. Mind you I am contracted through another company to clean this place therefore I don\u2019t receive delivery or sign paperwork. I informed the  operator of what happen and told them that the office was closed and there shouldn\u2019t be any deliveries. They said they were sending an officer over needless to say the person was still in the parking lot trying to make me sign paperwork and the police never showed up to my knowledge I never spoke with an officer. The APD never informed me of what the out come was or if it was safe for me to leave I have to call someone from home to meet me outside of the building in order for me to leave the building.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2e3c18255c3:0xd48e0ce741c5a4a5"}
