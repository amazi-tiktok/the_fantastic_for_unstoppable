I'll look at it when I come back\". I agreed and we hung up. So I went on Saturday around 1130 am (the man said they opened at 10 am) and the lights were off and door was locked. So I called a few times with no answer. Fast forward to the following Tuesday (I worked from home that day) I went to the store to drop it off....it was about 2 PM. The door was locked and lights were on. Another lady (probably in her 70s) was standing there with me and we were discussing the fact the door was locked and why. So I put my face to the glass and saw someone so I knocked. A young man came to the door and mouthed something about an errand (we couldn't hear him thru the glass). After a few times of yelling \"WHAT, WE CANT HEAR YOU\" I yelled \"CAN YOU CRACK THE DOOR OPEN AND TELL US WHAT YOU ARE SAYING?\" well...he didn't...he yelled thru the door louder that it would be 25 or 30 minutes til someone came back. Not really sure why HE couldn't open the door so we could leave our vacs but she and I looked at each other and said to each other as we left that we won't be back. For me it was about a 20 minute drive to get there from my house. The ONLY reason they get a star is because of the super nice man on the phone. I ended up taking it to Fairhope (I work in Daphne) and they were nice and open!\n\n**thank you for such a nice response. I'm sorry it didn't work out this time. I will definitely keep you in mind in the future. All your son had to do was open the door and tell us what he was trying to say. The nite he was pointing to said \"will return by 1130\". When I questioned him about it he said it was an old note. Also there are sooooo many notes on the door its hard to know what is what. Maybe clean it up a bit. No one will stop to read all that.

The truck air conditioning part wasn\u2019t coming in until the 21st and it came in Yesterday and so it was able to be fixed today but when it was ready at 2:00 I put a sign on the door and locked it because the vacuum man and I are the only ones that run the store during the week and if I didn\u2019t get him to take me to get my truck I wouldn\u2019t have any vehicles or a way home I had no customers and the trip to pick it up is about 30 minutes.

I asked her if she knew anybody who sold the parts. She said no because it's a cheap sewing machine that's only a 150. I get that it's a 150 but not everybody has a 150 laying around. I have only had the sewing machine for 6 months and it accidentally fell of my work table and broke a few pieces. I would rather fix it then go spend 150 I don't have. Mind you I know how to fix my machines so I dont have to pay for labor.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1580394195672, "text": "A $150.00 sewing machine that fell off a table and busted its plastic bobbin winder off is not worth fixing the customer is likely to totally ruin the machine by taking it apart herself and then not work at all I told her to go to Joanns or Walmart and buy a separate bobbin winder for about $30.00 and be done a $150.00 machine with broken off parts is not worth fixing but if the bobbin winder was the issue buy a separate bobbin winder and be done those machines were not built to have those parts replaced they aren\u2019t worth it"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a527e86a298c1:0xc35dac5cfcaea79"}

In less than 30 minutes, we were up and running with perfect calibration- and it saved us $675.

I have personally spoken with this customer and explained that there was a misunderstanding that resulted in his impression that the shirts were not here and that he had been misled. My offer to him was and is to do whatever I can to make this up to him, including immediately applying these patches at no cost to the shirts he is purchasing online.

They have had those shirts for two months now and when push came to shove today after asking when the shirts would be printed we were first told by Teresa that their machine broke down and they needed to send out for parts. When I asked them if all five machine broke down at the same time I then received a call back from Carol who said she was the owner and I was told they would not be printing the shirts because they were less than their minimum. Minimum?  I guess that they have no problem with not correcting their mistake. Coincidently I have a copy of there price list and on it states 1 is the minimum so not sure why 22 shirts is less than minimum.

The other in Duluth Ga.  really didn't want to talk to me since I told him I would not be the one to pick it up.  So I was recommended Kens from a Facebook Group .  I talked to Jeremy that first day.  He didn't try to over sell me anything.  He listened to what I wanted.   I ended up getting just what I needed and nothing more.  He didn't over sell anything. I bought a re-manufactured machine , that he said came with full warranty as a new one  which gave me the extra to purchase the upgrade kit to expand.   Maybe I can get basic software at later date.\n\nSince I am out of state ( which makes me a bit nervous about getting service) which after 30 days, I am responsible for all shipping charges.   He had my choice in here in 2 days  and I didn't receive all the goodies some talk about such as starter packs or basic software but I did receive 4 spools of thread which I do like the quality.

The website says it has excellent service, but Donna and Kevin (owner?) are really unprofessional. Long story short, I received two defective machines and now they have everything back and don't want to give me my money back. The way Donna handles \"customer service\" is to hang up the phone on you and tell everyone to not answer your calls and not respond to emails. When she does decide to respond via email after writing many times, she doesn't solve the problem, she just causes more and doesn't sign off. The way Kevin \"solves problems\" is to lie and make up whatever is convenient for him. Have him email you so he cannot go back on his words.\n\nupdate: RELUCTANTLY, they sent me a third machine that I did NOT want. YES, I had to pay for shipping. The second one was broken within a month and I have email proof that I informed them at that time. I tried to save them money and have them send me a piece and change that to see it that is what was broken. Of course it was over a month by then and hard to contact them so they wanted me to pay for shipping. I had no choice b/c they wouldn't give me a refund for the broken machines they sent me. This was after months of them not refunding me my money & having possession of their machine. Donna was extremely unprofessional and childish. To expand on what I wrote above, she would hang up the phone on you and then when I try to call numerous times, she wouldn't pick up. I would then call with a different phone and then, wah-lah, she is magically answering the phone again. Who does that? Then Kevin gets the phone and has the nerve to tell me I hung up the phone. If I hung up, why would I have tried calling back several times to no avail? Kevin kept giving me the run around and wouldn't let me talk to the owner. I asked him NUMEROUS times to give me the same order when he shipped it, yet when I received it, the threads I had chosen were not included. The ugliest colors they could find were thrown into the package they sent me. I am so tired of dealing with them, I didn't even bother to contact them.\n\nBuyer beware!

THEN I NEEDED SOFT WARE FOR ANYONE WHO REALLY WANTS TO READ THE TRUTH ABOUT MY EXPERANCE:FOR MY MACHINE TO DO MANY OTHER DESIGNS TO MAKE WHAT I WANTED ON IT. SHE GUIDED ME TO THE BEST ONE. I CAN NOT DESCRIBE THE SMALL THINGS SHE AND THE OWNER WERE ABLE TO DO SO I CAN HAVE A GREAT DAY ON MY MACHINE.\nFIVE STARS JUST DON'T CUT IT I GIVE MANY THANKS AND YES, I BOUGHT STUFF SCENE THAT TIME AND SHE WILL TAKE THE TIME TO GO OVER MY QUESTIONS AND HELP ME GET THE RIGHT PRODUCTS. I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED IF YOUR HONEST WITH SOMEONE AND KIND THE SAME WILL COME BACK TO YOU. LIKE NOW I CAN'T BELIEVE SOME OF THE TWO REVIEWS I HAVE READ BECAUSE THEY OR ANYONE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN RUDE OR UGLY TO ME OR MY HUSBAND EVER........  \"MANY THANKS TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF KEN AND DONNA\"\nTO THIS DAY, I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN THEIR STORE, JUST DUE TO THE DISTANCE AND MY DISABILITY TO DRIVE NOW....I WOULD LOVE TO HUG HER AND PERSONALLY SAY THANK YOU.MABY ONE DAY I WILL GET TO GO TO THE STORE.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d48cec32d1629:0x37e6ea59d2d2ff03"}

I almost just left it there for parts! I was so disappointed. He had it for several months and never let me know the situation. I started to shop for a new serger. I didn't find anything I really wanted that was affordable. I called Kens sewing Center after seeing them on Amazon and e-bay in the past and asked to speak with someone who knows serger. I spoke to Jeremy I believe who works on them. He asked what I currently used and explained the situation. He said he had not heard of a tension board on that machine. He said if you are willing to send it to us I will look at your machine and if I can't fix it all you are out is the shipping. I decided to go for it. I shipped it and it was repaired and returned within about 10 days!!! These folks rock!!! I highly recommend them! If you have a Janome Compulock serger Jeremy is the man to work on them! It was almost a year ago it works like a charm to this day!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d48cec32d1629:0x37e6ea59d2d2ff03"}
