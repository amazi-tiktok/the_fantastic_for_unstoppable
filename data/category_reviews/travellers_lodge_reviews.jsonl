It was wonderful and cozy..Claudia thinks of every detail to make the experience perfect. I can\u2019t think of a more perfect cottage in such a quiet and peaceful location. The mattress was amazing and the most comfortable mattress we have  ever slept on , ever.  We enjoyed the hot tub on the screened in back porch. We would give it a rating of ten stars if there was an option.  Having at least 10 deer wander around the back yard was an added bonus.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1590171352620, "text": "Thank you! I really appreciate your kind words.

We love this little cabin. The cleanest and nicest place we have stayed. The owners are the sweetest and are very accommodating to every need. The cell service wasn\u2019t bad at all. We have Verizon and my lifeline is my cell service when I am away from my kiddos. We were very pleased with our signal. We love that the cabin is surrounded by woods and no neighbors close to it. We will rent again in the future...\nMagan Sellers", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1603131382924, "text": "Thank you Magan!  We hope you make it an annual tradition to stay with us on your anniversary.  Kathy is our housekeeper and is the BEST!  I will definitely forward your comments to her because she works very hard at making sure the cabin is clean and presentable for our guests.  Verizon has certainly upped their game in the last 6 months here in Mentone.  So now we have ATT, Verizon and T-mobile here on top of the mountain.  Hope to hear from you next year! Thank you again -\nClaudia"}, "gmap_id": "0x88602d438edc6431:0xd5e33bb7cdc1752a"}
