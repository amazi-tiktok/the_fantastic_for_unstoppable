So I did a Google search and came across HESCO, the reviews were great, I spoke with Joe Molina and he arranged to have it tower to HESCO \"DESPITE being in the middle of changing locations\", they got it in checked it out, started it up, \"No white smoke from the tail pipe\", turned out to be the water pump, THAT's ALL. I can't recommend Joe Molina and the guys at HESCO Automotive highly enough, they are highly professional, extremely efficient, keep you informed at every juncture of the process, and very reasonable.

I'm a single father of two boys the reason I tell you this is because I told them and I think that makes what they done to me worse. Yes I'm talking about premier tire and Auto on 231. The battery lite and brake lite came on and it was losing power. I got the battery checked and it was good. So I take it to premier thinking it was the alternator which he SAID he checked it and it was bad it would be 200$ for the alternator and two hours labor at around 110 an hour. I agreed to this and the following morning when I called to check on things she tells me it took him a hour to get the hood up. (All you had to do was pull the cable and pull up on the hood. So simple my daughter could do it) so they charged me 1 hr in labor just to get my hood open?? They already had the alternator so I couldn't back out . I wish I would have cause who really wants someone to work on your vehicle when they cant even get the hood up.. RED FLAG!! Anyway they got the alternator on she said it took them 5 hrs so I was getting a good deal but keep in mind the 110 she charged to open the hood. I get home the next morning on my way to work it was doing the same thing so I took it back. She said he would put it on the machine and get it fixed. They had it for a weak cause she said there were people ahead of me which I understood. A week later she calls and said that it was upn sensor or something like that behind the steering wheel I had to take it to a dealer. Then she goes on to tell me i owed 225$ for his diagnostic but wait now I've paid over 800$ and my van is still doing the exact same thing. So when i called the dealer the thing that he diagnosed it to be that the van would not even start and it does start. Now I'm 800 dollars out and have to take it somewhere else.
