I was told that this info came directly from the TSI owners. They also said my doorbell video and other automations (lights, etc.) will not work if I canceled with them. They say that no other company will be able to use the equipment and it will only work with TSI since it was \"theirs\". They say that you cannot buy the Qolsys IQ Panel 2 online, because it comes from their dealer. This is all false.\n\nThey will also tell you that they don't know if they are allowed to cancel your account and that they don't know how to cancel accounts (and you have to call alarm.com to cancel). After multiple times calling alarm.com, I found out that you do in fact cancel with the dealer (TSI), not with them (they are just a third party software company). The lady at TSI needed to speak to her supervisor (but they were conveniently gone for the day), and she would call me first thing in the morning about if they can cancel/how to cancel my account (wouldn't you know, they never called back, I had to call them). The next morning, my call was passed around to 3 individuals until I spoke to somebody who wanted to make sure I 100% wanted to cancel my account (for all the reasons above). My alarm.com account was gone less than 5 minutes after I hung up. It was a fun few days of conversations.\n\nEdit: Thanks for responding M. Moore. I WAS a customer of yours, so I CAN leave a review on your company (I went to a different company because TSI is dishonest). Everything I've posted is 100% truth. You need to check your employees training if what you've read above is not how you want them interacting with customers. Shady.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1590418768651, "text": "Matt,\n\nYou have over complicated this entire situation. It is actually very simple. The cellular device that is built into the Qolsys panel is registered to our company, TSI. You would need another company to replace that device. Of course the Qolsys panel is available online to anyone that would want to purchase it at a retail price. All the other automation devices that were installed in the home are also universal and can be used with any other company. You were not told that. That was your misunderstanding. You were actually told that the automation devices would no longer be free because TSI would no longer be providing that service. That is an agreement between TSI, DR Horton & the Alarm.com builder program. You can\u2019t just have some random company give you a free Alarm.com account. I would think this would clear up any confusion you have. Like I said it\u2019s very simple. You would need another company to replace the device.\n\nAlso please do not reach out to TSI to assist or help you for any other reason. We take our reputation and reviews very serious. We also do not appreciate you, who is not a customer going online as you if you are and giving our company a 1 star review. You are not a customer & do not reserve that right. We have been in business for 21 years. I can also tell you that during that time I have never been accused of being shady. That is slander! You need to be very careful with your words. We are upfront and honest to a fault. We did not tell people what they want to hear in order to make a sale. We have lost many opportunities & sales over the years for that reason. The other company was willing to tell them what they wanted to here even though it was false and we were not.\n\nSincerely,\nM.

The OEM original copy we work with, offers you lifetime warranty from the manufacturer.\n\nApple stores of course know the difference since they are the only ones authorized to replace the Apple original screens and they know when you fix it somewhere else, they care about it because you didn\u2019t fix it with them. As a retail store we put our stamp behind the screen to validate the manufacturer warranty and when Apple stores see our stamp they will tell you that it is not their screen.\n\nPlease come back to our shop and give us the opportunity to test your device and validate the warranty we offer you. This will not cost you anything and we will check the reason why your Face ID is not working properly, also we would like to know the location where your device was fixed and when it was fixed.\n\nWe like to share with you that our goal is not just to repair devices, it is to make sure you are satisfied with our service by doing it right and keep our customers happy because we care about all of you. Every day we try our best to satisfy our customers as we stand behind our repairs. As I mentioned before we will take care of your device and will make sure you have the OEM original led screen and as I said it already you don\u2019t have to worry about it, it is under warranty and we will do our best to make you satisfied.\n\nPlease email me for future questions or concerns at Tuscaloosawireless@gmail.com\n\nSincerely,\n\nStore manager, Abe."}, "gmap_id": "0x88860282ed6c3989:0xf70abf01cadf6e71"}

However we purchased a keyless entry/ exit door feature.  This was an option that was very important to us and so we chose a security company that offered it.  When the installation tech arrived I was told that it could not be installed because I didn't have a dead bolt lock on the door.  That I could hire someone else to drill a hole in my door at additional cost.  Already paid $2500 for this security system and now I have to hire someone else to install the door lock.  I  called the salesperson and was told that she could get her husband to drill it. But then he couldn't because he was out of town.  So  3 days later got the hole drilled but when tech came back to install it the lock would jam.  Tech said they never drill door locks.  ADS doesn't pay for that tool because it is so expensive. Very frustrating!  Be careful with the salesperson!  Finally works after spending hours adjusting the door and lock.  Use another security company. Not ADS.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1618489173753, "text": "Ms. Richard, I am sorry for the installation issues your encountered.  Please call us directly if you have any other issues.

He then said he'd go ahead and update our system for no charge, which he did. What was that about??  Offer to update the system for $100?  Would that be considered fleecing a client?

ADT proceeded to still charge me two months of service at my old location even though they knew I had cancelled the service at my old house. When I caught it, the call center manager told me that they still bill you 30 days after you cancel. I asked about the other month and she said \"oh we prorated that and took it out of your installation fee.\" So I prepaid $100 for an install that I didn't get.

We have tried restarting the router and it's useless. We pay 75 dollars for the smallest internet package. It would be nice if it would actually work in our room, but 60% of the time it does not.\n\nThey gave us two wifi domains (I'm not sure about terminology) but 90% of the time only one is avaible.

I have just reviewed every telephone company in Alabama and all the people that take the time to write a review say they wish they had some other provider...kind of funny.  New Hope Telephone averages one hour trouble repair responses which is absolutely unheard of today, get that from AT&T, Comcast, Charter or any other provider, try 2 to 7 days from those companies.  Oh by the way it won't be long and we will have GIG internet availability as well...not bad from a rural provider when Birmingham, Mobile, Montgomery and Huntsville doesn't even have it yet.\n\nThe reason that NHTC is most people\u2019s only ISP provider is the cost of operation and homes-per-mile available to serve. Other companies are free to serve the same area but choose not to due to the low profitability. NHTC isn\u2019t a monopoly by choice but they are the only company that strives to provide service to an area that would otherwise not have it.
