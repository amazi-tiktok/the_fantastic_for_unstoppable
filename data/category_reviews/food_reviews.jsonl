I ate at Chick Wrap a few times during visits to the Outlet Mall in Foley and was impressed with every meal.  On my first visit I had a delicious bacon cheeseburger with fries.  They took the time to melt the cheese onto the beef patty like you would at a cookout.  Awesome!  My next visit, I had chicken strips with homemade buffalo sauce.  The chicken was very good quality and not overly breaded.  The sauce was great and just one of several I was offered.  The last item I tried was the chicken salad after hearing another customer rave about it.  No kidding, it was the best I have ever had.

If I'm going to spend that much on a burger I'm gonna go to a sit down restaurant.\n\nI got the 5 piece chicken tender for my kids to split cause we just wanted something to hold us over while the wife was shopping. I expected normal size chicken tenders except we got the mini versions. Like half the size of a chik-fil-a tender. Then they offer you only 2 sauce cups and have to charge for extra.
