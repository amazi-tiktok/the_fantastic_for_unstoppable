They say one thing and do another. The only reason they gave me a refund was because a woman basically verbally attacked me in their store for requesting a refund and couldn\u2019t keep her \u201cChristian\u201d mouth shut about what she thought about me requesting a refund.\n\nAnd their feigned polite attitude afterward was more offensive because they made their views clear as they allowed the customer to verbally harass me the whole time.\n\nThe woman called me \u201centitled\u201d for demanding a refund (after being told I could return). Nowhere on my ticket did it mention no returns either. And here\u2019s what I should\u2019ve said: I am 100% entitled to my money. If a small business has an employee that makes a mistake and tells me that I can return an item then they should honor me as a customer and allow me to return the item regardless of what their policy is. Yes, I am entitled to my money back. And an apology to be quite honest, instead of the back-and-forth willy-nilly excuses from their employees about how they just choose not to return things.\n\nIf it were my store I would\u2019ve asked the customer who chose to open her mouth and begin harassing to leave the store or shut their mouth. Because it was uncalled for. But instead they sat there with a smile on their face as they listened.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame what this country has become that everyone feels that they need to have an opinion about everyone else\u2019s life and state it. It\u2019s also a backwards Christian who professes their Christianity is what led them to SHAME someone else based on their own personal view in public. Because that\u2019s absolutely NOT what the cross was for.\n\nI was disgusted once again by Alabamians today.

I work in West Mobile and live in Summerdale, so I hustled across the bay and arrived in the shop around 4:49, ugh traffic is the worst most days. When I called the shop, I informed the person working that 1. I was coming from West Mobile 2. I would be late but would be there before 6 3. I was really excited they closed at 6 4. I couldn't wait to check out the store! So, I walked in and was of course, I am greeted by an extremely RUDE young lady (do I call her a lady?) who blurts out, \"WE ARE ALREADY CLOSED.\" To which I am like, \"Huh? I thought ya'll closed at 6.\" To which she retracted her statement, \"Well, we're not closed, you can look around,\" but she is counting the money out of her drawer. I said, \"I have a card...\" No response.  Anyway, completely threw me off. So I looked around for maybe 4 minutes and was honestly just pissed the entire time. How is that a way to greet someone? I just hurried to get here AFTER I called to let you know I was coming, had someone almost crash into me on the way, and you have the audacity to be so extremely rude? I will not give this place any business and neither should you. I will take my business to the other Hertha's locations that are apparently run by Second Edition's ex-wife or something. I am sure that the young women there are much more pleasant and would not turn customers away, nor close their stores early.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a41a8fd841747:0x18eb077a09680940"}
