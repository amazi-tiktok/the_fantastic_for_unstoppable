The nice delivery man even came back to move dumpster to place it exactly where we needed it for easiest reach. When I needed to extend the rental past 1 week just a bit, owner graciously worked with me with zero hassle. After pickup, they cleaned so you could not even tell there was a bin. Was worth every penny in time saved and less stress, instead of trying to haul out truck loads of rubbish to dump off site.

With initial discussions we were quoted and paid for a team of 6, but on moving day only 3 were there, 1 of whom spent most of his time in the truck rather than helping move. After a sight visit and quote, we were told we would be cutting it close with 1 truck but that she thought we could get it all. So to ensure we would be okay, my husband and I rented, loaded and moved a 12 foot covered trailer from uhaul in advance. But they still couldn't fit it all in the truck. We have had to haul another 15 foot uhaul truck plus will have to make several more loads in our SUV or pickup to get the rest. No one in the company has been apologetic in the least, and in fact have responded rudely, untruthfully, and completely inappropriately to our petition for their consideration of the inconveniences that their misquote has caused us... Oh, and by the way, their inability to properly drive a truck resulted in relatively significant damage to our property. At first, my husband and I were willing to overlook their errors and their incompetence, however their dishonesty is what has resulted in this post.

Their employees are inexperienced, clumsy, and unable to handle simple problems. If you have an issue, you will be directed to some call center down in Tampa, FL, who are absolutely incompetent as well. The Call Center can, and will only, call the local franchise owner to express your complaint. This franchise owner, never reaches out to his customers, despite the fact that my wife and I both got his cell phone number and left numerous messages.\n\nNow on to what actually happened.\n\nMy wife's parents recently moved and we needed to move her piano out of their house, so we hired College Hunks to move the piano. We expressly told them that it was to move a piano and that was the only thing that needed to be moved.\n\nThe scheduled day approaches. They said they would be there at 4:30. When 5:30 eventually rolled around, so did they. ((Strike One))\n\nThey then moved the piano out of the house and down the first step for a total of about 15 feet. Then for some inexplicable reason, could not move it any further. Not only that, but it was ONLY THEN that they realized that they had no way of getting the piano up on their truck. So they came to a job knowing that they were going to move a piano without the proper equipment and without enough people.\n\nThen comes the worst part of all. Instead of moving the Piano back inside where they originally moved it from. THEY LEFT IT OUTSIDE!\n\nThey Left the damn piano and said that they would be back tomorrow!\n\nWait, it gets better.....\n\nThe next day rolls around and again they say they will be there between 3:30 and 4:30. Well, 5:30 comes and goes and still no word from these stooges. That is when my wife and I started calling that call center and reaching out to the Franchise Owner and even the guy driving the truck.\n\nThey said they were running late and would be there at 6:30. We then asked them if they had a different truck or additional equipment. They told us what they were bringing and IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAD THE DAY BEFORE.\n\n7:00 PM comes along and still no word. We call that Call Center again, and this time they tell us that they had to reschedule and that they would be there the following day, which would have left this piano OUTSIDE for TWO Days!\n\nI finally had enough of these inept morons and called up someone who also owned a moving service. He was able to get out to the house the following morning and move the thing in less than an hour.\n\nTo sum up:\n\nThis company absolutely sucks. Incompetent Employees + Incompetent Ownership and Service. They left my wife's piano OUTSIDE for TWO Days before we finally had enough of their nonsense and hired another company.\n\nI will never use College Hunks again, nor will anyone that I know.\n\nAfter I am done with this review, I will actually be looking into filing a claim against these morons for the scratches that they also put on the piano during their re-enactment of a Monty Python Sketch.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjMMa7LkPZKbI4_q-0AA5lPjSfFBVVIL6CoI2f=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8oJEZPtCRlBvWJ52jF5l2hUQNTZ3NRB06feEh=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCW8NgNglF_OtX0HNlGIbtt_Ssdg7udlz9XPMz=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891ec334a7d1c7:0xd295fc628abd4f5c"}

The guys who did the move were friendly, but sometimes that is not enough.  I hired this company to pack the apartment and move it downstairs in the same building, I ended up having to pack and move almost everything by myself.  The only thing the movers ended up moving where the pieces that were too large for me to do by myself.  In fact, I had to hire a random Uber driver to help move things so I can get out an hour early to make my flight which the owner and manager is new prior to the move, but did not care.  They talk a good game, but cannot walk the walk.  Be wary of all these excellent reviews, if you look on Yelp you will see true reviews.

I truly feel like the guys didn't want to come across town and do any work when it only took one guy to remove the items from my house in less than 30mins. The employees not only lost this company some money no matter how small but they also are giving them a bad name.

Trey met with me, helped generate a game plan, and has stood behind his word at every moment.\n\nHis team is top-notch, works extremely hard, and is always courteous to me and the other employees. They are considerate of the facility and the other equipment, show up on time as scheduled, and always perform at the best of their ability. If you have junk that needs to be removed, Trey provides a service that takes care of all of your needs at a price that is highly competitive.
