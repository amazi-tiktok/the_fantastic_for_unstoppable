I have even shadowed the large animal vet rocking s uses and she does a fine job. the stalls are always, always cleaned twice a day. I know this because Im usually cleaning them. if suzanne ever lacks help she will muck stalls on her own. she cares for her horses and only gives jobs to the people who clean the stalls correctly, which some how seemed to be quite hard for some. yes the kids help w chores but that's part of the whole horse riding experience. it's great that she includes the kids in this. it teaches them responsibility. by taking care of the animals the kids bond with them and learn the necessities of taking care of horses. farriers come to the barn regularly for saddlebreds and the other horses. it is a wonderful little barn full of wonderful people. the negative reviews on here are honestly absurd and obviously don't know what they're talking about.\n\nalso a negative reviewer posted a picture on here. horses who live in pastures are going to get scratched. it's absolutely inevitable. I've owned many horses before who have been pasture boarded and different barns and can say this w full knowledge. it is not evidence that rocking s farm is unsuitable. the horse doesn't need a vet to some out it only needs for the wound to be cleaned and medicated (which it has been).", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888926b13ffc3793:0x3b11f57783e3b6d6"}
