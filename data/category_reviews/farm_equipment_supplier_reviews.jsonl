After calling to check on the status after a week, I was informed a few days later Of the total cost. And then took an additional two weeks for the repairs to be completed. In closing, it took 19 days to do two hours worth of work.  I was never notified nor updated.  When I picked up my lawnmower the only greeting I was met with was your total was $284.80.

We do our best to provide top notch service to all our customers, but there are rare times when a parts associates may get in a rush or is having a bad day and may forget the niceties. Please accept my apology for Jonathan\u2019s subpar customer service.\n\nThere are a lot of factors that go into pricing our used tractor parts, the cost of the tractor, transport, disassembly time, storage, and so on. The cost of the tractor is the biggest one, and the rarer the tractor the higher the cost which directly affects the price of each part. However, we are human and could have made a mistake when pricing the part. I don\u2019t know which part you are referring to or I would comment on it further. Please give me a call and I will review the cost of the part in question and see if I can give you a better deal on it.\n\nAgain, my apologies for your experience, and I hope you will give us another chance.\n\nDean Mangum, President, Cross Creek Tractor, 1-800-462-7335"}, "gmap_id": "0x8889c617e8a5155b:0x49e27fb9da8f3843"}

Instead of trying to \"sell up\", they taught me what each set was for. They wanted to make sure I was well informed on my blades. I asked them why and they said \"Knowledge about your purchase will make you a better owner, and you will take better care of it because you now have skin in the game or so they say.\"\nIf you want the full  old timey correct customer experience, Fredricks is your place.

A week and a couple follow-up calls later, they still don't know what is wrong with my mower.  A couple days later, I'm told it's the auto choke in the carb although there is a choke on the handle.  A few days later, they are still waiting on the Honda parts rep to call them back.  Next day, I'm promised an estimate; I hear nothing.  I call the next business day (Monday) when I'm told i will have an estimate by the end of the day, but I told them if I didn't hear back that afternoon (2+ weeks later), I was picking my mower and not paying the diagnostic fee.  Do you think I got a call?  Nope.  At least they're consistent. I picked up the broken mower the next day without paying.  I would avoid this place, for service, like the plague.\n\nAlso of note, they do not use computers to document your equipment's problem, part number, or your contact info; they use a small notebook.

Prior to this I physically visited SunSouth to purchase a mower but was told that I would need to go to a place like Lowes or Home Depot. I used my mower 3 times and noticed that the engine was leaking oil. On 29 Sep (when I noticed the leak), I called Lowes since I also purchased an extended warranty. They said that they would have someone come out to pick it up and that they would call the day before they were supposed to pick it up (scheduled for today 4 Oct) and give me a time. They were also supposed to call the day of pick up to let me know they were on the way.\n\nStill haven't received a phone call and it it currently 4:21 pm. They close at 5 pm. My wife called Lowes back today at about 3:40 pm and they said they would contact them again and if we didn't hear from them that Lowes would call someone else.\n\nNeedless to say, I am NOT happy at all.
