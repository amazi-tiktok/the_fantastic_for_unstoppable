So I ask him did they not put onions on the sandwiches anymore,  and he stated yes, so he grabbed a knife that had been hanging on the wall, so I thought he was going to clean it, it was already dirty, I said are you going to clean that, he stated to me, very nasty, its what I have used all day, I said, I don't care, don't use it on my food, he then he got mad and stated to the other employee who was standing there, finish this order and then I really wanted my money back, He stated he didn't want to fool with the register, so I ask for corporate number, and he stated I am corporate, I stated okay, but I am going to take this further than you, I took those sandwiches and fed them to my dog.
