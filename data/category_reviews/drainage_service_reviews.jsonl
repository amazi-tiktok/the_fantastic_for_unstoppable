Then I came home to find that the grate to catch water coming off the sidewalk was about 1 and a half to 2 inches away from the sidewalk, requiring the water to run over dirt before entering the grate.  The owner tried to tell me that it would be no problem and the bare dirt would not erode despite water constantly running over it.  I insisted that concrete be put between the sidewalk and grate to keep the water from washing out the dirt.  When I came home, I found they had used a type of caulk between the grate and the sidewalk, and had done a messy job of it, I don't know if that much caulk will ever cure.  After two days it is still soft.  Additionally, where they cut through the curb, the re-concreting was extremely poorly done.  It looked like they didn't even use a trowel, much less a curbing tool.  It looked like they basically packed the concrete on with their fingers and left it.  Part of the contract called for doing a brick border along the sidewalk.  After I paid them for the portion of the contract for the drainage, they informed me that they were waking away from the contract and that I needed to find someone else to do the edging.  The pity is, the subcontractor they had lined up to do the masonry work actually sounded very competent.  Bottom line, this is a company that, in my opinion, cut corners at every opportunity, poorly designed the project, provided shoddy workmanship, and then walked away with nearly half of the contracted work unperformed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626519de7ef85b:0x4b6cae1b92594858"}

I contracted with them to do drainage work, a sprinkler system and landscape lighting.\n\nI was told this would take 3 weeks to complete, with each phase occurring on consecutive weeks. The project as a whole took almost 12 weeks to complete, and this was only because I hounded them with calls multiple times per week.\n\nThe drainage work was the first part, it seemed to be fine, though the French drain was not placed the complete length that was discussed originally. Also the fingers of river rich were put in to stop erosion, but almost no grass seed was put in afterwards, so nothing but weeds grew in between the river rock.\n\nThe second piece was the sprinkler system. This was put in during a day, but the ground was not backfilled properly and they needed to come back out to fix it. We were told that they would put down grass seed after the lighting job was completed. The lighting work was not completed for another 8 weeks, and there wasn\u2019t any seed put down afterwards. They were also supposed to aerate and oversees the lawn, but since they could not get their mower into our backyard, they told us they would come back with a smaller mower to pull the aerator later. This never happened.\n\nI had to call them 2-3 times a week for 8 weeks to get them to complete the lighting. Part of it was landscape lighting, the other portion was putting in a fan and spotlight in/on our screened patio. The wiring was placed so shallow, that it came out of the ground within a week and they had to come back to fix. The light and fan was supposed to be put in by an electrician, but was just put in by the owner and his friend. They put a cheap conduit over the electrical wire that didn\u2019t even cover the wire.  They sent an electrician out to fix the wiring, but he just rigged another kind of conduit on the bare wire to cover it up.  The uplighting for the trees was sold to us at $65 a light. I just found the lights online for $45 for a 4-pack of lights.\n\nWe just gave up with this company and figured we would just be stuck with this work. Over the last year, I kept burying and covering up the wire as it came out of the ground and have been trying to repair the grass in the area where they did sprinkler and drainage work. We are still fighting massive weeds from the lack of follow through on planting grass after their work was completed.\n\nI am writing this review today after I just finished replacing 3 lights that stopped working and half of the wiring that was put in for the landscape lights. Turns out they believe that wire nuts are not necessary and you only need to tape wires together with electrical tape before putting it in the ground.\n\nIf you are looking for a company to do landscaping work for you, stay very far away from this company. You will only be sorry if you choose them.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1533529694432, "text": "Thank you for bringing all of this to our attention.  Unfortunately scheduling can be a challenge when dealing with different elements and sometimes issues arise.

The ceiling fan was installed by a certified electrician, as was the wiring for the fan, flood lights and outdoor switch.  We would be more than happy to provide the name of the electricians that provided these services.   The contract states that there is a year warranty covering defects in workmanship and materials.   Is regrettable that we did not have the opportunity to fix the issues that you were having with your lights, thus alleviating some of your frustration.

While he cannot help that he encountered a mess and that it was me who invited him to out my appointment off til later, I never heard back from him as promised. When I reached out to their office receptionist/customer service specialist, they apologized but did not offer me a \"make-up\" appointment. Rather, they indicated they were scheduling people (customers calling after my missed appointment) already into the following Tuesday and it would be after that date. They told me they had been scheduling others since my appointment and it would be 2-3 days before they could work me back in. I would rather bail buckets of water to my back porch for the rest of the week than do business with a company that accepts this as customer service. Thus, I cancelled my interest in following through with the repairs. There was also an issue with price discrepancy. The web listed free estimates. It seemed reasonable however they would charge $60.00 to come from the Gadsden to Leeds area but the technician indicated it would be $89.00. He did offer to honor the price but it was dishonored by not showing up or calling. It is of course unclear if this was the intent. I will say they were all very nice if you just want to talk to nice and seemingly knowledgeable people about plumbing.\n\nAddendum: \"I see that a reply has been offered by the owner, \"I'm sorry, call and we will make it right\" Before spending more time talking about the idea of services, I would need to know how this would be made right. For instance, if I have received the repairs elsewhere (since this was well over a month ago), will I receive some reimbursement for such? I cannot imagine someone being so generous as to do such a thing.\nOr if I have not had the repairs done, will I receive an offer no one could possibly refuse in exchange for the prior bad service. Maybe if I have an idea about whether the call is worthwhile vs a pre-scripted customer service response, I might call.

No damage was noted except for the fire pit cover we caught the squirrel tearing up the previous weekend.\n\nJim gave me two options on how to get rid of our furry new houseguest; we could capture him alive and release him elsewhere or set a trap similar to a rat trap that should kill him instantly. After much discussion my husband and I decided on the rat trap since the evenings here have been very cold and the poor squirrel may freeze to death in a live trap. Jim was so very patient as we weighed our options and was able to give me the pros and cons on both methods.\n\nAfter one failed attempt to trap him (the trap caught his tail instead of his neck) Jim text me throughout the evening to reassure me that he would get him the next day and that all would be OK. Jim returned promptly the next morning, set the trap again and was able to get the squirrel instantly. He disposed of everything and cleaned the nest out of the gutter.\n\nJim was so very pleasant to work with I will definitely be calling again if any other squirrel decides to make his home here!\nI would recommend Jim and Exclusive Wildlife to anyone who is looking for good, quality, and prompt service.\n\nThank you Jim!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBbVC-1NoRZZKkz46lqwpMR0kKMUXVSo0HNWyH=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpMImbqi6WT6TFmbGFntrWu9R1ePdVJL0QITRP=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1548888877159, "text": "Thank you Mike & Stephanie Freeman, it was my pleasure helping you rid your home of your unwelcomed guest and it was nice meeting you."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a1b2dea85547d:0x4c0bde02d4614206"}
