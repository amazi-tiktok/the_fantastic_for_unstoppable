I brought my girlfriend here to partake in splatter painting as one of our anniversary activities. The reservation process was quick and effortless on their website. You walk in and have your temp taken, you're given a squirt of sanitizer for your hands and then you sign your waiver if you did not already complete this step online. After completing the waiver a super friendly employee directed us to a table that had been set up with a cute anniversary sign, decorations, chocolate, champagne and our blank canvas. We were then able to add designs with tape that would be peeled off post splatter painting while enjoying our glass of champagne. Once we finished our champagne, part 2 of the fun began. We were taken to the splatter paint room where we put on our protective wear over our clothes, shoe protectors and goggles. While an employee went over the basics, we were given a bluetooth speaker to play music,  they exited, turned off the lights, we blasted our music and the anniversary paint party began! You reserve the room for an hour so you can splatter till you can't splatter anymore. Once finished, one of the owners came in to grab our masterpiece to place on the table to have the tape peeled off and allow it to dry a little. We took off all protective gear, wiped what little paint got on our faces off and decided to sit at their cute bar station to have a couple margaritas and a beer. They have a decent selection of snacks and drinks. The strawberry margaritas were sooooo good. You can easily kill some time while your paint is trying to dry. My girlfriend and I got the pleasure of meeting and speaking to the owners who happen to be husband and wife. They were nothing short of a delight! Wonderful personalities, warm and welcoming. They informed us about their various craft classes that another group was doing. This particular group was making candles and they let us know what a great and fun experience they had. My girlfriend and I will certainly be back to try one of the crafts out. If you're looking for something fun and different,  come here. The owners deserve all of Bham's business! Can't wait to return. Thank you all for such an amazing experience!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888917b632a9ec61:0x6a33f26353436292"}
