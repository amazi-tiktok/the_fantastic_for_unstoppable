Been going to him over 10 years. He is now retired and doing part time but I\u2019m still with him   He takes the time that is needed to see someone. He listens and if necessary will send you to a specialist  who have been qualified and good like him.   His staff is also top notched  if you need to talk with them they do return the call in a short time. Bot like some that might take two days", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4e1c8e41591d:0x21bfcc25c0f26ed"}
