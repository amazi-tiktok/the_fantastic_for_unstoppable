When we applied it was $10 a month. After 3 months the price rose to $35 without notification of any kind. We kept the membership despite the price jump because the service was really nice. However, beginning last month my husband attempted to take his vehicle after work to get it washed and vacuum etc, and they were closed early. We assumed it was just a fluke; i.e. someone had an emergency and had to leave early. It was not. He went three consecutive days to try and wash his car and they were already closed. The business hours posted online are not their business hours apparently. So, we decided to go take both our cars Sunday morning at 8am when they open. Noone was there. So we waited until 9 thinking that they must be running late. Still noone showed up. That makes 4 Times we have taken our cars without a wash. I reccomend not getting the monthly subscription. If I can ever get them on the phone I will request a refund for the last month for both vehicles since I can't reach them in person.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6s19YiG2UrC5RNcfIMKt1hvi3g43kM3i1aVpF=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a6baebc26a439:0xe4f004828d036096"}

There were spots 2 feet long that weren't even washed, the bottom of the tailgate was dirty, my mirrors were not clean, the front windshield had water spots baked onto it and the dash was still dusty.

They proceeded to go back over the truck and clean it up.  I told them to make sure the front side of the mirrors were clean.  I noticed what looked like steel wool laying on the table next to where they were washing.  Didn't think much about it, but when I got home and looked at my truck again, my drivers side mirror looked like they had used the steel wool to try and get the bugs, etc. off the mirror.  I called to speak to the owner and he won't call me.  I sent them a message on Facebook asking for the owner to call me.  I was read, but no one ever called.  I guess I'll have to take the truck and attempt to have the mirror buffed out or repainted, at my cost.  This carwash is garbage and the ownership is pathetic.

The interior looks better than when we bought it! The seats are spotless and soft. The carpet looks great. The cup holders on the floor between the second row seats are now pristine, which is a huge deal since my older two climb over that space to get to their seats. Our Weather Tech mats look new again. The exterior looks great as well. Marcus (owner) was incredibly friendly each time I spoke with him. We chatted several times about what the van would need, and he never pressured us into any services. He even called this afternoon after my husband got home to see what I thought.

Head out the window and upchuck, but it somehow managed to not only get EVERYWHERE in the SUV (I am talking back of the headrests, back seats, entire cargo area, and CEILINGS), but also from the front of the car and windshield to the bumper .. and he was in the back seat .. while I was doing 70 mph!! Quite impressive to say the least!  Well, he had the choice to clean it himself, or have it detailed .. he chose detailed (roflmao).  We took it to Pro Car Care and I honestly though there was no way my vehicle would ever be the same .. they proved me wrong!! It looked (and smelled) like it did rolling it off the lot with 10 miles on it!!  The owner, his wife, and all the employees are delightful!!

Employees recognized it and were quick to grab you a towel and in some cases even dry the car by hand for me as a sign of excellence service .  At the time it was managed by a very nice and professional young lady.  The place was also packed with cars which is a great sign for business .  Out of know were if you asked for a towel to dry the water there dryer missed after spending 18.00 dollars they wanted an extra 5 dollars to simply use a used towel. Not to purchase towel to keep but 5 bucks just to use the towel.  I never came back except one time to wash my company truck in a pinch.    I then noticed they had a towel program you pay monthly and the place clearly had lost a ton of business as its usually not very busy.  So sad an arrogant greedy cheap owner didnt learn the basics of running a business in business school.   1 year later today I took my personal truck that I was going to dry myself at home the same truck that had been through the wash many times before they turned my truck away after paying them.   They informed me they know longer except trucks with oversize aftermarket tires which over 30 percent of trucks these days have .  No other car wash has that policy .  Either tire fits on the track or it doesnt .  Reason for decision was having to replace rollers more often than without trucks with 34 inch tires or bigger going through the wash .  So being a cheap wad which is very common in his culture is resulting in lost business.  Clearly a hard headed person .\n\nA simple paper hand written sign could have been posted but instead I waited 5 minutes for them to refund my money then had to drive through vacuums at a sharp angle which almost resulted in my truck hitting there pole.  Not one person tried to guide me or be on the lookout for what I couldn't see. It's now  Ran by a bunch of high school kids who can give zero ducks about customer service .   I now use Anthony in Pelham but was making exception today as I was in a pinch.   Best wash is mister car wash on 280 but I dont leave on that side of town.

I made the appointment and wednesday was there at 8:30am as scheduled. No one was there. At approximately 9 am employees showed up and took my car. Inwas told that the credit card scanner wasn\u2019t working so I would need to bring cash.\n\nAt 430 i called and was advised my car was done. When i got there I spoke with the man cleaning the exterior of my car. I asked if they cleaned the trunk jambs as I noticed a large deposit of mud when i got groceried the other day. He said yes. I then waited about 10 minutes for my car. I watched the man open the trunk and then wipe the trunk jambs...?\n\nIt was an overcast day and the car looked good... until I got home. My chrome exhaust was still black (i rubbed with my finger and it comes off), the fuel tank door was dirty (once again my finger lifted the dirt there), large spots on the chrome grill looked untouched, large spots on the lower door panels were untouched, smears on the windshield,and spots on the rims were untouched.

She called back a few hours later and advised that the owner/manager said i can bring the car back. I advised that i didnt have all day to leave my car to be washed and waxed again. (I highly doubt it was even waxed as there was so many spots that were unwashed... the wax would have stuck to it). I told her honestly the interior looked great and id be ok with paying for that service but need to be reimbursed for the remainder. She basically told me that wasnt an option and that thisnis how the manager handled things. He doesnt talk to customers and just has her. I explained that im offering to pay for the work that was done correctly... most customers would just want a total refund. However, if she cant authorize that and the manager wont even talk to me to settle the issue, ill just have my CC company cancel the payment.\n\nI feel sad for Brittney as im sure she is put in this situation often.\n\nMy advice, stay away.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88621257eb4fc911:0x30d2bc60e10a06b4"}

My dash and console was all spotty, and covered in a mix of dust and cleaning spray. They did not open my hatch and vacuum the back. The front was vacuumed but not well.

I have leather seats, and they did not so much as wipe them down. My back seat had dirt in it from where I had sat a pair of boots. It's still there.

First of all, the package was 124.00!!! So right off the back I'm thinking they MUST be excellent at their job. I was sadly mistaken! I dropped the car off in the morning after making an appointment online. I asked the guy on duty about what time the car would be done. He said \"about 1pm\". I was cool with that. So I left and went to run errands. Around 1:30pm I called the place to find out the status. The woman who answered the phone put me on hold for over 5 min so I hung up and drove to the place to see how things were going. When I got there there was an older woman complaining about a previous job they did to her car. I just remember her saying \"someone owes me 10 bucks to fix this\". Anyway, one worker sees me and says \"would you like to see your car?\" I said yes and followed him into the garage. The car STILL had the dark brown stains on the carpets! Before I can point it out he says \"I couldn't get it out. You should try dying the carpet.\" I was upset because the car also looked like they didn't vacuum well... if at all! Then there were dirt spots on my back window. The door jams were STILL dirty! The tires were dirty and the front bumper!  I ran my finger on both and lifted black dirt from those areas! They uses the wrong cleaning material on my middle console that caused paint to come off. I was very upset and dissatisfied snice I left it there for almost 6 hours already! I asked to speak with the manager. I told him this was no where near a good job for that price. After some deliberation, he agreed to knock off 25.00. This was a bit of a relief, but honestly, that was a 50.00 job (at best). THEN... about 2 hours later, that woman calls me back and says \"your car is ready for pickup\". I told her I already picked it up. She said \"oh I guess I called the wrong person\". I'm so annoyed with this place! They are so unorganized.

On 3 July I took my GS350 to have the tint removed from my rear glass and have it replaced with ceramic tint that I purchased from tintzoom online for $200.00. When I arrived the owner and I agreed on a price of $190.00 to do all window with the exception of the left front and left rear (I had already installed it) with the tint I supplied. Having done over 50 tint jobs at a reputable local shop while in college (10 years ago) I know the proper way of installing tint, but being a little rusty I decided to take it to a professional to ensure the tint was removed properly (Steamer or Ammonia and Black Bag). After pulling the car into the shop to start the job I noticed the CARWASH DETAILER with a razor blade hacking at the tint in the rear window. I immediately asked him to stop and asked the owner to take over before he ruin the rear glass defroster. I then left with my ride that was waiting (big mistake) and had him take me to the bank to get cash for the job.  When I returned my car was supposedly ready. I looked at my rear package and it was covered with tint scrapings and my defrost lines were no longer black they were gold (as in no longer working from scraping with a razor). I also noticed that my 3rd brake light was torn to pieces, and there were several pieces of tint left on the window with new film laid on top of it. Soon after I spoke with the manager to inform him of my displeasure with the services rendered. The first thing I asked the owner about was my 3rd brake light and his answer was \u201cWe had to break it to put the film on.\u201d The second was my defroster his response was\u201d We had to get the tint off.\u201d The third issue with this humbling experience was the patches of old tint eft on the window with new tint installed over it, in which I received no response from the owner. My response to the owner was \u201cI am not paying for this,\u201d so he decided to vacuum some of the tint from the rear package tray and reduce the price to $165.00 since he broke my $250.00 3rd brake light. After I still refused to pay we both called the police (Little did he know I was on the phone with a good friend who is deputy chief of police). So between the times the police arrived he decided to rip the tint off the windows and throw my $200.00 ceramic tint in the trash, despite his wife warning him not to. When the police arrived he lied about ripping the tint off and even said I didn\u2019t bring any tint to him and stated that he supplied the tint. After looking at the car the officer asked why is there just tint on the driver side windows, I stated that is because those were the windows I did myself. To end the story the officers did nothing (OF COURSE) and stated it was a civil matter which is probably true. Long story short I am out $568.49 to replace the rear glass to get my defrosters back (plus installation), $200.00 for the ceramic tint that he decided to rip from the window and throw in the trash, and $250.00 for my 3rd brake light the he tore up. PLEASE do not go to the poor established called Customized Auto Detail & Window Tinting or you will receive a humbling experience like mine.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b785508b9fb:0xfffd9e0f9eb61f62"}

I took my vehicle here as recommended by a trusted friend. I purchased the highest level service they provided (well over $200), a \"full detail\" as they said. I had my vehicle there a full day with no pressure to have it done at any certain time, as i wouldn't be able to pick it up until i was out of work, well after they had closed. Upon arrival to pick it up, I was immediately concerned. It seemed as if they overlooked quite a few obvious areas. The front-end still had smashed insects and debris on it that easily came off with my fingernail. That lead me to look even closer. Using a flashlight, I noticed quite a few areas where wax was never removed, where hopefully condensation, and not unrinsed soap, dripped down, leaving behind hazy but obvious lines across the paint. The interior of my vehicle was outstanding, with the exception of the entire front winshield being ignored and unclean. I am just disappointed. I apologize in !\nadvance for not having enough faith in this shop to bring my vehicle back there, even for them to correct these issues. I do believe that this may be the best place in town for a basic car wash, but i would not reccomended them to someone expecting expertly trained, skillful, adept work or to even get what they paid for.

I have never been so disrespected. I don\u2019t know the manager here\u2019s name but he does not deserve a job at this place and I\u2019m sure if the owner knew how he acted towards customers he wouldn\u2019t. My car was damaged while entering the car wash due to this guy (the manager) guiding me in Completely crooked. As soon as I got out I noticed the damage. When I approached him and said something about it he just exploded. I\u2019ve never seen someone get so defensive. This whole time I was being calm and respectful. He knew he was in the wrong and immediately started trying to shift the blame to me. I could tell the guy obviously had some issues and decided to just leave. I said \u201cdon\u2019t even worry about it. It\u2019s fine\u201d Well this is when things took a weird turn. He immediately started cursing me up and down referring to me as \u201cyou people\u201d telling me I was trying to set him up for money and calling me a liar. I could not believe how aggressive this guy was being and just how he was reacting in general all because I called him out for his wrong doings. As I was getting in my car to get the heck away from this crazy guy, he was still yelling about how I had scratches on all my rims and that I couldn\u2019t prove it happened then. (Even though I could prove it. He just didn\u2019t know that.) I just wanted to leave at that point. I mean I have never in my life been treated in such a way. This guy does not deserve to have a job. I can\u2019t imagine if it was my grandma or somebody else that he was treating like that. Also they don\u2019t \u201cgive out names\u201d at this business, as I could not get the managers name that damaged my car nor the owners name. Maybe it\u2019s just me but that seems a bit shady.

In addition I am the treasurer of a local credit union and we have used Alabama Auto Clean when we needed to sell a repossessed vehicle. They always do an amazing job cleaning the vehicles and I have always been happy with the services they provide. Unfortunately when I recently had my Yukon XL detailed I left the trailer hitch cover and another item in the third row seat. Again they did a great job with the detailing but the items that were left in the car were missing when it was delivered back to me. I am not sure if Ricky is still there but I wasn't able to talk to him at any point during this visit. It is a shame that someone would take items from the vehicles they are responsible for but when I asked about the missing items I was told they were not there. Just the hitch cover is $115 plus the body shop cost to paint to match the Yukon. I am sure I can find another detail shop that is honest and does as good of a job.\n\nThis issue was resolved - Ricky saw my review and, as I expected he would, corrected the situation. Since they do remove everything from your vehicle prior to detailing I would recommend not leaving anything inside. There is always a possibility that something can get lost or misplaced.\nThank you Ricky", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4dc42d4b5fab:0xdb32e8965d9285cb"}

I arrived and paid at 4:45, and was through the automated car wash and in line at the full service lane within 10 minutes, with one car in front of me. It was a full hour before my car made it up to the station to be cleaned. The length of time doesn\u2019t bother me so much as the fact that the lanes were moving at very different speeds. This meant 6 people who arrived after me (one an hour after I did) still got their cars finished first. I understand that the lanes cannot move at the same speed, as not every car takes the same amount of time to clean, but it was very frustrating to watch so many people arrive and leave before my car was even started. I\u2019d highly recommend keeping the cars in a single file line so they can move forward as spots open up rather than trapping them in a lane that isn\u2019t moving. I will potentially give this place another chance, but will definitely be requesting the left lane if I do so! Additionally, it would be great if you could place an ATM inside. Before I became dissatisfied with the service, I walked to the nearby gas station to try to get cash to tip and the ATM was out of order. That\u2019s my fault for not thinking ahead, but I\u2019m sure there are other people who would like to tip but who don\u2019t have cash, and I\u2019m sure the employees would appreciate it.\n\nUpdate: Great customer service\u2014was contacted directly and feel like they took my feedback seriously.

I've had an interior detail from other places before, and this place is mediocre for the price you pay.  I get a little picky when I have to pay almost $200 for something, as this is a major splurge for me that I do only once a year, if that.  However, the staff was really friendly. When I pulled up, they asked what I was most worried about.  I said the dirt and getting my seats and carpets shampooed.  I said I would get the dog hair later.  I probably should have been clearer, as I didn't want to pay the extra 20+ for the dog hair cleaning.  They inspected the car and charged me for the dog hair (about 30 bucks).  I went ahead and paid as I was there and thought, might as well let them get the dog hair if I'm going to pay for it.  When I got the car back, there was still quite a bit of hair in the floor board and mats. I'm going to have to go in and remove it, which is what I had planned to do, but still got charged for it.  With all that to say, they still did a great job cleaning the dash, doors, and seats. It smelled much much better too. However, the windows, when rolled down, still had all of the grime at the top. I was kinda bummed, as this is one of the small things I was looking forward to having cleaned.  I can clean it easily, but again, it was part of a splurge that I was hoping would take care of it.\nThis is where I'm gonna sound real nit picky, but the presentation could have been a little better. Every place I've ever gotten an interior detail from (that I paid less for), they presented the car to me and did something of a walk through with me. If there was some dirt, spots, or stray hairs, they took care of it on the spot.  They didn't do this. There was still a little dirt in the floor board of the driver's side from where they were in and out of the car to move it and a couple of places that I would have liked to ask about. The back mats just looked kind of tossed in. Usually, the mats are placed in the trunk so the floorboards can dry, so it did take longer for my car to dry than it has before.\nI would recommend it with an \"eh\" and shoulder shrug, but I probably won't be back.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889226c05490431:0x6c9f60969359efe7"}

Normally, when I come to Riverchase, I get the standard car wash ($19.99).  No problems.   However, for my wife that day, I decided to upgrade my car wash to the $26.99 deal. (made it a little more special for my wife).\nUpon receipt of my car, I noticed that part of one of the primary knobs (power knob) for my radio system had been damaged.  I immediately brought this to Riverchase Car Wash\u2019s attention.  Riverchase Car Wash personnel attempted to repair the radio knob.  However, after 24 hours, I determined that the repair was not satisfactory.  The radio knob was still not available for normal use.  I promptly notified Riverchase Car Wash  management.  They stated that they would be notifying senior management for a resolution.\n\nAfter a few days, I followed up with Riverchase.  They stated that senior management would NOT resolve the issue because they did not believe that Riverchase Car Wash caused the damage.\n\nOK, I have NO REASON TO LIE!!!!!!!  FAIR IS FAIR!!!  This is a 2006 Lincoln Zephyr, TAKEN CARE OF VERY VERY WELL.  There would be NO LOGICAL REASON for this type damage to happen.  After review by radio experts, it was determined that the detailing service caused the damage to the vehicle.\n\nHonestly, in my opinion, this is nothing more than POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE on the part of Riverchase Car Wash Management.  Taking care of your customers should be a CARDINAL RULE. (Particularly regular customers)  Fair, HONEST business should be key.\n\nBelieve me, I will make it my business to tell all my family members, friends, and work colleagues to NOT use Riverchase Car Wash for any car care services.  I will send them to Anthony\u2019s Car Wash or other customer focused establishment instead.   You just LOST me and a lot of future customers.\n\nI have respectfully requested a refund for the car wash and repairs(which was barely $120) with no response from Riverchase Car Wash!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889226c05490431:0x6c9f60969359efe7"}

Stopping in car washes can mess up your paint and tires. I'm lucky that mine wasn't messed up. However, they should either put up something over that sign saying it's broken. And/or tell people before they go in that it's broken. And not put people in there back to back. Also... I was blowing my horn repeatedly while in there and it's like no one that worked there noticed. If they had been paying attention maybe they could have hit a stop button.

If you want to feel like a valued customer and not be treated like a thief and have your integrity attacked, I strongly advise you t spend your money elsewhere. There are plenty of other car washes in Tuscaloosa. If this is the last car wash left on earth i think its best to never wash your car again than to deal with these people.  Let me explain...\n\nI purchased the daily unlimited plan from Overflow during summer 2020. I dont really wash my car so often but with the pandemic i did not want to keep using my card in the machine or dealing with workers. A staff member came out and put a sticker in my car. He did not do a very good job at placing the sticker and it was not flush on the windscreen. I did not think this was a big deal since if it was then i would think the employee would replace it with a new sticker there and then.\n\nFast forward a few weeks later and thats when pestering from the Overflow workers began. One specific female worker kept accusing me of removing the sticker from my car. I tried to explain that the sticker has never touched since the day it was put on and she refused to believe me. I told her to change the sticker to a proper one, but she didnt.\n\nRecently, in the last days of September 2020, a new person started pestering me and that gentleman told me he was the owner.  He told me that \"5000\" vehicles have stickers from his company and none looks like mine so i must have taken it off to give my friends. Basically, he was questioning my integrity and accusing me of being a thief. I am a PhD student and instructor at UA, and so as an upcoming researcher integrity is super important to me and i got annoyed with the constant questioning of my integrity. I have never been accused of stealing anything in my life so i was very upset over this. I would never compromise my integrity, especially in the way they are accusing me.\n\nThe owner now told me that he could finally change the sticker or give me a refund and cancel my membership; I told him to change the sticker. When he came out with a new sticker he told me that if the new sticker starts to look crumpled after he puts it on then that means i am tampering with it and he would cancel my plan instantly. This then sounds to me like a set up. Clearly he still believes that i am tampering with the sticker and is setting me up to prove him right if the sticker looks misaligned in some way in the future. Anything can happen in the future; a pet or some object could come in contact with the sticker and make it misaligned in the future, and while that probability is very low it is non-zero. I did not want to give these people any opportunity to disparage my integrity further so thats when i told the owner i changed my mind and told him to give me a refund. He went to do it like it was nothing, like i was never a valued customer in the first place. Like i was begging this company for their services and not paying my hard earned money for it. No-one has ever touched that sticker, so their accusations and lack of reconciliation is sad.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a9233a5dece9:0x92f3e345a128e8c6"}
