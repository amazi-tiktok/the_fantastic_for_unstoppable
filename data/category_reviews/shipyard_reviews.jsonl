Other then paying more every month I\u2019d say it wasn\u2019t a bad stay the management is friendly for the most part I never had any issues with them.

It allows us to provide information to future guests.   I'd like to respond to your \"downsides\".\n\nYes, we collect a $20 deposit on the \"key pass\" to the pool, which is similar to a hotel key to provide safe passageway into the pool for authorized users.  What you failed to mention is that you get that $20 back when you return the key, so you're not out any money.\n\nSecondly, the sites are metered, and tenants are charged .16/kWh for power usage, and one is invoiced anything usage over the $50 allowance.  Anyone is welcomed to monitor their usage by taking note of the meter reading.  It's certainly unfair for a 22' unit to have to pay a higher rent to cover the usage of a 42' unit which has 2 or 3 air conditioner units, therefore, we keep all things even by giving each monthly guest a $50 allowance toward their power.  How they use it is up to the tenant.  You were also here during the summer months when temperatures were extremely high and often record-setting, so yes, you would more than likely have a higher power usage to keep the camper cool.\n\nThirdly, the site you were on is one of our smaller and cheaper sites.  We have larger sites as well.\n\nLastly, we are located next to a scrap yard, and they do move scrap around 6 days a week.  Their weekend noise is no different than during the week.  You must have just been off on the weekends to hear it.\n\nAnd yes, we're continuing to make improvements on the property, including the addition of 21 more sites so we may welcome more guests!"}, "gmap_id": "0x886285bb06e87b7f:0x94a3d5c4ffaec253"}
