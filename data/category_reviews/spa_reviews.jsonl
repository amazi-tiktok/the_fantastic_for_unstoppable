She was amazing!!  Great personality, she kept a good conversation going, and gave a nice looking haircut.  The wash prior to my cut was nice, the lady even gave a small massage before the wash.  You may be wondering after saying all that why I would give three stars?...  Well, I'd suggest bringing in a picture of what you want.  Because my hair isn't anything like what I asked for.  I went in with longer hair and she held up an amount to ask if that's what I wanted cut off, to which I agreed (about half an inch at most).  My hair went from around 3.5 inches to .5 inches.  It's so short I can't even put a part without having my hair just spike straight up.  So, I'm most likely going somewhere today to just have it shaved and start over.  On top of all that, I was told it was around a $20 cut, I paid $32 to have someone cut all my hair off.  BUT, I'm willing to bet if you brought in a picture she could probably cut to the picture with ease.  I kinda hate leaving this review, but I'd rather do this and save someone the stress of going from long hair to short hair unintentionally.\n\nUpdate:  I am reducing the stars.  It would seem that if a person actually cared about their business and a customer had such a valid complaint, they would at least reach out and inquire as to what exactly transpired and how it could be fixed.  I left this review over a month ago and have yet to hear from anyone.  Doesn't seem that they actually care about customer satisfaction, hence the drop in personal rating.  I still maintain that the lady who cut my hair was nice, but niceness doesn't really do anything for a bad haircut, or for a displeased customer who didn't even get an \"I'm sorry\"...... Doesn't look like I will be going back to this salon.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81087090f59b:0xae5d8db163a4d91b"}

The service is pretty fast. Im usually out in 20 mins or less and it's less painful then other places I have been to. My only concern is that for me, the hair tends to grow back wayyy faster when I go here compared to other places I've gotten serviced at. There were noticeable hair stubs all over less than a week after my wax as if I had only shaved a few days before, so I kind of felt like I wasted $50 when I could have just shaved at home which is what I'll more than likely have to do in a week anyway because it's growing so fast. The same thing occurred after my first visit as well, but because the customer service is great and the place is clean and well put together, I returned anyway. I don't know if they use a different type of wax from other places or what. When I've visited other places (before and after going to cabana for the first time), I didn't notice hair stubs until at least 2.5-3 weeks after the wax. I'd still recommend the place to others.

We are not a spa; we\u2019re a wax studio, and we do not advertise a spa environment :) most clients love our simple, no frills atmosphere and speedy service. It sounds like you had a facial waxing service. To be clear, our staff constantly sanitizes their hands between services (for their own protection and for that of our clients), and we have a 100 health rating from the Alabama Board of Cosmetology, which is on display in our reception area. Our technicians do not always use gloves during eyebrow wax services, because sometimes wax can get on the fingertip parts of a glove and get smudged onto parts of the brow line that are not meant to be waxed. In other words, in areas such as eyebrows where extra precision is needed to avoid removing too much hair, gloves can make the process more difficult. Gloves are always used during body waxing services. Thanks again for coming to try us out; it sounds like a traditional spa may be more your style!"}, "gmap_id": "0x88626d987dfed2e7:0xe55536739be2f6c7"}

You ladies need to take classes on professionalism because my comment wasn\u2019t rude, simply MY experience. Take constructive criticism so that you can improve not to take it personally because your comment definitely doesn\u2019t encourage me to revisit & I\u2019m sure turns others away.\n\nAlso, it doesn\u2019t matter what service I have, MY experience in comparison to my regular wax lady, who\u2019s a licensed esthetician for 20yrs, to your staff of 5yrs, is a joke. You\u2019re unsanitary & I stand behind MY experience.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1572465745195, "text": "Thank you for trying out our studio. I want to address a few of your comments. First, she\u2019s only been waxing for 5 years? That\u2019s quite a while (and Bri is very experienced), so I\u2019m not sure what you were expecting as far as years of experience. Second, there is no need for a formal \u201cskin analysis\u201d in the room; that\u2019s why we have you fill out a form in reception where we ask, among other things, whether you have used retinol, Accutane, alpha hydroxy acids, etc. in the area(s) to be waxed and whether you\u2019ve ever had a bad reaction to waxing. Even without a formal skin analysis as you call it, our technicians are analyzing your skin during the service and would immediately stop the service if there were any issues. Third, everyone who waxes at Cabana Wax has a current cosmetology or esthetics license, which is what the Alabama State Board of Cosmetology requires. The Board actually visited us a few weeks ago for our 2019 unannounced inspection (we got a 100), and licensure and cleanliness are the two main things they inspect. Your irresponsible comment about licensure insinuates that we are violating the law, which is slanderous, and I encourage you to remove it immediately. Finally, you had a chin wax; the technicians would never leave the treatment room door ajar for a Brazilian wax or any other intimate service. Thanks again for your business."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626d987dfed2e7:0xe55536739be2f6c7"}

While her services are absolutely relaxing (hot towels, yes please!), they go so far beyond that to truly treat your skin in ways that will noticeably improve your complexion. I came to Hannah specifically wanting to target issues I have with acne around my jawline, but the changes I\u2019ve noticed in my skin go so far beyond that. Between my monthly treatments with Hannah and the home care regimen she\u2019s recommended to me, we\u2019ve fixed issues with my skin that I didn\u2019t even realize I had. I\u2019ve gotten multiple compliments on the natural glow I seem to have now, and I owe it all to Hannah. She is truly the best, and I can\u2019t recommend booking an appointment at Glitter and Moss highly enough!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1606539500891, "text": "Sarah, thank you so much for taking the time to review G&M.

They said yes and said that the price had gone up and we would have to pay the extra cost. Of course I had no problem with that. We were both going to upgrade our pedicures to a more expensive service. We had picked out our colors and they had directed us to our chairs. They had already started removing my toenail polish when the same lady that initially told us we could use the gift certificates said that one had expired. My sister decided she wouldn\u2019t have anything done if they were not willing to honor the amount that had already been purchased. Then they said mine had also expired because it had their old location listed. We both left. My sister and I both, along with 2 of her daughters used them exclusively for all our pedicures.

While I was sitting there the second time I came back, almost every person that came in was remembered, asked about details that were happening in their family's lives,  (ex-is your husband feeling well now, one lady came in and was asked how her daughter's leg was doing) I'm not sure what happened but just that they remember and make you feel important speaks volumes! It is very quiet in there is the only downfall there's no background music going. They have movies on screen but no sound with them and that's really the only complaint that I have! Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely go back over and over again!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNducItWYRMPkhIylVmXUsqO7hMWbelONrwo2kp=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWoaZMFw_6B1A0lcFPKxdYWcXTnK-jLdQsNonv=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8861e92c233c309b:0x1d70b9b0c06c02ae"}

She was very apologetic and said they should have told me about the steam room, and she had no idea that the sauna was broken.  She refunded my money and I left.\n\nIt has potential but this place is terrible right now.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889076e104b7747d:0x7abf81efabd42fd"}

The turnover is high which is bad enough but they will cancel your appointment at the last minute and then when I came in for my new rescheduled appointment I wasn\u2019t even acknowledged by the receptionists. Yes plural because there was 2.  The usual receptionist knows me by face so I guess I didn\u2019t think nothing of it when those two said nothing to me since they seemed preoccupied...one with another customer and the other took a call on her cell and stepped away. I waited 30 mins to find out that my rescheduled appointment needed to be cancelled because the tech had a family emergency and she left. Walked right pass me!  I finally got to my breaking point and acknowledged the 2 ladies and they had no excuses that made any sense. One of them said she thought I was someone else so I guess we all look alike to her but ok and the other one said with all honesty she simply said you are right we said nothing to you. She was the one who took the call on her cell. Ok so the only wax tech that was still there had I guess turned her wax up and said she could wax me but I needed to give her wax time to cool or I could reschedule again. I opted to wait another 15 mins to let it cool. I must say she was good and this my first time with her but she was actually super nice and I apologized for getting rowdy to her that is just how good she was. As I was leaving the 2 ladies in the front wanted to offer me something for my inconvenience but I got prepaid wax passes so there no credit that could be given so they opted to give me samples which I took cause no one has ever given me samples at this place. It\u2019s sample though so I dunno if that is something spectacular. I asked for a number for management and they said that the manager would have to call me. That\u2019s been a month ago and no call but my $121 pre paid wax pass payment just hit my card again today.  I see that isn\u2019t being rescheduled!  So I said all this to say I might be calling the number and asking for a manager again and getting funds reversed because I can not keep coming to a sinking ship.

Awkward ...overpriced and unsure of the experience of the technician (this place charges twice the going rate in our area and the service is not half as good as the other places!)\n\nWhen I arrived the check in process was a little intrusive. The girl at the front desk wanted to see my driver\u2019s license? I\u2019ve been to several spas and had many waxes and never have been asked for a copy of my drivers license. That seems a little extreme for a spa service? But okay. I go to the restroom before my appt starts and when I\u2019m walking back to the waiting area someone calls out my name from a room ..It was my technician (first visit at this place and don\u2019t remember her name)? I felt like that was forward (but not so much so that it ruined the appt). However, then I step into my room and the technician tells me to undress from the waist down that she will do my brows first then my Brazillian ?!? So I don\u2019t have a choice in this and have to lay there EXPOSED while my brows are being done?!? Not only that she didn\u2019t go anywhere! She did not leave the room for me to undress and just stayed in there!?! That\u2019s not typical. Every place I\u2019ve ever been (and I\u2019ve been to many saloons and spas) has always left me in the room to undress then they would come in. More so  than that I\u2019m usually given something to cover up with until the service is needed in that area (unless it\u2019s just a Brazillian that we go straight to). I did not like that!! It was strange and the technician didn\u2019t say a word while she was working which makes things even more awkward!! Oh except for the \u201cshave shaming\u201d as if that\u2019s the reason for the horrible pain that I feel when my hair is being ripped out of my skin around my pubic bone! Lol ?!? So the technician had a dry personality (looking back she seemed weird) ..I had to lay on the table exposed while my brows were getting done first (I didn\u2019t have a choice in that or wasn\u2019t told I did). Also, she stays in the room while I change!!! And when it\u2019s over she stays in the room waiting for me to get dressed!! There was absolutely no concern for privacy or customary respect and boundaries. I much prefer the other place that I go (Marci\u2019s Hoover). The prices are better. The experience isn\u2019t creepy weird or demeaning and my technician is friendly and speaks!\n\nOh and heads up anyone who gets a brow wax, the technician removed all of my make up then waxed my brows! I told her that I prefer that she just get the strays outside of my make up. My brows are thinning and I have a particular shape that I prefer! That was not respected at all!! There is NO need to remove the make up first of all. (That\u2019s just some personal preference of the technician). That should be the clients choice! We should be able to change without someone watching us when we arrive and before we leave!! There\u2019s no way this place will stay around much longer if things don\u2019t change! Why would anyone continue to pay twice the price for a worse experience!? It\u2019s a strip mall wax place just like Marci\u2019s ..only they advertise like it\u2019s some type of luxury saloon. It\u2019s not..thank goodness they didn\u2019t try to sell me products or some membership. I hate it when I\u2019m paying for a service and still being subjected to high pressure sales. So that is a bonus. To add to the bad experience my wax took close to 30 minutes! It\u2019s never taken that long anywhere else. I don\u2019t think the technician was very experienced. I also felt it was a little creepy that she didn\u2019t say much at all but that she just stays in the room while I\u2019m changing out and back into my clothes. When I was leaving I felt rushed, she was standing with her hand in the door watching me put my shoes on!! I felt rushed cuz her next appt was there! I mean give a a girl some space!\n\nTo the management: you need to take note of the things I\u2019ve said. The only people  who wouldn\u2019t be bothered by those things likely don\u2019t know any better and probably haven\u2019t been to other saloons.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1563151726525, "text": "Our manager would really like to speak with you more regarding this matter.

Today I had a 11 o\u2019clock appointment and came in at 9 hoping to get in early because I had to go out of town.

I went in with some tension in my shoulders and upper back (pregnancy during a pandemic can be stressful \ud83e\udd23) so I called prior to my appointment to ask if the prenatal massage could be customized and if I could have more of a focus in that  area rather than in my lower back that typically accompanies pregnancy. Of course, the ladies up front that answered my call were incredibly friendly and went out of their way to check with the therapist instead of just placating me with some generic answer. They were also very friendly and professional when I arrived.\nOnce it came time for my massage, Tara explained everything first and made me feel completely at ease and comfortable. I did add on the Lavender aromatherapy and wondered if it would be worth it or not due to wearing a mask. It. Was. Worth. It. Just do it. You won\u2019t regret it. The massage itself was excellent and met all of my standards. There was a time or two that I almost felt like asking her to move on to a different area because the pressure was beginning to be too much for me (it was a good hurt, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m just a wimp), but it was almost as if she was so in tuned with me that she moved on before I got to that point. At checkout, they were offering  a wellness package, and while I passed on it due to the fact that I\u2019ll be having a baby soon and won\u2019t have the availability for a while, it is definitely something I\u2019ll consider in the future.

I asked the doctor's advice about the coverage, and she did not indicate I would need to buy more units. It has been about a month, and I still have movement in all areas injected.  The wrinkles aren't as strong but still there.  Also the areas over the corners of my brows were not treated, and I have this strange Spock look when I raise my brows. Of course, I called after about 2 weeks to let them know that the treated areas still had a lot of movement, and they quickly explained that they do not do any re-treatment with Groupons.  I understand that I  supposedly got a \"deal\" but I also still paid for a service and was assured when I booked my appointment that I would love the results.. I know Groupons are to get new customers in the door but with this experience, I will not go back. I have used a Groupon at another spa, and they re-treated me to get the results that were expected.  I had an appt with my dermatologist a few weeks after this, and she said that 100 disport units should have taken care of all the areas I had treated.

I had a GroupOn voucher & was a little concerned that I may be shortchanged because I was there on a \u201ccoupon\u201d.  All my fears were immediately put to rest from the initial phone call to make my appointment.  I had let time get away from me and had less than a week to use my GroupOn voucher or lose the promotional value.  The lady on the phone, Katrina I think, was understanding & made me an appointment for the next day.  Bonus point because I was able to get my appointment on a Saturday.\n\nWhen I arrived, I was greeted by name & offered a drink.  After paperwork, I was introduced to Jennifer Pyles who explained that she is double licensed and would do both my massage & facial.  I was extremely pleased with this because it allowed me to stay relaxed throughout the treatments and not have to move into a new area.  Jennifer was professional, attentive & through.  Her pressure level was perfect & she checked in occasionally to make sure it stayed that way.  She even surprised me by telling me she could tell I was right handed & spent a lot of time at a computer due to the tension level in certain areas.  That really showed me how skilled she is.  After the massage, Jennifer moved directly into my express facial.  She walked me through the process & gave me a brief skin analysis.  She suggested products & services I could benefit from.  She was also kind enough to suggest some over the counter products when I asked about them.  After the appointment, she left a list of the items & services we discussed at the front desk for me.\n\nAfter my time with Jennifer, I was allowed to wait in the sauna while the nail technician finished with another client.  The temperature was just right for relaxation and I had to avoid nodding off.\n\nNext, Badri Roshan, the nail technician came to get me for my manicure.  She was a very nice lady with whom I enjoyed talking.  I loved her accent & chatting with her about her background and what drew her to Birmingham.  As a testament to her work. I have received several compliments on my nails.\n\nAs I checked out, I neglected to get the name of the lady at the front desk but she was very friendly and helped me run my card to leave a tip for Jennifer & Badri.  I loved that while I was invited back, no services or products were pushed on me.

So I purchased a very expensive perfect package for my girl as a surprise Valentine's day present at this location bc ive sent her here once before and she seemed to enjoy it. Well the lady at the desk inquired on who it was for and apparently submitted the information under her name where as MY email confirmation went directly to my girl, where she called me informing me she knew my plans for her, spoiling the surprise!!! That should have never happened! I then called and explained my irritation and informed them I was coming for a refund. They called me back like it was no biggy like cool we can just refund this over the phone for you rather than saying hey i'm sorry is there any way we can make this right for you! I'm a funny, chill laid back dude, but if you ruin a surprise, that is my one and only immediate heartbreak bc that ruins the joy of spending lots of money to be able to see the expression on your womans face of how happy she is. Presents are for the givers and for the receivers bc we both enjoy feeling the happiness of THE SURPRISE!! Please resolve this issue, bc i'm a man of morality bc now my woman is upset with me bc I refunded the package but I simply can NOT do business with folks that aren't in it for the satisfaction of those spending their hard earned money! So now, I had Valentine's all planned out perfect to the T, I no longer have the \"kaboom\" gift available, and now there is all this negative energy between me and my woman bc I know she still wants the package but I can not allow it bc the surprise was so important to me i absolutely had to have my money back so that this place would know and preferably remember that they ruined something for two special people! I wouldn't dare ask for something free, I would feel bad for taking anything not earned, but as a man that runs  a business, I make free offers every day to ensure customer satisfaction and that they come back!!

See the address on Google is NOT where they are anymore as I found out the hard way. They have no webpage. When I finally got someone on the phone the attitude,despite my calm and polite voice, continued but they finally gave me the address on Hollis Crump Drive off 78.\n\nI stopped by and yep its teenagers running it.  The staff as the front desk when I asked for information about joining just handed me a sheet and rattled off there 3 mth, 6 mth, and 1 year prices then looked at me all very expensive (over a 100 dollars for 3 mth and it go's way up from there). and said nothing else. They seem to think anyone who walk's automatically want's to join but when I asked for a tour I got a hate filled look but they went and got someone (yep another teenager) to do so.\n\nThis place is very plain, has no class, and seemed very crammed together to me.  Lots of equipment (big variety) that seemed taken care of.  The pool is NOT a pool but something only to do laps in and that's about it.  The do have a small sauna showers and the like. Most rooms where dark (light turned out) with no one it and there was very few people.\n\nI would have tried it out but with piss poor and condescending attitude of the entire staff I met, the plain jammed together nature of the place, they high prices (no 30 day plan), I want nothing to do with the place and so should you.  They need to replace there entire staff with people who are professional  want yo make you feel welcome and to join be it over the phone or in person.  They do not..go elsewhere in my viewpoint.

Went in on a Saturday afternoon, there were very few people in the spa so I was taken directly to a chair for a pedicure. The owner of the spa ran cold water in my foot bath and when I brought it to their attention they told me to wait a few minutes and they would bring me some hot water to mix in with the cold water \ud83d\ude2e. Meanwhile, 3 Caucasian customers walked in for pedicures and had hot water ran from the faucet directly into their foot bath. I watched in total disbelief as another manicurist walked from the back of the salon with an electric kettle full of hot water ready to pour it in the bath of cold water. Fortunately Hannah moved me to another chair and apologized for the incident. When I confronted the owner about the situation, her response was that the other 3 people had made an appointment....but she didn\u2019t realize that I heard the appointment being made 5 minutes before they came in.

The other Vietnamese lady doing pedi for my daughter was mute as she did not speak english. She applied a callous gel on my daughter\u2019s heels without her consent and then even charged us for it which i thought was unfair! She didn\u2019t even want that gel applied in the first place! Anyway after leaving the place, my toe started hurting so bad. At first i ignored it. But when the pain didn't lessen after 3 days to the point that i couldn\u2019t  wear a shoe, I had to see a doctor to get it checked for an infection. Thank god there was no infection but they had nicked the cuticle too deep, hence the pain. If only she wasn\u2019t busy on her phone and concentrated on her job, maybe she\u2019d be more careful!

It\u2019s been close to two months now and my nails are STILL breaking and I have to keep a nail strengthening polish with a top coat on it so that they don\u2019t break as bad.\nThe only reason my nails didn\u2019t break off in the middle of my nail is because I have a friend who does nails, but not acrylics because they\u2019re bad for your nails, and she was able to help me get the gel off and told me how to properly care for the nails while I have this issue. She also told me this is something that really bad nail solans do called \u201crings of fire\u201d because the nails burn like fire. Which I can attest to.\nAnother thing, while he was doing this I jerked my hand out of his, wouldn\u2019t you think this would clue him in? I\u2019ve never experienced this and didn\u2019t realize what happened, I just though the tool was hot on my nail. Silly me. I could not get it off with the %100 acetone remover. I will never go here again.\nI would\u2019ve given this no stars but that\u2019s not an option.\nAlso the gel looked terrible, it had a lot of bubbles throughout and it was coming off my nails as I walked out of the store!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626afe255df913:0xca431ae7112e8fe1"}

The man applied the thinnest layer on my nails . i had to get a nail replaced and i told him the nail was flimsy after he finished with the acrylic. he told me it would harden after the nail polish was applied. (the nail popped off the next day.) he did not buff or file my nails. when he applied my nail polish he told me to sit under the gel nail dryer. my nails began to bubble up. so i stopped and told him and he asked me which nail and i told him all of them ! he said this is the craziest thing in my life ! i've never saw anything like this in my life ! referring to me not liking my nails. So he had his assistant to fix my nails lord bless her she was kind. but the owner made me feel less of a customer because I wasn't getting gel nails. she said \"Its doing that because you have the regular polish, gel polish doesn't do that!\" well excuse me but WTF were yall doing before gel polish came out?  don't go to this salon even if its your last resort.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626afe255df913:0xca431ae7112e8fe1"}

I came to get my nails done and Wednesday@ around 6:30 p.m. , they broke off . I would go back that night To get them fixed up at the nail place but they  closed after 7 pm , so I waited till the next day which was Thursday to get that nail repair . The same guy who died the nail replaced them , well Friday the nail breaks again , So  again so I called before attending there  to speak with management to see what the issue was , and see if they could fix them . The manager knows I drove here from Athens , al which is now my second time fixing after paying $50. The manager Mimi then assured me to come in to get someone else to fix. So I head to the nail place , as I\u2019m walking and I said hey I have already called  can I get my nail repaired , I am told by MIMI DAUGHTER, yes you may have a Seat ....  well after waiting for a while someone else walks in  abs they ask questions regarding prices , and wanting a full set and they sit her down and do her nails .  Then after I ask the daughter how can someone who just arrives get their nails done ahead of a repair that\u2019s been waiting for 30 mins . Then MIMi daughter began to get loud , and argue with me , telling me that I still need to wait , both not seeking any support or understanding of the situation , then she lies and say I have to wait for the same tech to redo my repair , when after speaking on the phone I was told someone else would be doing  it . I was also told that the nail tech who as doing the full set , can\u2019t do a nail repair . What sense does that make ?  (They can do a fill in , but can\u2019t do a nail repair ) Even as I am explaining myself Mimi began to yell at me abruptly in front of customers even after I give her respect . I am a business owner myself , and the respect you receive here is blatant disrespect. I even told the manager I would be leaving a review after the disrespect I received she yells she doesn\u2019t care \u201c it won\u2019t hurt her \u201c, again this is a business owner speaking to a customer like this . Little do they know I am in the military , and will be sure to spread the word to everyone I know . NOT TO GO TO NAILS BY MIMI , there are way better places who respect there customers . People should watch how they treat others , you never know who your customer is , or who they know , and you can definitely hurt business treating people in such a manner .

I went and got my nails done myself\nEarlier this month for my birthday and 2 days before my birthday two of my nails came COMPLETELY off ! Like the entire acrylic nail came off of my real nail without any damage. I immediately called \"Nails by Mimi \" to let them know how my nails were coming off , I gave them my name so that when I went to get them refixed , there wouldn't be a problem .. guess what ? There was a problem! Anyways Mimi stepped in and fixed my nails , with a TON OF ACRYLIC . I didn't know the consequences of piling so much acrylic on , So I referred my friends to go to this nail shop. Guess what .. their nails broke too ! My friends went to nails by Mimi to get their nails done before their trip to Japan and while they were over there , their nails broke! My friends called to let them know what was going on so that they could get their nails fixed when they arrived back to the states. Nobody wrote their names down or told Mimi what was going on . When we arrived guess what , THERE WAS A PROBLEM . When we entered the store and my friends started explaining to Mimi what was going on , she pulled out her phone and started recording us \ud83d\ude31 !! She started saying things like \" look at them \" \" look at what I have to deal with \" my friends were disgusted and the situation began to get heated . I stood up and addressed Mimi because I was the one who referred my friends and couldn't believe that she was acting this way. I started to address Mimi and reminded her that I was just up here a few weeks ago with the same problem from the same\nNail technician , so my friend's complaint wasn't unusual or unreasonable. I also explained to Mimi that she was profiling my friends and I by instantly pulling her phone out and recording us , when we were only coming to get a service fixed that we had already paid for . Mimi put her phone away and we proceeded on with the encounter. Mimi asked my friends who was the tech that did their nails , they showed her and  The lady who jacked our nails up started speaking in Chinese all angrily and aggressively! Although we could not understand what she was saying , we could tell that she was being agressive and talking trash about us . I told Mimi that the technician was out of line and that as a customer we should not have to deal with her ranting in Chinese or talking about us .. horrible customer service \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude24. The situation died down and Mimi started to fix my friends nails , she was obviously upset that we articulate what we wanted done and we refused to pay for horrible customer service . Mimi says to us \" one monkey don't stop Mimi's show \" \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31 I was LIKEE WHATTTTT !! I explained to Mimi that yeah one person won't hurt your business but horrible customer services skills and profiling customers will ! I attend Alabama A&M and have told plenty of people to go to Mimi's but NOT anymore ! They rush on your nails and give horrible customer service skills . Your nails will fall off and they will blame it on you , and not on the fact that they use cheap acrylic ! Oh yeah , and if you tell them that you're nails weren't strong enough and broke off  they will slap tons of the cheap acrylic on your nails making them rip your real nails off and leaving you looking like a mutant !", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626afe255df913:0xca431ae7112e8fe1"}

Salon comes off as welcoming and friendly - \"complimentary\" neck massage.  I use complimentary loosely as I'm not sure if I paid for it or not.  I never saw an itemized bill.  I just know that I was there for 1.5 hours and got all of a ten minute haircut (that's being generous).  Total came to $55 for what amounted to a 1/2\" trim and sloppy bang cutting.  No layers (even though layers were discussed).  Stylist hardly spoke at all during entire appointment and I walked out with extremely flat hair with a cowlick in bangs that also have a big chunk that wasn't faded into the overall cut.  She made me feel like I was taking up her time as she had another client in the color room, so I felt uncomfortable and rushed.\n\nWhen you get your hair cut, you should want to hit the town because you have hair that's only possible after a day at the salon.  I wanted to go straight home and wash my hair to try to regain some movement and style.  Three weeks out and I'm still unhappy and can't wait until I can get my hair cut again - at a different salon.\nI should note that I emailed the salon that afternoon to complain about my experience.  On Monday I received a voice mail offering to make things up to me.  I was so upset I didn't know what I wanted to do (I did NOT want Tori touching my hair again and felt very disappointed with the whole Tonya Jones experience).  Made the mistake of waiting two weeks to call the salon back - haven't received any other calls.  At this point I would have offered to pay a percentage of a re-do, but since I haven't been contacted I now feel they don't back up their services so I have no problem leaving this review.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888919c2e5b5df63:0x800c45eadc2ebd68"}

I asked my hairdresser why it cost so much more than the estimate and she said that hair length and the experience of the hairdresser influence cost.

Not only did the prices continue to rise every single time that I walked through those doors but my hair was completely messed up by the staff (as well as Tonya herself). The day that I went in to have my hair colored was a day that I could forsee myself running late ahead of time. I called and spoke with Tonya herself who told me that it would be ok and to just come on and she would get my hair done. I even stated to her that I would be at the very least 30 mins late. She still stated that was ok. When I arrived 28 mins late and I announced to Tonya that I was there (due to no one being at the front desk at that time) she stated that she already had another customer and that I could see one of her lower tier'd hairdressers. I never like to change hands when it comes to my hair and this story is exactly why I don't.\nI was very upset that Tonya told me it would be ok and when she found a higher paying customer she ditched me. However, I decided to go ahead and see her next in line hairdresser who she stated was trained by her and exceptional.\nThis hairdresser placed the bleach on my hair and after many many minutes I walked up to Tonya to ask if it was time to have the bleach removed. Tonya was irritated and told me that he would come to me when it was ready. Another amount of time goes by and I once again try to find someone to take the bleach out of my hair. After several attempts to have the bleach (foils) removed I was told that the hairdresser had went home! Yes that's right....went home!\nTonya had to call him and have him come back to take the foils out of my hair and to wash the bleach out.\nWhen everything was done and my hair dried, I felt how brittle and dried out my hair was from this session. I mentioned it to Tonya who stated that it was all perfectly normal and to use the \"purple shampoo\" when I wash my hair the next day and all would be fine.\nThe next day I did as asked and my hair started to break off in a very big way! I ended going back to Tonya to trim my hair and I asked her to only cut 1/2 inch off the bottom of it. She cut MANY inches off and my hair was no longer long, nor was it healthy any longer. I was truly angry!\nNot only did Tonya make me pay for my bad bleaching session which was over $350 but she also made me pay for my horrible trim.\nI will NEVER go back to this place as long as I live! I have continued to tell others how bad I was treated and how bad my hair was when it was all said and done.\nIf you want good service than you will want to go to someone who can give you that. Tonya's salon was not kind to me. When she realized that I didn't have the kind of money that most of her clients had....I feel that's when I was treated much differently.\nI would advise going to someone who will treat you right regardless on how much money you are worth or how much money you will spend while at the salon.\nJust my experience and my opinion. Hope it helps others out there.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888919c2e5b5df63:0x800c45eadc2ebd68"}
