I deducted two stars due to their shipping policy, which caused us to cancel two future purchases and return business. 40% of our total cost was shipping (across the country) which we knowingly chose to pay. I assumed that shipping and delivery was inclusive. It is NOT. Once the freight company called me for a delivery appointment, I was told that I had to pay for offloading the pallet from the truck unless I had a forklift or some such thing hanging around my business. Upon calling WillyGoat and inquiring, I was told that I should have read what 'curbside delivery' actually meant. It's not curbside. Once the product leaves WillyGoat, they pocket that shipping money and leave it to you to figure out how to get the product. Not necessarily deceptive, but certainly not respectable.  Four phone calls later, I was simply told that 'if the truck driver is nice, he will help you offload it'. I said that I would take the pallet of goods apart myself and offload it by hand if necessary, but was then told that I'm not allowed on the truck. Well, there's a quandary! I can pay extra for shipping to actually receive my product. The woman at WillyGoat was unapologetic and didn't care too much to facilitate much or elaborate. Too bad, sooo sad, basically.

We chose this one because as our daughter grows she will still be able to play on it and love it. This thing is huge! Delivery was fast and sent to a local company, Sia Motor Freight, that would deliver it to our home. The local delivery was where the problems started. First, they wouldn't come in our driveway saying the truck was too big. We just had a huge, fully built, shed delivered with zero problems and told them so. They still said no and they wouldn't stop on the highway because that was too dangerous for them. Luckily, we have a big company three yards down, that said we could have it delivered there. It was brought there but these guys did nothing to help get it off of the truck. My 57 year old husband would have to pull each box off himself. An employee of the drop off site saw this and got his loader and unloaded it for my husband. He helped my husband put a safe load in the back of our truck and we unloaded at our house. This took four trips for us. Maybe WillyGoat could make sure to find good freights that will also unload for the price you pay on these swings.\nWe quickly decided we could not build it ourselves. (too many age problems) so we got on a local facebook site to hire someone. We hired a husband and wife team for half the cost of the \"professionals\". They build swings for a different company for a living. We knew they would take longer with ours because they would come after work and each day and build ours. They worked 2-3 hours per day when it wasn't raining. Even with all the rain they finished in a month. He kept telling us we made a good choice with this company. He said it is quality material and will last a lifetime if we treat it and paint it every year. He said his company's is lucky to last 2-5 years.  We were pleased to hear this.\nWe had a huge 3rd birthday party for our 3 yr old daughter and unveiled the swing. She gasped, her eyes grew large and she started squealing.  Our grandchildren who are 2, 3, 7,  and guests from 2-13 were all wowed and raced to it. There is something for all ages on this one! It was the hit of the party. Since it was so hot we put a sprinkler on the roof to wet the slide they loved it! Word of caution though,  water makes the big slide a rocket slide! We had young parents loving that. Just make sure you have plenty of soft landing. We used square foam floor mats with cedar shavings under them.  The 3 slides are great the curvy, tunnel slide was a favorite for the 6 and 7 year olds the small slide was a hit with the babies to 2 yrs old. From 2 to 7 the tall slide was a favorite. They all enjoyed sitting and playing under and inside play house section. Preschool kids love the chalkboard while all ages liked pretending to steer the ship and look at the sky from the binoculars. We added a castiron home bell. Such fun for the kids to ring. Small kids seemed to be afraid of the bridge but soon got over their fear when the bigger kids would go on it.\nWe didn't have a sandpit yet but we had a table filled with water beads and put under the tallest part of the set. This was another favorite playing spot.\nI found a plastic kitchen on the side of the road one day and brought it home. At Dollar General I found a plastic kitchen set to put in it. I placed it opposite the picnic table and the kids instantly made a resturant.\nThe solar lights are awesome and put out plenty light to play at night but too many mosquitoes make that impossible during the summer.  The uncovered slides get hot enough to burn skin so be mindful of that. The play area is built to where it makes a breezeway and even on hottest days I find comfortable to sit in with a good book or bring a mat and take a nap. We've had breeze up there even on the hottest, non breezy days.\nWe are very pleased with this set and glad we spent the extra money for better quality! Everyone loves it and we've gotten so many compliments on how nice it looks from the road. Our daughter calls it her castle.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb5556866c317:0x7cfb6402d6281f05"}

I had to reach out again on Monday for the next day delivery.\n\nGail is rude and although I repeatedly asked for the owner or manager to call me she refused to pass along the info.  I can only hope they eventually read this or someone that knows them reads this and lets them know she keep all complaints from them.  I requested my shipping money back and Gail laughed.  Again I must have asked to speak to the owner 20 times she said NO.\n\nLook elsewhere...you will be disappointed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb5556866c317:0x7cfb6402d6281f05"}

After searching for the swing set we wanted and finding it for a good price with free shipping, we ordered. Later came an email showing added shipping costs. The manager Gayle refused to honor the $0.00 shipping charge that was shown on my screen at time of purchase, even tho I have screen shots of my confirmation page (also showing the no shipping charge again with my order number). She even called to let me know there were 2 charges on my credit card (of course the shipping was NOT a charge I had authorized). She didn't seem to want to hear my point, see my order confirmation showing the no shipping charge, or attempt to make it right, instead she just said she \"would refund it all bc there was a flaw with my computer.\" I'm not sure how the flaw can be my computer, but rather a flaw in their system and a manager that won't honor the charges that were shown on their website, that stayed the same throughout the online checkout process, and even showed up as $0.00 shipping on my order confirmation page. Very disappointing for a new customer. I'll attach images of the confirmation page showing that their website did indeed take me through the checkout process with NO shipping cost only to be charged the added $202.64 after the order went through.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb5556866c317:0x7cfb6402d6281f05"}

We bought a playground and paid for install. They installed our playground during the winter assured us that they previously did installs over snow. Come spring; snow is melted and you can see how unleveled our playground is. Not to mention they left the ground screws pointing up, leaving hazards for the children at our daycare. If you are a residential daycare, do not buy from this company. The customer service is only two people and the lady who claims to be the manager clearly shouldn\u2019t be the manager. She is rude and nasty. Her name is Gail. They do not take responsibility for there mistakes and lack of communication. They try to rush you off the phone and never follow up! They hire a third party to do your installs and they do NOT have communication with the contractors, they pretty much send you off to another company.. meanwhile your paying Willy Goat. They make you hire someone else to fix there errors, I had 3 different companies come check and they were all shocked as to how this playground was installed.\n\nWilly Goat does not care for the safety of children.\nWilly Goat does not care about their customers.\nI have been waiting for 3 months to solve this problem. They refuse to fix our playground and refuse to admit they messed up on the install.\n\nI do not recommend this company to any child care programs.\n\nThey say they will send someone to fix the screws and blame \u201cpost\u201d installation instructions to be followed. However the whole playground is not straight; it\u2019s crooked. They also don\u2019t install all the parts correctly. Installer left a big gap in between the stairs.. another hazzard. I will be contacting the Business Bureaur on this company because they are not taking responsibility to fix playground leveling NOR the stairs. I got a faster response from the \u201cowner\u201d through google than a phone call.. as they mentioned the owner will be contacting me for weeks already. Spend thousands for unprofessional work. Worst customer service who rush you off the phone and tell you lies.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1624460949143, "text": "Hi Erika, thanks for your feedback -- we take all feedback seriously! We do install play systems in the snow very regularly and take seriously the safety of children!  That's our business!\n\nWe know this installer very well, but had someone local we did not know come back out to look into it for the sake of urgency. If the post-installation written/verbal instructions were followed, this wouldn't have been a problem. Fortunately, as discussed, the fix is very simple, and we can have our installer back by to tap the bolts back in place when he's free to take care of it!"}, "gmap_id": "0x889bb5556866c317:0x7cfb6402d6281f05"}
