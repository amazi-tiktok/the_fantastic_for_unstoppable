Both for the initial phone purchase and for the Note 7 recall he was knowledge, friendly, and great to talk to.\n\nOn the latter occasion they were busy as quite a few customers were in to replace their Note 7's. Though his shift was over and he was in street clothes ready to leave, he stayed behind to help his co-workers and customers an hour past his scheduled time. Clearly customer satisfaction and aiding his peers is more important to him than leaving on the dot when his shift is up.\n\nBest Buy, if you're reading this, give this man a raise and do whatever you need to keep him around. He's not someone I knew before this purchase, but if he worked for me I'd make sure it stayed that way.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cb66ea47319:0xa9a7dc141de52702"}

This one is in the mall, they are talking about the University location. As far as the University location, I can say plenty bad but will skip it since I worked there at one point.\n\nNow as far as this mobile location:\n\nI bought a prepaid sim card for an unlocked Android device about 15 minutes before closing, on a Friday night. True to their marketing, they made sure it was activated and I had a working phone before I left. There was an issue with the activation (not their fault) and stayed an hour over closing till it was fixed. That's customer service and something you never see. Trust me, you want to leave quickly on a Friday, they stayed. That's the soul reason why I'm writing this review.\n\nOne negative, they messed up on the data settings but that was no issue as I resolved that quickly when I got home.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cb66ea47319:0xa9a7dc141de52702"}
