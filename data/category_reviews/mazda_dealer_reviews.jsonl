We found one online, previously, and wanted to drive one before we drove all that way to Birmingham to see it. They made us a proposal, \"If we  can cut you a deal on a new one, can we have your business?\" Well, of course if the price is right then, yes. We drive a grey CX-5, everything is great, but they are calling this car \"new\" and it has 7500 miles on it. Well, it's never been owned they say its a \"demo\" car. Then my husband tells them he wants to be at $19,999 financed for this car (yes, we were putting several thousand down - we didn't expect a miracle deal). They only get it down to $20,010. Then he says, well if you throw in remote start, we will take it. They came back with each of us paying half so, we decided to buy the car.\n\nThey told us that they could get us a killer interest rate of less than one percent. When we got back to financing, it was another story entirely. We ended up wit ha 4.99 interest rate because \"less than one percent is only for \"new\" cars\" well when you were trying to negotiate this deal you said it was a new car and now that we are financing you've classified it as a \"used\" car.\n\nAfter we left, we began driving to my dad's house which is probably 100 miles away. The check engine light came on before we got there. We had O'Reily's check the computer and they said it was low oil pressure. We called and they has us call the Mazda tow truck to come pick it up and take it to the nearest Mazda which was in Birmingham. (They told me to get a rental during this time and they would pay me back.) They called for me to come pick it up three or four days later saying it was a computer problem and it was fixed. When we got there, 4 error messages were popping up on the dash. We left the car and called the sales manager at Julio Jones Mazda who never called us back and said he never got our message.\n\nI went in to talk to the Julio Jones Mazda sales manager about this problem on Monday. They had me sit there for a while and eventually said they spoke with the technician at the Birmingham Mazda and they said I must have taken my foot off the brake too early and it caused the car to throw up those error messages. So, they blamed me for the problem.\n\nLater, the technician from Birmingham called us personally and said they had screwed up and not fixed it properly to begin with. So, the sales manager at Julio Jones Mazda was either misinformed or blatantly lied to make me think it was my fault.\n\nWell, we finally got the car back and it has been running fine. No more issues. However, they still haven't paid me back for the rental and it's been almost a month. I called about this and they said they lost my receipt and asked me for the amount again. I still haven't been paid and they haven't bothered to call me back. That was a week ago.\n\nSimultaneously, I took the car in to the Julio Jones service center to get the remote start put in on a Thursday. They told me it would take a day, maybe two, to get this done. The service center is telling me that I owe our half of the remote start that was supposed to be included in the deal. Obviously, they didn't include it in the price like they said they would. Also, they had to give me a rental car because they couldn't get the remote start to work. It's now Monday and I have no clue when I am going to get my car back. I called today and they said they still couldn't get the remote start to work.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't wish this headache on anyone and I wouldn't recommend this dealership to anyone. It has been an absolute nightmare since we signed for this vehicle.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1554413123364, "text": "Hi Dylan, thank you for your feedback.

I bought a truck from them at an outrageous price (had no options at the time and needed a truck A.S.A.P. for business) and I have spent over $5,000 fixing it in the 6 months I've owned it. I was told by Lee and the \"salesman\" that the truck was $11,000, only to charge me $13,000. Of course once I realized what they did and contacted them they play dumb and it is too late. I know if I should have taken more time to review and ask questions but it was the end of the day, past business hours already and I needed to leave with the truck that day. Regardless you should never practice those business ethics in any industry. I have had to change the rotors, brakes, brake drums, brake cylinder, master cylinder, calipers and brackets, hub assembly, CV axles, steering arm, I am in the process of changing the transfer case (over $2,000 on it's own) and it still needs a steering column, gear box, front differential, driveshaft and possibly the rear differential. When it's all said and done I will have put at least 5 times the value of this truck into making it run right and paying it off. I am a self employed remodeler and I have missed countless days of work, lost countless jobs and it's gotten to the point that I am having trouble paying for my daughters daycare and buying her essentials.
