She then made the situation worse by making a sour look on her face and the tone in her voice was VERY hateful My friend's said they heard her gossiping to that employee and the customer after I left, so loudly she could hear and she was going through the checkout isle in front of the bank .

How ever out of the blue they tuck the overdraft away and told me I have done to many over drafts and I could over use the over draft again in 30 days. OK fine after 30 days I got in a tight spot due to covid19 Palmer Toyota said we could only work every other day to lower the risk of getting covid but I still needed food and gas and rent even if they didn't charge a late fee it still had to be paid but can't overdraft.so after the 30 days the overdraft still is not working they said oh well it's going to be 60 days not 30 nope after 60 days still no overdraft once again I ask them why then I was told oh it's going to be 90 days for a cool down nope still no overdraft so once again I asked why no overdraft and was told oh it's has to have a full 6 months for its cool down. OK FINE! well even after that still no overdraft so again them why and they say I have to resign up for overdraft then it will finally work after 24 hours. Well still no overdraft after 6 days so again I go and ask why no overdraft and now they are telling me I can never have overdraft there again due to how many overdrafts I have made like a year ago. Like I said I needed over draft due to moving in are first apartment we needed everything so yes I used overdraft often they ALWAYS got there 30 dollar overdraft fee and the were always paid back and had a positive balance the following week we just had are first child so it would really be nice to know if I need to use overdraft I could but no giving them 30 dollars is not good enough for this joke of a bank. And also at the time I started a new job at Toyota as a tech so I needed overdraft to help get tools I did not have new apartment first child new job but now no overdraft with no warning and nobody knew at that bank why all I was told was next month next month them clown don't know anything.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb26a955faee9:0xad3ac7132af6dd59"}

They dont care at all about the people that try they only care about money and I hope that people dont decide to bank with them and go ellsewhere becuase I have never ever been treated like they did.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889e69cbeb5ff35:0x9cff9bdf1cd3f2ac"}

Let me tell you about this corporate office that doesn't know its a$# from its elbow.  I had a BBVA Compass Bank credit card and wanted to switch my name from my maiden name to my married name.  I called the phone # on the back of my credit card to inquire how to do that.  The customer service rep had to put me on hold because he didn't know what I needed to do.  He came back on the phone & gave me an address to mail a letter requesting the change & said to send proof of change with the letter.  So I wrote a letter, put in an official copy of my marriage certificate & a copy of my driver's license just as I have done for everything else to change my last name.  A month went by & nothing happened.  So I called to inquire where my new credit card was.  The customer service rep said that they didn't have anything in the computer about it.  When I asked if he could check where my documents were he kept repeating that they didn't have them.  We went in this circle for 20 minutes.  I became increasingly angry as he did not even attempt to help me.  This was alarming to me as my personal information with my husband's & my ss# was now out there somewhere, along with our address & my DL #.  I tracked my envelope w/ the post office & called them.  They assured me that my envelope was scanned into the correct PO Box & that Compass Bank picks up their mail everyday at the back door at 8:30 am.  I called Compass Bank back & told them what they told me & I once again got a, \"We can't help you.  We don't have it.  If it is here it is safe with us.\"  This again happened over and over and over again.  I again became increasingly angry.  I cancelled my credit card at this point. (It was an emergency credit card that I barely used.)  At this point my aunt & I wrote letters to the Regional Manager, Branch Manager, & President/CEO of the company about this matter.  A woman named Tonya called me & pretended to care about my situation (after they got the letters).  She was very convincing on the phone that she cared.  However, after she promised to look into the matter I never heard from her for a week.  It took a few messages between myself and my aunt for her to return my phone call.  In fact, she did not return our phone calls until we said that we would write a letter to the Banking Commission or someone of that authority.  She told me someone from the Investigative team was supposed to call me & that she had put in 2 requests w/ them.  After that phone call, never heard from her again.  Then I received a phone call from a Customer Client Service rep named Holly.  She also seemed to pretend to care about my situation & told me that my letter ended up in another PO Box & went to a company called Computer Support Systems.  She stated that she called this company & that they said they received a letter for BBVA Compass Bank & that they were going to return it to the post office.  She even put me on a 3 way call with the post office to \"confirm\" this.  The whole time on the phone Holly was baiting the post office into saying or implying that they misplaced my envelope, that it was possible, that the other company didn't return etc, etc...  When the post office stated that this happens often w/ their bank Holly told her \"to remember that there was a customer on the line.\"  This made me laugh to myself in disbelief.  I guess she thought I was stupid & that I didn't see what she was trying to do.  The post office took my phone # & said they would look into it further.  Holly seemed satisfied w/ her job & like she solved my problem.  The post office called me back a few hours later & told me just as they had the first time I spoke to them weeks earlier when I called them myself, that my envelope was scanned into the correct PO Box.  They also said that they get calls from Compass Bank customers all the time w/ the same problem.

She then told me the only accurate way to monitor how much money I have is to keep an \u201cold fashioned check book\u201d. I asked her again why I got charged THREE overdraft fees and she went through my account telling me all of the charges that still wouldn\u2019t have led to me having three overdraft charges. She put me on hold 3 times in the middle of me talking and concluded the conversation by telling me she could only take one off, which I still haven\u2019t seen the money back in my account, and that I would have to wait until her branch manager got back on Monday to resolve the issue and see if he could do anything for me at all, and that she would tell him I was \u201cso distraught over the situation\u201d in a super condescending tone. Absolutely disgraceful to handle business in this way in the middle of a pandemic where so many people are financially stretched.

I then asked for the older red hair lady or that handsome young man they were always helpful. The girl said they no longer work there. So I went to the office with the blonde hair lady. I asked her to help me load my clear spend card. She then said I am better off opening a checking account. I told her the card was really for my son whose doing travel basball and he's 13 and this is easier to manage. She then said she couldn't help me and that's something the tellers would have to do.She tried really hard to sale me a credit card or an account when I just needed to load money. I then tried to go to the manager but she closed her door and I knocked and she said she could't help me that she's on a call. I use to come to this branch when I lived close by and this use to be a great branch. But it looks like the turnover is high the new staff of tellers don't know what there doing. Also the ladies in the front offices won't help. My son was needing the card the next day and I had no time so I went to walmart and purchased a prepaid visa which allowd me to track expenses from there app to my phone.

I've been a loyal banker with Wells Fargo for 3 years and they treated me as if I were insignificant today. I spoke with the manager because of a situation where my fiance went to deposit money in my account (as he has many times before theough the ATM and with a teller) because im at work and he was told he couldn't. The option wasn't there with the ATM either. So I called to inquire on if the policy has changed or of the ATM was no longer offering the option. I was told they have no control over who deposited at the ATM multiple times as if I were an idiot and then told that the policy changed in May (ever think to notify customers when policies change?). I was told he could deposit a check or money order but to deposit cash would be fraudulent. When I pointed out his tone and the fact that he was talking down to me he continued with \"so you called over something I have no control over and I told you I have no control over and your upset because I can't control it, is that correct?\" That is very riderand condescending. II wil be closing my account and banking else where as soon as possible. No wonder this branch only has 3 stars. He is a poor excuse of a manager and exemplimes customer service at it's absolute worst. He refused to give me his name at the end of the call but thankfully I document everything and when I don't I always do my recon and research. A little trick I have learned working in customer service the past 10 years is record every conversation. Unfortunately I didn't start recording in the very beginning of the conversation when he said his name, as I did not expect the call to take such a turn. So I only have the last half of the call on record. That's ok though, I will still be going through the proper channels to let Wells Fargo know what poor service I received. It is unacceptable and they deserve to know how their employees are treating their customers so that it can probably be addressed and handled.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0e119f3a5a27:0xaf86bc955e2df069"}

As my mortgage broker, KC was efficient, thorough, knowledgeable, and dependable. Without a doubt, KC is an expert in mortgage financing, the purchasing process of buying a house, and in anticipating potential barriers to overcome in the process.\n\nKC was very proactive through my purchasing/financing experience. He followed up with me via phone or email quickly without delay, he kept the process going, and stayed in constant communication with my realtor. His efficiency is exemplified in his ability to close on my house within 30 days of me winning the bid on the house.\n\nAbove all, KC is transparent and trustworthy. He is quite the professional and I will be using him and First Federal Mortgage again for my future buying experiences as well. KC represented himself and First Federal Mortgage in a remarkable fashion.\n\nI also had the opportunity of working with KC's assistant, Haley Roscoe. Haley was equally responsive and facilitated attention to details. Anytime additional documentation was needed (or if I needed to provide additional documentation to First Federal) Haley reviewed and submitted documentation without delay. She also anticipated potential barriers and provided solutions to keep the buying/financing process going.

So the last few payments have been by check (which is fine)  I never experienced the type of rudeness I received like I did the other day from a teller. I've been cashing the checks through my wells Fargo account mostly and others I have cashed inside the bank I received the check from, to see if I want another account with another bank. (Walking in regions) waited 10 mins to even see a teller due to them being busy(3 customers 2 tellers) yeah that was sarcasm.  When it was finally my turn I told the cashier I need to cash this check. She responded ok I need your LICENSE  to which I provided while I signed the back of the check. Of forgot to mention this is a $25.oo check. She asked if I had an account with regions I responded no mam. She said you are aware their is a service fee on checks if you do not have an account with regions. I said no I didn't know that, that's weird. I said how much, she replied 2 dollars (not much it seems but when you struggle to make ends meet that $2 means a lot) she said yes it's just our policy \" EVERYONE GETS CHARGED THE FEE IF YOU ARE NOT AN ACCOUNT HOLDER\" I said ok, my bank doesn't do that. When I write a check to someone they cash without having an account with my bank it bc that's their hard earned money. She responded \"well the only way I cannot charge you is if the check HOLDER gives permission to WAIVE the fee. So naturally I was pissed off. I said how is it you can say that it's a mandatory fee and EVERONE GETS CHARGED THAT FEE IF NOT AN ACCOUNT HOLDER, but if the check HOLDER called and said it's ok to WAIVE the fee. That literally makes no sense! She replied in a smart tone \"well why don't you just deposit it to your wells account. I said I'm almost out of gas and just figured I could cash it here being less than a mile from my house. I said fine just cash it I'm on my way to work. I will be visiting the branch manager of regional manager tomorrow to see exactly why they say it's mandatory but it can be waived? I'm in customer service I know what it's like dealing with the public but that was uncalled for rudeness. I will recommend everyone close their account bc my friend did the day I told her what happened she said she had no idea they did this when she paid ppl by check and was outraged. So that's 1 account being closed. 1 may not matter much to this bank but I have only told her so far so next is other friends who msg me about their accounts with them.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a1cd156ff2b79:0x80751851e8f42a1"}

I really didn't  know what to do when I walked in. I asked the customers sitting if they were waiting for a teller and they said yes so I noted who was in front of me and stood and waited. One customer got frustrated and left so now two in front of me. Two more came in and walked ahead of us and I kindly said that we were waiting for a teller, too. They were nice, one left and the other sat down and waited. The two in front of me were there because they had wrongful credits to their account so they would be a while, too. They all said that the wait was common at this location. I stood there for 20 minutes before I finally got waited on.  The teller was nice and started to chat with me ( I was in a hurry, on my lunch and frustrated) and there was was still one person behind me. I told him that I was in a hurry and had already waited 20 minutes to please just deposit my check.  He then tried to tell me that I could have used the machine outside and or gone through the drive thru (he was still very nice). I was not. I told him I thought it would be quicker to come inside that I had never waited this long with just 2 people ahead of me.  He said that he thought it was normal to wait at all banks.  He stayed professional but I know I made him mad at the end because his smile went away. It wasn't his fault. Evidently they have a new policy that you can go to any teller for anything, opening an account, lost card, wrongful credits to your account, all of which take a long time so if you want to cash a check or make a simple deposit then don't go inside.

I live almost 2 hours from here, and once per month I drive a long way to have an appointment at a nearby salon...so near you can see it from the bank. I arrived early and they were mowing and weed eating all around the parking lot to the salon which wasn't open yet, so I parked at the nearby bank at 7:30 in an area where other cars were parked and it had a covering overhead, which helped with the sun, and I also used the space at the end- the furtherest parking space from the door. Well, when the employees started coming in there was one lady that wouldn't stop staring me down as if I were a member of Al Qaeda waiting to rush in and rob the bank, and looking at me extremely rude. She stared me down all the way until she got to the door to unlock it and then just stood there with the door open staring at me more (smart thing to do if you think there's a security risk going on). I didn't think much of it because I was minding my own business and eating a biscuit and looking down at my phone most of the time. But then I look up again and she had an entire clan of people looking at me (employees who had arrived and were standing outside of their cars in the parking lot); she was looking at them in the parking lot as if they shouldn't try to walk into the bank because me, *the possible big bad mean bank robber* might try to rush them. I'm a person sitting here waiting for a business to open and I've actually sat in the same exact parking spot 5-6 times before without any issue. Once I realized what was going on I saw a man walking over to my car and I rolled down my window, and I explained to him what I was doing and that after using THEIR ATM I was just waiting on a business to open. He then said that they just weren't sure what I was up to.\n\nI will say, just based on this incident I am so glad I am not a customer of your bank.

They're pretty great out there. Anyway, a couple months ago I attempted the Foley PNC (only because it's a lot closer than GS) and what a change! Although, there's usually only one or two employee(s) working the window and/or counter, but they're super friendly and always acknowledge me when they're busy. Makes me want to continue going to this branch.\n\nOriginal post:\nPulled up to the drive through today about 1:45 pm and I was the only one there. I saw two girls working behind the computers at the window. I assumed they were busy dealing with other customers. Cool, I'll wait. What's not cool? Neither of them even acknowledged I was there. I work in customer service and if I'm busy I'll at least say \"I'll be with you in a moment.\" Most people are okay with that, I'm okay with that. Alas, I didn't get that from them. I sat there probably close to five minutes. Another car had pulled into the slot to my right about four minutes after me and sent in the container. She wasn't waiting very long before the lady with the name plate where the first letter was a J grabbed her container, then finally made eye contact with me and dispensed the drawer for me to put my money into for my car payment. Imagine my frustration when she acknowledged this woman that pulled up about four minutes after me. I let J proceed with the other customer, but when she went to put in my payment I just had to know why. I mean, you'd be curious too, right? Her reason was it isn't personal, but she didn't see me sitting behind the gigantic window that's directly in front of her face. Yes, she was behind a computer, but several times she moved from behind it to place some receipts into the bin underneath where the containers come in. You can't be that oblivious when there's a window there. Unless.. dare I say it? You choose to be. It was quite amusing for her to think I would believe that horrible excuse. If your employees are that unaware of your customers, as J stated, then maybe they should be retrained a little better.

She was an excellent mortgage officer & did a wonderful job. This past summer I began the process of opening my own small business. Because I had once had a great experience with her, I went back to this mortgage officer & allowed her to help me set up my business checking account. I was talked into using their \"Merchant Services\" for my credit/debit card transaction needs & I meet up with their merchant services rep Jarred. He is awful. My card reader never worked properly from day 1 & he continued to tell me he'd have me a new one. Days later it stopped allowing me to email receipts to my customers. After 3 months of him constantly avoiding my messages and phone calls about my reader problems (and me paying more money to TYPE my transactions because my SWIPE never worked) I was charged a ridiculous $40 fee that he and NOBODY at the bank could tell me what the fee was exactly. I finally was able to get him to answer my call & I canceled my Merchant Services. The next month (month 4) comes along and I was charged the $40 fee AGAIN!!!! I closed my account immediately & I then took my money to another bank (SUNTRUST) and was told by the people at SUNTRUST about a survey that i had to take to avoid First Southerns unknown fee. (Why first southern & Jarred never mentioned this survery to me remains unknown.) But Suntrust advised me to check my spam folder.. and there they were! Also, I closed my account last week & I received another email in my spam folder just yesterday about receiving ANOTHER fee because of unanswered survey. And I can't even click on the survey now because my account is closed!! First Southern completely let me down with their customer service. They continue to explain how the merchant service is a \"third party\" Yes but its YOUR CHOOSEN third party & as the FIRST PARTY you should take responsibility for all parties involved. OPENING THAT ACCOUNT HAS TURNED INTO NOTHING BUT A HEADACHE. WORST DECISION I HAVE MADE IN QUITE SOMETIME. And here's to hoping this unknown \"fee\" doesnt go to collections and effect my credit. Guess i'll be calling the 1-800 number first thing in the morning trying to get some answers. Will never ever go back to this bank for anything ever again. No help with anything & kept in the dark the entire time. Its sad that the new bank has obviously heard about what first southern has been doing because they knew right away what had happened to me!!
