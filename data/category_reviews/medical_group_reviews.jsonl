I was NEVER called back and had the same nurse catch a attitude when I called up there to check. After Finally getting the forms back(btw it was the same forms I sent the FIRST time so it wasn\u2019t necessary for me to send it FOUR TIMES she just didn\u2019t look hard enough) I see I was only given exactly 1 week to be back at work. Now I spoke to the doctor before even scheduling this surgery and I advised him that I work at a call center so I\u2019m on the phone literately all day and he told me normal recovery time would be 7-10 days and due to my job I would probably need more time so getting those FMLA forms with only 1 week was pretty upsetting. I call the office back and speak with nurse Jessica the same nurse who \u201cwasn\u2019t getting my faxes\u201d and she tells me there is no follow up appointment after surgery and that only one week is permitted(completely different from which the DOCTOR told me) and with a smart tone says \u201ceven small children are given this time.\u201d Well EVERYONE knows that for children to heal is a lot quicker than adults for this kind of stuff plus I am a19 yr old with a full time busy job as I explain to the nurse she says and again with and attitude  \u201cyour voice will be perfectly fine\u201d I haven\u2019t had the surgery yet but she definitely knew that. The day of the surgery my appointment was at 9 and didn\u2019t get called back until 2 hours later. Post surgery I wasn\u2019t given any paperwork or info as to what will be happening to me over the next few weeks. Let\u2019s just say day 6-11 I woke up crying from the pain. I was not able to even speak or swallow anything until about 2 weeks after not to mention the jaw and ear pain I had still after that and the worst part was after I ran out of my prescribed meds I called the nurse to see what I can take and she told me ibuprofen was okay I tried it over the weekend and called again Monday since i was not feeling better and was told by a different nurse THAT I SHOULDN\u2019T be taking ibuprofen since it increased my chances of bleeding.

A lady by the name of Jordan was, this ladies name was Gloria!

I was going to go for some lens that Medicare would not cover and was willing to pay the additional cost.  Due to some eye surgery over 30 years ago he recommended against the more expensive lens.  I appreciate that. He too is friendly and very pleasant to talk to. I picked him because of his specialty and his age because I wanted to stay with one eye doctor until my end on this earth.

The price was $10 which was $10 cheaper than the other 2 doctors offices I had called. The reason I was not able to go to the original doc that did the test was because they closed at 5 I knew I would not have made it from Boaz to Guntersville before 5 but I could have made it to the other doctors office in Albertville that would have charged me $20. When I walk in I told the girl I called and she said you haven't been here before right and I said right I was handed paperwork only to be told 5mins to 5 after I walked in at 440 that it would be a $65 charge bc I had to see the Dr & 10 for the test.

We share your feelings about the labs.  Just to clarify, in most cases, as in your case, we review our patient's lab results as quickly as we can, almost always within a couple of days of our receipt of the data.  Then, if the patient requests that we we do so (and not every patient desires that we do), we will share the results on the portal, where they can be seen by the patient directly.  Exactly how the results are displayed on the portal, however, depends upon how the lab sends us the results.  If the lab provides results to us in a structured, computer-friendly format (which we prefer), they will appear in the \"lab\" section; on the other hand, if we receive them via fax, we will forward those pages to the patient in PDF format, which can be viewed on the portal as well, in the \"messages\" section.  We agree it would be much better if every lab provided their results in structured format, but not all lab vendors are doing that just yet.  We are working hard with our lab vendors to make that a reality, and have been for some time.  We expect that in the very near future, virtually all of our patients' results, including labs drawn here at the office, will be received in a structured way (and, in turn, passed along to the patient that way).  We would like to make things as easy and intuitive as possible, and we agree that would help.

Some day soon, they will.  We give each of our patients all of the time they need, and we can only hope that you and your husband have felt that.  We strive to get the right care to the right patient at the right time, and for that reason we have two other providers in our practice at present, an NP and a PA.  They are both quite skilled at treating complex patients, but they naturally tend to see patients for visits that are less complex on average than those handled exclusively by the doctor, and so for some patients there are many times that they may offer a more efficient healthcare encounter.  Consider visiting one of them in the future, and we believe you will find it to be a pleasant experience that you may even prefer.  Every patient will be seen by the doctor periodically as well, and the doctor is always available when necessary.  With respect to the question regarding a return call, we wouldn't want to discuss the specifics of a particular patient's situation in a public forum; however, if there were an urgent matter, we would ask that in the regrettable event that you don't hear back from us promptly, that you simply reach out to us again to check on the status of the issue and to reiterate the urgency of the matter; if there were to be a medical emergency, we would recommend that you seek care at a hospital emergency department and call an ambulance if necessary.

We believe you bring up an important point that we would like to highlight.  It\u2019s true that patients sometimes have a wait to see their doctor or practitioner, and we take no pleasure in it when a patient is upset.  We would respectfully disagree, though, that this is due to a lack of regard for our patients\u2019 time.  In fact, we see it as quite the opposite.  We take our time with our patients.  Most patients have many questions, each of which deserves respect, and we strive to consider each one thoroughly at the time it is asked, rather than asking the patient to arbitrarily pick just one or two and return for yet another appointment at another time to handle the rest, which would delay care for weeks or months and require another trip to the office (and possibly another copayment).  We document the decisions we make together in a thoroughly detailed manner, often in the presence of the patient, which takes some time but improves the quality of care and communication.  We also care for our own patients in the hospital, which makes care in the hospital more safe, comfortable, and efficient. (This also means that the first patient in the office on a given day is probably not the first patient of the day overall.)  Whenever possible, we address routine screening and wellness concerns at each visit, so the patient does not have to wait until the annual \u201cwellness\u201d or \u201cphysical\u201d visit to receive that care; whenever appropriate, depending on the medical situation, we may perform that service on the same day as a visit for specific medical problems, to save the patient some time; the total cost to the patient is the same, and in some cases the total reimbursement to the practice is less, but most importantly the patient doesn\u2019t have to make an extra trip to the office.  We acknowledge that life is full of trade-offs, and some of the ones we choose to make at our practice have occasionally resulted in wait times longer than we would like.  We are continuously working to improve that, and we are absolutely confident that we will as our systems and workflows improve, but the truth is that the vast majority of our patients believe that it has been worth it, and we would agree with them.  We have tremendous respect for our patients, their time, and their concerns, and we are proud to provide medical care in a way that we are confident reflects that respect - even if it\u2019s necessary to wait at times to experience it.  We consider it a privilege to care for you as our patient and hope to see you again soon."}, "gmap_id": "0x88621310f9455325:0x5c077b603254c00e"}

During this visit she told him of problems she was having and he prescribed medicine and told her of some labs he wanted her to take. We called our insurance and verified these labs were ok. Later after the labs we get a bill for $550. Two labs on this bill that were not covered were never discussed with my wife and she did not know she was having them done. I called the dr. Office and his nurse said the dr. Added these labs and she said they have been having problems with insurance companies not covering them. I asked her why the dr. Did not discuss this with my wife first and the only thing she told me was that the cdc recommends them. Well the CDC is not my insurance company. I called my insurance and asked what was the problem. They told me that the dr sent them the wrong codes. That he sent routine codes instead of diagnostic codes. They called him and asked for the diagnostic codes and he refused to give them the codes saying there were no other codes that can be given. Well I think the insurance company would know if there were no other codes or not. Anyway I called the dr. And asked them why would they knowingly have my wife take labs, they did not discuss with her first, knowing our insurance probably would not pay for if it is only routine and not for a diagnostic purpose. I still have no answer and a big bill for something my wife neither needed or was told he was doing.I DONT TRUST THESE PEOPLE, I CANNOT TRUST dR. gREEN TO DO WHAT IS MEDICALLY AND MORALLY BEST FOR ME AND WIFE.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1594449061360, "text": "Sir, We are sorry that you are so upset. We are generally meticulous about discussing each diagnostic test that we order with each patient, and the reason for doing so. That's important, in part, for this very reason - we can never know with complete certainty what an insurance company may or may not cover. And, of course, our medical decisions are made, first and foremost, with the good of the patient in mind; whether the insurance company decides to cover them, while important, is a secondary consideration. Medical decisions are made between the patient and the doctor, and no one should come in between that sacred bond. There are various different reasons that a test might be felt to be indicated - sometimes to evaluate an active problem, and other times to screen for a potential problem - and the tests and treatments we select are generally chosen according to scientific evidence and/or according to the clinical guidelines that define the standard of medical care in our country. The \"codes\" are used to communicate the reasons for tests to the insurance company; sometimes there is more than one code that could be used for a given test for a given patient (because there may be several reasons a test is ordered at a certain point in time), and other times there is really only one code that is appropriate. Some tests the insurance company may decide that they will never cover, and others they may cover only for certain reasons (which can change without notice). If they choose not to cover a test, it's usually not so much because the \"wrong\" code was sent, but rather because they have chosen not to cover that test for the reason it was ordered. If we can ever provide them other reasons, or codes, that weren't submitted at first because the first set of reasons sent seemed to the doctor to be an adequate explanation, then we will send those additional codes. But sometimes, all of the reasons we supply just aren't enough to get the insurance company to cover the test. Sometimes there are other codes that might get them to cover the test, but these aren't really the \"right\" codes unless they actually apply to the reasons the test was ordered for that patient at that time. We understand you are upset, and we understand why. But we would respectfully suggest that your concerns about lack of coverage are better directed to your medical insurance plan, which may have a different idea of \"medical necessity\" than your doctor, and we would further respectfully suggest that you consider that your doctor is the one that defines medical necessity, and that while the doctor has nothing to gain from ordering more tests, the insurance company could potentially have something to gain from declining to pay for some tests. We stand behind the reasons we order all of the tests we order, and the reasons are quite thoroughly documented in each patient's medical record, and we refuse to let another entity dictate to us what is appropriate for our patients.  We strive to review all the tests ordered and their reasons, but there is a lot that goes on during medical appointments, particularly ones that are conducted in-depth as ours are, and while we also work to ensure that the patient understands very well the plan of care, it's quite a lot to ask the patient to also remember every last test ordered and the exact reason why. While it would be great if the patient could remember all of that, that's really more the job of the doctor to take care of that in the medical record. If we failed to mention a test and the reason for it, we certainly wish to apologize. We would just ask you to consider the possibility that all of the tests ordered may have been discussed with your wife, and perhaps she was understandably more focused on the problem that was bothering her than on all of the screening tests that were also being ordered as part of a comprehensive visit. We consider it a privilege to care for our patients and will do whatever we can to be of service."}, "gmap_id": "0x88621310f9455325:0x5c077b603254c00e"}

Neither of us could ever get a receipt (after we would beg) that matched any of our insurance bills. That may be because they listed us as missing appointments (we have never missed an appointment) or as not even having them!

You can\u2019t get them by phone at all so you have to go through the portal for all things. Not a problem unless the staff is as non-responsive as they seem to be.

So frustrating, I may as well have been talking to a robot. You have to pay $60 dollars a year for an online service (that you don\u2019t have to use, because you can still just call if you prefer) and if you opt out of the unnecessary online service then they charge you $10 for every piece of mail they would send you. Ridiculous and unnecessary. I suspect they have too many clients because they don\u2019t do a good job of making new clients feel welcome and taken care of. The CRNP I saw was good, but there are too many layers of unnecessary headache between the client and her. I chose this place because it came highly recommended to me by family, but apparently that was years ago before the new onboarding and client management process, and when I asked why this new process was so terrible, she said it didn\u2019t use to be that way. I was told that my family member was probably \u201cgrandfathered\u201d in to the old system. If the new client management system was truly better, easier, more intuitive, and actually added value for older customers, then why would they not institute it with all their clients?

We are always working for continual improvement at Innova and it is encouraging to hear that you share our frustration with the widespread dependence on unreliable communication methods like fax machines and telephone calls to transfer critical patient information between medical facilities in our community. We strive to avoid paper orders and utilizing faxes, but because so few clinics and hospital facilities locally utilize modern communication methods, we are still forced to send 86% of our communications with other clinics by \"electronic fax.\" This just means that we don't use paper to send the fax, but it's still a picture of a document sent over a phone line as opposed to electronic communication with structured data in a standardized format that increases accuracy and safety.

The have automated a lot of their administrative processes and use technology to their advantage (e.g. having a patient web portal where you can communicate with them, see test results, schedule appointments, etc). The result is that it frees the providers up to focus on the patient rather than paperwork. And their appointment times run like clockwork. Like a 9am appointment is really 9am, and if they are 10 minutes late, they are apologizing profusely.\n\nEvery provider I have dealt with at Innova also gets an \"A\" for bedside manner. Sometimes medical issues aren't easy to discuss, even with medical professionals. However, Innova providers really have a warm interpersonal, friendly demeanor that takes that edge off.\n\nThey also focus on general wellness and health as much as medicine, that is they don't just throw pills at you. They actually have a full time dietician/nutritionist and a wellness program you can enroll in. So if you are looking to lose weight or just not be a generally average unhealthy Alabamian, it's better to do it under medical supervision from people who know what they are doing.\n\nAlso, they take my insurance (Aetna), and their rates/discounts are reasonable, so that's nice too.

These are my reasons behind that. I don\u2019t like coming into a doctor\u2019s office and not be greeted by a friendly face. Instead you\u2019re greeted by a keyosk (however you spell it) walking you through steps to sign in and pay. Next when you are seen, the visits are rushed and I feel that I\u2019m just a number patient on the list,  instead of a person who they are taking their time with to answer any questions or concerns I may have. I have left several times knowing that I did not get the opportunity to address all of my concerns. While I know this is a business, and money has to be exchanged for services, If you are behind on a payment of $10 or whatever, I don\u2019t appreciate being called by a \u201cmafia like\u201d voice message indicating I have 24 hours to pay you, and that I cannot be seen until that is resolved. Lastly, my father was recently scheduled for a procedure. However,  his blood pressure was too high. Stroke level to be exact. Innova was called and they refused to see him at their office even when the nurse where he was called them, hoping that would make a difference.  They claimed there is a balance on his account, which there isn\u2019t. This is very poor judgement on a so called health care professional. Copies of the canceled checks have been shown indicating he was up to date, but they just dropped him as a patient.  I along with the rest family have \u201cDROPPED \u201c Innova as our primary health care facility. Anyone looking for a general practitioner, should never go here. Thanks.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1532654563903, "text": "Diedre, We hope you are able to establish with a new provider with which you have a trusting provider-patient relationship. While we cannot discuss patient cases on a public form as you have brought up, I have certainly enjoyed talking to your father myself several times over the past few weeks and was happy to take care of his medical needs. We look forward to seeing him again soon. Medical billing can be a frustrating and confusing issue especially in this time of increasing deductibles.  We deal with this on behalf of our patients frequently and are happy to discuss these questions or concerns with our patients to get them resolved.\n\nOur current practices at Innova include being open on Saturdays for sick visits and for those who work during the week as a convenience to them.  We do not fully staff the office on Saturdays so you will not see one of my team sitting at the guest reception desk in the lobby. My team needs their weekends too! Otherwise, Christine or one of my other team members is at the guest reception desk to greet you.  I regret you have not felt heard at your office visits.  This is one of our highest priorities at Innova.  We sometimes find that we cannot adequately address all of a patient\u2019s concerns within one office visit and in those instances we will ask you to continue to follow up with us until all has been addressed. Lastly, our billing company will begin calling patients after three statements have been sent out without payment to collect that payment for medical services already rendered. We are always willing to set up a payment plan for any amount. Unfortunately some patients do expect to be able to remain current patients and receive medical services without payment thus we use resources such as the AMA and the AAFP Practice Management recommendations to assist us with how best to address these issues.\n\nAgain, we wish you all the best."}, "gmap_id": "0x8862132e04d8184d:0xb0d4fc8e9fba4586"}

I didn't get the message, as I never dreamed they wouldn't be in direct contact with me. So, nearly a week later, I get a same day appointment at Innova.  I walk in with a cane. They proceed to tell me they cannot do anything for me. I barely made it there and it's late in the day. I insist there must be sonething to do since I couldn't perform basic hygiene or walk.  So they sent in another and another staff member, as I explained myself over and over I became more agitated and more explicit about what I couldn't do as a result of the blindibg pain. They finally arranged a MRI that afternoon at close of day. I went.\nI hear back next day that my hip is shot and that I need  hip replacement.The orthopaedic surgeon said the year plus old xrays were clearly indicative of hip replacement some time ago  One heels of this news,  then I find Innova has deemed me innapropriate to be their patient. They sent person after person to witness my behavior and to justify their getting rid of me, not as I thought, to find someone on their staff who understood me.\nSo, If you are in excruciating pain, or have pressing health issues for a primary care doctor to manage, I would not recommend Innova. They had been my doctor for months at the time of the incident. They had not consulted with specialists who were caring for me. Then at my most vulnerable, they threw me out. I'm  certain I would have been better off at the ER with some random tramua doctor than to go there and be treated / not treated as I was by them.\nThey rely on their portal, messaging, voicemails emails and texts. A bit hands off for me anyway, that was a contributor to my missed communication and frustration, and prolonged pain.

When Dr. Uptagrafft asked if I had anything I would like her to check out, she didn't hesitate to check into it. She ran tests and did an ultrasound and, sure enough my thyroid was enlarged and, my levels were off. I eventually had to have my thyroid removed. I've heard many people have gone years with undiagnosed thyroid issues because, their doctors were so quick to dismiss the issue as something else without testing the levels or doing an ultrasound to rule it out. At innova they listen to your concerns and, they do what they can to get to the bottom of any issues you may have.
