My son Matt was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes at age 4. After reading an internet article on Diabetic Alert Dogs (DAD\u2019s) my wife and I was motivated to find more about how a DAD could improve the quality of life for Matt and our family. We found many stories of success and quite a few horror stories as well. In our search, we ran across the name of a dog trainer in our area, Frances. I called Frances and told her our story. I told her of our fear of Matt going to sleep and not recognizing a low then going into a seizure. I told her of how we feared Matt coming up on driving age and getting in the car after practicing sports and not realizing a low blood sugar and having a seizure while driving. We had these fears because Matt had seizures due to failure to recognize the signs and symptoms of low blood sugars. I was hoping Frances could point me in some direction but she did much more than that. After hearing our story, she told me she worked with a service dog organization but their organization had never trained a DAD but if we were willing to work with her she would do her best to help. We did and so did she. Frances and Ashley worked to develop was has become a very successful Diabetic Alert Dog Training program at Service Dogs of Alabama.

It's a throw back atmosphere with modern equipment. You can tell the owners wanted it to be a relaxing family environment because of how welcoming the staff makes you feel. The fact it's one of the largest helps and the owners work out daily helps them stay in touch with the needs of the members. What I liked most is the variety. Rarely do you find a gym that's big enough to offer more than fitness. At this place, they offer martial arts, crossfit section, bodybuilding, aerobics, meals, smoothie bar and several other classes to meet your fitness needs.

From what i gather, management has changed.\nI used to would shop at several of the locations at least once a week. I would pick up things for others who were in need as well. If it didnt work for them at thrift prices i could afford to buy it & put it back til i found someone who could wear/use it.\nNow I can't afford to do that. The last time I went shopping there, I came back with 3 used clothing items which cost me around $15. My mom came over with new clothes she had gotten on sell fot $1 at Walmart. The point of thrifting is being thrifty. JCPenny's & other department stores has new clothes for clearance around these prices.\nI enjoy the \"treasure seeking\" process of going to the thrift store but it is more fun when the treasure wasn't wrestling for a spot in your budget.\nI'm not the only one who feels this way. The parking lots used to stay full of customers. Now nit nearly as much traffic goes through there to weed through the donated goods.

My son had ymca learning program at this time for online class due to c19. Last week was horrible. I sent zoom meeting information with teacher email on Tue which is saying that she would need class in zoom meeting at first week. Manager replied she needs schoology log in info. I had to reply again on Wed morning that my son needed to attend zoom meeting instead of schoology. But he missed Wed. I sent email again that let him attend on Thur & Fri finally. On Thur, my son missed again. So during meeting, I called manager to check it out. She did not know it. Finally on Fri. my son attended fully. So my son was not happy and comfortable with YMCA service. Me neither. Without care, I paid $120 each week. My son told me his elder sister could help him instead of YMCA. So this week Mon, as soon as my son dropped in YMCA, I sent email to manager that I need to cancel. She replied she saw my son and asked me about changing my mind. I replied immediately that I would want to cancel asap your confirmation. She replied at 11oclock that she cancelled from next week. So I called her and asked her that I wanted to cancel this week and get refund. She said that even one day attendance would change all week payment. So she won't give refund no matter one day attendance of my son. It does not make sense at all. YMCA is very greedy. Even I sent her email at 8clock at Monday morning. I sent email to manager and cc to director. But the same reply. Very greedy. I am still very mad at this.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2b9e17217137:0xcaa6c459c1c9784"}

It\u2019s almost like they get off on stringing me along but I\u2019m not gonna beg them to come pick up my stuff. They should be the ones asking me. Oh wait, that\u2019s right they did ask me when they called in the first place. Yeah, right. Good luck with that. I wanted to donate my mother\u2019s clothing. She passed a way a few month\u2019s ago and would have wanted it that way.

Neither of us realized how badly she needed to go to The Lovelady! My 2 children went there to live with her in June 2017, and our 3rd baby arrived August 2017. Had she not gone to TLC, she wouldn't have learned to live first for God and the rest would fall into place, nor would I. Even after moving out of the center they are still there for her, they're there for us! The people are amazing people of God and are an amazing support system!! They're still our family and friends and to be honest, we've never known friends, love, and support the way they've shown to our family!

We've always liked the private swimming lessons experience and those instructors have always been excellent. We used to love the Kids Night Out program, but they've made it less conducive for our child who is not into socializing. I wish they had some kind of classes for beginners especially yoga. Administrative people are nice but don't seem to be on the same page with information. Cleaning attendants are friendly and always hard at work. Now that my children are 8 and 11 they do not feel comfortable going in the ladies dressing room which I totally agree with but I do not feel comfortable letting them go in the men's area because there is no privacy for them. I'm not comfortable with them being exposed to naked men or having to expose themselves. Probably a lot to ask for a kids dressing area or family room. There is a changing room/storage room by the pool but I think it's really just meant for storage. It would be great if they would post the status of the pool on Facebook or via text.

While some reviewers may speak improperly,  regarding them, the majority of people familiar with Caritas and Terry (A Friend of Medjugorje), recognize Caritas as a special place, blessed with the presence of Our Lady, and a lifestyle, unhampered, by the modernism of today.  Many things, written in humility, by Friend of Medjugorje,  have become evident as truth, as time moves forward.  While no one, or group, can claim to be perfect, Caritas sets a wonderful example of how best to live the precepts of a Christian life.  While the narrow path they choose, isn't chosen by everyone, in this world, it exemplifies a profound dedication to Love, Hope, Charity, and Perseverance.  Anyone seeking to understand, what God's Blessings, can truly mean, if one dedicates their life to Christ, through Our Holy Mother, only needs to visit this Heavenly place, in Alabama.

My family visited there almost 4 years ago and we have been coming back ever since. Walking around their grounds you can tangibly feel the presence of Our Lady & Her spouse the Holy Spirit. Getting to see the witness of the community members over the past 4 years has deepened my faith, has led to a deeper conversion within my family, and has led to a personal indescribable love for Jesus, His Mother Mary, and His Church. The thing that really stood out to me was the love that the community members showed each other and showed my family. I have a fairly rambunctious group of kiddos and their energy only brought loving smiles. Smiles during the Rosary, during the Chaplet of Divine Mercy, and all of their interactions with them. They are a beautiful community focused on introducing the world to Our Lady of Medjugorje to bring as many souls to Jesus as they possibly can.\n\nIf you get a chance to visit, take the time to:  1) Pray the Rosary in the Field of Apparitions where Our Lady of Medjugorje has appeared prior to apparition time (rosary starts at 11:00am in the summer // 10:00am in the spring/fall). 2) Pray the Stations of the Cross on a hike to the Cross on top of Penitentiary Mountain. 3) Hike the mountain across the valley from the Cross to the Grotto La Pluie. 4) Pray the Chaplet of Divine Mercy at 3:00pm.\n\nLastly, satan hates this place because of the community's love of Our Lady & their work of bringing more people to Jesus through His Mother.  People's negative reactions to this beautiful community can only be explained through that perspective.\n\nJohn 15:18-21: 18 \u201cIf the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you.[a]  19 If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.  20 Remember the word that I said to you, \u2018A servant[b] is not greater than his master.\u2019 If they persecuted me, they will persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also.  21 But all this they will do to you on my account, because they do not know him who sent me\".\n\nMatthew 7:16-18: 16 \"You will know them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles? 17 So, every sound tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears evil fruit.  18 A sound tree cannot bear evil fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit\".\n\nThrough Mary to Jesus,\nMike", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88896acde5666be3:0x963bf93c3a056567"}

But haven't yet reviewed this location. It's here that your donations arrive and are priced, and then are sent To various branches for sale. There's an elderly gentleman who is in charge of electronics, who does this pricing. And he's an outright con artist.\n\nThat said, he's the reason primarily for the majority of my poor reviews at other locations, as it happens. He told me once that his prices were \"on par with eBay\". And I retorted, \"the people on eBay are making some of the money back that they spent on the product initially. That's the entire point. They're sold at a discounted price because they're used. They're not donations such as the things found at the Goodwill. The point for you is to make a profit, but when there's no overhead, it's all profit! So if a set of speakers cost $200 brand new, and they're twenty years old, and they were free to you, there's no reason to not let him go for thirty bucks or less. It's all free money\". When I donate items to the Goodwill it's not only for the money to go towards the community or whatever, it's so that somebody can get something nicer that they can generally afford. A \"come up\" or a \"blessing\". And for the money to go bsck to my community. Not to scalp my fellow shoppers. Check out woth Google how much their CEO made last year, when you have time.\n\nThen there's the issue of the products themselves. There's no returns, and the vast majority of the electronics you're not in a position to test without a computer maybe, or an audio system capable of powering whatever device you're looking at. I bought an expensive camera once because it powered on so I assumed it was functional, and it wasn't. Couldn't tell until I had it plugged into a computer at home. Once, a streaming player that powered on. Assumed it to work then...but no. It turned itself off after a few minutes without the remote...which it didnt have. Another time I bought a set of vintage speakers cabinets but didn't have the presence of mind to check if there were any speaker drivers inside. That's right, they were Hollow. He's told me that he checks them with a 9-volt battery which is a very plebeian way of doing it. That will just tell you if they're blown completely out, not that there's anything wrong with them. Not to mention, he definitely didnt check with a 9-volt battery the speakers that he sold me. As an example of his overpriced foolishness, I saw today a set of soundtech vintage speakers commonly used by DJ's for sale. Expensive. Maybe $1000 new.  My first thought after my previous experience was to take the covers off and make sure that they were drivers inside and what did I find? A whole other brand. I'll Grant you cerwin Vegas aren't bad speakers, and in fact my Mains at home are Cerwin Vegas. Probably the best rock and roll speakers ever made. But these are definitely not those models, and theyre definitely not worth the price of a sound tech set such as match the covers that are on there (that they lead you to believe that they are). In fact, most people would hesitate before removing the covers for fear of damaging them....so you wouldn't know. Those speakers sold for $60-sonething bucks EACH (NOTHING SHOULD COST THAT AT GOODWILL for one, and two, separating vintage sets should have you shot at dawn) are REALLY worth far less.\n\nI saw a man loading them up and attempted to hip the guy, but he was of a different skin color than me, and immediately became very defensive and rude. As a white male visiting the south.... I've learned to not even bother. So he can find out for himself.\n\nRip off artists here.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4cd9f20229b1:0x1747cc31627f6c0c"}
