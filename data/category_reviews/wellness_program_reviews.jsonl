A full 2 years of my body aching bone deep, I didn't have the energy to get beyond half a day. I knew my hormones were way out of balance.  I also knew something was more wrong than being a 50yr old menopausal woman who had to live with it.  The program was explained in detail.  Once my lab work came back.  I mean an extensive panel of labs!  The proof was right there in front of me.  The Team at Vital Force tailored a program to fit my needs.  It took about 3 weeks of taking supplements and IV infusion therapy then I noticed a huge change in my self. Each week, I was better than the last.  I HAVE MY LIFE BACK !!  I feel better than I have in years.  If you don't take time to take care of yourself, you body will make you do it !

He has a genuine nature, a respect for where you are in the process, and a drive to see you return to wellness.  He took the time to evaluate me and was methodical in his design of a plan that worked not only in the clinic but could be transitioned to home. He championed me through tough times with kindness, professionalism, and a warmth that led to a trust which is necessary for the recovery process to be successful.  He is a credit to his profession and an asset to TherapySouth.\nThroughout the following weeks, I worked with Abbey.  Abbey is truly a pioneer in her field.  She is focused and attentive during every session, kind, compassionate, knowledgeable, and helpful.  When I was doubtful, she was always there to encourage me, being honest with me about the challenges I would face, yet reassuring me that I would one day be able to return to a life filled with many athletic endeavors.  Abbey is understanding and genuinely takes a personal interest in how you're feeling.  She always made sure to explain every exercise in depth and also how it would aid in my progress going forward.  I feel lucky to have been guided by Abbey along my PT journey, for it was her encouragement that pushed me through when I was at my lowest.\nHannah is also extremely helpful and efficient.  Being the face you see when you first walk in, she is cheerful and always greets the patients by name.  TherapySouth has an amazing team and, more importantly, great teamwork.

Both were done by the same surgeon. My first surgery was in November of 2015. I did physical therapy at another Hoover clinic (not a therapy south) and I grew to hate physical therapy, physical therapists, anything associated with them. I honestly believed the profession was a crock because of the poor care I had received at that clinic. I didn\u2019t know any better! My hip never got better, it was much weaker than before, and three years later, is still in pain and lacking the function I had prior. My skepticism towards physical therapy as it turns out, was just because I went to the wrong place. After a shoulder surgery in May of 2016, I was referred to Chris and Corey from a friend and my outlook could not be more different now. Not only did they cater my shoulder rehab to my specific sport (weightlifting), they also helped me repair my hip and alleviate some of my pain. I\u2019m a true believer in physical therapy now, even going as far as changing my career path so I can also change someone\u2019s outlook. Chris and Corey go above and beyond for you and Lauren is always a friendly face when I come into the office. I can\u2019t say enough good things.
