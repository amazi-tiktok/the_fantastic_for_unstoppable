During this time our discussion turned to military divorce with myself being a 22 year veteran and having experienced a divorce while on active duty. The short conversation made me wish Mitchell had been my divorce attorney. Some of our discussion topics were SSCRA, mandatory DFAS verbiage, and the 20/20 rule. These are topics I learned the hard way and discovered not every lawyer who professes to be a military divorce expert is familiar with (for the record I can immediately name 3 locally). I did a lot of research during and after my divorce and can tell you that Michell has a firm grasp of the intricacies of military divorces (and he's even written a book further demonstrating his understanding). After conversing with him and reading his book, I would fully recommend Mitchell Howie as a military divorce attorney and suggest hiring him so your spouse doesn't.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1580534496427, "text": "Richard I am very happy we were able to help you with your general legal consult and thank you so much for the kind review!

During this time our discussion turned to military divorce with myself being a 22 year veteran and having experienced a divorce while on active duty. The short conversation made me wish Mitchell had been my divorce attorney. Some of our discussion topics were SSCRA, mandatory DFAS verbiage, and the 20/20 rule. These are topics I learned the hard way and discovered not every lawyer who professes to be a military divorce expert is familiar with (for the record I can immediately name 3 locally). I did a lot of research during and after my divorce and can tell you that Michell has a firm grasp of the intricacies of military divorces (and he's even written a book further demonstrating his understanding). After conversing with him and reading his book, I would fully recommend Mitchell Howie as a military divorce attorney and suggest hiring him so your spouse doesn't.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1580534496427, "text": "Richard I am very happy we were able to help you with your general legal consult and thank you so much for the kind review!

It was an uncontested divorce except for the fact that my ex wanted child support. Well, I didn't know any better, and I knew she wouldn't sign the papers if there was no child support so I agreed to give her what Mr. Campbell had come up with: $400. My ex originally wanted something like $650 per month so I looked at that as a win. Well, after talking with different people who have joint legal and physical custody like I do, they wonder why in the hell am I paying my ex ANY child support, since I have her week on and week off. And, after talking with two different lawyers, they wonder the same thing. The lawyer I have now told me if I'd taken our case to court, the judge would NOT have awarded child support to my ex. We will be going back to court needless to say, will definitely not be using Mr. Campbell who screwed me over.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1450297464686, "text": "Dear Mr. Kemp, I appreciate the opportunity to have assisted with your case, but I do wish you had taken an opportunity to follow up with me about these concerns.  I did leave a message for you to call me concerning this matter, but I have not heard back from you.  I can address your concerns here.  As you might recall, you came to me to fix the agreement that you had tried to file on your own and that the court had rejected.  Without going into the details of the numbers involved with your case (which details are a matter of record) I can confidently say that you would likely have been ordered to pay around $400 per month in child support if you were awarded true joint physical custody after a trial.  If you had tried your case and been awarded joint legal custody, with your wife being awarded sole physical custody, you would have likely been ordered to pay around $650 per month.  Note that there is a difference between joint physical, versus joint legal, custody.  In Alabama, child support must still be calculated, and the judge still must state whether or not Rule 32 has been followed, even in joint physical custody situations.  This means that one party who makes significantly more than the other may still have to pay an amount of child support, and the method used to calculate $400 per month in your case is one that is accepted by the courts.  If two people make the same income, or have an agreement to deviate from guidelines, it is possible to have an order without child support.  Those conditions were not present in your situation.  The alternative would have been to pay me (or another lawyer) much more money to take your case to trial, and make an argument for custody and support, the result of which would not have been a certainty (and could result in less favorable terms of custody and having to pay more support than your agreement).  I'll be glad to explain this to the other persons that have provided feedback to you, as I fear that they must be either misinformed as to the facts or the law.  I am glad to have had the opportunity to assist you, and I will be happy to follow up with you concerning any questions that you have about this matter."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626b54406e816d:0xec1834fe93991c53"}

We contacted several Lawyers before speaking with Whitney Polson and no one told us the real deal like Mr. Polson did. We were so impressed with his consultation that we paid 75% of his starting fee that day! And he delivered far better than what other lawyers had told us which was mostly \"I will try but.....\" . One lawyer even told him he was \"screwed\". Polson worked with us on the remaining balance and when court day arrived he worked his amazing skills and was able to get the DUI dismissed!! The other charge will be dismissed once a class is completed within 4 months. Mr. Polson will always be our 1st choice and I strongly recommend them!!!

Talk about availability! We spoke briefly about the case and then fully the next day with what both of our expectations could be and how we would like to resolve this, with no guarantees. However, my confidence definitely was boosted, especially when we went though the case and they requested discovery. Fast forward 7 days later, the case ended was dismissed! This should be your only stop if you're up against the wall. I couldn't have had a friendlier, professional, and timely resolution. They had answers not only prior, but during the process.

Everyone has the right to post something negative online so this is a safe space for you to vent.  I\u2019ve been doing this for almost 20 years and have seen most everything and dealt with all different types of people.  We tried to reach out to you three times by telephone to figure out what it is that you were upset about but you refuse to answer the phone and actually talk to us.  I guess you are busy working on your complaint to the attorney general\u2019s office and the Alabama State Bar (both of which we welcome you to file by the way - that is your right).  So, let me get this straight - you were visiting Alabama from Texas and you received a speeding ticket. You waited about a month and contacted our law firm to ask for help in handling the ticket.  We responded immediately, gave you the care and concern that you were seeking, went over the process with you and your options.  We quoted you a very reasonable fee and told you what we could do in order to resolve the case.  You told us that was too much and you were going to pay the ticket and move on - obviously that would not be based on our suggestion because we ALWAYS try to avoid a conviction for our clients (and we are a traffic ticket defense law firm... that you contacted for help).  Presumably, before you paid the ticket, you attempted to communicate on your own to try and get the ticket resolved (which every defendant out there has the right to do - only most people would do that first before contacting us but I guess that didn\u2019t occur to you).  You then called us back and were upset because you resolved the ticket on your own\u2026allegedly - after checking, it is clear that no resolution has been entered into the state system.  We love you man - but whatever it is that is troubling you has nothing to do with us - we hope you get whatever it is straightened out.  As for the frivolous complaints you have tried to threaten us with to the Alabama Attorney General\u2019s office and the Alabama State Bar - bring it on.  We fight like hell for ourselves just like we fight like hell for our clients.  And another thing you may want to keep in mind - the goal of resolving a traffic ticket is so that you have no conviction and presumably no public record of it.  But, you sir, have done a great job of creating a public record of it for whatever reason and for the entire world to see.  Best of luck to you.  Joseph C.

We always love and enjoy any type of feedback. We \u2764\ufe0fpublic criticism of our firm because it allows others to see how we handle our business and how we respond and most of all, it causes us to step back and fully analyze a problem or situation to see what happened, where we can improve and it gives us a valuable opportunity to reach out to a client who is clearly hurting and offer support in whatever way we can.\nThe only issue in reaching out to you is that we do not know who you are and this is the first we have heard of any problem such as the one you describe - unfortunately, we do not currently have and have never had a client by the name of Butch Pinkston.  If I personally have an issue with a business, I usually contact the business directly and try to resolve whatever it is that is going on.  Businesses don\u2019t get to make things up or hide behind fake names on the internet - I am as transparent as it gets and all of my actual clients know this.\n*I have been practicing law for 16+ years and have successfully resolved 17,000+ charges for clients over that period of time.  I am a man - through and through - if someone has a problem with me, all they have to do is explain what the issue is and if I have made a mistake, then I am glad to admit the mistake, apologize and fix it.  That is the measure of a man.\nAnyone that knows me and that I have helped knows that I am not a hack, a liar or deceitful - far from it.  If only a successful law practice could be run with a paralegal through text messages - but as you would know if we actually represented you, when someone hires us they are able to text us (and our clients LOVE this option), email us, they get a link to schedule an appointment (at a time convenient for the client) to talk with my staff, they also get a link to schedule an appointment (at a time convenient for the client) with an attorney and also, get our direct dial so all they have to do is call us with a question or issue or to schedule a call with anyone that works for me or an attorney (myself included).\n* You don\u2019t get to the level we are and have the impeccable reputation across Alabama and the country that I have by \u201cpromising everything but delivering nothing.\u201d  Close to 100% of our charges we handle are ultimately dismissed - if that is \u201ccookie-cutter law\u201d then so be it.  Apparently, our clients love having their charges dismissed.  We have the utmost interest in defending cases - our actual clients know this.  Every single time we speak to a potential client or go over case resolutions with our clients, our goal is to develop options with the ultimate goal of having the charge(s) dismissed.  Once we have options on the table, we go over those options and our clients get to decide how to proceed - we don\u2019t force anyone to accept any offer on the table and are always available to continue fighting, take the case to the next level or have a trial.  It is our client\u2019s case and they get to decide.\n* Wow - in your review you said, \u201cI expect this kind of lying, duplicitous BS from the cops and the government but not the people you pay good money to represent you.\u201d  Really?  You expect the cops and the government to lie?  What a sad, sad worldview you have - which explains the many false statements you made while hiding behind a fake name.  I practice law to relieve human suffering - period.  No other reason.  I love people - even the people that choose to post random diatribes attacking me on the internet.\n*I invite anyone reading this or looking for a lawyer to Google my name (Joseph Kreps) and review the info about me and my law firm and all of the great work that we do throughout the State of Alabama for clients located all over the world.

I spent 10  hours in jail thinking my life would never be the same again once these charges  permanently stained my record. At first, I figured there was no point in hiring a lawyer  considering the fact that I was caught dead to rights. I was caught speeding. I was  caught with open container. I blew a .11 once I got to the station. What further proof  would they need to charge me with a DUI? How could I possibly get out of that? A  month went by and I still hadn't hired a lawyer. I got to thinking about it and I figured I  would try and find a good DUI attorney to at least provide some good advice before  entering my case single handedly. I then did some research, and happened to stumble  upon Attorney Joseph C Kreps' YouTube videos online that explained what would  happen if I were actually charged with these convictions. They were so enlightening that  I couldn't help but give this guy a call to see if he could help with my case. I gave him a  call & after getting my information & case details\u037e one of the first things his secretary  mentioned was that they may be able to get the sentence reduced to a public  intoxication. I was astounded, thinking there's no way. I was caught dead to rights. I'm  going down. No doubt about it. I then decided to pay the fee and to hire Attorney Joseph  C Kreps' as my DUI Defense Lawyer (not NEAR as high as what I was quoted from  other firms). His very helpful team then guided me through the process of completing a  series of tasks that would help my case. I completed a questionnaire and a few other\nsimple tasks that would, in fact, turn out to help my case tremendously. A month later, I  was scheduled to arrive in court on a Wednesday. On a Monday afternoon prior to my  court date, I received a phone call that explained to me that I wouldn't need to show up  in court on Wednesday and that there was a high possibility that my case was going to  be dismissed. I was absolutely thrilled. How could this happen? I was caught dead to  rights! Two days later I received a phone call and an email from the firm saying that if I  completed a level two CRO, 20 hours of community service, and paid a $600 fine plus  court costs, that all charges were to be dismissed! My entire future was left in the hands  of Attorney Joseph C Kreps, and I couldn't have put it in a better place. I now have no  DUI charges and no open container charges on my record. I'm telling you from  experience, this man and his firm are the absolute best DUI Defense Firm you could  possibly hire for your case. \u00ad If you have a DUI pending \u00ad Stop what you're doing \u00ad Call  this firm. It will be the best call you've ever made.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891905ba2738bb:0x382d0da3c88d46c2"}

The cases were not DISMISSED, they were  NOT PROCESSED.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1531931236940, "text": "Brooke:\nThank you so much for removing the false information from your original review.  We don\u2019t want any trouble with you - you know that - but if a review is posted with false information then that is not fair and everyone would agree with that.  We certainly appreciate your comments and your feedback. We always love and enjoy any type of feedback.  We \u2764\ufe0f public criticism of our firm because it allows others to see how we handle our business and how we respond and most of all, it causes us to step back and fully analyze a problem or situation to see what happened, where we can improve and it gives us a valuable opportunity to reach out to a client who is clearly hurting and offer support in whatever way we can.\nWe never claim to be perfect and certainly don't want anyone to think that we are perfect.  As you know, Brooke, we did not represent you. \u00a0We represented your partner who is going through the immigration process in the United States of America. We take great pride in the knowledge and the experience that we have over the last 15+ years in handling and resolving 13,000\u001e+ charges all over the State of Alabama. When I was made aware of these issues, we reached out to you to try to resolve it within hours and on the next business morning 7-18-18.  When we did reach out ASAP, you went on and on and then hung up on us before we could even talk.  We tried to call back to no avail.  I personally tried to call back to no avail.\nThe first and most important thing that I would like to point out is that BOTH of the actual client\u2019s charges were DISMISSED.  And it wasn\u2019t just a \u201ctraffic ticket\u201d.  He had 2 charges one of which was failure to obey police/fireman.  Immigration is a difficult process and who knows how this could have seriously impacted his immigration issues - that process and system is ALWAYS CHANGING as everyone knows\u2026 but it shouldn\u2019t impact him now because we got BOTH OF HIS CHARGES DISMISSED \ud83d\ude09!\nAs to the class that was required of him, we are sorry that his time was taken from him in order to do that - our main concern was and is his immigration status and getting the charges dismissed.  His completing a class while his lawyers worked through issues beyond anyone\u2019s control seems like a small price to pay to continue the long and difficult process of becoming a legal United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Citizen.\nIt is important for anyone reading this to know that we did email you the DISMISSAL disposition of BOTH CHARGES back in March 2018... and heard not a peep out of you until this review surfaced almost 4.5 months later.  It is baffling.  We love deeply and dearly every single one of our clients and their friends and family including your partner and also you, Brooke. \u00a0We still love you no matter you might post about us.  This is the truth because our love for our clients and our love and passion for our work and the system is not dependent on how others think or feel about us because we know the truth and our love is our love no matter what - it\u2019s just who we are.\nI invite anyone reading this or looking for a lawyer to Google my name (Joseph Kreps) at any time and see all of the great information about me and my law firm and all of the great work that we do throughout the State of Alabama. \u00a0I stand by my work and the work of everyone who is on my team.  We love what we do because we love people and we love to help people - it\u2019s why I am alive and why I was put on this earth and called to do this type of work.\nMuch love to you, Brooke, and your partner.  If you change your mind and desire to speak to me then I am always here and always willing to talk.  If you or any family members need our help again in the future, please let us know as we would be honored to assist and help you with anything that comes up.\nJoseph C.

However, throughout the entire process, Brett made my experience substantially manageable. When I did not feel very hopeful for a chance that my case would go smoothly and in my favor, Brett knew exactly what to do with his developed knowledge of the law and extensive experience in court.\n\nInitially, Brett told me all of the viable options he felt possible and gave me the option to choose what I wanted to proceed with, keeping in mind the potential consequences and how likely he felt things to play out the way we intended and wanted. He was always very upfront, concise, and easy to understand. Brett was always empathetic with how I felt and how different outcomes might affect my personal life and education/career options. Keeping my interests in mind, Brett managed to return the best possible outcome for me while minimally invading on my personal commitments.\n\nWhile it was difficult to appear in court because I live in New York City, Brett kept things simple and never made me appear personally for his own ease. He was easy to contact because I had two emails and his cell phone number. Additionally, he was always quick to reply to my concerns and questions, even after office hours or on weekends. I NEVER felt as though Brett had exclusive control and management of my options because he informed me at every update he received and really leveled with me as an individual to come up with and decide on challenges together.\n\nBecause Brett formally worked \"on the other side of things\" in the courtroom, he knew the ins and outs of what was to be expected from the district attorneys or judges. He knew people personally and they also seemed to think highly of him because they were always friendly in response. This experience was crucial to my case and changed the entire outcome of what I initially thought possible.\n\nBy working with me instead of \"for\" me, Brett took my interests and concerns to heart - he recognized how these sorts of situations are detrimental in many ways and it was obvious he cared about me succeeding in life long after my file was finalized. If I were local to the area at all, Brett would definitely be the attorney I retained consistently for any of my criminal law needs. Also, compared to other attorneys offering me \"worse\" potential outcomes, Brett was super affordable. He made payment quick and easy and was willing to help through consultation and the like before I had submitted payment. Although I paid all at once by credit card, he also offered payment options.\n\nIf you are in the area and need genuine help concerning a criminal record/issue, Brett is the man to talk to! He will put your mind at ease and take care of everything while leaving you in control of your own file and life.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4069bcbc0a43:0xaefa0552b60cb9a4"}

This place moved three times since she has been their client, and they never informed her until she called them herself because they do not contact her. David, the person with whom she asks to speak, is constantly dodging her because he is always \"out of the office\" or \"with another 'more important' client.\" I'm sure NONE of those \"more important\" clients have been as equanimous with them as she has.\n\nDavid has apparently trained his staff to dodge her as well since she called them, and Alice refused to answer the phone (probably because of caller ID) but when I called, she answered the phone just to place us on hold to retrieve something so minuscule that it took less than 30 seconds to do...\n\nApparently this lawyer and his team care nothing about their clients--and dare I say clients of color... But this is the behavior that is typical of many businesses in the north central region of Alabama. Once the better business bureau is contacted, however, maybe they will change their tone.\n\nIf she had not contacted the actual courthouse to get her court date, she would not have even known of the impending court date. After calling these people several times, they refused to give her any of her case details.\n\nSo with regard to the other negative review this institution has received, I do NOT agree with the owner that \"it is the work of a competitor.\" I have seen these practices first-hand, and I am far from a capital seeking adversary.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1594754666809, "text": "Because we don't recognize your name and you don't appear to be a client of our firm, based off your screen name, there's no way for us to address this issue without knowing the exact name of the client. We also do not have, nor have we ever had, any employees by the name of David or Alice. Are you sure you have the correct firm?\n\nIn relation to your comment about \"people of color,\" approximately half of our clients are non-caucasion clients and are \"people of color.\" We have dedicated this firm to representing clients who have been injured, oppressed, overlooked and not been treated fairly, regardless of their designation. Over the years, the lawyers and staff of our firm have also volunteered countless hours of their personal time participating in charities and outreach programs that benefit all segments of our community.\n\nAlthough we're respectful of your opinion, the assertions you've made about the issue of race are reckless and inaccurate and thats clearly proven by 17 years of close relationships with people of all genders, races and socio-economic statuses that are repeat clients. Many people leaving reviews on this very site are \"people of color\" and would strongly disagree with your statement and actually take offense to it. Writing a negative review about a business that's never represented you is one thing but making baseless accusations of racial unfairness about people you don't know and who have spent their careers representing underprivileged segments of our state and communities is something else.\n\nIf your mother is dissatisfied with any service that any lawyer or staff member of our firm has ever provided, then please have your mother, personally, reach out immediately and ask for the head practice manager so that we can rectify this matter.\n\nWe take any client dis-satisfaction very seriously and want every client to be satisfied with our efforts.

He refuses to return phone calls. He called me ONE TIME during my divorce, the day before the hearing. He never even bothered to send me the final divorce decree. I had no idea what my divorce papers said until his secretary emailed them to me, after the THIRD request. I know all of his secretaries because they are the only ones I could ever talk to. Half the time, they didn't return phone calls either. Halfway through the 'mediation' I got the distinct feeling that he was working for the other side. He obviously thinks he can make a living by gaining clients, screwing them over, and going on to the next victim. He must be too young and immature to grasp the concept that most people will need an attorney more than ONCE in their lifetime, and if he thinks he can be successful without the benefit of repeat clients, he is delusional. If he was the last attorney on earth, I would never hire him again. My divorce is final; I'm still missing half my belongings; he's promised me a refund twice and never delivered. On top of that, he suggested we file a contempt motion because of the fact that I was not given all the belongings I was entitled to. He didn't mention at the time that he planned on charging me an additional $1500 to do what I'd already paid him to do. In my opinion, the reason all his pictures on FB look like gangster photos is because he is a crook. He will stand there and 'listen' to you, but he is just pretending to hear you. You'd have more luck talking to a brick wall. Plus the brick wall might return your calls. I read a bad review of his, and I should have heeded it.

I took my daughter with me to be my other \"eyes and ears\" as I suffer from anxiety and panic disorders, and needed legal advice as my husband was divorcing me, for the 4th time and I had no money to hire an attorney. April was kind and compassionate and patient. I started off my divorce without a lawyer, as the husband made me all kind of promises, and I believed him. You know the saying \" fool me once, shame on you, fool me 7639 times.....\", well..... things got ugly, and I saved my quarters, dimes, and nickles, worked harder, and on Jan 23, 2018 I hired Miss April Bauder. Why? You don't  fake kindness, that is something  you are taught. You don't fake compassion, that is something you feel. People with handicaps are treated \"different\", and April has never treated me different. She ALWAYS returns my calls, and last, her laughter! She has this infectious,  contagious  BEAUTIFUL laughter!!!!  The last few months have been sorrowful, painful, and soooo much hurt. I could cry til the sun goes down, April calls me and I giggle, and giggle and giggle! Proverbs 17:22 \"a cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.\" (NIV)  AND Leah Thomas? Well, somewhere is a storage unit, there is a sparkling little tiara, for her, and she will be the guest of honor at my next pool party! Thank you, thank you thank you, April. If it wasn't for your volunteer work, I would of never found you. Grateful  for the Merrell Law Firm, and what it produces out of it's  people, for people like me who are struggling....

My mother lost almost $4,000 from him; in which he promised us some good news for a rule 32 appeal in which he wrote to the States of Alabama  for my brother to get a lesser sentence on his case.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1470538568028, "text": "Mr. Richardson, Rule 32's are inherently difficult as you and your family are well aware and were well advised.  They are last ditch efforts after a criminal defendant has been convicted and their appeals denied.  Statistically they have some of the lowest possibility of success in the criminal justice system.  The only thing Eversole Law ever promises anyone is that we will do everything we can to help our clients in any way we can.  And Mr. Richardson, Steven Eversole did not represent your brother, but another attorney in the firm.   You should know that.  Either way,  Mr. Eversole has has great success filing Rule 32 and other post-conviction relief measures for clients, but nothing is ever guaranteed. In 2014 Mr. Eversole himself overturned 287 life sentences and over 2000 years sentence in one case.  In 2013 he overturned a sex crime conviction with life time registration  with an out-of-time Rule 32 Petition in a 26 year old case.  In 2015 Mr. Eversole overturned a several year old drug conviction with another out-of-time Rule 32 Petition.  And again in 2016 Mr. Eversole overturned a 2010, 20 year sentence on a drug trafficking conviction that released our client 15 years earlier on a post conviction relief measure.  And these are just a small accounting of his success. He has won appeals in both criminal and civil matters and been highly successful in both trial and appellate matters in hundreds if not thousands of cases.\n\nHere is just a sampling of Mr. Eversole and the his firm's success: Admitted to practice in All State and Federal Courts in Alabama: \u2022All Alabama State Courts, \u2022Alabama Supreme Court, \u2022Alabama Court of Appeals, \u2022Northern & Middle District of Alabama.

In addition, when she did not get all the information she wanted about the case--attorney client privilege exists to protect the client--she asserted defamatory statements in a public forum. When the client is noncompliant, or is unwilling to pursue certain avenues of a case, the mother of an adult child becomes irritated by outcomes rather than considering the reason for the outcomes. Perhaps one should remember who the client is and that Mom's and Dad's can't make adult children act in a manner for which they want despite the desire to pay for representation.

Roberts is an African American as myself and I feel enriched and blessed to have a firmly established, very educated without question, a sharp attorney \"who represents justice for all\" but makes me proud for testimony; he truly represents the \"black community, in a quality image\". From one African American male to another, both  having Master Degrees Criminology/ Criminal Justice, I respect you sir. One noble undertaking is his lighting quick response in calling you back. Meeting him you might not be sure if he is an attorney or pastor with the extremely sharp increase look of professionalism, yet with a personification of spirituality (bishop Roberts} lol.  So if I said  dam, I would be safe; it  meaning water dam. lolllllllllll. Should I say Amen, or what's up man. lolllll The office also gives you a feel of , I'm in the right direction. I recognize the fundamental principles, hard work, and the possessed skills to have a Masters Degree, and it is a cemented foundation when dealing with the much more complex criminal justice system. The great ideal person to navigate you through this process is attorney Roberts. Sitting in the office a thought popped in my mind as if I were the rebirth of Einstein   \"Faith is not Faith until there is nothing else to do\". The legendary Johnny Cochran is no longer with us; but I believe attorney Roberts is the link in the positive outcome of faith per Cochran. Roberts is an upstanding individual with a soft landing way of articulating questions and answers. He takes a solidified position, with a mental alertness of impressive response. Hedi, is the  secretary who immediately responds to the main mission of achieved information for the Roberts law firm. She carries clout with me because she is very professional and a matured vital link in centerpiece concerns. She is properly focuses on the positively  best moral image and performance contribution of case. Roberts and Hedi, look like models to me. loll. My respected viewers, across the broad spectrum, this law firm has a genuine care of/for your represented best. I had to say more, being retired Navy, one of my embodiment talents is writing and talking. You feel a comfort zone, like you knew him already. Eric, your wife is so pretty in the wedding pictures, and you two compliment, and I'm sure complete each other with guiding principles of love, respect, and equally yoked intelligence. I did not know you were Hollywood in Jet magazine.  I wanted to say we played football together and you was the backup quarterback to me. lollllllllllx 100. Hedi look sooo sexy in that dress in web site pictures.  Dammm she does, Beyonc\u00e9 level sexy. Eric, I am proud of you and firm, and if I can do anything to help I will. Put up more awards and Hedi in those dresses. lollllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll.  I had to zoom in on pictures.   In the criminal justice field a match in identification is essential.  Spinning around in the computer chair, I  jumped up sayings, that's them. lolllllllllllll. Loyal. This is fun, I add more each time I visit this page. I need to stop, you have to meet him to understand. He talk really mellow, mild,  soothing. Example, If your hand shake to the point you can make a milk shake,  you might feel like you can be a dentist after talking with him.\n\"C\"", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4e1ecd9848db:0x52aee1da03742c99"}

Amanda, Fredrick and Osha were just wonderful to work with. The whole staff made me feel comfortable and at ease through a very uncomfortable life circumstance.  While the other party had 5 attorneys through the process , I had one.  I only needed the one team- I had The Best with Sam & Dani Bone. Sam was honest, upfront, bold and encouraging. He never had to be ugly or raise his voice in court or trial and never once belittled anyone. I recall him saying, \"It doesn't have to be ugly\". Being a Christian, a professional, a self employed woman, a Realtor and a mother of 2, this was imperative to me. Sam treated both parties with total RESPECT always . That was very important to me.  I did my part and provided the true facts, evidence and proof- he did his part and presented my case with true professionalism , Integrity and no one was disrespected in the process. I would \ud83d\udcaf percent recommend Sam & Dani Bone if you want to be represented by someone who will always have your back and is not afraid to fight for your best interest. Thank you Sam, Dani, and your amazing team. If I ever need attorney services in the future , I will use you again and will highly recommend you to anyone that I know. You Rock!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a3c1ebee7a0d1:0x403ca2131c0a695b"}

Phone calls/emails are answered promptly and you are made aware of appointments and court actions.

Sam will listen and use what will benefit your case most, helping you to make the best decisions.\n\nThrough my experience, I learned that Sam is wise beyond his years and holds a unique combination of qualities that make him an excellent attorney. He is a younger lawyer in comparison to many of the veterans in the area, but his expertise speaks through shrewd discernment, both in and outside the courtroom.\n\nIn retrospect, I know that employing a professional, well-versed attorney who gave honest legal advice was a valuable asset to me.

He said that he could handle the case; however, it would become more expensive because that area is approximately 4 hours from him. In my opinion, most people wouldn't even care about that. They would only care about running the bill up on you. In addition to that, he even found and referred me to an attorney in that area that could assist me.\n\nI certainly appreciate his honesty and his assistance.

While my charges were from 2017, I was not arrested until 2019 because I was sent to the hospital on the date of the offense instead of jail and diagnosed with Sudden Traumatic Shock exasperated by alcohol.  Being arrested was completely out of the norm for me.  I did not know where to begin, what to expect, and was consistently imagining the worst possible outcomes and scenarios.  Based off my charges, my bail agent highly recommended that I contact Mr. Crumbly for counsel.  I had an initial meeting with Mr. Crumbly within a week from the first time I contacted him.  The initial meeting did not take longer then an hour and during that time Mr. Crumbly was able to explain all my available options to include representation options, payment options, court expectations, and expected timelines.  Perhaps the most beneficial thing Mr. Crumbly discussed in the initial meeting was the overall stress of the situation.  He told me that it was human nature to imagine the worst possible outcomes and to not worry about that as it was him and his teams job to make sure those outcomes don\u2019t happen.  He was absolutely right and ,during the entire course of my case, I constantly imagined the worst possible scenarios; however, I always made myself think back to that initial conversation with Mr. Crumbly and remembered that is why he is there.  After that initial meeting, Mr. Crumbly and his team handled everything for 6 months up until my court date with the Judge.  Before I even had to go before the Judge, Mr. Crumbly had secured a deal with the DA for me to enter the Pre-Trial Intervention Program (PTIP) and have charges dropped following the completion of the program.  I was more than happy to enter PTIP as it took all uncertainty and stress off the table and I was able to hold everything going forward in my own hands.  As of May 2020, I have successfully completed the PTIP program and am currently working with Mr. Crumbly on having my charges expunged.  I am very pleased with the services I have received from Mr. Crumbly and his team and would highly recommend them.

This led to several serious concerns I had as to what negative impacts this DUI might have regarding maintaining my current place of employment, a valid Alabama Driver\u2019s License, and the potential for increased auto insurance rates. In addition, I was uninformed of all the specific issues pertaining to Alabama State Law as they apply to a DUI charge especially, with respect to possible fines, imprisonment, unknown future adverse impacts, or establishment of an unfavorable permanent criminal history. The level of stress in my daily life was extremely high, to say the least, due to this situation and these concerns.\n\nI was referred to the Law Office(s) of Russell W. Crumbley to try and sort all these issues out. Russell put me immediately at ease and clarified for me, in a no-nonsense way, what needed to be done to effectively address the DUI charge against me. He also kept me informed as to the current status of my case as it made its way through the Alabama judicial process and provided reassuring personal representation at any and all court scheduled hearings or appointments. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND retaining Russell as your DUI Attorney should you ever find yourself in a similar situation. He is a completely knowledgeable and competent attorney in the area of Alabama DUI Criminal Law and you can rest assured that he will obtain the best possible outcome regarding your case.\n\nSincerely Yours-\n\nGreg Kaltz\n\nP.S. \u2013 Due to Russell\u2019s expertise, he obtained a DISMISSAL of the DUI charges against me!

When I explained I was busy I was asked if I would speak with him over the phone. I agreed and I was transfered to Mr. Crumbley.  After listening to me explain my why I left the review and my account of my interactions with Mr. Matt Wisda, Mr. Crumbley asked me several questions.\n1. Would I consider removing my review?\n2. Would I consider moving it to Mr. Wisda\u2019s webpage?\n3. If he (Crumbley) were to fire Mr. Wisda would I then delete my review! I said no.\n4. Was there ANYTHING he (Crumbley) could say or do that would result in me removing the review? To which I responded \u201cNot ethically\u201d, because I felt he was trying to \u201clead me\u201d into asking for a monetary resolution.\n\nDuring our discussion Mr. Crumbley stated he was not at all happy about Mr. Wisda\u2019s conduct. And that he was considering actions (including termination).  He asked once more if there was anything he could do To get me to retract the review against \u201cCrumbley, Blackwell, & Wisda Lawfirm\u201d.  I explained to him that when I researched Divorce Attorneys/Firms I based my decision in part on the reviews of his Firms website and information regarding the lawyers and therefore would not consider removing the review. We said goodbye and I hung up.\n\nI spent that day wondering if he would call again. I just knew \u201cIT\u201d wasn\u2019t over.\nSo this evening I checked on my review out of curiosity...and wouldn\u2019t you know it there is this long drawn out explanation that it was I who was misinformed etc.  Never once mentioning any unethical behavior on behalf of Mr. Wisda!\nI want to SHOUT from the highest rooftops what a sleazy slimeball you are! Shall I post more? Shall I post information Mr. Wisda freely disclosed to me about a clearly VERY SENSITIVE divorce and custody battle where the children involved had been...!\nYou disgust me!\n\nI retained Matt Wisda to represent me for my divorce.  I feel he acted unethically.\nI contacted his office after receiving an invoice for services that were not rendered. When I followed up with an appointment a few days later not only did he begin by talking about another case he had been working on (this was the 2nd time he mentioned details of this other party's case!) but he also presented me with an official Settlement Agreement\" that clearly stated me and my spouse had both agreed to - WHICH NEITHER OF US HAD!\n\nWe never went through discovery at all! No mediation - nothing!\nThe entire document looked copy and pasted, and all of the assets and then some were to be awarded to me!\n\nMr. Wisda was trying to fool me into thinking he had been hard at work on my case and that I was entitled to everything when in fact he hadn't done anything. Additionally It was never my intention to try take my husband to the proverbial cleaners. I just wanted a fair settlement.\n\nI didn't even look at the \"Settlement Agreement\" he'd drawn up while at his office. I had already decided to sever our business agreement and told him so.  I asked when I could pick up my remaining retainer and he said it would be about a week.\n\nWhen I went to pick up the monies, enclosed with my check was an invoice of almost $700 for the bogus \"Settlement Agreement\" that had been drawn up without consultation or discovery.  Coincidentally the new invoice showed just one line item for the preparing of said agreement which was dated after the phone call I mentioned above.\n\nI immediately drew up a letter refusing to pay and insisting I be refunded.  Additionally in the letter I called him out for trying to fool me and get paid for it. I emailed this letter and received a response early the next morning stating they would immediately refund the that money, which they did.\n\nI am leaving this review to make others aware.  In our consultation meeting he told me his practice \"is like a game to me.\"  And because  conducting his business in such a way, I feel, is an abuse of his power as an attorney and is extremely unethical.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1528493792927, "text": "We deeply regret that your experience with our office did not meet your expectation. We work very hard to not let that happen. Having said that, you say that you received a \u201csettlement agreement\u201d that indicated you and your husband had agreed to the settlement terms when, in fact, you had not agreed. You also say that this agreement was put together without doing any \u201cdiscovery\u201d or any \u201cmediation\u201d. You initially hired Mr. Wisda to assist you in negotiating an uncontested divorce with your husband\u2019s lawyer. In fact, you produced, for us, a \u201csettlement agreement\u201d created by your husband\u2019s lawyer when you hired Mr. Wisda. That settlement agreement had already been prepared absent any \u201cdiscovery\u201d or attempt to \u201cmediate\u201d. It was clearly the intentions of both parties (and their lawyers) to settle this matter, if possible, without costly litigation. This type divorce typically does not involve \u201cdiscovery\u201d (in the traditional sense) and most certainly doesn\u2019t involve \u201cmediation\u201d. In these type matters we simply go with settlement negotiations to the extent we are able, which necessarily includes \u201csettlement proposals\u201d. Also, in this type situation, both parties tend to agree that they know what the assets are and their values are not in dispute.\n\nThe \u201csettlement agreement\u201d your husband\u2019s attorney prepared, and gave you, was just like the one Mr. Wisda gave you. In reviewing your husband\u2019s proposal it is noted that it also includes language stating that the two of you \u201cacknowledged and agreed\u201d to things that you had not already agreed upon. In other words, both lawyers settlement agreements included the very same language in that regard. In fact, most paragraphs in all settlement agreements are full of language such as \u201cthe parties acknowledge and agree \u2026\u201d. This language is included to satisfy legal requirements and applies to you ONLY AFTER you have actually read it, agreed to it and signed it. It is not intended to mean that you have already seen it and agreed to it. And, it is NEVER INTENDED to deceive. Your attorney, Matt Wisda, did exactly what your husband\u2019s lawyer did with respect to that language.\n\nAs far as the \u201cattempt to fool you\u201d is concerned: you received an itemized statement of the charges. You received two billing statements. The second of those two seems to be where you objected. That statement involves the \u201csettlement agreement\u201d. You were dissatisfied with that charge and objected to that bill and, although you had NOT notified him of your desire to terminate him until after that work was done, we refunded every penny to you of that part of the bill. And your objection, as much as any we can tell, is founded on your belief that it included the \u201cbogus\u201d settlement language indicating that you and your husband had agreed to the terms that you had not agreed to.\n\nWe strive to handle cases the way our clients direct us. And, while the services you received were not satisfactory to you, Mr. Wisda DID NOT bill you for services not rendered. His conduct was not unethical. His ability to communicate effectively with you, I will agree, must have missed the mark. For example, we are not sure how, exactly, you did not understand that the \u201cacknowledged and agreed\u201d language in the settlement agreement did not mean you had both already agreed to that agreement. That was no more the intent of what Mr. Wisda provided you than it was the intent of what your husband\u2019s attorney provided him. It was merely two lawyers doing their jobs and adding the language that was going to be necessary at some point, in advance. Perhaps THAT is why it looked copied and pasted.\n\nWe would encourage ANYONE who is dissatisfied in ANY way, with ANYONE in our office, to meet with any of us. WE ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE to meet with that person and do everything we can to alleviate their concern and fight for your cause. Your case matters to us. And, YOU matter to us. Best wishes moving forward during this trying time.\n\n~ Russell Crumbley & Matt Wisda"}, "gmap_id": "0x886214b5eb6aa54b:0x60d777fdf93ee41a"}

Mr. Crumbley is the most exceptional, top notch attorney in the area and will exceed your expectations each and every time under his representation. He has represented me on 4 separate cases (3 misdemeanor and 1 felony) and has impressed me more and more each time with his results with all 4 of the cases being dismissed with NOT GUILTY verdicts when I was very GUILTY as a matter of fact. As soon as he walks in the courtroom you should know that you will be taken care of. This mans representation is like the results of having the combination of Peyton Manning in the regular season and Tom Brady in the playoffs which in other words is about as good as is gets when in comes to criminal defense representation. I honestly do not have enough words or ways that I can use to describe how high level of an attorney he is and worth every dollar of the premium cost to afford him to represent you because you get what you pay for so you won\u2019t be disappointed no matter how guilty you are of your charges. Don\u2019t hesitate to call his office as they are more than happy to assist you with whatever questions or concerns you may have in regards to your case. Mr. Crumbley is hands down the best attorney in our area for any criminal matters. Do yourself a favor and make sure you hire him to take care of yourself because I\u2019d honestly be hesitant to have anybody else to represent me in a potential criminal defense situation besides Mr. Crumbley. To Teles Walker, you won\u2019t find a better attorney or receive a better result than having Mr. Crumbley by your side and am sure you received a contract as Mr. Crumbley is always sure to provide one so everyone out there should disregard any negative reviews because those folks are more than likely either trolls or generally unhappy with their own lives and you can tell the literacy of the individual by reading their review from a grammatical standpoint. To the rest of the folks out there, be sure to disregard the ignorant individuals reviews as that is a false representation of Mr. Crumbleys services. As GUILTY as any individual may be, I can guarantee that you will receive the best possible legal result with Mr. Crumbley by your side and I say that with no doubt in mind. There is a good reason as to why you see his billboards all around our area and it\u2019s for his consistently exceptional results. As always thank you for your outstanding as well as expectation exceeding results Mr. Crumbley.\nYours sincerely,\nAnother Satisfied Client", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1556027434386, "text": "Wow! I have fought for clients for 21 years but, as far as I know, this is the first time a client has fought for me. I never really thought about clients reading other people's reviews before they write their own but I guess they do. I think you were more upset than I was. But, I have learned over the years that people see things, view things, expect things and interpret things differently from each other. As they say: \"one man's trash is another man's treasure\". EVERYTHING must be ALWAYS viewed with the proper perspective. I appreciate your strong, heartfelt words but they weren't necessary. We take cases all across the board and that includes cases that are very difficult and filled with a multitude of considerations, possibilities and opportunities - even for failure. Sometimes the absolute best outcome still falls short of the perfect outcome. I think most people understand that. Having said that, God Bless you young man.

I was very nervous about my situation, but within minutes he had me at ease and feeling confident we would win this case. During our meeting, Mr. Crumbley was very professional and knowledgeable and easy to talk to. I followed his advice and we took the case to a jury trial in the higher court. We were scheduled court dates several times and each time I went, the court wasn\u2019t able to try the case at that time and would reschedule at a later date. Jump forward 6 years (that\u2019s our court system), and the court finally scheduled a court date. So since it had been 6 years, I had moved a couple of times so the court didn\u2019t have my current address so I was never notified of the new date. Mr. Crumbley still appeared in court on my behalf, he informed the court that he had tried to contact me but was unable to reach me. The court was talking about doing several different things, but Mr. Crumbley kept fighting on my behalf to reach a solution that was in my best interest.

I googled lawyers and FAQs, anything to help me figure out what my first step needed to be. I found Adam Jones and Associates and while looking over their website, a chat popped up asking me if I needed to chat with them. I figured it was some ploy or scam to get my name and number that would lead to a flood of annoying calls, but I decided I had nothing to loose, so I chatted about my situation. It turns out, I was chatting with my future lawyer! That same week I met Niki and as soon as she shook my hand...I knew she was the answer to my prayers. Hands down, an amazing woman and a powerful lawyer. After my divorce, I brought the company I work for to Adam Jones and Associates. I can honestly say, on a personal level with my divorce and on a professional level with the cases I deal with at work, Adam Jones and Associates is my lifetime firm. One chat session lead to one phone call, one hand shake lead to one case, and now they are my lawyer, my family's lawyers, and my company's lawyers. They really do cater to their clients needs. I can not express my support for this firm enough! I remember emailing my lawyer at 3am and she was not only there for me legally, but as a friend as well.

We get into the court room and do not see the attorney anywhere. We initially hired Whitney polson which has yet to show his face in the court room. We then wait until court starts to find out he's sent his RUDE DAD that knows ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about this case. So we stand before the judge who is having to explain to me what Polson was suppose to explain and we leave still confused because our attorney is a complete IDIOT. So here it is May 11, 2017 at 9:00 a.m. And the dad appears back in the court room when I told Jennifer I did NOT want him representing my case. He then comes with a rude attitude and basically tells me what I'm going plead. We go in front of the judge while everybody is watching this uneducated attorney representing a case he once again knows NOTHING ABOUT. So I had to fire him in front of the judge.

False advertisement Really!! My true story: My now ex husband and I went through a chaotic divorce and his lawyer was Mr. McGhee. My experience is based on what I dealt with in phone and email conversations as well as what was told to me by my ex husband and McGhee's  Secretary and how the divorce was handled. First Mr. Mcghee, does not like to speak to people that are \"Pro Se\" (representing yourself) so even though you worked for over 10 years in the law field as a paralegal and you can easily save your money by doing the settlement and divorce yourself, Shawn McGhee will make sure to give you a hard time. Not only does he lie and says there is a conflict of interest, which is why he won't speak to you which by the way, THAT IS NOT TRUE, but he will not answer any of the calls. For whatever reason he was not able to speak to me which to me seems very unprofessional, he would often have his secretary let me know what was needed for the divorce to be settled. I think because I do know what I needed to do legally, and trust me lawyers hate people that have worked in law fields you cant pull a sheet over legal assistants or paralegals eyes easily, we know all the tricks.  Now his secretary had given me some information that had holes in what she said that included the discovery process and hearings as well as the laws. Because of the communication between me and her and then what she told my ex husband of what I said, which were twisted, this made the divorce messy and long . And I believe the reason was for trial which is very expensive, but lawyers love expensive. Now one thing which is grounds for a grievance is that Mr. McGhee gave advice on the amount of payments for child support that should be paid which is unethical and should only be done by a referee. Mr. Mcghee, has no compassion for children as he informs his clients that they don't need to be responsible parents and pay for the kids until a judge says so, which to me makes me wonder about his character. Being out of state I was not able to do much, and my ex did not even live in Alabama as law requires in order to file but as usual somehow McGhee got around that. I have worked for law firms since I was 16 years old I could never work for someone that does things that are unethical, shady and down right wrong  he has no moral character, and I would be scared if my papers would be questioned by a judge with the amount of lies that my ex and his lawyer gave to me.  Please look at other Law firms that will look at your case and care enough to not control your decisions and won't run up your bill for no reason. Me and my ex husband  managed to settle together without the hearsay talk of his lawyer. The issue I have is there are amazing lawyers out there and Mr. Mcghee is the reason that lawyers have such a bad reputation. Make sure you chose a lawyer that will care about your interests and especially the kids, don't let the kids get lost in the divorce they are the most important thing, don't let the lawyer stress you or the other party or you will cause more harm and extend something that is not good for anyone. And make sure to hold your ground. Research on your lawyer don't chose someone because they are cheap eventually they will show you why they are cheap, Mr. Mcghee was affordable for my ex-husband until hearings and trial came around and then up goes his hourly.
