I went to the rural king in Chester Pa and saw an equipment that i wanted to purchase for my business. Spoke to a rep there and he told me that I can apply for their business credit card though redstone federal credit union. So i applied on Sunday 05/18/20. On Monday a Melissa Wilson called me back and said the credit card was approved but she need to open a membership for me first to finalize everything. She took my basic information and said I'll received a docu sign by the end of the day. I got an email from Melissa on Tuesday night saying that the underwriter needed 2 year of business tax returns, a utility bill, a mortgage statement and a selfie of myself with me holding my ID. I thought the last request was a little strange but I submitted everything anyway. Got a call from an underwriter on Wednesday and this is where I think she just dont have a clue about what she's doing or is extremely racist. She asked me how far was rural king store was from me? I told her about an hour plus. She then ask why I close two credit cards in 2019. Told her I had two credit cards from the same company so I requested that they combine the credits from both cards on to one and close one, which they did. And that i didn't close the barclay card. I was an authorized user on the barclay card and the primary user close the card that's why why it appear on my credit as close. But I went ahead and open up my personal barclay card in December of 2019. She then ended by saying well I'm not satisfied with the two cards that were closed, and there's a fraud alert on your credit and this seems like fraud. I told her yes I place a fraud alert on my credit so that no one can open up fraudulent account in my name. A fraud alert will tell a company to give me a call and verify its me before opening up a new account. People do that all the time. She said well this seems like fraud. I told her you have my ID, Mortgage statement, utility bill, my social security number, phone number that you're talking to me on matches the phone number with the credit bureau that's on my fraud alert, my 2 years of business tax return with my business name and my home address. I have a 732 fico score and a 80/100 dunn and Bradstreet score. I have all the credentials needed for approval. Credit, income, etc. But all they saw was a driver's license of a beard black guy, that have a fraud alert place on his credit and two close credit cards that one of them he requested to be closed and the other was close by the primary card holder. And the scary part about this entire situation is the young lady that told me all this is an \"underwriter\". An underwriter who's racist or an underwriter that don't know that it's legal to call the credit bureau and request that they place a fraud alert on your credit and give them a number to place on your credit to have potential creditors call you and verify its you before opening an account. Also an underwriter that don't know that if you become an authorized user on one of your family members card that entire card history gets transferred to your credit history. And if the person closes that card it will also close on you credit profile. So much for \" Equal Opportunity Lender\".", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1590054648736, "text": "Let me assure you that RFCU has a strict policy of non-discrimination not only in the credit union\u2019s lending practices, but in all aspects of conduct throughout RFCU.

I talked with a supervisor because I figure they want my business and will provide some other option. No can do. The supervisor told me that all banks now have check maintenance fees. A very cursory exploration of other options reveals that is not true:  some banks waive any fees with a minimum monthly balance (a balance which I can easily do), some have basic checking accounts which have no fees but limited services (RFCU offered me no such option), and some of the checking accounts that have no fees also pay interest which my Redstone checking account did not.

I got an email from Melissa on Tuesday night saying that the underwriter needed 2 year of business tax returns, a utility bill, a mortgage statement and a selfie of myself with me holding my ID. I thought the last request was a little strange but I submitted everything anyway. Got a call from an underwriter on Wednesday and this is where I think she just dont have a clue about what she's doing or is extremely racist. She asked me how far was rural king store was from me? I told her about an hour plus. She then ask why I close two credit cards in 2019. Told her I had two credit cards from the same company so I requested that they combine the credits from both cards on to one and close one, which they did. And that i didn't close the barclay card. I was an authorized user on the barclay card and the primary user close the card that's why why it appear on my credit as close. But I went ahead and open up my personal barclay card in December of 2019. She then ended by saying well I'm not satisfied with the two cards that were closed, and there's a fraud alert on your credit and this seems like fraud. I told her yes I place a fraud alert on my credit so that no one can open up fraudulent account in my name. A fraud alert will tell a company to give me a call and verify its me before opening up a new account. People do that all the time. She said well this seems like fraud. I told her you have my ID, Mortgage statement, utility bill, my social security number, phone number that you're talking to me on matches the phone number with the credit bureau that's on my fraud alert, my 2 years of business tax returns with my business name and my home address. I have a 732 fico score and a 80/100 dunn and Bradstreet score. I have all the credentials needed for approval. Credit, income, etc. But all they saw was a driver's license of a beard black guy, that have a fraud alert place on his credit and two close credit cards that one of them he requested to be closed and the other was close by the primary card holder. And the scary part about this entire situation is the young lady that told me all this is an \"underwriter\". An underwriter who's racist or an underwriter that don't know that it's legal to call the credit bureau and request that they place a fraud alert on your credit and give them a number to place on your credit to have potential credit call you and verify its you before opening an account. Also an underwriter that don't know that if you become an authorized user on one of your family members card that entire card history gets transferred to your credit history. And if the person closes that card it will also close on you credit profile. So much for \" Equal Opportunity Lender\".", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1590054508039, "text": "Let me assure you that RFCU has a strict policy of non-discrimination not only in the credit union\u2019s lending practices, but in all aspects of conduct throughout RFCU.

Back in November of 2020 I went on a trip to Colorado where I rented a car from hertz Denver airport location.Hertz overcharged me $711.00.\nSo I called All in to file a dispute(this was in December)they sent me the paperwork and told me I would have to wait until they hear something from hertz. January had come and I called the representative stated that they are waiting to hear from hertz still no answers from hertz. Called In February still no answer from hertz and the rep advised me by law they have to give the merchant 180 days. I called again at the end of March early April. Spoke with a representative who advised me they still haven\u2019t heard anything from hertz and that the 180 days are coming to an end by the end of April and for me to callback then. So I waited until May 4, 2021 to call back spoke with a representative named Beverly. Beverly called over to whatever department that handles disputes only to tell me that they still haven\u2019t heard from hertz. Also she advised me that she was told that even though the 180 days were over I still will have to wait until they hear something from hertz. I\u2019m very frustrated because I was told to wait 180 days and still have to wait. All in has showed me that they do not care about their customers only when it benefits them. All in needs a better way to navigate for their customers when it comes to overcharges. I really feel like I got the short in of the stick because I have patiently waited and All in failed. What was the purpose of me waiting 180 days if you guys are going to keep yo-yo in me around?!
