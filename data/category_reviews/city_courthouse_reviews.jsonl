First, let's start with how incompetent the prosecutor and the judge are. The prosecutor gets all angry and acts like she is mad at the world when you simply try to defend yourself. There was a gentleman who went to her before me and he stated that he was under the impression that if the officer didn't show for the trial that the case should be dismissed, I have been told this throughout my years as well. After telling the prosecutor this, she gets all irrate and replied, yea, I'm just going to call in this officer out there doing his job, protecting the city, blah blah blah, in such a disrespectful and angry manner, basically trying to make the defendant feel guilty. It's like yes, you are suppose to have the officer there  for the trial. Now that being said, how come the officer who wrote me a ticket wasn't there? Oh he changed shifts so we have to reschedule your trial was the answer I got .What if that officer had a night shift? Would he not be expected to show then? You are so incompetent you didn't know he changed shifts before my trial and not setting the trial according to when the officer would be there? I'm missing work days and getting this stress put on me for no good reason. Sat in that court room for all those hours basically for nothing because this system is so broke and needs to be replaced by people more competent for the job.\nNow for the judge himself, there was a lady there for her son that was being held in another state and when the judge called her sons name she answered him and the judge stated that he would get to her shortly. 3 hours or so passed and the officer had to remind the judge about the lady and the judge is 'like oh I'm sorry, come on up here ma'am. What a joke.\nNow it's my turn to talk to the judge, after sitting there for 4 hours or so, basically for nothing. I tell him that it is unfair, I haven't missed any of my court dates and I'm under the impression if the officer isn't there for the trial, the case should be dismissed. Note that I am driving all that way from Huntsville and missing a days work. He replies to me, I'm sorry, I'm sure you read online the officers don't show to court but they do. I replied with yes, and that's what should have happened today. He replies again I'm sorry, I know this is an inconvenience but there is nothing we can do. He tells me that I'm only dealing with one case and he is dealing with 70. Well guess what? That is your job. That is what you chose to do with your life. You doing a poor job at it or not is beyond me and you shouldn't use it as an excuse against me.\nThis is the corrupt incompetent system deciding the fate of human lives.

We left there still have no idea how much she owes\nAll know to do is call DMV and they tell us the same ticket we thought she owed for and NO OTHERS. Mailed a money order for what we find out the ticket would be in jefferdon county. 10 days later get a paper back stating she needs to come back in to set up a payment plan. We get no receipt for the money order or the $400 THEY received. This is a nightmare. Guess next step is an attorney!!  Never in my life have I ever had to beg a place to take money or tell me what I owe for something.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b8f8248cdaf:0x6e5a83f876f1b5c2"}

They try to balance justice with mercy and despite the criticism they get from some in the community they do an excellent job with limited resources. I have worked in some rural places and it seemed like the only thing that mattered was bringing in money but Birmingham actually works with people who struggle to pay and shows a lot of grace. The staff that works there does a good job with the limited resources and everytime I have had an issue or a problem they took extra time to be helpful and truly went above and beyond to fix any error. If people would just treat the court personnel with kindness and respect they would have such an easier time. But I have seen people yell at judges, cause disruptions etc. and each time it was the court personnel who showed restraint and calmness.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b8f8248cdaf:0x6e5a83f876f1b5c2"}

Front end staff is very loose except with the people that are there for court.  I observed more than one person set off the metal detector, walk in with bags, all the while the lady that was supposed to be checking them just disregarded it.  Evidently, if you know the person up front you can walk right through without second glance.  Court was running behind so I had to wait around 10-20min which is understandable, not everything always goes as planned.  Went through security after being thoroughly checked myself and to the court room.  The court room had changed from what was posted; again, not a big deal, we got to the right place.  Bailiff came around signing the folks in and then tells me I have to leave.  Ok, why isn't it posted?  I left and waited out front.  Had to sit on the ground because they're to cheap to provide a couple benches or a proper waiting area.  After waiting over an HOUR the person I took came out and said \"The judge isn't in; I have a new court date.\"  Needless to say, this venture was an utter waste of time and a total disappointment in dealing with our \"justice\" system.  Don't forget to pay for your parking token!
