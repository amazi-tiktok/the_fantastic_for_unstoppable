Theres no way to blend with the hack job she did.

The professionalism was abundant, however you also know that the barbers are real people and make everything comfortable.\nOn to the actual haircut.\nI have never once had a barber pay such attention to detail and ensure that not a single hair was out of place. The time was put in to ensure that everything would turn out exactly how he envisioned my hair would. From clippers to scissors, not one strand was able to hide from this man. He then styled my hair exactly as I would have, and applied the proper product with a good hold, to ensure I would be looking fresh all day long.\nWhen it was all over I stand up to pay, and he tells me, \"That'll be $16.\"\nI was left speechless, I have paid a lot more for a lot less of a haircut.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1605015267396, "text": "Thank you.

He did a fantastic job and didn\u2019t miss any attention to detail...clearly knows what he is doing AND best thing was that it was way more affordable than going anywhere else nearby!

Brett is highly professional, cares about the haircut as much as the person below it, and charges a fair rate ($17/$10 for veterans (it may be $12, either way its a discount)), and listens to your wants and needs regarding your hairstyle. My son's (all 3 of them) have never looked better stepping down from the chair. The shop being new is very clean, well styled, and offers an assortment of beverages. Between the excellent customer service and the fair pricing, the clear choice is Gallantry.\n\nI have tried all the local barbershops/chain hair cut stores in town and here are my experiences:\n\nSuper Cuts/Great Clips: Avoid. Period. Employee turnover is horrible and professionalism meets no one's standards. Hair cuts might as well be done with a butcher knife. The old adage, you get what you pay for, applies here.\n\nBuzz & Cuts: This is the factory of barbershops. You sit in the chair, get manhandled by someone who does this 1,000 times a year, get a half way decent hair cut and then bumped out of the chair by an often rude stylist. The only perk is that if you can put up with the lackluster customer service and average hair cut, you can save money with a frequency card. Honestly, its not worth it.\n\nChelsea Barber Shop: Ms. Faye is a staple of the town and has been there for a long time. The shop is large, clean, and generally a friendly atmosphere. If you are looking for a barber who talks and gossips with you in the chair, this is the place for you. Be warned though that the conversations get....intense....sometimes. The problem I have found here is consistency. My haircuts range from above average to sub par. My kids hair is basically a trip around the edges and call it a day; no matter how much I insist otherwise. The consistency problems continue with the hours. The hours posted on the door are dependent on the mood of the stylists, their personal schedule, and whether or not it was busy enough that day to keep the doors open for the full time. I have gone more than once where the shop should be open, but they closed up for the day (once at 11 AM and another at 3 PM within the last month.) If you are personally going for a hair cut where you have the time and patience to make sure its right and can catch them when they are there, this would be my #2 choice.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88893fc1acd02fe7:0x9e5840824fbf1de"}

Still, after some research ( meaning looking at the pictures on reviews to see if was a black barbershop)  I went to Heritage first because it was closer,  online stated that it closes at 7pm, but when I arrived at 6:24-- the Heritage crew inside looked at me from behind a locked door and gestured \"sorry\".\n\nAnyway.\n\nI didn't realize it then, but that was a blessing in disguise because I quickly found Hunter's on Google, and it was only three minutes away and open until 9pm.  When I walked in I was greeted warmly by an older gentleman dressed in a suit and hard leather shoes-- Hunter in the flesh-- and the joint. was. packed. I initially suspected that everyone in there were all like me and didn't make it to Heritage on time, but I quickly realized that they were there not because they were like me, but  because they already knew what I didn't, and that this was their go-to spot, for several reasons.\n\nPlace wasn't hard to find with GPS, a small unassuming barbershop that we're all familiar with the look and feel of.  Aside from a TV with the game on or music, those who frequent black barbershops don't even expect all the bells and whistles-- we're here for two things- a good cut and for some; a spot to come get caught up on the daily local news and gossip--and maybe for the younger guys...a little mentorship.\n\nSetup was professional with a nice array of clippers and lighting and very COVID safe.  Hunter told me off the bat that it would be an hour wait, and that if I left my number he'd call me when the chair was ready--which I really appreciated.  An hour later I was back and he was just wrapping up.  Hunter can cut hair really well and FAST.  He took care of two customers in under 15/20 minutes and they all looked CLEAN. His efficiency is really what amazed me first, and the clean cut he gave me was perfect.

I retired from the military a little over a year ago out of Michigan and haven't shaved since. Being in the military for 30 years, I've never had a beard. So I'm new and learning. And finding a barber who can give a proper trim has been a struggle. I haven't had many trims, but I'd never had a trim I didn't have to fix myself, until I came here.\nSo after around a year after retirement I find myself down here. Short of a couple family member, I don't know anyone here or anything about the area. The search starts again for a new barber. So I tried one previous shop before this one. The haircut was ok, but the beard trim was an absolute butcher job. I had to wait a good time letting the patches fill back in before I could get a trim again. Then I found this place and gave it a shot. I couldn't have been happier. Ray cut my hair and gave me a beard trim. He spend around an hour on my head. When I first arrived, there were a few customers,  but not many. Ray was the only barber present at the time. While I was in the chair, another barber showed up, and more customers started showing up. It was getting busy. I thought for sure Ray would start rushing my cut, but he did not. He just kept at it, and paying close attention to detail. Ray didn't not just cut my hair and trim my beard, but he invested time and genuine effort. He cared and had pride in his work. Craftsmanship, hard to find these days. I have found my new barber shop, and I highly recommend it to others.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81774af430b3:0x9334c0db845b3d51"}

I did! I am from Birmingham I saw her work it was good. I booked a 9:30 am appointment. When I got to the shop no one was there. I waited a few then texted her no response. I asked the barber was she coming he said he wasn't sure. I called her no answer. Because I am not from the area and I really needed my hair done I continued to wait. 2 hours later she contacted me asking if I was at the shop I informed I was. She said you got the times mixed up and apologized. I'm human I understand that. She said she was coming. So i continued to wait! This was around 12ish. I got frustrated with waiting and left she called saying I'm on my way to the shop now. By this time I left heading back to Bham I had had it to Prattville! I turned around thinking I have a full day ahead i really needed my hair done. So I went back to the shop she still wasn't there. I waited almost another hour after driving 20mins from Prattville. As I was walking out the shop I noticed a lady in her car eating ice cream, nevertheless it was Diedria as if I haven't waited 4 hours for her to do my hair and telling her I wasn't from Montgomery and I had a 9:30 appointment. She asked as I was leaving was I about to go!?!?!? Because her ice cream was more important than keeping a schedule appointment or being professional! Will never go back!

I hadn't cut my 3 foot long length of hair in about 25 years.\nI don't know Claudia and she was genuine, warm, welcoming, and had me at ease quickly. We had met one other time and she talked about doing, \" a little bit here and a little bit there.\"\nI was even more at ease when we talked about what to do and she started to work.  She is exceedingly confident and talented. \"I've been doing this long enough,\" she said.  As an artist myself I picked up on her fastidious hands and meticulous gaze that showed her talent, experience and intuition.  Before I got up she had me sit back, \"hold on, those two hairs are bothering me,\" snip!\nYeah this will be the only place I go when I'm in Huntsville.\nThe shop itself for me has a nice intimate feel and it is great to walk into Claudia's space as opposed to into a row of chairs.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b84dc4d8f25:0x572bff6604de54f9"}

Looked terrible and had to be fixed. Additionally, $35 is an incredibly high price for a haircut that doesn't come with a stylist that is confident and knowledgeable (she kept stopping to ask me if it looked okay as she made adjustments: I brought a picture and gave specific instructions \"low fade starting with a 1.5, disconnected at the part and scissor trim on the top, tapered on the neck). If I were to pay $35 once every other week, including tip, I would expect a consultation, a comfortable stylist, one that understands the common or even less common terms and styles, and an atmosphere that is conducive to relaxing (Store was quite, echo-ed, and awkwardly staged). I know that it is rather common in Alabama to have a haircut done every 6 weeks or some astronomical time frame, but coming from a larger city where my experience was better at the $23 ($27 after tip) price point and the cut a better quality with some input and know-how, I'm extremely disappointed.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1536847628158, "text": "Hi Steven, I am so very sorry about your bad experience at my shop.

He went above and beyond all expectations to make everything right.  I walked away with a great haircut and wonderful experience.\n\nI got a shampoo, haircut, and beard trim.   The haircut is honestly the worst I've ever had.   It was styled while it was wet and looked fine.   Once it dried out, however, I soon discovered that it wasn't blended, there were whole sections that weren't even cut at all.  It looked like I had 3 pony tails sticking out on random parts of my head.     The entire hair cut only took a few minutes and I just don't feel like my stylist paid much attention to doing a good job.\n\nAdditionally, the beard trim was terrible.   I asked the stylist to trim my mustache so it wasn't in my mouth.   After combing it out later that day, there were whole sections that were completely uncut.   Combed straight downward, my lips looked like a barcode where there were random whiskers sticking down.\n\nI understand that stylists have bad days, but when you charge 5 times as much as a standard haircut you expect a higher quality.\n\nThis haircut was much worse than the $8-$12 haircuts I've received in the bast.    After tip, this trip to Stephen Gregory cost over $90.     It was a complete ripoff.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1535384763244, "text": "Hi James.

Just asked if it looked ok with a horrible attitude, I didn't have the nerve to tell her that she butchered my hair. I have never felt more uncomfortable getting my hair cut.

Anna did what everyone else couldn't and I will happily drive the 45 minutes to get there.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626ccbcb1ea25f:0xb4e505e0d474933f"}

Chelsea Loeb removed \"Reviews\" from her Facebook page, \"Vanity Hair Studio at Sola Salons\", @VanityHairStudio88, where her mother decided to intervene and childishly berate me. I didn't want to have to do this, but since the BBB in Northern Alabama closed my case as \"Unresolved\", because she didn't reply, as usual, so I have to take to social media to tell the Facts so this can't happen to anyone else. I sent this to BBB & posted a Google Review & will continue to post to make others aware! Chelsea Loeb has scarily moved on to jeopardize the business, \"Sola Salon Studios (a.k.a.Vanity Hair Studio at Sola Salons), but EVERYONE should be warned!!!! 2&1/2months now My hair had teal/green streaks that was NEVER requested & now the streaks are fading to a rusty color. She said she would fix her mistake & ceased communication when the messages clearly showed \"Read\". Original hair plan, ALL OVER blue/black \"PERMANENT\" hair color. Then Chelsea spoke of some \"Pre-lightening\" streaks. Wasn't too sure what that was, but entrusted she knew what she was doing since I told her my \"Original\" hair plan. 1st Salon appt, 4/23/18, Chelsea only touched up grey roots on top half of head & \"Pre-lightened\" streaks & dyed them teal/green!! I asked for ALL OVER permanent hair color, not just partial roots, & did NOT ask for TEAL/GREEN! Chelsea then processed a 3rd color on my hair within 3 hours, to cover up her first mistake. After 3+ hours there, it was supposedly \"fixed\". Knew it wasn't, but after 3 hours, I was done. Reached out to her the next morning, 4/24/18, to have it fixed before our beach trip the following day, 4/25/18. Chelsea then supposedly applied a \"permanent\" all over color, what she called a blue \"Fantasy Color\", & was told to rarely wash my hair so the color wouldn't fade. I know enough about hair color that a \"permanent process\" should not \"wash out\" in showers. Unfortunately my nightmare came true. Ruined friend's linens we visited whilst on beach trip. Couldn't swim in Resort pool or at beach because blue was pouring out in showers & is was \"washing out\" 38 days later. I paid for \"Permanent\" color, not \"wash out\". Returned from beach trip & respectfully asked her for a refund on 4/30/18, since what I paid ($135) for was not remotely done. Chelsea replied, \"Unfortunately we don't issue refunds since the time & product spent...\" So I asked for it to be fixed \"again\" since I did not ask for the teal/green that's showing again since her 3rd color is \"washing out\". The same day, 4/30/18, Chelsea agreed she would once she returned from her beach trip. 5/7/18, I asked her what brand of \"Fantasy Color\" did she use so I can figure out how to get this color out for good for I was tired of ruining my own towels & linens. She replied the same day with \"Pulp Riot\", but didn't offer any other advice, considering she messed up my hair. Of course I followed thru and researched the product, only to find out that it \"Washes out in 42 washes...\". As stated before, I paid $135 for a \"Permanent\" hair color process. That same day 5/7/18, I asked if she could fit me in the following week to correct her mistake. No reply. One week later, 5/14/18, I messaged again to see if she can get me in next week. Still no reply. Most insulting is that the messages let you know once they've been read & Chelsea has \"read\" them, and still no reply. I don't want her touching my hair in fear she will ruin it more. I just want my refund so I can go elsewhere that's more professional & knowledgeable to fix HER mistake. Insult to injury were her Facebook posts during the 2 weeks I was requesting her to fix her mistake. She was clearly telling the Facebook public that she had openings. Why not reply to my requests to fix her mistakes?! Filed a BBB complaint May 14, 2018, & she had until May 31,  to respond. No reply. Then had 10 days to respond. No communication until 2nd BBB letter. My pictures and her complete disregard of her own negligence is proof enough on her lack in professionalism and customer service & is UNacceptable! Still \"UNresolved\"!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzpuxeK1gKssill30F3zN2G-Vu3eYqb4mNG5h6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDP-mppzw37dZ0_jO53RTTaf6ETiF1xH088V-P=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMY_jlo02Pe3p6jsETwL8_LwpU3GCuNX1oRZwa-=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrTi10Ft7_pp91jPWI_GO_REM10mflIC8RDyWE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvYQuRQbXJunDGWzIDFkl5Tn98OCydO_Tg9qBk=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTHb-dWVDmJ70hk86S4yIqe8WP5RjxJ30O7ClE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZM15k8yFZxsd4HvWduJPdx4TPRk1P8aNjHhg8=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuMtwTAsXF_yhNv-PxzU5uRLJsykaK0K_JB2ju=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626ccbcb1ea25f:0xb4e505e0d474933f"}

It had been years since she had been treated to a girls day and so today was a special girls day where we could get our hair cut together. We live in Florida and wanted to spend some time in Dothan visiting our favorite shops. We booked an appointment and scheduled our day around town. My mom was so excited when she sat down and explained what she wanted. Instantly the stylist scowled and said \"I'm gonna let you know now... your hair is not going to do that\"  My mom has had this particular cut before and explained that it was okay and that she wanted this cut. The stylist did not wash her hair at all before tearing into it with scissors. The entire appointment the stylist complained that he hair was \"too thick\" and did not stop complaining about how my moms hair \"just wouldn't cooperate.\" At the end of the appointment, my mom did not receive the cut she wanted at all, it was a jagged uneven cut. My mom had beautiful long hair and now the cut was so short that even if she wanted to have it fixed at another salon, it would turn into a pixie which is NOT what she wanted. For me, thankfully she didn't botch my hair like my mom but still she was rude and complained that my hair was \"just as thick as my moms\" I already have a pixie so there wasn't much she could mess up on thank God. At checkout, the stylist even scowled at the fact that i was paying for my moms cut along with my own! as if its unheard of for a daughter to treat her mother on her birthday! Needles to say I left a small tip to be nice because the cuts were not that expensive but honestly i shouldn't have. My mom was so upset that night when we went to dinner and did not feel confident :(", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889292726d9c00c3:0xd19c2276df0a2aa2"}

I received the worst haircut I could have gotten for my first experience! The staff is super friendly but being friendly don't get peoples hair cut properly. I'm a white guy and I mention this because I never let white people or women touch my head. Well, when I walked in there was a black dude (Tony), and a white lady (Ruby). Tony had one guy in his chair and one guy waiting on him. Ruby asked if I needed a cut and I should have told her, \"no offense, but I'll wait on Tony and then explained why.\" I thought about it for a second, and if I hadn't been in a hurry to get to a job interview I would have waited or went somewhere else. So I said sure. As soon as I sat down, I told her that I wasn't trying to be rude in saying this, but I haven't let a white person touch my head in 18 years, and I haven't let a woman touch my head since I was a kid. Obviously she covered both categories. I told her it's because black and Spanish dudes can fade hair great! Now, she's already gotten started at this point and she proceeds to tell me that she probably isn't as good as the owner, George and Tony. -RED FLAG- (the only two black guys that cut here) She follows that up with, \"I'll get you Tony's card, and you can call him for a cut the next time you come.\" -RED FLAG- She even told me that she's good with lining up beards as well. Spoiler Alert!!! She lied about both!!! Again, she's very nice, but being nice doesn't get my hair cut correctly! Well, I guess you know where this is going! She F'd my head up son!!! And my beard, mannnnnnnn let me tell you. She must have closed her eyes or something when she was lining my beard up. I literally had to tell her that I looked like I had a bowl cut, that she needed to fade it better and more on the sides. Told her I hadn't had a bowl cut since I was a small child and my mom couldn't afford to get me a real descent haircut. She tried to fix it with no luck at all. (Because there was no skill!) She finished that and then moved on to my beard. This woman put a hot towel on my face, which felt nice, but I'm at a barber shop, not a salon, to get my damn hair cut! She then proceeds to attempt to line my beard up, and she must have closed her eyes, took her glasses off, or just looked away when she got to this part because my line on my neck seriously looked like she held me down and trimmed it with a weed wacker! She put a different hot towel on my face and then told me we were almost done that she needed to put a cold towel to close my pores and I was like, \"No ma'am!\" we are done! Now I'm at the point where I am to pay for my services, or lack thereof, and she proceeds to tell me that my hair cut and beard line up was $40!!! Needless to say, she DID NOT GET A TIP!!! Needless to say, don't let her even look at your head, and get Tony. He at least looked descent from what I could see while sitting next to him getting mutilated! I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be mean, but I take my hair and beard cuts VERY seriously!!! (If you couldn't tell by now) Enter at your own risk. Oh, I gave it two stars because they're really nice peeps but some should seek out new professions. Peace. Sorry Tony", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88620d77eb99a851:0xdc6b611a196aea34"}

First of all I have long hair, I wanted my split ends off and layered along with face layered. All she did was a face layered and split ends, and then she took a big round tool for the hair dryer and tried to curl up my hair, when I got home, my husband looked and they burned some of my hair so not only was my hair the same, just a snip here and there, but it stayed frizzy all the time, no matter what I did it would still frizzy. So I finally went to options in my town and they did my hair right. My mom went the same day I had mine done at Walmart, this same place. The girl who did hers, was suppose to cut her split ends off and layer it. She did 2 snips on 1 side and the other side and she was done. Then they changed their prices from 15$ (for a wash and cut along with druing) to 20$ for a wash, cut and dry. It's still 15$ for a cut and wash, but you will have to go around with wet hair because in order to dry, you have to pay 5$ more. Oh but they don't tell you that at the counter BTW!! Wound up paying almost 45$ for mine and my mom's hair cuts. They would not refund either. So I could have let my 10yr old niece cut my hair way better than those people and saved 45$. I will never go back. I suggest to anyone else, if you want to goto your salon who does a good job, but decides oh I'm at Walmart, I'll just do it here, don't!

My Mum and I love that the hairdressers go to the Nashville and other hair shows to learn how to do the latest cuts, colors and styles (my Dad and brother don't care as much - they just get the same men's barber hair cut each time). I worked at a beauty parlor years ago and I can tell you that I've never seen hair stylists or beauticians that care as much as Kim and her team. I have very long hair that I dread cutting but the girls take off only what is necessary. I alternate between hair straightening and letting the  hairdressing salon tame it all perfectly into loose wavy curls. Every six weeks I like to get a deep conditioning keratin treatment and multidimensional highlights and Kim is the best at listening to and giving me exactly what I want. I love that I can buy all of my fav Paul Mitchell, A.R.C.O.N and Olez hair and beauty supplies here too. For Mothers Day, I treated my Mom to some corrective hair coloring (these guys are master colorists) and a new textured bob that she absolutely adores and a relaxing pedicure too. We have booked them to do all the hair updos for my bridal party in mid-June. I've seen some of their wedding hairstyles on instagram and am so excited.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a6150a846cbd7:0xc286820ce2a5fd31"}

All of this was done WITHOUT damaging my hair--and it was a pretty drastic change. I've had my hair lightened before, and there was always a period of super-dry, frizzy straw hair that took weeks of deep conditioning to recuperate. This is not the case now. My hair doesn't even feel like it's been colored at all. It's just as healthy as it was from the start. Also, I now get complements on my hair E-V-E-R-Y day. That's never happened to me before!

Staying at the residence inn, I Googled best barber near me, and Robert Henry popped up first. Took a look at a few reviews and then booked my appointment online for just a few hours later.\n\nRobert Henry is located inside the Sola Salons community of beauty care, which is a series of suites that are rented by different beauty experts. Walking into the solo suite, I was met by Robert who was gratious and welcoming, as was his work space. Very clean, with a modern feel, Robert started with a brief consultation, asking me what I was looking for, as well as assessing my hair's style. He made some brief suggestions and offered up a bottled water and then we were off.\n\nI signed up for the business cut. From moment one I knew I made the right choice. Shampoo, a little massage and then he dives right into his craft. Robert was talkative and engaging while never being overbearing, he had a comforting chair side manor, and walked me through what he was doing, like a play by play.\n\nHis style is precise and you know, even if you can't see, that you are being treated to a Great haircut. Once he had finished with the overall styling, he conditioned and treated me to a warm face towel. Man, what a touch. A brief scalp massage and then he popped me back up, applied some product and I get the glimpse of the final product. It is Amazing. He shows me the back, where he tiered it a little more in the lower section, remembering how I told him that section grew faster than other spots. Love the attention to detail.\n\nI highly recommend Robert Henry. I have a pretty wild mane, curly in spots, straight in others and some pretty crazy hairlines, and they were no match for this amazing stylist.\n\nMahalo & Namaste,\n\nmpgink", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1528226036488, "text": "Welcome to Birmingham Matthew !!\nThank you for your feedback.

I showed them the picture and neither said they could achieve the simple braid and curl. they explained that the stylist I was scheduled for had called in, but I was not informed of this until I had already made the 45 min trip.

The workers seem like nice people, I just dont understand why I am watching people go before me when they checked in and showed up after me.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888921a453dc1c9f:0x3b5650a8232caf6a"}

We have been treating it, and it had not went away and has discolored the back of his neck area.  In sixteen years my son has never gotten any rashes from barber shops. I decided to give the shop another chance,  and had thought maybe it was just a random break out.

No one who can do good fades and nobody who does the straight blade for your lineup. Greasy hands is good in downtown but they are way overpriced and their app is just too complex for a haircut. So I decided to give up on finding a good Barber. Until I decided to go to Johnny B's. Not only was he as good as my New York Barber but he was better. Not only are they professional but they are very kind have a great conversation and most importantly they have a lot of confidence in their work. They definitely take pride which is most important. Even when he's cutting my hair and I told him about my situationE he said he guarantees it would be better then my New York Barber. Not because he knew my barber but because of his confidence. And I'll be damned it was. this guy has confidence and he knows what he's doing. I don't care what barber anyone tells you to go and Florence or anywhere in Lauderdale county for that matter.

The personality and communication skills of Arian do not qualify her a job in service sector. Definitely not a manager, if she is one right now as she self claimed.\n\nI have been going to this place despite of a bad experience 2 years ago with a stylist before. At that time,  I averaged my rating at 2 star. But now, I wish I could give 0 or negative rating, and will not go there anymore despite of the convenient location.\n\nI believe this place can still survive only because its location is very convenient for students. I went there in a morning in March, I was told they didn't take walk in. Understandable in covid. I made an appointment at 2 , then I went back at 1:50, and waited for 40 minutes, and finally sit on the chair at 2:30, and got the 10 minutes hair cut. Then I apparently complained to the stylist that the so called appointment didn't work.\n\nHowever, I forgot all these, until I was reminded by the same stylist yesterday in May.  When I saw she didn't have mask on yesterday, I asked if she had vaccine.. she said no. Then I asked why she didn't have mask on if she didn't have vaccine. Then, she told me she refused to serve me anymore because I complained last time as well. I didn't even know what is the last time and who she is, then she showed me the ticket, which shows her name ARIAN for my last visit. And told me what happened last time. I wanted to talk to the manager, she self claimed to be the manager while wagging her head and proudly laughing at me.\n\nOkay, she won. I walked out and went to another place and fixed my half done hair.\n\nIsn't it part of managers job to handle customers complaint? I know many of us at our jobs need to pretend to like our boss.  But since when it becomes a responsibility for a customer to pretend to like the service even if they don't? Ok, I have been there for 15 times as the ticket showed.  Out of 15, I do remember 2 bad experiences including yesterday. Plenty of okay and good ones.

Upon arrival to my bathroom mirror, i find that i have 0.5 inch of hair in the front middle, covered by 1.5 inches (like i wanted), 2.5 inches on the right and 1 inch on the left. I have a sink full of hair from around my ears and the back is gaped up all to hell. I almost want to stand in front of the door with my hair all jacked up and tell people that walk in that this is what $15.50 will get you. I am so mad right now that i will never even get a gallon of milk at that place, not an rx, not anything and am going to tell anyone that asked me the same thing. Ridiculous that anyone could pass beauty school with work like that on something so simple. I feel sorry for the females that come in with something more complicated and pay 3 times as much", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8861e929668213d7:0x612ab985938f27ed"}

They always discuss the outcome first with great communication skills and provide services with experience, heart, and soul. Every stylist there is great. There are many requests for specific stylists but give the others a chance. It is their priority to please you and they never rush to the point of just barely meeting the requirements. The newer stylists are always doing their very best to please you and they work as a team if one employee needs help. You can take before and after pictures, create new color ideas, highlight, shadow root melt, ombre, all over colors, perms, stack bob haircuts, undercut fades, layers, color correction, beautiful bangs, waxed eyebrows, a head massaging shampoo and conditioner, great products, and more.

I lived out of state for school, and would plan my visits around when I could come to The Masters. Even now, with me living in Nashville, I would schedule well in advance to make a trip to this salon so I could see my favorite hair stylist, Rita. As someone with curly hair, it takes me a long time to find someone who has the skillset to work with curl patterns. I have had many bad haircuts in my life\u2014anyone with curly hair can relate. Rita changed the way I worked with and styled my hair. I even recommended for my mother to start visiting the salon because I wanted to refer her to Rita. Recently, Rita told us she was moving out of state and that she would be referring all of her clients to Kimberly. I trusted the salon, and so I scheduled my next appointment.\n\nKimberly has a great disposition. I explained I didn\u2019t want to deviate from the shape that Rita had left, and I only wanted it a little shorter because I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to be back for a long time. Kimberly asked me if I wanted for her to cut my hair either dry or wet, because \u201ccurly haired girls always have a preference\u201d. I told her I would be okay with what she was most comfortable with, and she decided to cut my hair wet. I noticed she was cutting it in large chunks and not taking her time. When she was finished, she asked me how much product I wanted in my hair because \u201ccurly haired girls are particular.\u201d After she put it in, she separated my hair into clips and said she was finished while she pulled out the diffuser. As she plugged it in, she looked at me and said: \u201cDo you want to diffuse it yourself? Curly haired girls usually like to do this part themselves.\u201d I was taken aback because this has never been asked of me before\u2014especially by a place that charges almost $100 for a cut. I told Kimberly that, sure, I could diffuse my hair myself. After I was finished, I looked at the result. The hair fell like a triangle; she easily had cut off 4 inches. I quickly paid and went to my car. I decided that I couldn\u2019t leave a place that charged so much to do a substandard job. I pulled up a picture of my hair after I received my last cut, and went back to the salon to see if it could be fixed. When I came back and showed Kimberly the picture, she was apologetic. I sat back down in her chair, and she proceeded to ask me to tell her where I thought she should cut my hair to make it look right. If I could cut my hair myself, I would. But I cannot, and that is why I spend more than $20 to go to a place that emphasizes professionalism and a higher skillset of stylist. Seeing that I was just going to have to leave with a bad haircut, I left.\n\nI called management to ask for a refund. My mother had given me a $50 gift card and I had put the rest on my credit card. They told me the owner was out of town and that they couldn\u2019t refund my money without his saying that it was okay. Instead, they offered me two haircuts. I explained that, although I appreciated this gesture, I wouldn\u2019t be returning to the salon to get my hair cut again. They insisted that it would be okay and that I should go to the stylist who trained both Kimberly and Rita in cutting curly hair. When I declined, they said they would try to talk to the owner. A couple of days later, they returned my phone call to say they had not heard from the owner and they still suggested I take the original offer. I had no plans on going back, but my mother has straight hair and usually has no problems when it comes to getting it trimmed. I asked if I could transfer my two cuts to my mother, seeing as she had purchased the gift card and it was also her money wasted on a bad cut. I would feel better knowing that she could do something nice for herself. But, they said no. I never heard back.\n\nI had to write this for all of the curly haired girls out there who \u201care particular\u201d or who have a \u201cpreference.\u201d Do not come to this salon.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1566598422101, "text": "Hello Brittany, first off if this was to happen to one of us or a member of our own family, we would not be happy.

When I came in and asked for something different the manager and son of the owner stepped in and decided to do the formulation and process himself. This man is considered to be extremely good with color. My hair came out neon orange when I asked for dark brown. He then tried to fix it the same day and it was still very very wrong. At this point I had been at the salon for seven hours. He then asked me to come back that Saturday for an \"adjustment\". I came out of that no better and my hair was damaged and breaking off. They also still charged me $450. I have never gone back. I also witnessed failure of management on managing clients and appointments. Brett has set up the salon where clients are passed around to whoever is free to work on them.

My job pays me to look good and I couldn't even walk into my work place feeling confident (which is one of my favorite things about getting my hair professionally done the \"confidence boost\" you have after)  I research beauty and hair consistently I guess because of this I felt like I knew more about what needed to be done to my hair than the staff which I should not be able to say because they have had actual schooling in this.

We offer all types of cutting techniques. Scissor cutting , scissor over comb , clipper over comb , razor sculpting.

This is why we turn every client around and ask them, \u201c Is  this what you were looking for?\u201d  Why didn\u2019t you say anything then? Sounds to me that you weren\u2019t happy before your hair cut ?? Because wetting hair shouldn\u2019t of been a bad sign to you. Using a water bottle in a salon/barbershop is completely normal. Very similar to a shampoo and cut. A lot of men have old product in there hair, wear glasses, hats, or their hair is simply messed up from normal wear throughout the day. It would make since to wet it and make sure of no cow licks or nothing to prevent unevenness. We are very surprised to receive a 1 star and you never said anything to us. We would of never charged you and made sure to give our best to change the style or fix whatever we needed to. I wish you would of gave us that chance before leaving us a 1 star.

I came as a walk-in because I needed a haircut very badly and everywhere else I went was booked. I walked in and the people were pleasent enough but they all seemed to not give a care. The girl who cut my hair was kind of rude. She never introduced herself(I had to find out by looking at her cosmetology license) and she made me feel uncomfortable and like she could care less that I was giving her business. She also never started a conversation with me and when I tried to start one with her she never answered me back. Yes, I understand they need to concentrate but, my previous hairdress who retired made an effort to make me feel good about myself while I was in her chair. She spent maybe 20 minutes on my hair and she didn't even style it with a flat iron or blow dryer. Mind you, she dry cut it, which to me is a no-no and she should have put in the effort and asked me my preference. I would have paid extra. I didn't realize until after I had gone to work that it was everything I told her I didn't want. Choppy haircut and and chunky layers. I'm so upset and if I could get my money back I would. Basically, I'm so ashamed that someone who is in the beauty business treated me this way.
