I went out to the course and spoke to the gentlemen about the incident.  They were delayed only 5 minutes from their tee time.  My worker could have had a cooler head dealing with customers, but an apology was made and the men appeared to be happy that I looked into the situation. I offered to buy them a round of beers as a friendly gesture.   I am more than willing to accept a one star review than cower to a person trying to extort money in lieu of a bad review.

My ONLY criticism was it seemed the sites were a little close to each other, however, the owners made accommodations and created some good spacing for those of us that were reserved in some of the smaller sites.  I also believe that I overheard that the owners were looking to make some improvements as they continue to complete the overall construction.\nBut again, really inspiring to see this all come together in the way that it is and I will DEFINITELY be back in June for the Grand Opening.\n#GreatTimes #GreatOwners #GreatStory2Tell #LastingFriendships #Inspiring #TimeAway", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1622519030010, "text": "Thank you!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888bcf3f7272837d:0x30a6fde7d5cf86bc"}
