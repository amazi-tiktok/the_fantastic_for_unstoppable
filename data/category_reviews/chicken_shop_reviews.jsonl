I\u2019ve seen it on SM with great feedback. I came for lunch and the drive thru was packed. Looks to only one ordering system.\nI walked in , entrance is right in front of the cashier and restrooms. I was greeted with someone handing me a take out menu. I began my order by letting them know I had a free sandwich from the app. Yikes things got a little crazy. No one knew how to probably add my coupon code. The coupon code is timed after you hit redeem so it actually disappeared. But no worries the time got me set with my cayenne ranch chicken sandwich meal. Jared was very nice taking my order and my food came out quick! The sandwich was amazing. Very light spice. The Buffalo wings are really goodThe fries was seasoned pretty while too! I really enjoyed this place great new option on skyland.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYVomyFOUs1Z0WrlUP6hz_ExJ0J8O_Sc0OkE4M=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdvcj8Si4S2m10fJugZ6crIRAf1rMvkBEgOksS=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmlprepc5Vri8wIVzjoMVjJZQOc3Yuhuvfckvg=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTM7zgUCapVEnz8ZFiVmOLRDdtx9ykYvv754V5=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1GuiHbF26DAuKu47FD9atOwe9KeJVVwORNOLF=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBKBkXhULPnqurZ5S5A2CQVb9VvW0chXFq42KC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2xhuR5OOf0SL43JrpCkJmDA5RPa6z4ig6GQfA=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkwCEgyQMhIzI26FawYfsdfDLmBvRI7uMnEGXc=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkvEjgn0BQTAutYpzV97ZutnmEn3SX64rCmZJw=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5ds9NL18IawVOY9Mo0t1LgAivh2twZrLFwIP9=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNB5DwFQYauXw8DbS9GfzOgfhhzXLNjtXzjbhnS=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIMEFBvenG7Nd12b6gQiVJEhb1Gjd0DTnsaNpC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_Ag1Gr2xJzpxtPBKv_C4vimQEzGhfEehvi_y2=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqByhcA2qTtef1x0LdWB18Kskj9-B5nUrkht3p=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a90ddb4bffd9:0xe4dc5407284bd54d"}
