I have dealt with a lot of doctor's in my lifetime,  but never in my life have I dealt with a doctor's office that never has anyone answer the phones,  return phone calls or call and give the patient the results of test that he/ she may have had. I am not the only one that has the issue of getting someone to answer the phone or return your call as Heather claims they will do when you leave a message , and even then leaving a message you are lucky if they have it where you can. 99.9% of the time, the voice mail box is slam full and you can't leave a message.  Heather claims that calls will be returned but that is a flat out lie. Btw I am not the only patient with this issue. I have spoken with about 20 if not more patients who have the same issue. Same goes with other Dr. Offices, they can't even get anyone to call them back, nor are they able to even make a appointment with Dr. Hari's office cause there again no one ever answers the phone .. Pharmacy's are the same way, they are unable to get anyone to call them back when they call to get refills for a patients meds that they have no refills on. This is very unacceptable and as a doctor's office , his patients is not his first priority, or should I say it isn't his office people's priority.  I really did like Dr Hari but to be treated as I have been by his so called office staff is unacceptable.  He really needs to get someone in there that can do their job.  I am still waiting on test results from a ultrasound I had done of my stomach and liver , trying to figure out of I have cancer. I have several factors that could cause it. My mother died from it Jan 3, 2016. I did find out today through no help of his office that I could come to the hospital and go to medical records and get the info I need there.  I have two of my other doctor's who have been trying to get the results from him, and you guessed it, Heather nor anyone else will answer the phone and I am assuming she throws all medical requests from other docore in the trash. One of my doctors has faxed my medical release form 4 times and still nothing.  But gave up on calling.

The man makes a trip to California, doesn't even tell me knowing this a current thing that i just got. I call the office and the nurses (Great people) try to help me and get him on the phone. Next it turns out i have a gallbladder check up that i didn't even know about. And i had to find that out the hard way by calling the office to get help because my medicine was rejecting my body. Then not only could the nurse not get ahold of him the man never called me or spoke to me about whats wrong with me. I know how doctor life works. And i am not on here to exploit or ruin anyone. But those who have concern for your health dont go to him. He doesnt really talk to you about anything, hell send you to do test and you wont hear one word from him.

Dr. Tarwater said that even though the probability was extremely small for someone her age (she was 44 at the time) he did not want to take any chances and scheduled her for a colonoscopy. Based on my previous experience, I was all for it, though I thought the chances were probably pretty slim as well that it would be anything serious. To our horror and disbelief. Dr. Tarwater found colon cancer. He was really great about how he broke the news to us, praying with us and giving us a lot of hope. Because of Dr. Tarwater's insistence on doing a through job, we caught it early and it was cured with surgery. She didn't even have to do chemo. I thank God everyday for Dr. Tarwater and the team at Digestive Health and especially God's mercy in guiding us to where we needed to be for her treatment. In another situation,  my mother-in-law had to go to the hospital because of intestinal distress that turned out to be a life-threatening condition. Cody, the nurse practitioner,  who was working at Flowers Hospital at the time, intervened in her care and immediately recognized the seriousness of her condition making sure her treatment was swift, which probably saved her life. So I feel like I owe the lives two people whom I care about very much to the expertise and care at Digestive Health. One other thing. IF YOU ARE 50 OR OVER GET YOUR COLONOSCOPY IT CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE! IF YOU HAVE RECTAL BLEEDING OR OTHER SYMPTOMS, INSIST ON SEEING THE SPECIALIST AT DIGESTIVE HEALTH. For us it made all the difference in the world.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1579701110498, "text": "Thank you for such a wonderful review and such sweet words!"}, "gmap_id": "0x8892928199908111:0x275fa30c9779cd8"}

Personally, if you are considering this place, I would just run like H3LL.  I had symptoms of acid reflux and had an ENT confirm what I thought it was.  I asked to get an endo done just to ensure my throat did not have Barrett's.  They referred me for the procedure and one of the female doctor's performed the endo.  Prior to this I had never met this doctor.  I explained my acid reflux and she said it could be my gallbladder since I had a child 1.5 years prior.  She recommended an ultrasound and hyda scan.  I went in for both and it was found that I did have a gallstone.  The hyda scan was normal.  The gastro doc immediately referred me to a surgeon to have my gallbladder removed.  I was blown away!  I had never had any typical gallbladder attacks or pain.  After doing more research I found out that having your gallbladder removed can actually cause bile reflux due to the constant free flow of bile into your system once the gallbladder is removed and the bile has no where else to go.  This doctor could not even read details of my ultra sound so I had to rely on some random doctor (over the phone) to tell me that yes, I have a rather large stone.  This female gastro doc never made any follow up appointment with me.  I immediately canceled the surgery.  I have since discussed this decision with other doctors (ENT and family doctor) and they agree with my decision.  My one gallstone while big is not currently causing typical symptoms.  There is absolutely no guarantee that removal of my gallbladder will fix the acid reflux.  And, recently, my acid reflux has been manageable with a proper clean (and green) diet. Folks, after doing much research, I am convinced that probably millions of Americans have gallstones.  Why?  Diet, it's that simple.  Our diet is just too high in fat, salt, and sugar amongst other things.  A lot of people have gallstones without even knowing UNLESS they have a gallbladder attack that lands them in the ER (or in my case was found just by chance).  In my opinion, gallbladder pain and recurrent attacks are reasons to remove the gallbladder.  Yes, you can live without your gallbladder but you can also live without your arm.  Your body functions better with both so unless you are having issues, think really hard about whether it's worth losing an organ.  In very rare cases, gallbladder disease in the form of stones can lead to major illnesses like cancer.  However, IF you drastically improve your diet, I do believe you can control your destiny.  Remember, everything begins in the gut!  Obviously, I am not a medical doctor, so these opinions are my own.  My last words of advice: get 2 or 3 opinions and remember that doctors are in the business to make money.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a680bf0c7d7:0x1d6cad2459ca0d12"}
