To begin with, the estimator came out and gave me a price on having 2 trees cut down and having the stumps ground - trees are in the back yard behind a locked gate. I was told to expect a phone call that afternoon for scheduling. After 3 days I called the office and was told that they never received my estimate but they would put me on their schedule. A date was set and then was moved several times. I scheduled someone to come do bobcat work around that date as well. I then received a call asking if they could come that day (Thursday) and do the work. I said yes and left my office to go home and meet them. They finally showed up around 4:45 in the afternoon and got one tree down and told me that they would be back at 8:30 am the next day. I had to call the office at 3 pm to see if they were still coming to finish the work since I had to take another day to stay home from work. I waited to hear back and was told that they should be out sometime that afternoon. The crew finally showed up around 5:30 pm. They were able to get the second tree down but did not have the equipment to grind the stumps and I was told that they would come Saturday morning to finish up. Saturday came and went without anyone showing up and no phone call. The following Wednesday I get a call from the office asking if I was happy with the work and to confirm that they had removed all the debris from my yard, I told the person on the phone that they were not supposed to remove debris but they were supposed to grind stumps. She was unaware of this and said that she would make a note of it and have someone call me. Later that afternoon I got a phone call letting me know that someone would be out the next morning to grind stumps. I waited the entire day at home after taking off work, again, and NTS was again a no call no show. At this point I gave up on having anyone come complete the job. A couple weeks later, the company showed up without calling to try and finish grinding 2 stumps. The guy told my wife that he couldn't finish because there was some concrete and rocks that the didn't initially see and that he would need to come back later to finish the work. At this point I have had to call and cancel on my bobcat guy twice, which has cost both of us money. This job was started in April, and it is now the end of May. If you don't have anything to do and want to work with a company that is completely incompetent with communication, then National Tree Service should be ok. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and stay clear.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889120537039b69:0xc174a3fde06c8ea6"}

This company has no pride in their work. They laid our sod all kind of crazy in the dead of winter and didn't roll it properly. If not careful one could easily break an ankle. They turned our sprinkler heads against the house and garage like idiots and quite a few were broken. It's the work of 2 year olds. And, it's a non warranty service so there lies the problem. If most are doing a job they never have to return to then they are not going to put too much pride in doing the job.

I used them to repair my irrigation system. Although I do not have any problem with the quality of the work they performed, I do have a problem with their billing. When I first called them to ask for an estimate was told they would not be able to provide an estimate only do the work because in figuring out what was wrong with the system they would be doing work towards fixing it. I understand that. I was told they charge $75 per hour on the job plus materials. I was ok with that. It took some time to get out to me but eventually they came out.  They came out late afternoon on a Friday.  I showed them the problem and provided pictures of the system when it was being installed. They spent no more than 30 minutes in my yard. I asked if they could tell me about how much I should expect it to cost. I was told that it really depends on how long it takes and how much damage the system had (I understand that too) and told it should be less that $500. They said they would return next week to do the work. It was more than two weeks and several calls before I was able to get them to come back and do the work. They arrived at 8:00AM and were gone by 10:30AM. I received a bill for $477. The bill only said labor and materials. I called for a better itemized breakdown and was informed the person that handled that was out but he would call me back. After two weeks and another call I did get a call back. I asked for the material cost and how many hours I was billed for. He said they charged 4.5 hours and a hundred something for materials. I told him that was not correct and that they were here no more than 3 hours.  Here is the kicker folks. He said they charge for the drive to and from my house!!  That was the additional 1.5 hours!!  He said I should be happy that they came in under the max they said it might be!! Seriously. I told him I was going to spread this as widely as I possibly could and he did not seem to care.

However, over time, we noticed the results became less & less apparent, and the invoices seemed to become higher & higher.  Then, finally at some point last winter, there was some apparent weed spraying along my property\u2019s entire fenceline that left behind a 3-foot wide swath of dead grass, which became painfully obvious when the lawn came out of its winter dormancy in late March 2021.  All TruGreen tech had to say was that it must\u2019ve been from a cold winter & some other BS, and that maybe it would eventually grow back; however, none of our many other neighbors that don\u2019t use TruGreen, but do have the same type of centipede grass, the same type of shadow box fence, and the same type of winter weather showed no signs of this kind of problem.  So, I have to call B.S. on this lame-brain & accept-no-responsibility explanation.  TruGreen management was notified numerous times about this complaint, and we never got a reply from anyone about it.  Needless to say, we were forced to cancel this expensive & negative impact lawn service.  Now, I have the wonderful task of ripping-up thousands of square feet of dead grass along my entire fenceline, and purchasing expensive & dirty sod to put it all back myself.  Then, I have the wonderful task of watering it all back to health very early in the morning for the next several weeks.

I had a young lady come through our neighborhood and ask if I would like a free estimate on servicing my yard.  I told her yes and within a few days I had a phone call with my estimate. Everything started good with speaking with both employees.  The SALESPERSON (Gail) told me I would get 5 different applications over the year. I told her I had a previous lawn company (which Ill be returning too) and they have done most treatments.  She told me to find out when they were last out and call back.  I didn't call Weed Man back before they came out so they decided to go ahead and do two applications on my yard when I did not approve  both applications. We paid $40 and a couple of days later had another invoice in the mail.  I called them to ask why I had another invoice and they told me they did two applications, even though I didn't give them authorization to do it.  The playing manager (DAVID) said that I said Yes when I didn't, so he proceeded to tell me he was going to go and pull the recording of the original phone call.  He called back told me that I never said yes to the weed killer application but  that I was supposed to call them back. Because I didn't they went ahead anyways and charged me for it.\n\nThey will do anything they can to get money.

We asked them to cancel all services at that point.  Two months later, Ecopest cashed the missing check without contacting us at all.  We called and left messages but our calls were not returned.

This company is not dependable, they make all kinds of excuses and they do AWFUL work. Charge a hefty amount ($50.00) to cut and ($35.00) to treat and I have a very small yard as I have a large in-ground pool that takes up most of my back yard. My grass looked the worst, this year, it has ever looked and they broke an electrical box on my pool and then tried to make it out to be my fault. If you want to have a good-looking lawn look elsewhere.\n\n***Update 5 Jan 2020***\n\nReceived a phone call on 4 Jan from one of the owners (Dusty, he managers the pest control). He wanted to see what he could do to make up for the awful service that I received from the lawn care part of his business. I told him there really was nothing he could do as I am not one to write a review just to get a discount. He was very nice and offered to refund part of my money but I told him that he did not need to do that. He was concerned about my review being one star as it really hurts the other side of his business as they are tied together. I told him i understood and that I hated for that to happen so I have now raised it to a three-star rating. I cannot speak for his side of the business so it is unfair for me to give the entire business a one star because of the lawn care side. So, with all that said I still do not recommend the lawn care part of this business or at least not until Dusty gets rid of his partner whoever he is.

First I called one of the crawl space companies.  Issue with them is that they actually don't care about anything except making sure you get a quote for about 4000 to 8000 dollars in water proofing nor will they give you a report with the details of the moisture readings.  My agent called Ecopest and Dustin came out to do an inspection.  He did moisture readings throughout the crawl space and recommended a series of steps to return the crawl space back to its usual condition.  He explained everything in simple terms and I learned a lot from him.  When the work that needs to be done isn't something they do he recommends highly capable people with the same integrity as those that work at Ecopest.  This job ended up costing $4000 LESS than the supposed crawl space experts and now my crawl space is back in its original condition with no waterproofing solution necessary.  Thank you Dustin!

I told her our yard looks horrible since it has not been cut since May 2nd and I know when they are there because of the camera. I then asked when they were going to be coming out and she said the earliest would be this Wednesday, since they were done for whichthe week. That  would have made it nearly a month which is totally unexceptable. She then told me that they have long standing customers that have to be taken care of and I responded I am a paying customer as well and she said all their customers need to be taken care of. The owner sent me a message Saturday stating the entire yard would be taken care of Tuesday. It is sad when you pay someone to do a job and it is half done or not at all.

He pointed out the different weeds in my yard and the challenges with each type. I'm VERY picky about my yard and enjoy working in it (when it's not too hot !) so I asked Jonathan if I could pull a few of the remaining weeds in the lawn since the first treatment had wiped out 90% of the problem weeds and the 10% remaining looked like something I could help with. Jonathan advised what weeds or foreign grass I could pull and which ones if pulled might aggravate the problem and possibly make the those particular weeds spread instead of eliminating them due to their root structure.   I knew then I was working with a true KNOWLEDGEABLE professional. Jonathan said he would be specifically targeting the residual weeds in the following treatments while at the same time promoting the health of my lawn which now looks like a lush thick green carpet after only two applications.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1601476017816, "text": "Thank you for sharing your experience, Glenn.

So here we are 2 weeks later and we were told it would be on a Thursday and Friday of the week after we signed up.  Thursday rolled around and it was raining so of course they wouldn't be out.  I called Jonathan (no VM) so I texted him to find out that they would be out on that Friday.  Friday came and went without any service.  Texted Jonathan and was told it would be today (Monday).  So it's Monday and I texted Jonathan to find out when so I can unlock our back gate, etc and was told to go to the app to find out when they would be out. There is no place on the app to check this so I started a chat with an \"agent\" only to be told to talk to my representative on when they would be out.

I had TruGreen in 2018 and at the end of the year decided to end service. There were multiple times they didn\u2019t show up and I had to call and complain.  And at no point in that year was my back yard treated and it was overcome with weeds. I didn\u2019t think I should have to chase down a service I was paying for. At the beginning of October a sales rep came by and I decided after speaking with him to give it another shot. He seemed horrified by the difference between my front and back yards. He gave me his cell phone number as a personal guarantee that he would handle any issues of the person not coming out. Because of the time of year it was he told me that I would be services every 6-8 weeks. Which, if you\u2019re any good at math, would tell you that at MOST I *may* have two treatments before the end of the year. On October 24th I texted him and said that there must be some confusion because I had already been charged twice, and when looking on the website it appeared I was going to have another one within the next two weeks. He told me he would credit me one of the services I had received and push back my next service. He was going to follow up with me the next day. On November 5th I reached out to him again, I had not received a follow up and already had a pending charge for another treatment. No response. November 6th I texted again, this time he said he was going to get it resolved and a credit issued. I should have that credit within three business days. On November 15th I had still not received that credit, and a technician showed up at my house to treat. I sent my sales rep another text. At this point I had already been billed 109.87 in a month and a half, when I should have been charged less than 80 through the end of the year. I explained what I had been billed, the lack of credits I received after being told it was coming, and the frustration I felt for being signed up for tree and shrub service that I didn\u2019t ask for and didn\u2019t need. I explained I expected a refund of 79.92 for the two treatments that I should have never received, and that I would like to cancel my service. He responded with a \u201cYes ma\u2019am\u201d. On November 20th I sent a follow up text to be sure it was handled. The sales rep has red the text but not responded. It is November 23rd and there is no refund to my account, I have no trust in TruGreen that this will be handled in a professional manner. If this isn\u2019t resolved by the end of the month I will be going to the BBB.

After 6 phone calls and threatening to sue, a field manger comes out and explains they will do a soil test actually use a fertilizer that works.

So I gave them another shot and they  came  and did it. Two more treatments later I saw NO difference. my backyard was covered it dirt and weeds.

This includes sprinklers front and back, outdoor lighting around the backyard, sod front and back, gravel on one side of the house, bushes, straw beds, a privacy hedge, and a tree in the front yard.\n\nBefore they did sod, they \u201cgraded\u201d the yard. It was a horrible mud hole until they came. Our yard has a bad erosion problem from the slope of our yard. I asked them to fill in the low spots with some dirt before they laid sod so the yard would be more level and the water wouldn\u2019t pool. The nice man in charge agreed.\n\nWhen they were done, the yard looked amazing. Truly beautiful. However, after a few weeks, it was apparent that they had not filled in the low spots before they laid sod. A few spots were constant puddles, and the sod in those spots was getting torn up because it wasn\u2019t taking to the mud.\n\nWe contacted DC, and they replied straight away that they would fix the problem. They came out, picked up the sod, filled in the low spots with dirt, and then covered them back up with fresh sod. He even offered to replace the bushes in our backyard because our dogs have killed them with urine. I declined because it wasn\u2019t their fault. We\u2019ve had no problems ever since.\n\nOne of our sprinklers has had problems a few times, and so have our backyard lights. Each time, they have shown up promptly to fix the problem with no hassle.\n\nThe one thing I would ask is that they start calling ahead or knocking on people\u2019s front doors before they randomly show back up in people\u2019s backyards for a service call.

Daniel King and his team quickly put my fears to rest. Daniel showed up for the initial inspection quickly and his quote arrived soon thereafter. His staff stayed in contact with me every step of the way. His price was very fair. Three days before work was to commence, I received an email letting me know they were monitoring the weather and there was a possibility of a rain delay. This never happened with any previous contractor. In the past, if it rained, other guys just wouldn't show up -- no communication. DC rescheduled with me for just a couple of days later -- and then showed up a day early. Their installation team, led by Bobby Faust, was knowledgable, and they got in and out quickly. They cleaned up their mess when they left. A week later, Bobby even came back to check on the work.\n\nYou can do a lot worse than to hire DC Lawn and Landscape, but I'm not sure you can do any better.

They would show weeks later unannounced so we would have to call again to ask them to come spray the backyard, after we called several times to get in the schedule in the first place.\nThe front office staff is atrocious, inconsiderate and extremely rude. My husbands phone number was blocked and we had to call from other phones to get the front office to even answer and then they would not schedule our service. They would claim to- but no one would ever call- this final straw came after we called several times over EIGHT WEEKS!\nDo not hire this group unless you want to waste your money and be disappointed!\nAs far as the actual treatment goes, that was fine. I would rate one star purely based on how terrible it was to get scheduled and actually get an answer.\n\nUpdate:\nSo we fired this company over a week ago- after we called and called, even called the Huntsville office to try to get someone at the Birmingham location to help us. (Huntsville was very responsive by the way and it turns out not related to the Birmingham office). This is what leads to my theory that either the front office blocks phone numbers or is just so lazy that she doesn\u2019t answer the phone.\nSo we finally get the front desk worker on the phone and we tell her we do not want the service for the above reasons and to remove us from the quarterly rotations. The manager did try to call to confirm why we were leaving service, but we were fed up with trying to deal so we didn\u2019t respond.\nWELL this week a worker comes out, a week after we told the front desk we didn\u2019t want service anymore,  Without a text, voicemail  or email alert and they spray our front yard AFTER WE FIRED THEM for the same dang reason!! So apparently the woman didn\u2019t even put down that we didn\u2019t want service and we asked to cancel our arrangement! So a worker sprayed and left a bill on our front door and a note that the back gate was locked. Of course, it was locked- we were not expecting service and had no notice service was coming because we had told the front desk worker to remove us.\n\nHonestly, I think the whole thing could have been avoided had TurfDoctor just hired competent front office staff- the woman who seldom answers the phone, but it is ALWAYS her when she does answer cannot get her calendar straight. Please get new office staff!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1580938378770, "text": "Amy - we value all our customers and would love a chance to clear this up.

He came to the property and gave me an accurate estimate before by 10:30am, had his crew and equipment on site by 3:30pm, and finished the job, including clean-up by 7:00pm all in the same day..... and this was not a small job.  He even returned the following day, as promised, to cut a dead tree that required additional equipment, a bucket truck, that he did not have out on-site when I originally called him about the job.  Kevin and his crew were friendly, eager, responsive, prompt,  professional, and DID A VERY EXCELLENT JOB FOR A VERY FAIR PRICE.\n\nIn short, I GIVE KEVIN'S TREE SERVICE MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION AND WOULD ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO CALL KEVIN FIRST FOR YOUR TREE SERVICE NEEDS.....

Unfortunately this is not what we were expecting.

Our fence is covered in stains from the treatment and they range from 1 to 3 ft above the yard. This is unacceptable! Like I said, we are still in the process of fixing this but I want others to know our story. The fence was built in October so it's fairly new.\n\nI have emailed them and they are tracking what is happening. Let's hope we can fix this situation.\n\nUpdated 4/5: We called and had Andrew come over on Thurs to look at the damage. They told us it was because of the iron in the formula and the fact our fence is new. Our fence is about 6 months old and if this is the case, they need to treat each fence or patio as being \"new\". They talked about staining it darker but that's not what we want. We told them our opinion and what we wanted. Pressure washed and sealed. If they have to stain then we would go from there.

This review is coming at the end of the only season where I used Superior. Throughout the year I wasn't impressed with the invasive weeds that continued to sprawl in the back yard. Normally I was not home when the service was rendered, but one time I stop the person doing the application. He was rather dismissive and said they would get taken care in the future weed control applications. I am not a professional lawn person(hence the reason I pay them)so I had to assume he was telling the truth.\n\nToday, I was home when he came to do the final application. The truck was out front for less than 10 minutes. I have a reasonable sized lawn, front and back and a very difficult gate latch to contend with. There is a zero percent chance that he would have been able to disembark the truck, prep his application material, mange the gate, do a proper back yard treatment, latch the finicky gate latch, do the front and tag my door in that amount of time.  Suddenly then it clicked, this is likely why the back looks terrible - other than the one time I was here with the gate open, the work has never actually been done. (Included below crab grass photos taken today - after $432 in applications you should not see an increase in the amount of weeds - these patches are 2x what they were in the spring.)\n\nIt is evident that Superior does not instill in their employees a sense of pride in their work. I've had the same person so all the applications and a reputable business would develop a culture of doing the right thing. The application person should be invested enough to actually correct the problems a customer and ask for support if needed. Clearly this is not the case with Superior. The operations manager had the approach of blaming me for not bringing it to their attention at an earlier time and after consideration, I believe he couldn't be more wrong. If the applications aren't effective, his employee should be responsible and proactive enough to address this internally and find a solution for the customer.  Obviously these are not priorities for their organization.\n\nCaveat emptor.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMy4-LTuRrGXDNNTQpAp8cJeGNZM6R6wv4XCW6a=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMho-gmsg-5oiMvEhcU7dZYQQf60m_tBAUnM0Gp=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88882b00ada4e425:0xca3738802127df8b"}

I asked/called (repeatedly) for a rep to come out and get with me to get an estimate, I wasn't even sure it needed to be pushed at all I just assumed given my gate size. I wanted someone, a supposed professional, to tell me what they thought. However, after just simply driving by quickly out front of my yard they surmised (and didn't actually call to follow up) that they wouldn't be able to service my yard. It must be nice that you have plenty of business that you can not only turn away potential new customers but also treat them poorly with poor follow through and lackluster effort. I understand the eb and flow of your operations and how you can't push mow entire yards. I wasn't sure that it required that and if it did I would of possibly still been interested in the front yard being serviced which can be completed with a riding mower. You should evaluate your business operations and how you portray the business as a veteran ran organization (with I'm assuming good order and discipline, integrity, and work ethic) because I don't see that in your company right now.\n\nAgain to be clear your representative that \"stopped by\" rolled by for 20 seconds (we are all working from home and I watched him) and surely couldn't have gathered a full sight picture. Which is weird because I asked  your office rep if I could safely talk with him (at distance) and was told that wouldn't be an issue, clear lack of follow through there as well. Also, I was interested in other services your company might have provided but in light of this entire process lacking professionalism and follow through I wouldn't be confident in ANY work you could provide.

Called a few of the top rated companies on google and could not get a call back. Then Tahj and Pedro rolled by the house one day and handed me a pamphlet. I called them up and Mike responded quickly. Amanda at the office made the scheduling and transaction a breeze. Tahj and Dan started work promptly the day of the project and hammered out most of the clean out before lunch. After lunch Eric and Pedro joined the team and the entire crew finished the job. In 10 hours they had completely cleaned out and dug-up/removed the weeds and 12 over grown bushes from the front, back, and side beds, removed 5 stumps, cleaned out an over grown play area and had taken out 2 dying trees. By night fall, they had the yard mulched and ready for phase 2 - replanting in the spring. The following morning Tahj dropped by to mow the grass and edge the entire property, just as he had promised. You can tell Tahj gave a damn, and treated the place like his own. Eric brought the knowledge and had no problem answering my questions about plants and things while they worked. Pedro kept them honest, while Dan provided the laughs. As a veteran I appreciated that from all the guys. The price was fair for the work performed and worth every penny to us. Thank you guys for your service and for the service.

Something seemed off - sketchy. But we did anyway, against our better judgement. We waited a few weeks and then someone showed up at our house completely unannounced at 7AM trying to do a quote for us. We sent him away and immediately cancelled our service through the app. (We were charged for a cutting.)\n\nApparently the app wasn't working properly because they sent someone out again a week or so later. This person also showed up completely unannounced, and we sent him away as well (again, we were charged for a service).\n\nAt least those two lawn care technicians had knocked on our door. The THIRD PERSON (again we had cancelled through he app, and we also told the 2nd person they sent out to cancel our service) didn't knock on the door and instead started cutting our lawn without permission.\n\nWhen we originally talked to the company, we explained that no one was to be in the front yard where my vegetable garden and other projects are. We specified that mowers should only access the area beside the sidewalks and the back yard.\n\nNone of that information was communicated to the THIRD PERSON they sent out (seriously trespassing at this point since the company had been told multiple times at this point to stay away) so he began cutting where he wasn't supposed to and did over $200 worth of property damage to plants I had specially ordered from out of state as well as some prized plants my grandmother had given me and also fruits and vegetables that he mowed over with impunity.\n\nI don't blame the individual. He shouldn't have been sent by LawnStarter in the first place, and even if they did send him by mistake, he should have had the information we provided them to prevent this exact scenario from playing out.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that all three of these lawn care specialists were also upset with LawnStarter, decrying their lack of communication.\n\nNow we've been charged THREE TIMES for a service we cancelled before anyone ever started - a service that has only been performed once and resulted in over $200 worth of property damage.\n\nI filled out a property damage report including photos and receipts, and I spoke directly to customer service who assured me someone would reach out in 24 hours, and it's been almost 3 days.\n\nDO NOT USE THIS COMPANY\nSPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE\nHIRE LAWN CARE SPECIALISTS DIRECTLY, NOT A DISORGANIZED COMPANY THAT CAN'T OWN ITS MISTAKES", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bdda132bfb5:0x7014201d41c1aa29"}

A courteous receptionist is a must for businesses and sometimes not as appreciated as they should be. Today Todd performed my first lawn service. He was very friendly and was so thorough in his lawn application, being careful to really saturate any problem areas. He took about an hour to complete the service. I used a different lawn service last year and they were usually finished in about 15 minutes and were not nearly as thorough and were more expensive.
