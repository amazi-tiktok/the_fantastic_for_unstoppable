Now I know a few drinks and techniques.\n\nThe pros: Tracey, the instructor, made this class fun. With her outspoken personality and no filter there was never a dull moment. She was knowledgeable and could answer questions nearly right off the back.\n\nThe cons: the class was scheduled from 6-9, but there were times the class was ended only 30 min into it. For the money I paid I would\u2019ve rather the instructor took time to teach us the details. However, class was mostly just reading the textbook word for word. Also, there were different class groups on different sections in the textbook that the instructor had to teach all at once. Never giving her time to really focus with one group of students. I feel the class was rushed and spotty. Really ended up teaching myself. An online class would\u2019ve been better than having to drive an hour in rush hour traffic for a 30 min to an hour class.\n\nOverall: I wanted to obtain a new skill, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll learn loads more on the job.
