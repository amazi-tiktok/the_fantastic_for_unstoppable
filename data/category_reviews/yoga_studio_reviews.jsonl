I was actually craving nutritious foods (not the norm for me, at least not to the point that I was a little disgusted by junk food) and my joints didn't ache like they had for years!!  Hmmm...what was this??? As I listened to the instructors explain the benefits of the tourniquet created by many of the postures I could see how the increased blood flow following the release of the postures, to my body was actually helping/healing!!  That first class was about 3 years ago now and I'm hooked!  It has literally changed my life!\nKate Jenkins is a fabulous owner/curator of yoga...the facility is aesthetically pleasing, comfortable and is always kept in pristine condition (which is no easy chore with all of those sweaty bodies around!)

They are currently doing renovations/improvements on items that need it. In my opinion, they are not OVERLY nice and they are not rude. They are polite, professional and basically just a \"no bullsh*t\" gym. They have the most workout equipment I've seen in any gym of Mobile.

It started off pretty good and then it went down here, but I blame corporate for that. Back when they first opened, they were charging $55 a month for this place which at the time, made sense because all the equipment was new and they have four and five of the exact same machine; ensuring that no matter what you did, you always had a free machine. However, as the equipment started to crack & deteriorate, it has not been maintained right. That was too much to charge so people left and now you can start off here for about $34 a month.\n\nApparently, the owners don't like this because they shut down the smoothie shop. They've closed off a lot of the rooms that we used to be able to go in and use and multitude of requests have been put in to fix certain equipment that never gets around to being fixed. They just got weight pins because people kept taking weight pins out of some machines to use them in others and we had to beg for about a month to get that. The yoga room used to be open to me where I could go in and use the exercise balls (because the ladies only room has only one ball and it is severely deflated.) I never messed up the room, but others did and now everyone else is being punished and is not allowed to use the room, but our dollars pay for the equipment. No one seems to know where a damn air pump is so they can inflate their own balls. It's ridiculous. If you going to the theater room, there is a graveyard of broken equipment and that they refused to fix or replace. They also have torn up machines in the food court and in the rooms that the clientele don't normally frequent. Why keep it if it's broken and you don't want to fix it?\n\nTo add insult to injury, we have to pay a $40 fee once a year for the equipment, but a lot of this equipment looks like it hasn't been changed out in years. To literally lock away a room full of equipment from members who haven't messed it up is wrong. Meanwhile, they have a set of high school kids that come in here tearing up the equipment all the time and being loud and using slurs that everybody has literally complain about, yet they are allowed to continue working out here. All of the quality Equipment is sealed off in some room somewhere while everyone else is left to use what's left.\n\nThere are ants in the ladies sauna that I ask the boys to tell the head girl about so it could be taken care of. They never told her and I had to tell her myself. I ended up getting bitten and I have welts on my arms from the ant bites. It has been about 4 days since I told someone about it and it still hasn't been taken care of. The manager here is really cool, but he doesn't move unless corporate gets involved.\n\nFurthermore, they won't stop hiring college kids to work here and they're not paying them all that much so they're simply not going to do the job. On the weekends, they work out on the clock  when they don't think they're going to get caught. Trash is overflowing in the restrooms, dirt is on the floor and a lot of the equipment is jammed up when you try to use it. They don't regularly check the paper towels towels or anything. There are far too many $10 a month gyms running around here for this. Between Pro Health, Sportsplex and the YMCAs, I'm sure I can find somewhere else that will find equipment that is quality.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d6b22fa2ab5:0xc12047c9fedc974d"}

I travel to the Birmingham area for work once a month and was looking for a gym/box that has hours on Sunday.  I had heard some not-so-great things about a few boxes but I hadn't heard of Forge Fitness/ CF Shades.  Not only is CF Shades the only place with Sunday hours, but they were above and beyond wonderfully welcoming when I showed up unannounced during their open gym period.  Upon first glance, the gym was very clean, which is not very common among CrossFit and Crossfit-inspired facilities.  The owner, Rich, jumped up from a staff meeting and gave me a tour and after learning of my CF history, invited me to use any and all of their space as well as invited me back through my duration of stay while in town.  They have an awesome workout space out back with a platform, squat racks and a rig and the running course around the building is super safe.  I also met coaches Caleb, Josh and Rebecca who were all very accommodating and friendly.  When I returned for a class, Rebecca coached and I really appreciated her attentiveness.  I'm a CrossFit coach in Denver and because I move relatively well, I tend to get left alone - but I love being coached when I drop into new places and Rebecca was great.

The forms asked for all of the exact information (emergency contact, address, experience with yoga...) that had been filled out extensively on the online form, but she made it out to be that I was neglecting a step and trying to casually sidle in late. There were only six or so people in the class, and the manager's lecturing brought me into class about 1 minute late. She reminded me as I went in that \"this is Huntsville; it's different.\" My address lists that I am from Chattanooga, and I don't know if she was trying to make some comment about the caliber and status of clientele attending Huntsville studios as opposed to Chattanoooga ones, or not... but I can say that I am much more impressed with every Chattanooga studio I've been to than this one, which just left a bad taste in my mouth with its snobbery :/ The class was completely unremarkable, sadly.

I joined this gym and after going five times did not feel like it was the right fit for me, and did not like going to a gym without staff at night. When I contacted Daniel at the gym and asked if I could cancel I was told my only options were to pay a $150 or finish out the contact without using the gym if I did not like it. He said it did not matter that I had only been a member for less than a two weeks. So beware they do not offer a trial period - join and if you do not like it pay their fee.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a4b3874e27:0x627f367f072cb79b"}
