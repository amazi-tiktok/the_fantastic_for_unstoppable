It has been in a clean, dry upscale condo for its short life.  About 2 months ago the fake leather of this chair began to peel and show the cloth underneath.  Understanding that the chair is not under warranty I called Coco Island Furniture and asked for the item to be repaired at my expense.  I was told that the manufacturer no longer produces this color and even if it were repaired it would cost more than simply buying a new chair.\nThe problem is that a new chair costs $700, and this one costs $700 also.  You can take this review ever how you want, but I'm the type of person that believes a recliner should last at least 10 years, especially if i spent $700 on it.  Others may disagree with me, but I think that 3.5 years of life from a barely used recliner is far from enough.\nFor the record, I gave Coco Island plenty of time to respond before posting this review.  Apparently Coco Island is fine with leaving me left with a screwed up recliner that is just over 3 years old, so this review is my last resort.  I won't be shopping at Coco Island Furniture ever, ever again.

I paid them a deposit of $250. As of today, the work has not been delivered. It was promised 10 days after payment. As of today, they are 100 days past due. I posted an honest review on their Facebook page, starting off by saying I hoped I could change it to a positive review in the near future. They changed their Facebook template to not allow reviews so mine could no longer be seen. They always say they are working on my plan and they will have something in a few days. Then I don't hear from them and nothing is ever delivered. Their Facebook page has photos they post- and therefore imply that the work depicted is their own. Through reverse photo look up I found photos they had \"lifted\" from other sites and I contacted the owners. Indeed they did not have permission to use the photos and it was not their work. When I tagged the owners in the misused photos they were promptly deleted from the Elaine Roberts drafters Facebook page. One of the owners of the business from which they had plagiarized the photos of others' work, did know Jimmy Parker - one of the owners of Elaine Roberts Drafters. He told me specifics of how the owner (Jimmy) of Elaine Roberts Drafters worked for him previously and had stolen from him, and described him as one of the biggest con-men he has encountered. Perhaps occasionally they deliver a product enough to keep up an image, I don't know, but after my own experience and what I heard from Jimmy Parker's previous employer, I sure wouldn't trust him with my money again!\n\nAlso look at their other reviews.

If they want something, they\u2019ll ask me then buy it.\u201d The ONLY information we were given was about looking online and a RH book when we got ready to leave because I couldn\u2019t take it any longer.

We had seen print ads for Summer Classics but had never really known much about the product.  Fortunately Cynthia was working the day we visited the showroom.  She was very knowledgeable about the different collections, and quickly gained our trust.  She has a very positive attitude and it is apparent she loves what she does and is very invested in her customer relationships.  We spent almost two hours with her and never expended her patience.  After listening to us and showing us many collections, we decided on the Newport Collection.   While expensive, Cynthia showed us the quality of design and construction of the Summer Classics products;  and we proceeded to order a sofa, two chairs, two ottomans, two side tables, a coffee table, and multiple pillows and bolsters.   Several weeks later we called Cynthia for another Summer Classic solution.  We needed two window bench cushions and she solved the problem immediately, ordering two custom dimension cushions with a Sunbrella fabric unique to Summer Classics!   Cynthia is a \u201crock star\u201d and I have recommended her to friends.   She is a great asset to Summer Classics and we look forward to working with her in the future for further outdoor furniture needs.  I highly recommend her!

My family and I are very please with the out come of our flooring. Kellie Reese was my sale rep and she was so welcoming and helpful. Her crew was thorough and sufficient. I was told it would take 2 to 3 days to complete the job, it took only 1 day. How great was that especially since it was close to the holidays and I needed the floors done before Christmas.
