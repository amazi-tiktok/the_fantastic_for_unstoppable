We were forwarded here by our pediatrician and i called a month and a half ahead to make our appointment. Our appointment was scheduled for 3:15pm and I showed up at 2:45pm to complete all of the neccessary paperwork. My husband and two kids, 3years and 10months showed up at 3:15. We waited and waited and waited. We were not seen until 4:30 (now mind you their office closes at 5pm). However I constantly see the doctor and her nurses talking and giggling at a computer in the hallway. So after finally being called in the nurse does some little eye tests and dialates my sons eyes. While waiting i spoke with another mother that said her duaghter was there for her appointment at that was at 4pm. We are then sent out to the waiting room and wait another 20min for them to pull us into the room to see the Doctor. So after being called into the room we again waited and waited and waited. We sait in there for 45MIN!!!! Now it is 5:45pm and my two children are hungry, tired and are frustrated at having to look at walls. So we finally looked out of the room to find out that the ENTIRE Office Staff had left and the doctor was in another room with the little girl whose appointment was at 4pm which was after my son's. When the Doctor FINALLY made her appearance she said my son was fine and we could go!!! 3 HOURS to tell us he was fine! Now mind you on the paper work they sent it said to prepare for a 30min appointment! This was by far the WORST experience we have EVER had and will NEVER return!

I normally see either Dr. Harris or Dr. Jackson. On this visit I was seen by Doctor Fredrick Jackson and it was a truly amazing experience. Everyone was extremely courteous and friendly. I was really impressed with Dr. Jackson on this occasion. He took his time explaining everything he was doing and why he was doing it. His explanations and genuine concern went a long way in putting my fears to rest. He not only took an interest in my eye health, but he was also very forthcoming with sharing some possible solutions to other areas of my overall health that could potentially affect my eye health. He offered some possible solutions to help with bouts of vertigo I have been experiencing for a couple of years now. He suggested some things that I could try to help to minimize the severity of the migraine headaches that I have been suffering for more than thirty years. No one else had ever made the suggestions to me that he did. I can't wait to put them into practice to see if they will help even the tiniest little bit. Thanks, Dr. Jackson, for one of the most enjoyable appointments I have ever had. And trust me, I will make sure that you are highly recommended to everyone that I know who needs a good optometrist. Keep up the good work.\n\nHad my yearly exam on February 4, 2015 and must say that it was a very interesting experience. Even though the wait time was a few minutes past my appointment time, I clearly understand why. The doctors spend as much time as needed with each patient and I realize that I will get the same type of treatment when it is my turn. Also, Dr. Harris' staff are extremely kind, considerate, and compassionate. I just love Dr. Harris to death (no offense Dr. Jackson, I love you, too). Even though he informed me that I have cataracts, he took the time to explain all of my options and shared his experiences with his father's surgery. I left the office feeling very good and felt that Dr. Harris had provided me with all the information that I needed to make a decision. Once I made the decision, he even scheduled an appointment for me--talk about the personal touch approach. I would highly recommend Primary Eyecare Associates to anyone. As a matter of fact, my entire family uses Primary Eyecare Associates. So, if you are looking for a good eye care center and optometrist, give them a call, THEY ARE THE BEST I have ever used.

I am very disappointed in my \"very short\" visit with Dr. Rosenstiel and staff. (Well I didn't even meet Dr. Rosenstiel???!) Being that I live in Montgomery, I have to request a day off for ALL my eye appointment visits.  I am not new to UAB Callahan Eye Hospital as I've had multiple surgeries within the last three years there. As a matter of fact I just had an appointment there two weeks ago with the incredible Dr. Priscilla Fowler and staff.   I've been diagnosed with Kerataconus and Dr. Priscilla Fowler is my primary eye doctor.  Dr. Fowler and staff are some of the nicest people I've met in the eye care industry. Earlier this year and this past month I received the Cross-Linking  procedure.  I spent over $6000 within the last three years at Callahan eye.  Dr. Fowler and staff treat me with respect on EVERY visit,  yet on December 10 with Dr. Rosenstiel and staff I felt the lesser of.  This visit was scheduled to replace my old sclera lenses with new.  You would think before my arrival they would've did their research on my condition.  Upon my arrival in the room, Dr. Rosenstiel's nurse asked if I ever had sclera lenses?? (I'VE HAD SCLERA CONTACTS FOR THE LAST 6 YEARS??) From there, he goes straight into and I quote, \"before we even see you, you have to pay X amount of dollars!?. Furthermore, he adds, \"The Lenses will be an additional $XXXX.XX amount of dollars to get them?   Now at this point I was feeling as though they did not want to help me as Dr. Fowler and staff did you for the last couple of years.?  Now do mind you I've already spent thousands of dollars to get my eyes corrected.  The money is not an option, but I felt inferior to his demands.  I also wondered have they even looked in my charts from previous visits.? \"Have they even checked my insurance\" I thought to myself?  At that point I asked him a series of questions in terms of verifying my insurances and deductibles. To no avail he says nothing will be covered. Now as I mentioned money would not be a concern as I've spent a lot of money to fix my Eye disease. ( As well as the removal of an tumor in my eyelid two years prior ).  More questions came to mind in this parlay with Dr. Rosenstiel's nurse.  At this point I felt that the nurse is trying to rush me so he leaves then comes back with a business card and prices on it. He then states, \" if you have any questions please call Melissa\" on the business card. I agreed and proceeded to leave. Upon leaving, I felt very embarrassed to even be there. I rushed out and got in my car. I kept thinking to myself \"have they even check my insurance\". So I called my wife, and she confirmed we do have Eye insurance.  I decided I needed to call them back to confirm and verify with them that I have insurance, the same insurance I've used last three years. Two calls later and one left message, I still have not heard from Melissa, Dr. Rosenstiel , or the male nurse that was talking to me. I never even got to meet Dr. Rosenstiel??? I will still come up to visit Dr. Fowler but I will do my business elsewhere in finding new Sclera lenses!\nVery disappointing!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bea1d7b458b:0x2741eb9855e3054"}

I also had to bring my glasses back as the lens were cracked and when I got them back, they were not the same as the first ones.  I had paid extra for the top of the line with all of the add ons and when I got the \"fixed ones\" back, these were not added to the lenses.  Very disappointed also that if you call close to 5pm, they never answer the phone.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889badbf94081c6b:0x4f3c6da5ce8f1c70"}

Unfortunately the dentist doesn't seem like he should be working with children.

The first visit (for a pulled tooth) the dentist eventually stopped and gave him another shot, after which he was fine. This 2nd time, we were told we were the ONLY patients in the office, but the dentist seemed inconvenienced to even come in the room,  didn't say 2 words to me and acted in a rush to leave. He started a filling and my son raised his hand and made noises to let him know he could feel it, but the dr kept going and told the nurses \"He's fine.\" Then when my son finally jumped & grabbed his hand, he got aggravated and said to refer us to a pediatric dentist to be sedated. Very rudely made a point to say he wasn't even touching his teeth when he jumped. He didn't even offer to give him another shot or try to comfort him/talk to him about what he was feeling. My son is 11, knows what he can feel & has never had this problem with other dentists. :( I am very disappointed that an office so heavily geared towards children & close to home, has such an impatient & unkind dentist.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889badbf94081c6b:0x4f3c6da5ce8f1c70"}

He have a very professional staff and they are always ready to say or do something to make you comfortable. I was in the office about two weeks ago to get a permanent crown on a tooth that I had gotten a crown on about three years ago. Dr. Hankinson replaced that crown because he said that he felt that it should have last longer than that. I did not go in to received a free crown, I thought he could cement the old crown in considering that it was still pretty, but he insist on doing another one free of charge. You really don't see that kind of act of kindness today. He is a remarkable young man and he is very attentive with every patients. I have recommended many people to him and I will continue to do so, and he is VERY SMART. Please check out that SEMMES LOCATIO lt is beautiful.

Glasses were the right decision and something we can address early before she attends school. She is great about keeping them on! We bought them from the optical place at 20/20 and had them bend the ear pieces so that they fit comfortably around her ear instead of on top of them.\n\nI also go to Dr. Young.

The doctor fit me for new contacts despite me insisting that I had just been given an updated prescription by my eye doctor at home a few months prior. I also emphasized that I had 3 months' supply of contacts at home and was NOT looking to buy new ones. The doctor told me that was fine and that she would just write me a new prescription in case I wanted to update my lenses. This was after her asking me what my old prescription was and me telling her what I THOUGHT it was, emphasizing that I was pretty sure the prescription I had at home was much stronger than the numbers I could remember. Please keep in mind that I am young and inexperienced in the medical field and basically just moved through my appointment (which was supposed to only be a check-up on the blood vessels in my eyes) basically nodding along to whatever the doctor and the staff said because I know NOTHING about this stuff. When I get up to the front counter to pay they informed me that I owed $100 for the contact fitting that I DID NOT ASK FOR and that even the doctor explained to me wasn't entirely necessary because she told me I could one day use the updated prescription she wrote me if I wanted to. Ended up going home, letting my dad call them (because they would not listen to me at check out) and ultimately making my way back to the office for a refund of the $100. The entire time I'm there for the refund, an older lady who was not in any sort of medical attire (she looked like a patient) harassed me telling me I was not fit to drive with my old prescription, she could get me in trouble, etc. She stood over me badgering me while I removed the contacts that the doctor sent me home with and returned the prescription the doctor wrote me to her.

Trust me you won\u2019t be disappointed. I\u2019d give 100 stars but Google won\u2019t let me. Thanks Dr Marc Michelson and your professional caring staff. Don\u2019t put it off if you seeking Lasik Surgery he is the answer.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891771d5bc1327:0xa9b2514c31329e4c"}

I began my LASIK search with another eye care provider. It did not occur to me that I would be rejected as a candidate, until the optometrist (not surgeon) noted a callus due to chronic contact use and subsequently rejected me. Thankfully my husband suggested Michelson where the doctor that would be performing surgery approved me. Dr. Michelson\u2019s years of experience and expertise allowed him to see the callus was not a structural part of my eye and would not prohibit my benefiting from LASIK. Having a one on one with Dr. Michelson prior to the day of surgery was invaluable for me. The staff was very attentive and I felt as though I was in the care of a very competent work family. I felt informed and reassured throughout the process including during the surgery itself. No more foggy glasses, no more keeping a contact schedule or burning scratchy contacts. I would definitely recommend investing in a better quality of life through Michelson Laser.\nThanks to Michelson Laser my vision improved from relying on a -6.5 prescription to 20/15 in less than 24 hours!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891771d5bc1327:0xa9b2514c31329e4c"}

I could kick myself for not having lasik done sooner! I am 51 years old and as I have gotten older, I began having more trouble with wearing contacts.  I could only wear them for a few hours before they would cause my eyes to get very dry, red and irritated.  Because of this, I reverted back to wearing glasses which I really didn't want to have to do but felt like I had no choice.  I was near-sighted, which meant that I had no significant problems seeing up close, but couldn't see things very clearly at a distance. About 15 years earlier, a supervisor of mine had lasik and mentioned that he had done an extensive amount of research on it and would be having Dr. Michelson perform his surgery. I kept Dr. Michelson's name tucked away in my memory and said that if I ever had it done, he would be the one that would do it.  I made the call to Michelson Laser Vision and couldn't get over how easily it all fell together after that call.  I went to my first appoinment and had several super-quick tests to see if I could actually qualify for lasik.  Margaret and Lauren ran the tests, then Margaret sat down with me and  told me that I qualified for the procedure. They were both great about taking the time to explain the tests and what to expect on the day of the surgery.  I was so excited to hear this news because my eyesight was so bad in one eye and I also have a history of diabetes in my family which I thought would completely rule me out for the surgery. Dr. Michelson asked me if  his daughter,Jennifer Michelson, M.D., who is also a practicing opthalmologist/cataract and laser eye surgeon there at the clinic,could perform the lasik surgery under his supervision. She has done many, many of these surgeries  and is very well qualified just as her father. I agreed, came in a few days later and had the procedure done  which only took about one minute to perform and I was in the office for about an hour total.  There was absolutely no pain involved and I didn't have any trouble whatsoever after the surgery.  The next day I was seeing perfectly with 20/15 vision in my eye that had before not been able to make out huge letters on the eye chart! I was sold! I drove to my appointment that very morning after surgery and  was driving and taking kids to cross-country practice that day as well. To be able to see so clearly things like car tag numbers, street signs and other things at a distance without the use of any kind of corrective lenses was so incredible!

He has at least for now saved my vision from glaucoma disease which he says is a serious condition for me. I have attempted to thank him for this several times now while in his exam room.\n\nHowever, at one laser treatment at the nearby Surgicare center, I unexpectedly had severe pain from the treatment. When I stood up I think I was partially in shock. It was like wasps stinging my eye! The center was very busy that day and I suspected, just my guessing, that a long wait had caused the deadening drops in my eyes to wear off some. On the next scheduled treatment I asked him again about this to make sure I knew what was coming. His answer was more technical in nature and less about the fact that his patient had been hurting so much. The actual cause to me was not really the point. Much more important was to try to avoid such as this in the future, if possible. Perhaps it was unavoidable I don't know. He did not inform me. He said that at the earlier time that he had had to use a stronger laser strength setting. That is, my diagnosis of the pain cause was incorrect!  As if i really cared about my being right!  Whatever the causation, I would like to be warned about the possible discomfort and perhaps given more pain lessening drops?\n\nOn my very first surgery on my left eye for both cataracts and glaucoma, one of the nurses had accidentally left a sheet of plastic over my nose somehow. DrBall was asking me why I was  squirming so much while he was operating? I said because I cannot breathe. The nurse then removed the plastic, saying somewhat rudely I thought, something like, I hope you're satisfied now! I did not appreciate this attitude & comment for it was a real problem for me not being able to breathe, as it most certainly would have been for this nurse as well! The location of this again was at the Surgicare site of course.\n\nBut these problems pale in comparison to the help the doctor has given me.\n\n( I would suggest for surveys expected to be done by eye doctor patients, that you make your display screen  characters in the survey larger and bolder so that I & others can read them better! I think the very best doctors, nurses, surveyors, and technicians are able to somehow put themselves in the position of the patient as if they were the patients.)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d8d1a0bea3b:0x636e1b8b40014064"}

He had picked out the black on black plastic Ray Ban frames.  The staff stated that it would take 2 weeks for his frames to come in so he had to go without glasses which contributed to him having major headaches.  They stated they would call me once they came in to come and pick them up.  I had to call them 3 separate times and physically go into the office and ask if they had come in yet for me to finally get my son's glasses, only to realize that they were the wrong frames.   He has been wearing the wrong frames for the last 3 weeks b/c he couldn't go a day longer without glasses due to his headaches. The staff there stated they would order the correct frames which should only take a week..... I have called the Mobile office 6 separate times (last call was Friday November 1, 2019)  with the response of, \"I don't know what you\u2019re talking about, can you repeat what is going on again?\" and with \"I don't see any frames for the name of ****** here for pick up\"..... with no resolution.  I have drove up there 3 separate times, the last time being yesterday, November 4, 2019, and a member of the staff sat there and pulled my son's frames out of her desk drawer and stated, \"well, they're right here\"... with attitude and with a disgusted look on her face that clearly showed that she was bothered with having to even deal with the situation.  I then asked how long they have had the correct frames there because I NEVER received a phone call to advise me that they were there for pick up.  Their response was, \" I don't know\"...... They stated they needed the glasses off my son's face before they would give me the correct glasses for him to wear and attempted to take them off his face right there.  I told them they were not taking the glasses off of my son's face and we are leaving with his new glasses that we had paid for. They then stated i would have to call management to try to resolve the issue and they just sat there without giving me the name and number of the person I needed to talk to.  I had to ask them for that information directly.   Needless to say, I left the office yesterday, yet again, empty handed because they never gave me the glasses that we originally ordered and paid for.

The staff was unbelievably rude and poorly trained. I went up to talk to the receptionist, she shooshed me, asked me if I didn't see her talking on the phone, and then closed the glass. I had an appointment at 9:30, but didn't get in until 11:00. When I did make it back to the office, they told me we would have to wait an hour and a half for my son's eyes to dilate. If this was the case, then why didn't they do that while we were already waiting. All in all, they expected me to be there for over 3 hours for an exam that might take 10 minutes.\n\nThe Daphne branch and Providence branches are just as bad. In Daphne, the doctors told me my eyes are getting better and I needed a weaker prescription. I asked them how was that possible since I have had glasses for 30 years and they stay pretty much the same or get maybe slightly worse. I thought that was just common sense, but I thought I could trust them. When I got my glasses back, they made my eyes cross. The staff told me that was because I needed a few days to adjust to the new prescription. After a few days, nothing. I took them back, got a new pair and the same thing happened again. It took them 3 tries before they could correct the problem.\n\nLike I said, I have been wearing glasses for over 30 years, lived all around the US, and have never had a problem.

Which he sent me to Dr. Mitchell @ Maynor and Mitchell Eye Center.  Dr. Mitchell removed my cataracts in both eyes.  He is very professional with great ethics, my surgery was done and in appx 2 hours, and he sends you to lunch, then returned back at his office at 12:00(**that was my time, it may be different for other patients **) .  He likes to Ck and see the eye to make sure surgery went good and no complications.  I have been in glasses since I was 10 years old, with the cataracts removed from both eyes I am now seeing 20/10 and 20/15 in my eyes! I was so much the colors of things were so different, so vibrant and pretty.I no longer did not have halos, I realized they were only one thing I  was looking at, which was a good thing. I did not know what to think it took a minute for my brain to comprehend that I no longer needed glasses to see distance.\nI will always have to wear glasses to read, but I am amazed at the quality of work and how How easy it was to have the surgery to see just how things look, how clear I could see things, without having to wear contacts or glasses not to mention developing and having cataracts.. I was told by my regular doctor;  Dr.  Vandiver in Athens, Having cataract surgery is almost 100% correction; where optional Lasix surgery to correct far vision is only temporary and Then you have to wear glasses or contacts or are to have Lasix to be re-done , usually in 10-20 years.  I was never able to afford having the Lasix surgery (because it is considered a cosmetic surgery) so I wore contacts and glasses all my life!  When I developed cataracts I did not understand why I could not see In my correction glasses/ contacts that I was used to wearing.  When Dr. Mitchell done my surgery, let me REMIND you it was in and out, within four hours I was seeing (almost ) perfect, I had very minimal swelling and the next day at my check up (Dr. Vandiver) My swelling was almost completely down, which even amazed my regular eye doctor. Dr. Vandiver , even helped me out with some really expensive eye drops by giving me a couple of samples( with my RX INSURANCE COST ME $70.00 out of pocket.) I found Dr. Mitchell to be very professional, caring, and very informative.  He is not one of the doctors that just does the work and then rushes you out of his office. He took his time, he done the job, and he made sure my eyes were healthy before he discharged me.  Dr.  Mitchell did NOT PROMISE ME THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO GET TO A PERFECT EYE SIGHT\u2026\u2026however, even though he did not promise he did tell me that he would do his best for me to see clearly, Now I can perfect better than perfect (in MY OPINION) I could not be any help happier!  I Highly, highly recommend\nDr. Mitchell\u2019s service. He will take care of you no matter what your circumstances are!!\nTHANKS TO DR. MITCHELL NO MORE EXPENSIVE PROGRESSIVE LENSES OR EXPENSIVE CONTACTS, even if he did not promise that, he done a great job with the surgery, and my eyes are brighter, and healthier!\u2026. I would do it all again 100 times over. Thank you Dr. Mitchell and  to your team!.\n\nMrs. Pruitt", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cccfd39e9b9:0x9bbcddc496fcb23"}
