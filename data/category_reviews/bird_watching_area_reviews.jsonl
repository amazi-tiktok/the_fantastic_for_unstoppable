She got an attitude with me and said, \"Thanks for letting me know. I waited for you for over an hour.\" I then informed her that I had tried to call and she didn't answer. I did not bother to mention that she wasted an hour of my time and the gas that I used to drive to her disappointment of a trailer park that she is trying to pass off as a campground.
