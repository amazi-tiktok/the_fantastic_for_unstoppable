Im a chef my self and when i took one bit of my fuegos \"famous\" taco i spit it out. The little itty bitty porportion of steak i was given was completely burnt. Charred burnt. We odered 4 of them and every single one was like this and the tortilla it self was not warmed in any way before serving it to a customer. Also we odered a salsa verde and it came out more like a soup verde. The chips given for this green soup were not warmed in any way either. So yeah its a great hangout spot for uab people and students. maybe a good spot for a few drinks but DO NOT EAT THERE. Their kitchen staff needs a serious upgrade.And when i brought it up to the manager she did not offer any retured services for the food being so disgusting except remake the tacos and they came back out just as bad. She also blamed the reason the salsa looked liked soup was because they were not supposed to sell it but one of the mexicans in the kitchen cant speak english. Her words not mine. You get what you pay for on those 2 dollar tacos. Taco bell would have been more appetizing. I run a kitchen that holds a way higher capacity and this place couldnt handle 30 people inside their restraunt. If it wasnt in smack middle of 5 points birmingham nobody would eat there guaranteed. If your in the area try blackmarket or makarios. And what kind of mex-tex restraunt doesnt serve chips and salsa free?", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc488637a67:0xe3eadfc170210835"}

On top of the fact a TV Mexican dinner would have been more appetizing and less hassle. We ordered, our food and one beer. A different server brought the beer and had two, we explained we only ordered one. When food was brought to table by another  server. We waited for our server to bring us silverware, by the time I decided to get it myself our food was cold. My husband asked for tea from each server that came to our table and I asked for tea when I requested silverware. I had to go find tea pitcher myself. No one asked if they could help, and when we where done and wondering if we were going to get our Check. Our server showed up, my husband explained,  no everything was not okay. We had to get our on silverware, our on drinks. Her response was not, apologetic at all. Her response was well we had a large party. I saw the other patrons in the restaurant, while I was getting our silverware and my husband\u2019s tea. There is no excuse, for poor service. We had to wait at cash register, until I waved a waiter down and told him I had a list of complaints but all I would like to do is pay my bill. When the hostess came to the register with a attitude, she tried to charge us for the two beers. We both told her, one we had one beer. Along with our other experience. She left the register, then came back with the original bill we were given by our so called server. The cashier was rude and had an attitude on top of that. So to sum up our experience the food was bad, the service was bad, and the restrooms were nasty. I would not recommend this place, it is obvious they do not care about quality. The booth behind us, were not served more than chips and drinks, they left. A table across from us had to get their on silverware also.

The people who ordered before me had time to eat and leave and be gone for 5 min before I got my food. The entire wait for my food there were 2 toddlers running around the dine in area screaming. It appeared that the cashier was babysitting this toddlers. She kept leaving the register to tend to them and give them drinks. That was very unacceptable. I ordered this for dine in but after being in the restaurant for 20 min I was tired of hearing 2 kids screaming and running around I asked them to give me the food to go. I get back to work to eat and the quesadilla was not properly cooked and just fell apart. I will never go back. And as an engineer I hope fast food workers are replaced with efficient equipment.

It was chock full of avocado goodness - creamy just ripe avocados. Yum-My. We each ordered 3 tacos de tripas (no photo) and it was so good...just how I like them. A little crisp on the edges and chewy inside, a nice clean flavor. We will definately stop by when in the area. \u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUooFDuKpVJtQSCGR8u92rSDzWym2RZ6TBiCbO=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORG_vgsC76QTd_TFF6wcol8vL1pK2R8NhnWdia=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889226b3af452f1:0x90a87528ad9a7f4"}

The orange sauce had a bit of a sour off flavor and was too much vinegar for my taste, speaking as someone who does like vinegar based sauces. The brown salsa was better, with a smoky flavor. But honestly I didn't like any of their salsas that much, and preferred to eat the tacos with just salt. The Pastor was our favorite, with the Asada being our least favorite.

I asked the waitress if I could order the chile relleno as a vegetarian dish and she recommended queso fresco. I asked about lard and pork fat in the beans and she realized that they are not vegetarian and offered to double the rice instead. Queso fresco is not as fatty and gooey and was a recommendation I will use in the future.\nThe breading on the chile relleno was soft, not crisp as hoped for, but all in all tasted good. Pico de Gallo came in a small taco shell (cute) but was placed on top of iceberg salad reducing the amount of Pico de Gallo significantly. The rice was cooked perfectly and when mixed with the salsa that came with the chips, a really enjoyable side. I like my food spicy and was disappointed that there was no hot sauce on the table or fresh Jalapeno on the plate.\nStill, I would have given 4 stars but $13 for a fried chile with rice felt a bit steep.

This was sadly the highlight of the visit here.\n\nWhen trying new Mexi-joints... i generally like to to go with a classic Nacho dish (Nachos Supremos in this case). Ehhh... Though not as large, a Nachos Bel Grande from Taco Bell would have been a bit tastier. The nacho dish was served on a large plate, and seemed a bit pre-pepared and popped in the oven... here's why I say that:\n\n1. Food came out in about 5 minutes flat (if not less)\n2. The plate itself and food on the bottom was hot along with singed edges on chips, while food on top was literally cold\n3. Lettuce and veggies were not only cold, they were a bit wet as if rinsed right before refrigerating\n\nSo you agree? Pretty obvious right? Along with this, I like to eat my nachos with a fork... everything all mixed together. In this case, that's a good thing. If were to eat my nachos chip by chip, I'd be disappointed. Meat and chips on the bottom of the dish, and lettuce covering the entire top of the dish. In between these two layers were 3 separate \"piles\" of beans, cheese and sour creme. Really? Melted cheese only in 1 section of my NACHOS???

It comes with corn or flour tortillas, lime wedges,  onion and cilantro topping, and an awesome habanero sauce with a ramekin of habanero relish****. Cant go wrong. Trust me.\nThe pork chops and the grilled chicken(not the half chicken but the marinated breast) are amazing. They also serve a grilled steak, tomato, and onion plate(get it Mexican style) that the flavor of a perfectly seasoned grilled steak just bursts through and marries with the onion and tomato.\nI know this is hard to believe but even their rice is better than any others out there. It's not bland and red but it is ACTUALLY seasoned!\nIn the mood for a margarita? Don't bother with the regular margaritas but go straight for the Texas style. Made with fresh limes and tequila that will quench your thirst.\nAs you might be able to tell, I'm a regular to this place. The service is always great and my kids love to go anytime to get authentic Mexican. Last but not least, just about anytime I'm here there are always Mexican patrons.

This is why:     {1} About a year ago, my brother, mom, and I ate there for dinner. We had a total of 3 orders of salsa, yet they decided to charge us for salsa because they said we had 7 among us 3, and only one per person is complementary. This was the first time they had ever mentioned this rule, and they neglected our proof that we had only 3, making us pay for something we didn't use. Also, they neglected to tell us this before writing our receipt.     {2} In a large coupon book we purchased, we found a coupon for a buy one get one free dinner plate for this place with the purchase of a drink (the requirement of getting a drink was in fine print). We went there with a group of 10 people, and we had 5 coupons. We decided to have 2 people per bill so that we could use the coupons. Unaware that water didn't count as a drink, the manager refused to allow us to use the coupons, even though we offered to get drinks or pay for drinks we didn't want to drink. After that, they told us that we couldn't use the coupon even if we did buy drinks because we were sitting at the same table even though we had separate checks, which wasn't a requirement listed on the coupon.     {3} My family is strictly vegetarian. On Wednesday nights, they have a buy one entree get another free deal with certain restrictions. Because none of the options were solely vegetarian, my mother and I had replaced a beef burrito with one with vegetables inside for a $0.75 charge for the substitution. This is what we had done for years now, yet today they refused to allow for this change. Apparently, these changes wouldn't be allowed because \"it's too similar to a dish [Vegetarian Burrito] that's not included in the deal.\" We offered to pay as much as it would cost to buy a Vegetarian Burrito, yet they still refused. We even talked to  manager who knows us pretty well for going there over the years and told him how this is what we've done for years, yet he told us that to his knowledge, they weren't allowed to do that in the first place. Literally sounded like he was making up some random stories.          ~So as you can tell, this place neglected the fact that we were usual customers and treated us poorly, making up false regulations with no explanation and trying to overcharge us. We seemed to overlook 1 and 2 because the food was worth it, but there comes a point where their bad service reflects on the goodness of their food. Plus, what's a decent meal without good service no matter how the food tastes? Isn't the customer always right? Not at Amigo's! So do yourself a favor: save your money. Going to Taco Bell is even better than wasting your time here.~", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889226b7915378d:0x1a60ed1d57a970f2"}

We reminded the waitress multiple times that we had ordered and still took forever. Meanwhile we watched 3 or 4 tables come in, eat, and leave. When we finally received our food, it was wrong.\n\n2)We hadn't eaten here for a couple weeks given the experience listed above, but yet again we decided to give this place the benefit of the doubt. But instead of going and eating inside, we ordered it to go. I repeated myself to the hostess on the phone about the way that i wanted my food, so right away i had a sneaking suspicion that i needed to check my food before i left. Of course when i arrived the food was wrong, so she apologized and took the food back to \"remake\" it. Twenty seconds later she comes back with my food, and i knew it was too quick to \"remake\" it. When i arrived home i saw that all she did was pick some of the stuff out and throw it back in the old tortillas.\n\nUnfortunately there is not many Mexican restaurants in the area to choose from, so we got to make do.

Not the usual spice pizazz I am used to from traditional Mexican fare.\nI got a spice kick from the salsa that came with the chips though.\nMy overall feeling is that we spent too much for the meal, but Debbie was delightful and accommodating and made a killer margarita.\nI will probably return one day when in the area, but stick to the lunch specials which are cheaper but not as flexible in choice selection.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFUCuE-_hikWB4i8XgjdUh390yZLVozTqudi6l=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwrXT-uKk1kT_vn2oIVL9V4kADbpoLls037ioK=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuyrYdPpxqJ63KJDdJnggR0beeyjTroE5SvNXe=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpCBmpsrPlLK005K-a8PvzEIsBqXqLsqWy-Hyf=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNObN_7hbz0H0wV1kZxGTLAuiXlDil6i9OFdjb9=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDGT2mX_Gng2EKZacqun3w-gck-PV8VnAs5S1V=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNly82zgLIRUpTWqD_Oxpk0aS2gFFE8Qrug7S7M=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuASyuX63HTLZU8H4Pv_JpaA-IIbWIZkU70sdi=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOj6iIjN0gIaObQblWKqdOhKyChE-CfOXOOs-y9=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNt9wr65zJF-xx6Nz5ssTQ5eEK_aMtIGKPcvTcA=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1bzZDIPZBXVJfXTae8ZVBreGo-W6Gpbh8b48F=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMv0PFyiWFBpxQPDauh-tqjU_xE5gL1QGSlJCKd=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1623352719544, "text": "Chris, thanks for trying us out while you were in town!

First time there with family and will not return or recommend. My husband asked for no sour cream got some on his plate and a side of it, my sister in law ordered the fajita chicken nachos apparently the veggies are .99 extra, and they charge for chips and salsa at their own discretion. The waitress checked on us once, I had to flag down another waitress for water refills for the whole table. When we got our bills we noticed the extra charge for the veggies and 15% tip was already added. Asked about this and told too bad nothing can be done. Asked to talk to the manager, another waitress came to talk to us and said not our problem. Finally got the manger to have her tell us that she doesn't know why the other waitress came to talk to us even though that waitress said the manager sent her. Explained that when you look at the menu it says fajita chicken nachos and not that it's just the chicken and veggies are extra, she admitted the menu has mistakes and is hard to read but too bad because we're not a regular customer who understands that you'll be charged for stuff at the restaurants discretion. Customer service definitely needs to be retrained as all we were told is oh well pay your bill we don't care that you had a bad experience, that the waitress ignored the table or that she will argue with you when you say something was wrong.

Many restaurants in Fort Payne are closed on Sunday and I was struggling to find a place I wanted to go. There were multiple Mexican restaurants open but I didn't want a heavy greasy meal topped with a slab of cheese, so I was delighted to see other items on Mi Ranchito's menu.\n\nI'm not a big fan of TexMex food as my brother lives in Dallas and I've had plenty of real Mexican food, which I vastly prefer. At Mi Ranchito, I had several authentic Mexican taco fillings I'd never had before on housemade corn tortillas \u2014 and with only a scattering of cotija cheese on one of them. The food was absolutely delicious and my server was a nice young man with whom I enjoyed speaking. When I asked to take the freshly made chips and salsa with me, he offered me some salsa verde to take back to where I was staying, too.\n\nFor those of you who are fans of Tex-Mex food, they have plenty of that, too, things like burritos and chimichangas, etc. I bet they're equally delicious.\n\nAnd my whole meal, which consisted of one taco and one doblado (a double- sized taco, something new to me), unbelievably cost less than $6 excluding the generous tip I left! I highly recommend Mi Ranchito.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8861d761a1bef09d:0xb124530ca3e829a0"}

It had Vegan options and that's a plus for me,as I cannot eat meat due to a vitamin deficiency. The vegan meal I tried ( enchiladas) was very good and I was given the option of regular enchilada sauce or salsa verde. I chose salsa verde and it was awesome! My husband got the carne asada and he loved it. A plus is that their tortillas are handmade and not full of those stinky chemicals that most store bought tortillas have.\nI liked their chips,but I don't think everyone would,if they aren't accustomed to traditional Central American food. They use tortillas( handmade) ,cut them up and make chips from them,so they are thicker and crunchier. They have two sauces that are given with them. One is salsa verde( my favorite) and a tomato based homemade sauce. This restaurant hasn't been open long and it is still being decorated. The place is a Mom and Pop place and has a family type,friendly atmosphere. They do take both cash and debit/ credit cards. I will tell you that they have the absolute best Pico De Gallo in the area and I have tried them all.( They put lemon juice in their's.)  My two grown kids liked Mi Ranchito  too.
