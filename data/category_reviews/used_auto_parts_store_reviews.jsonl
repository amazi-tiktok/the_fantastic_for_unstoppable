Went in for something super simple and can put with an even bigger problem. I purchased a windshield wiper arm. It was confirmed that the arm was for the year and make of my car. I asked if I could pay extra for him to put it on and he agreed. He wasn't able to put it on claiming that it was becuase I needed a nut. I noticed that the wipers were no longer working after he tried putting it on. He claimed the wiper motor was not working. The wiper motor was working completely fine prior to him touching my car. I took it to my trusted mechanic and it was confirmed that not only did the wiper arm Hammett sold me was NOT for my year and make car, but he also tore my wiper transmission when he ripped the arm off of it. Prior to me even going to Hammett, I took it by my mechanic to confirm what was needed. It was confirmed that I only needed the arm as the wiper motor and wiper transmission were perfectly fine in great condition, I had also driven the car in the rain the day before and the wiper worked just fine. I called and text  the guy who damaged the car and sent photos and I have yet to receive a response. Do not only did i pay $40 for an arm that doesn't fit my car (Oriellys Auto Parts confirmed that the Hammett arm was likely for a 2003 not a 2008), but I also had to pay $75 for the part Hammett broke as well as $75 for a brand new arm from The dealership. This was a $40 fix that ended up costing me $190! This is a real review. I would not suggest taking your car or buying any parts from this company. The honest thing to do would have been to at the very LEAST reimburse me for the arm that didn't fit the car.

Gary happened to be in his shop and answered.  Even though he was only there for a short errand, he waited for me to bring the car by.  Though he couldn't fix it right then, he called the local rental car agency and helped me get a rental.  I went on to Florida and he conducted diagnostics and held it for the whole week.  He offered straightforward advice on the repair.  I chose to sell the car since it was older.  He had it in enough working order for me to get it to a local dealer to sell it.

Paid for it over the phone and picked it up the next day. After getting the motor in it was knocking called and talked to a lady who said owner wasn\u2019t in and he\u2019ll give me a call back, he never called me back. I called a couple days later and he answered I let him know what was going on and he said you only have a 30 day warranty, when in fact my paperwork states I had 60. Thank god I had kept the receipt. He told me I had to fill out the warranty paperwork and present receipts. Ok no problem but on the warranty form it states that the timing belt needs to be replaced, this engine has a chain. He informed me that regardless belt or chain it\u2019s all the same. Well I got some news from you buddy there not, a chain shouldn\u2019t have to be serviced under normal conditions, a belt yes I agree it does. But if the motor is knocking that has nothing to do with it. This is a fair warning for anyone purchasing from here he will not refund your money and will think of any way possible not too, and he uses the square app which makes things much harder to get a refund through your credit card. But I am happy to say after over 8 months I have received my refund and hope this guy flies out of business and really feels it.

Also, you stated an hour ago and yesterday, on the phone, that the engine had \"low compression\" on one cylinder. Now you're stating in this review it's low on 4 of the 6 cylinders?\n\nThis is where the situation became \"interesting:\" A few weeks ago a gentleman named Michael from Atlanta, GA called us. He stated that Mr. Browne was trying to sell him a used Land Cruiser engine, and Eric was advertising the engine as only having 60,000 miles on it (Eric knew 100% that our engine we sold him had over 185,000 miles.......). Michael saw our number on the invoice and deciding to check it out for himself. Michael later told me, \"I knew those low miles were too good to be true.\" A long story short,  Michael informed me that Eric was trying to sell him the motor because Eric decided not to fix his own Land Cruiser. We find it interesting that after a year the motor was supposedly finally put in and now is no good. Eric was asking for an immediate refund--no questions asked. We politely informed Eric that the engine was outside of the 90 Day Warranty he selected on checkout. Eric responded with yelling, \"you're a liar, you sell bad engines, and you do not value your customers.\"\n\nI know this reply is longer than most; however, I hope this response brings clarity to those reading this review.\n\nThank you,\n\nHeritage Auto Parts"}, "gmap_id": "0x889bba74704faf0b:0xa0468ac8e31bc397"}

Explaining all of that in the listing is really the only way we can try to curtail this as we do not have a chance to talk to you prior to a purchase being made.

I bought a used transmission from them, installed it and less than a week later the transmission is slipping heavily. No problem, returned the old one for a \"new\" one from them. Installed it and only made it around the block before it started slipping again. Frustrated I contact them for the third time about getting a WORKING transmission just to have them claim that something is wrong with the \"installer or computer in the car\".\nJust to note, both transmissions were sent to me with broken clutch lock up solenoids, shift control solenoids, as well as dirt in axle bearings behind the seals, muck behind all the solenoids as well. On the first trans he sent me I had to swap over everything, assuming he would send me another trans complete with everything the second go round I didn't bother taking all the solenoids off. When I received the new one, of course all the solenoids were broken. So after having to go source and replace all the solenoids I kept them after having to return the last transmission. Today I went into his car yard and actually found all my undamaged sensors in his junk transmission. He wouldn't let me have another transmission until I gave him his sensors out of the older one. He then claimed that he had only sold me one transmision. And that he didn't have another transmission anymore.\nAwful business, 0 stars", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuWLNzMWabKOBbWiJVmRtJCGFGyDMSRUAWh97m=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5dWxxSFcg7QMNnbP9MQgUDgznTQ7avGeyBb22=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmSMJ3QvrRnmbn2UCJ0zkx0yFlLGUdrd3w6ueN=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891dd3ae138be3:0xb566adebea1b5336"}

But not before tearing my truck apart so I could not move it till the parts was repaired. In other words intentionally taking my truck apart so I would have zero choice but to let him repair it. After 3 days and constant lies, I finally went and got the parts so I could get back to Atlanta. After all 3 days I had lost Dale's and service calls. Well 4th day I got my truck and immediately started off to Atlanta. I didn't make it. There was nothing wrong with the breaks when I took the truck to him, it was the rear end had gone bad. Not I had ABS lights on, and by the time I got 20 miles away I had NO BREAKS!! SERIOUSLY I had to place the truck in neutral and coast to a stop on the interstate. I had the truck tow to Atlanta. The mechanic there break lines not tight and leaking fluid where Bama people had not bother to tighten the up. Bolts not put back properly and had cut into the tire, wires and emergency brake cables just taped up. And rubbing against the tire. Long story short.
