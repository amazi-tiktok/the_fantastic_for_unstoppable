I am not from Chattanooga, so I had questions about almost every vendor and she never steered me wrong. She was so much fun to get to know and from the beginning, I felt at ease with her, knowing she was going to be on top of everything for the reception. Since I had a church ceremony, she did not coordinate for that, but she made sure to know all of the details and really took my vision and made it a reality for the entire event. If you are looking for a coordinator, and don't want to spend a fortune, In Style Weddings is the way to go. They do not sacrifice professionalism or quality of service, they are extremely helpful, can fit into almost any bride's budget, and are absolutely worth every penny for the peace of mind they provide! I am so thankful to have had Tina and her team help make my wedding day perfect for my husband and me!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88608c02ecdcb0eb:0x709fe431ca361225"}

We originally were not going to hire a planner because we thought we had everything under control, but I'm SO glad we did. It saved my mom and I so much stress the day of. Lecia went above and beyond. My wedding would not have been near as great without her. She is so sweet, professional, and really knows her stuff! Thank you for everything!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88608c02ecdcb0eb:0x709fe431ca361225"}

The DJ played the music we requested and did a great job with all of our announcements. The lighting was GORGEOUS & really made the room. I'm so glad we decided to have our wedding cake lit up; it totally made a difference! Everybody loved the photo booth & we have a ton of fun pictures to remember the day! The snow on our first dance really surprised everyone & we even used a really cool picture as our cover photo for our wedding album.
