I had him come out for a Master bath remodel to replace a tub valve and re-route/rough in plumbing to a walk in shower.  His plumber that came out to do the initial work did not turn the new valve to the bath tubs water on, and after tiling up the shower and trying to turn the bath water on, there was no water.  Had to go back in through the tile and found out the valve was never turned on/tested to the tub.  The rough-in work to the shower ended up being so poorly done, we are having to hire another plumber to come out and go in through the wall to fix the shoddy work that was done.  The plumber that came out to do this initial work was too concerned with having to leave early to officiate a soft ball game.  The worst thing about it is the owner is not standing behind his work and fixing himself. He has repeatedly blown me off and will not come back out.  I could also go in to how he threatened legal action if I didn't pay him for partial work before the job was completed, but that is another story.  If he is that concerned about needing money before a total job is completed, not a reputable plumber.  Beware", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889338819de61b7:0xea3f1db7e03a5777"}

I got maintenance here they said he was suppose to do everything because they have cable n internet with rivera . Called them to tell them about the issue . They called back saying that the cable guy told them I said I didn't want the cable anymore. Which was a complete LIE because if I didn't want it I wouldn't have paid ..

Been paying for their premium internet service which  is supposed to be 40.  Since the date it was connected, November 14th,  I have been lucky to get around 14-20 mbs and not the 40 I'm paying for.  I have tried numerous times to get this problem corrected.  Technical support advised me that there were \"upgrades being made\" which I was later informed that was a lie and evidently used just to appease me.  I've since called back numerous times and left messages which are rarely returned.\nI actually had one lady transfer me around and when I kept getting transferred back to her she sent me right back to their internet help department which I had already spoken to thanks to numerous times for several hours total.  Their internet help department apologized and transferred me back to her and the phones had been switched off saying that they were closed.  After successfully giving me the runaround for nearly 30 minutes she was able to just switch the phone off and be on her merry way.   I left Century Link due to poor internet speed and piss poor customer service.  It appears Riviera isn't much better.  I understand things happen with technological items and speeds vary.  But to never get the speed I'm paying for and to constantly get the run around when trying to get the problem fixed is unacceptable.  If only Mediacom serviced my area.  I've been with Riviera for years and this is by FAR the worst experience I've ever had with them.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0e0d2a3444cb:0x8ecddf4ec0b22777"}

I spoke with a Riviera Utilities rep about why they don't offer cable internet and she said that they did not want to compete with private business.  I don't really understand this response as subscription television is offered by Dish and DirecTV and if I'm not mistaken, they compete against cable television services.
