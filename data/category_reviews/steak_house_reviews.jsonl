There was nobody in the PLACE and we had to wait! Olive Garden, Outback does this too: They make you wait and the place is only half full!

We ordered different wines and she never identified to us which wines they were. She just placed them in front of us and proceeded to take our order. She incorrectly took our order by not remembering. Did not write it down either. I ordered the 14 oz. rib eye grilled Pittsburg style, med-rare. She returned to our table telling me that they gave me the next size steak for the same price of the 14 oz. because she did not remember the order. We\u2019ll  guess that was OK. When it came it was not P-Burg style. I asked for sour cream for the mashed potatoes and she did not bring that as well. I noticed the lack of friendliness to me and my GF compared to her report w/ the other American-African couples. She just did not care,\nWhen I commented to her about the experience, I tried to do so in a kindly fashion. She never listened to my advice.

There was not a pile of it, but it was on all four steaks that came to our table. It did not bother me or associates and had no overwhelming flavors but my spouse scraped it off because of an aversion to mushrooms, onions, and anything else that could be misunderstood. I chose aspaeagus and salad as sides. My asparagus was tender-crisp and well trimmed. Salad was basic using Iceberg. Had a couple ugly pieces i picked out but nothing major. I had ranch dressing which was homemade but not fantastic nor horrible. There was some dried herb or flavor that did not seem authentic to my ranch tastes but it was edible. I would like to try their  porterhouse but im just not ready to pay $38 for one steak. Overall, very nice meal for 20 minutes down the road. I will be back.

I woukd have rather them took their time than to \"rush\" so we could have our steaks with our food. \"Throw the whole steak away\"", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cd42d282633a7:0x64cdb53202edfde7"}

The menu has changed! No more bone in ribeye which was disappointing! We had 13 people in our party! We waited 30 minutes for our drinks as we watched 2 of the 3 girls behind the bar eat. They assigned the \"new girl\" to our party who was very sweet and tried very hard to please all of us and her other tables. She was not old enough to serve alcohol and the other staff definitely didn't care about her or us or the fact that we were sitting with no drinks after driving 30 minutes to visit a place we had a wonderful time previously! Of course they told us it was her first night alone after things fell apart! Then 3 others tried to help her! That added even more confusion! All of the tickets were mixed up and finally 1 male server stepped up to help her! The wait staff should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this to happen! More organization is a must and a staff who's main concern is the satisfaction of ALL guests should be a priority! This experience was nowhere near as good as our first 2. The food was definitely not as good, my potato was even so burnt it was inedible. (Literally black on the bottom through the skin to the inside & as hard as the table!) And steaks that were not what we were expecting (They did have good flavor and were cooked a perfect medium rare!) After completing the payment process, we sat outside and listened to 2 guys play some live music. This was a very nice outdoor entertaining space!

Normally the service is wonderful. Tonight was another story. We waited almost 10 minutes to get sat. When the waitress finally came to seat us she explained that they were short staffed so there was a little bit of a wait. I understand that, I've been a waitress before. After we sat down we waited at least 30 minutes before our drink order was taken. And even then it was the owner that finally came over to take it. After that it was another 20 or so minutes before the waitress came over to take our food order. Two tables were sat almost 30 minutes after us and received their drinks right away. We sat waiting for our food to come out for another 20 minutes before our appitizers came. The waitress then said that there were no more mashed potatoes, which is what my husband and I had ordered for our sides. We asked for baked potatoes instead. They were also out of that. Ok things happen. So we decided on fries and chips instead. Not even 5 minutes later the table behind us, one of the tables who was sat 30 minutes after us, got their food. Which included both mashed potatoes and baked potatoes. Up until this point we were a little annoyed but fine, this made it much worse. We had mostly lost our appetites by this time. We mentioned to the waitress about all of this and she apologized. Nothing was done to try and rectify the situation though. I would also like to make clear the fact that it was not very busy then we got there at about 8:30 so I did not understand why everything took so long. I am disappointed because we love the food here. I'll have to think long and hard about coming back.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cd42d282633a7:0x64cdb53202edfde7"}

This was NOT it. We had no idea what to expect and we did read other reviews that complained about the price but we have no issue, if the service is good and the food is quality, so we headed over to Fred and Lesters. We were thrown off from the beginning. People were smoking on the front porch when we got there and when we walked in we were greeted in the fashion you would expect from folks that were very disorganized. The atmosphere is ok for a family type country establishment but it is not a date night place-by any measure. All I thought of was \"based on the looks of this place, the steak must be truly amazing\" . We waited for 20 minutes and no one ever even acknowledged us. We finally asked someone if we had a server and she was kind enough to get someone to help us. Not going well so far but we were happy to finally have our drinks-which sat at the bar so long that we almost went up and just grabbed them ourselves. We ordered the fried green tomatoes and they were good and the sauce for the tomatoes was tasty. We were ready to order our dinner and the waitress came and explained to us that they were out of SEVERAL of the steaks-and I think they only had a total of 5 choices. They were out of porterhouse and they were out of another one-cant remember which one. I asked her which steak she recommended and she said the filet, which was my first choice-BUT then she told me that the filet was NOT part of the quality meat that they are supposedly known for. I asked her what that meant and she said \"it is basically grocery store\". So I kind of chuckled and ordered the rib eye.....I really did not know how to take that but it was kind of funny. My husband ordered the ribs. My steak came with a salad and it was truly the most pathetic little limp salad I have ever received-except for maybe the few times I had a salad at waffle house. Limp lettuce and served in a thin wood bowl, like you would purchase at The Dollar Store. I could not finish it. But we were there for the steak. We continued to sit and talk and noticed that they had a patio outside where music was playing and since our food was no where to be found-It had been 45 minutes since we ordered we went out the back door to see what the patio area was like. It is a cute little area and the band seemed like they were quite talented but I was shocked that they were serving food to people while groups of other people were sitting right on the patio area smoking. I am not that particular but it was pretty gross and the smell of cigarettes was very strong the second that back door opened. I really did not think this was allowed any longer by the Health Department but maybe it is. We went back inside and had simply had enough and asked the waitress where our food was. She was sweet and smiled and said she would check and by that time I explained to her that it had been a full hour. We waited another 10 minutes with no reply from her and then told her to get our check and we would not be staying any longer. She told the manager who came by and said very quietly \"Sorry about that\". That was it!!! And it was a very half-a-- apology. Basically I would not return if it was FREE. My time is more valuable then to spend it at an establishment that manages itself in this manner. On a side note-the waitresses congregate around the computer screen for ever. This establishment needs to move the computer screen to an area other than the middle of the restaurant so it is not so obvious that no one knows what they are doing. I felt strong enough about it to write this review in hopes that others do not waste their time or money.\nAdd to list\nEdit\nShare Your Review", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cd42d282633a7:0x64cdb53202edfde7"}

Sarah's had so much grit it was like they just picked it off the floor. Think that could be it? Nope.

Breakfast was good but the service was horrible until the end when another waiter started helping with our table. We had a table of 4 and 2 of us had food while the rest of us were still waiting for drinks. The original waitress threw a menu down in front of me and immediately asked if I knew what i wanted without even giving me a chance to look. It took forever to even get our drinks. We decided maybe it was because several people came in at the same time and tried to give it another chance for dinner. We ordered a starter, my husband order a steak and potato, and I just ordered a potato. They came out with just the potatoes. We waited about 20 minutes for the rest of the food which never came. We tried to get our waiters attention but he kept walking. My husband finally got another gentleman's attention for the check. He brought it promptly and we discovered that none of the other food had even been ordered. Would not recommend to anyone. I have been a server 10 years of my life and worked catering and fine dining events for 2 years. I am very understanding and pateint but this was outrageous. If I could give 0 stars, it has definitely earned it.\n\nApril Jackson", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626c174c5aaaab:0x49b4e494aa130f06"}

Bread brought out before the meal was a plate of cheesy cornbread muffins and dinner rolls. Both were cold and no plates were given. The cornbread muffins were very dry and the rolls were meh but tasted better when you didn't want to eat the food ordered. The NY strip (cost $32) came out rare instead of medium well. It was really fatty so I could only eat a little bit. The knife brought with the steak had dish detergent caked all over it. The brussel sprouts were delicious and I would recommend those. The caesar salad ($8) was small, tasted ok, and the croutons were an overly buttery, crunchless mess. A friend of ours ordered the filet mignon medium (cost $34) and it came out mooing with a giant frozen block of garlic butter on top. She said the parm fries were ok and a small portion.  Another friend ordered the Farmers Market mushroom spinach risotto (?$?) which was ok after she seasoned it. We did not have a reservation so we waited for 30 mins.  It took 2 hours for us to order, eat and pay once we sat at the table. I waited for an Apple Jack cocktail for 30 minutes so you can imagine how long everything else took.

We waited an hour and a half for a table. It was nice that they did texting so we were able to go across to shop and walk around while we waited.\nWe ordered the loaded fries, which were not fries. They are potato bites, which was fine and they were really good! My companion and I both ordered steak and shrimp items and were both very dissatisfied. The steaks were COVERED in pepper. You couldn't even enjoy the flavor of the steak through the pepper, mine was also over cooked. My shrimp was good though so that was a plus. The Mac and cheese was flavorless though.\nThe service was sub par. You could tell the servers were swamped and ours literally ran away from our table when she took our drink orders. I don't blame her at all since I know how hard it is to manage a large section. Every interaction with her was super short and cut off by her walking away. When she came to check on our food after we got it she barely stopped. I didn't even bother to tell her we didn't like it because we had already waited over 2 hours for the table then food.\nAll in all we may go back in a few months, but it wasn't anything special.

Then she says that there was something on the plate but not touching the food. Then, I remind her that it was dripping wet and had to touch the food or have been touching something else before it landed on my plate. She asks bluntly if I want it and looks confused as to why I did not. Other bartender reorders my food and manager apologizes, but my experience is still ruined.

So many mistakes, several made more than twice, and everyone had an excuse or wanted to blame it on their other \u201cteam\u201d members.\n\nFirst, my son had to ask for sweet tea twice. Both times he was brought unsweet tea. When we complained that the second glass wasn\u2019t sweet either, she tried to act like it was my personal definition of \u201csweet\u201d that was wrong. They figured out someone neglected to actually put the sweetener in but never apologized. And then tried to charge us $3 for it when it was included in the kid\u2019s meal. They also tried to charge $3.40 for my daughter\u2019s milk that was supposed to be included AFTER being told to remove the charge. Second, my coffee that I ordered when I arrived was cold and I had to wait 10 minutes for a replacement AFTER asking for it AGAIN. Another excuse was given when asked why the coffee wasn\u2019t kept hot in the kitchen.\n\nLast, what is most upsetting is how we were made to feel when making our complaints. I know it\u2019s a fairly new restaurant at that location. I get that there are certain mistakes that happen at any restaurant (like forgetting lemons in the water which also happened tonight). What I don\u2019t get is how 3 or 4 people on their \u201cteam\u201d could make us feel like we were difficult customers when it was their repeated mistakes that led us to complain! And never once did they offer to compensate. In fact, they tried to charge us for their mistakes! I would have rather eaten at Chick-fil-A where my business is appreciated. My family will not be going back.\n\nJust so you know, this is my first time ever to leave a bad review for anyone. I don\u2019t do this as a hobby.

The veggies we're excellent \ud83d\udc4c. The sirloin however, was ok. It was a bit bland and just barely cooked over what I ordered (medium rare). Naturally sirloins are a lean meat and it's difficult to keep this cut tender if not cooked rare/medium-rare. Nonetheless I did enjoy my food and the service was decent.\n\nVisit 2) Ordered the ribeye and garlic mashed potatoes (I know it's completely opposite from the last meal). The mashed potatoes were fantastic. The ribeye though, MAN! That ribeye was an excellent steak and seasoned to perfection. Ribeyes are one of the fattiest cuts and they can be cooked well done while maintaining tenderness. I got mine medium rare. I highly recommend that dish.\n\nOverall this place has a great atmosphere, the service was good, and the food has a good range. As a general rule I give 4 stars if a place meets my expectations and 5 if it exceeds my expectations. I give 4 here only because I had inconsistent experiences.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923e1ccb42077:0x85f66f6e42d882c7"}

So many mistakes, several made more than twice, and everyone had an excuse or wanted to blame it on their other \u201cteam\u201d members.\n\nFirst, my son had to ask for sweet tea twice. Both times he was brought unsweet tea. When we complained that the second glass wasn\u2019t sweet either, she tried to act like it was my personal definition of \u201csweet\u201d that was wrong. They figured out someone neglected to actually put the sweetener in but never apologized. And then tried to charge us $3 for it when it was included in the kid\u2019s meal. They also tried to charge $3.40 for my daughter\u2019s milk that was supposed to be included AFTER being told to remove the charge. Second, my coffee that I ordered when I arrived was cold and I had to wait 10 minutes for a replacement AFTER asking for it AGAIN. Another excuse was given when asked why the coffee wasn\u2019t kept hot in the kitchen.\n\nLast, what is most upsetting is how we were made to feel when making our complaints. I know it\u2019s a fairly new restaurant at that location. I get that there are certain mistakes that happen at any restaurant (like forgetting lemons in the water which also happened tonight). What I don\u2019t get is how 3 or 4 people on their \u201cteam\u201d could make us feel like we were difficult customers when it was their repeated mistakes that led us to complain! And never once did they offer to compensate. In fact, they tried to charge us for their mistakes! I would have rather eaten at Chick-fil-A where my business is appreciated. My family will not be going back.\n\nJust so you know, this is my first time ever to leave a bad review for anyone. I don\u2019t do this as a hobby.

If it had been a little later, I would have had several more. I selected the 5 oz. bacon wrapped filet ($19.99) with salad & baked potato (there is a $2.49 up charge for the baked potato at lunch). My meal was delicious. My husband had the ribeye ($18.99, I think) with salad and garlic mashed potatoes. His meal was delicious as well, and when we go back, I will have the ribeye myself. It was one of the best ribeyes we've had. For dessert, we shared some kind of brownie/cookie skillet  with ice cream that was incredible and probably actually big enough for 4 to share. The service was excellent as well. All in all, a great experience & we will definitely go there again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923e1ccb42077:0x85f66f6e42d882c7"}

We had issues with an overcooked steak and they offered to put another on the grill.  We denied because the one we had was good but it was not how we ordered, which was our fault we tried something new and it backfired.  Anyway, I loved it.  Patrick was a great waiter.  Atmosphere is great, decor was entertaining, and the place was clean.  I didn't go to the restrooms so I can't comment on that.  There is alot of parking but even with that said, we had to drive around looking for parking on a Sunday afternoon at 2:30pm.  My husband even said that made him want to eat there even more because it meant it was good.  We were not disappointed.  It was delicious.  No sure if there is wifi but either way, it's a restaurant enjoy the company you went with and/or the decor around.  Disconnect if you can, it's worth it.\nSide note:  I would have given 4.5 rating if I could.  Con was not so bad to give a full blank star  but I could't do that.  So it is what it is...\nCon:\nPlace was HOT!!  I am usually cold natured and it was hot even for me.  My husband couldn't take off any more layers.  Our waiter was sweating and so were other people around us.  It was a bit disgusting.  Our waiter was a good sport though.\nFINAL VERDICT:\nWE WILL BE BACK.  REALLY ENJOYED IT!  TRY IT!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923e1ccb42077:0x85f66f6e42d882c7"}

The manager came out and said absolutely you can you are more than welcome anytime you come through here to park your truck and trailer and eat. We talked for a good hour at this point only to find out he is in fact the owner. When it came time to leave, he refused my money and said it was no good here due to the work that goes into trucking and everything that goes on in my industry. For the first time in all the years of driving this man was the first person other than family to actually show appreciation and when I got to the truck I was still amazed.

I won\u2019t write a long drawn out review, but I do want to inform customers, and hopefully the owners about my experience. Staff and hostess were very polite. Came in for a birthday party. Wife was not feeling well, so she just got a small side salad from the salad bar.  We had a large party, and her drink was overlooked and never brought. No big deal, I informed the waitress, and was told we would not be charged. The food was for lack of better words ABSOLUTELY NOT GOOD!! I ate a few bites, and lost my appetite. Decided maybe the dessert would be better. Got some icecream, and it tasted strange and was runny like water. Asked the waitress about it, and was told it is because it is a powdered icecream that is mixed with water. I was amazed. I took it that the waitresses must get complaints daily because of how  not surprised they were when asked about the quality.   Got the bill, and of course while splitting the checks it was overlooked and we were charged for full buffet and drink. Went to pay, and informed the person of what happened. Was told she did not have a manager card to override it, but would gladly go speak to the manager. She came back, apologized, and said that she was sorry, but the manager was doing the schedule, and told her that he was busy, and if she bothered him again he would close the door. Now, he may have been kidding with her, but either way, he never came out to help her, or to address the issue. She said she was sorry, but without the card, there was nothing she could do. So I had to pay 37 dollars for a salad, one drink, and the small plate I ate. It is the principal that I was told that I would have to pay for something that I never received, and the manager who\u2019s job it is to handle issues, decided he did not feel like walking 20 feet to talk me. I want to also state that I called back and spoke to mr. Rodney. AWESOME guy! He apologized, and was very professional. Just wanted to make that clear in case anyone that works at the store sees this post. Will not post the manager in questions name, because that is even more unprofessional than he is. I will say though, it was the guy working around 3pm on this past Saturday. The one doing next weeks schedule. Also, I will be contacting corporate tomorrow, to inform them of my experience, and see if they will be kind enough to refund the difference that I was overcharged. Usually do not write negative reviews, but it does not sit well with me to be charged for something I never received, and be told that I would have to pay for it because the manager does not feel like being bothered to come do what he is paid to do. So, I do apologize sir, but I WILL be telling corporate your name. Gotta get my money\u2019s worth!!! Take care, and enjoy the 9 dollars you stole from me!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1603739840747, "text": "I apologize for you experience and our failure to meet your expectations.

Even when we've lived away and returned for visits, we've actually made it a part of our plans when planning where to eat. Obviously, it's an older restaurant and has been remodeled a few times, and even underwent extensive remodeling after a fire. We've noticed there seems to be a slight burned odor lingering since the fire. Other than that, to us, it doesn't smell dirty. The food has always been quite good. In fact, some of their food is better than other (more expensive) places. For the most part the service is above average. It depends on who waits on you. There are several members of the wait staff who've been serving customers for decades, and they give great service, while some of the novices could improve. It could be cleaner, but in our opinion, it isn't as dirty as some make it out to be. It is much cleaner than the Ryan's or Quincy's Steakhouses which were once here. There must be some reason Western Sizzlin' has outlasted those places by several years! They were here before those others and they're still here, long after the others have closed down.\n\nWe're not related to any of the owners or employees.
