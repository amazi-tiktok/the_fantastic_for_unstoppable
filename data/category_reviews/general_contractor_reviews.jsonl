I just didn\u2019t have the time to do all the work myself. I usually do everything myself. I received multiple estimates and Heath was the more affordable option, but not just price but his attention to detail while talked and looked at all the things I wanted done to my home. It\u2019s a rather large home and the items to do were: new siding on the entire house, a few new windows, new gutters, stack stone and cedar posts on porch, exposed wood work in the eaves, and remove a rather large bay window and put an addition of 10\u2019x10\u2019 roughed in for a laundry room. First of all Heath and Crew knocked it out of the park. Being an older home they even tyvex wrapped the entire house, and found 1 rotted wall hiding behind the old siding. I received a FaceTime call from Heath showing me the damage and a quote to fix the wall the correct way and asked if I wanted it fixed. I agreed to let them fix it. There was awesome communication during the entire job. The day we met to sign the contract I paid a percentage for materials and was told to go down tot he building supply store to pick out the colors and a gigantic rear door and windows and they would be waiting on me. I went right down there and they already had a ticket waiting and items for the job placed on it with notes of things I needed to put my choices on. Back to being a perfectionist along the I looked at it everyday when I got home and anything that seem just right I would call Heath and we would talk about. When the work was going on was a couple years ago when it rained from Thanksgiving to spring about every day. Heath crew worked every minute it wasn\u2019t raining and some things they could do out of the rain. Even though they had multiple crews and jobs going I still seen the owner of the company Heath at my house every morning the workers showed up giving out the plan for the day and a lot of those days Heath was with them tool belt on and hammer in hand working with them. The other companies was the owner giving quotes much higher so they could skate 20% off the top to do the job but never show up to work. I wasn\u2019t about paying someone just to put their name sign in my yard but leave it up to the crew to do the work. I highly recommend Heath Davis Construction for any home needs you got. It may take a 1-2 weeks to get your estimate after meeting, but when you get it it is very detailed and not chicken scratch on a torn up piece of notebook paper! You have to watch paying attention to a lot of negative reviews because, 1.) disgruntled employees that do things to get fired are \u201calways\u201d innocent LoL, and 2.) some people you can never make happy no matter what you do for them! A lot of people in our area has had work done by Heath and word of mouth is what made me call him. Also, rule of thumb is don\u2019t ask one contractor about another because because the one you\u2019re talking to wants your job.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88628b6c9625553f:0xb51ff15ae460f8ae"}

Heath is not to be trusted and never take him for his word. First of all Heath came out to do an estimate on a few projects. He told me he has so many people they would line up and knock the work out in 2 days. This would be the start of many lies!\n\nThe day they were supposed to start no one showed or called. I called the office and talked to Misty. She told me they are running a few days behind and that I was next in line. She was right, about a week later some guys were here to roof the small building I had. That\u2019s about the only time Heath and his guys showed up on time. For the next 10 weeks all we heard was excuse after excuse why no one was there. Heath actually sent me a nasty email trying to tell me that I didn\u2019t know what was going on.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the windows. Heath replaced 3 windows. The first and biggest window I actually had to help the guy install because Heath dropped him off by himself. The windows are very cheap and took 10 weeks to install and finish out.\n\nNext is the new interior door he installed. Heath bought the wrong door and instead of taking it back and getting the correct door he tried to customize it. This consisted of adding a block of wood to the jam. Looks absolutely horrible! The door hit on the bottom and is hard to close. My sisters kid could have done a better job.\n\nNow for the thing he called a deck. There are somewhere around 30-40 nails that are sticking out to where it can cut you or rip your clothes. Heath was supposed to drill into the concrete and anchor the deck boards down but he did not. A 19x15 deck only had 4 sets of nails in each board. It bounces and creaks everywhere. Definitely now square. One side measures 19\u2019 the other side is 19\u201911\u201d. The over hang of the deck boards go from 2\u201d to 6\u201d and looks like a drunk man tried to cut a straight line.\n\nOverall I would recommend this ragtag company to change out a roll of toilet paper.

If you get nothing else from my review, get this: use anyone but Landmark.\n\nThis company dragged my relatively small project on for months. The employees are nice enough, but are unbelievably slow and inept. More than once, I had to call the main office to \"tattle\" on Ben, the project manager, who had gone totally AWOL and would not communicate despite my house being in complete disarray thanks to his project management.\n\nInstalling quarter round proved too difficult for this company. They had to come out over 4 separate times to complete this job. They literally skipped parts of the wall because there was furniture or a floor mat in front of it. They skipped the kitchen entirely. And when they did return to install it there, they literally just left giant gaps in each corner without joining the pieces together. They were dumbfounded that I wanted the quarter round to join at the corners. WTF!\n\nThey destroyed 2 toilet lids by putting tools on them.  They re-seated toilets crooked and rocking and leaking.  They left the closet bolts uncovered and did a caulking job you'd expect from a toddler.\n\nThere are places in the laminate floor with visible gaps between planks. There were gouges in it that they filled with wood filler and called it a day. They did a sloppy paint job in both bathrooms (at least they got the color right, though).\n\nIt was unbelievable how many times these people had to come back to my house to fix their screw-ups and even now, a year later, I'm still finding fresh, mind-boggling issues.\n\nIf you care about your house at all, use someone else.\n\nI would like to add that the owner of the company did reach out to me within 24 hours of my review with apologies and an offer to make it right. I declined, however, on the basis that I have no faith in them being capable of doing any of this job.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAO2dPDf0rGtjaHws1KIHCPOJpZF4YegjBr-8f=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOvjEXA7aLM2pPXoofAfvvtkOW-zflTbXuq03N=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1559692532080, "text": "Thank you for taking the time to communicate to us why our service did not meet your expectations.

I wrote a check for the services. Them some women comes to the door asking me to re-wrote the check to a personal person because they couldn't cash it. Then when I asked for a receipt they said we don't have receipts today. Then when I thought ok something is not right here and called the office which was the dad he was in shock they asked for another check and had been told he didn't do anything....like I had not paid. Then he said let me see what is going on and I will call you back. He never calls back. The lady that I am pretty sure was on meth calls me back and says I won't charge when we come back. Well later that night my uncle has no hot water. They never turned the water heater back on. So that was a 125.00 extra charge from the plumber. It has been a total mess. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!

I contacted them to rewire a switch controlling one light and a ceiling fan (the light switch was working already but the ceiling fan was not).

In the process they disconnected several lines causing various lights, vents, fans, etc., throughout the home to quit working.  After three hours they quit, leaving hot electrical wires hanging out of the wall.  They returned the next day (three hours later than they agreed to arrive) and spent the entire day working on the wiring trying to determine why they had broken the circuit to the other locations.  After eight hours they \"finished\" and left -- with the switch they originally came to repair still not working.  After calling them the next day they sent another person who worked on the wiring and finally got the original switch working and the other outlets they had disconnected working but still did not ever get the ceiling fan working.  They then presented a bill for $85 for the original service call and $375 for the repair work they had to do to solve the other problems they created, and, the ceiling fan switch still does not work. $460 total for them to actually do nothing.  The switch that was working is still working, the circuits that were working before they disconnected them are still working as they were before McLeod arrived, and the ceiling fan still does not work.

I informed Mr. Patel that I would be glad to provide him with a contractor that could do the prep work properly, he chose to use his own contractor.  Mr. Patel and I had several conversations leading up to the date of the installation about specifics of the job.  The statement that I never returned phone calls is patently false.  Mr. Patel has had several conversations with our office as well, to which his phone calls were always answered or returned (records to prove it).  Our office called to confirm the installation date on June 3rd, at which time Tina went over everything that needed to be moved again.  I spoke with Mr. Patel on Monday, June 7, TWO days prior to installation date of June 9. It was at this time I discovered Mr. Patel had been misinformed by his contractor about what needed and didn't need to be removed.  Aqua-Guard only removed Mr. Patel from the schedule when he wanted us to postpone his job.  In that conversation our office manager explained to him that if he postponed the job that we are booked out and couldn't guarantee when he could be worked back into the schedule.  He called us back on June 10 to get back on the schedule and we were unable to give him an immediate schedule date. We were in the process of shuffling our schedule to work him back in when Mr. Patel called our office today upset and cancelled the project all together.

Well I wasn\u2019t surprised when they didn\u2019t so I just went to Home Depot and purchased what I needed. Overall, quality of work was good (besides not capping the sewage pipe back).\n1st Update: Went to the basement this morning to discover that the guys working had broken the drainage pipe for our bathroom sink and they used a Romex power wire we have running in the basement to hang their new pipe on.

One of the other companies wanted to sell us a similar system with an unnecessary pump system for almost twice the price of AG. Due to our property being on a heavy slope it made more sense to have the water gravity fed from the basement to have one less thing to worry about maintaining. Mike saw the reason in this approach and explained while some applications do require a pump ours did not and so was able to design the system to accommodate our individual situation as opposed to saying \u201cThis is our system. It\u2019s the same for everyone\u201d. On the day of the job the crew showed up on time with a supervisor to address any concerns before starting the job.

The GOOD: The price was very competitive, Mike (owner) seemed very honest detailing the work to be performed, the crew completed the job quickly, and I haven\u2019t had any water intrusion issues since. THE BAD: following the completion of the job I noticed several items that looked suspect - caulking around door, window, fireplace, and at end of wall sheets was missing or poorly done, sump basin cover had a large cutout and therefore not well sealed, encapsulation in crawl space was made up of what looked like a lot of scrap peices haphazardly taped together and noticeable creases in the tape joints. I didn\u2019t call Mike to come back out because I figured they were the pros and the installation methods were acceptable and/or industry standard - i.e not items I should be concern about. Well... 2.5 yrs later, I\u2019m having issues with the tape joints separating and releasing moisture and foul odors from the soil gases escaping the encapsulation in my crawl space that are coming up into our main level. I contacted Aquaguard and was told that it\u2019s been too long since the install for them to correct the problem free of charge. the customer service representative basically stated that \u201cif the waterproofing system isn\u2019t leaking then it doesn\u2019t fall under their warranty.\u201d So much for standing behind your work. If the encapsulation membrane would have been taped correctly we would not be having this issue. Note* I have already addressed the poor caulking and sump basin lid on my own as to not be a \u201cneedy customer\u201d.\n\nInteresting bit of info... I called BDry about this as I thought they had done the waterproofing. They sent a rep out the next day, he checked the encapsulated crawl space, agreed it was not installed acceptably, and said they would be sending someone out to correct the problem before end of week.

I first met with Craig Blair on April.  He gave me a quote that same day.  He was very patient and was definitely not in a hurry to leave, even though it was late in the day.  He answered all of my questions.  After I thought about it for a while he came back another afternoon to answer more questions and show the demo window unit to my wife.  Again, very patient and in no hurry to be anywhere.\n\nMade down payment in April.  He said they would install in early June.  That is exactly what happened.  The install took only three days.  They started on a Wednesday and finished on a Friday.  The install crew consisted of three guys.  They were extremely polite and cleaned up their mess each day.\n\nThere was only one major issue.  There were streaks and smudges on every window.  It looked like some kind of sealant that was not cleaned off during the manufacturing process.  I met with the lead installer on Friday morning and pointed this out to him and asked that he clean the windows.  He was very condescending and obviously did not want to clean the windows.  He said he would but I knew he would not.  I went back to work (my wife was home but said she would not enforce the window cleaning)\n\nThe project was finished when I got home Friday afternoon.  The windows looked great but . . . You guessed it.  There were still streaks and smudges on all the windows.  Not wanting to be a pain, I tried cleaning the windows myself.  The sealant was very difficult to remove.  It would not come off with glass cleaner alone.  I decided this should definitely be Blair\u2019s responsibility.\n\nI asked for a meeting with Criag Blair.  We met the following week.  He was very polite and patient.  He agreed to have the windows cleaned and address a few other minor issues.\n\nIt took a while, and to be fair, I was out of town for a week but we finally coordinated on having the windows cleaned.  The crew that did the installation came back out.  They came while I was at work.  My wife was home but declined to be the inspector.  They finished cleaning about 3 PM.  They waited for me to get home at 4:30.  We walked around and inspected all 26 windows.  There were a few touch ups but for the most part they did a good job.\n\nIn summary, I was very pleased and satisfied with the entire process.  I will definitely use Blair Remodeling in for any future projects.  Craig Blair is the best.  I totally trust him and I know that he will do whatever is necessary to make sure I am satisfied.  Hopefully, Blair will add cleaning the windows to their standard installation procedure.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1567607282328, "text": "Thanks James!"}, "gmap_id": "0x8889163057be33df:0x9d5df5b1f942ec2f"}

It took only 2 days for removal and installation of my new roof which is amazing because mine is very high pitch. Each day they cleaned up their debris (shingles, nails, etc..) and when the dumpster they used leaked hydraulic fluid onto my driveway, they pressure washed the spot. His crew even replaced a board on the side of my home that had a rotten spot. I cant tell you how pleased I am with the aesthetics of my new roof, not to mention how structurally sound it is. 2nd to None had the highest warranty (7 years) of all the companies I was considering which was also a deciding factor for me . Most only have a 5 years warranty and one had only 2 years. When a company can stand behind their workmanship, they deserve my business. Bryan also worked closely with me to make sure I had the right type of shingle (color, functionality). He also imparted valuable advice regarding which shingle manufactures are honoring their warranties. Also..it needs to be mentioned that before they installed the new roof, I had a portion of my old roof tarped but the wind blew it off. Of course heavy rains came and water was leaking in several spots on my roof and into my master bathroom/closet. It was raining and lightening when his crew got on my roof to retarp/stop the leakage. That was also a deciding point for me that I would be using his company for my new roof. I can tell you most companies would not have done that. Also Bryan worked diligently with my Allstate adjuster explaining the cost of the roof which they had initially underestimated.

With genuine sincerity we would rate this company,  under the leadership of its owner, Mike Hayes, as \"Best in Class\". The group is made up of dedicated professionals and highly skilled individual driven by high quality service comittment.\nThe repair MDH was hired to do was one that had been previously attempted by another foundation repair company. This was our second time addressing the same problem. While the first company ensured us the fix we paid for was permanent. It was short number of years later that we began seeing signs indicating the repair was failing . We found ourselves back at square one.\nAt the time we did not know MDH Foundation. We did reach out to the only other company we knew of thru advertisement only, and while we had someone come out assess and quote us a price, we chose to hold off. Very impressive sales presentation they did but we were just not convinced on their proposed corrective plan.  Some time later we hear of MDH, and a lot of good things being said of the owner, Mike Hayes. Not only on their foundation repair work, but as a very highly respectable contractor too.  Earlier this year we met with a member of the MDH team, and an assessment was made. Then before the job plan was finalized, the owner, Mike, came out to thoroughly go over the plan. It was the first time we felt really comfortable about the corrective plan.  Mike has a great group of professionals and skill guys that communicate well together. They were very attentive to our concerns, explained and answered every question.  They were punctual and respective of time. Always leaving area neat after each day.

Sam went through all the details about what was involved in the roofing process, the estimate, the product, work involved. He gave me the pros and cons so I could make an informed decision about whether to just fix the leak or go ahead and get an entire new roof. As my roof is old and deteriorating I opted for a complete new roof. Sam was available throughout the process if I had any questions or concerns about anything. I have to add that Sam was the primary reason I decided on One Call Roofing. Carter scheduled the work and worked around my odd schedule. He kept me informed about when the workers would arrive. Joey was the roofing manager with boots on the ground while the work was being done. Mine was a \"smaller\" job, and only 2 workers were here to do the work in addition to Joey. They worked diligently throughout. I became concerned for them because they didn't even take a break until lunch at 1:45 and then didn't even take a full 30 minutes. The work was completed on the second day. Complete clean-up of all debris and nails was performed (they use high powered rolling magnets). During the roofing process an unavoidable incident occurred and as a result there was a small crack in the ceiling in my kitchen. Carter scheduled workers to come and fix the crack (again working around my schedule). The workers fixed the small crack and even graciously did touch-up paint on 2 other areas that were discolored due to my leaky roof. They completed the work in only about an hour. I am exceptionally pleased with the entire process and highly recommend One Call Roofing.

It took him about 5 minutes to diagnose the problem when he came in and told me how much it would cost before he did anything - which I liked. It was a very affordable price for the repair as well I thought. He had my AC unit repaired in under 3 minutes. I really appreciate how this company handled me as a customer. I call expecting to be miserable and sweating all day, and they had my AC fixed before the the time they had scheduled my appointment initially .

The unit we had was original to the house and going on 22 years old.  So it came as no surprise to us when it finally decided to start being more hassle to upkeep than just flat out replace.  Our unit stopped working on a Sunday morning.  The fan motor had gone bad and no hot air would come through the vents.  It would kick on and off intermittently, but very sporadic and unreliable.  We called around and left messages at a few places.  Steve was the first to call back that same day. We explained the situation.  He advised us to use the unit if we could and wanted to make sure we did still have some heat.  Being that it was a Sunday, it would be Monday until he could send someone out unless it was an absolute emergency.  Come Monday, a technician, Juan, came out to check the problem.\n\nJuan was polite, informative and an all-around great guy.  We were given a quote to repair the unit and replace.  Juan took the time to break down everything for us if we had any questions.  We shopped around and found A1's price to be fair and put the order in for a replacement.  Steve, himself, came by the house the next day to talk with us and clear up any questions we had and help discuss cost options. We decided to go with A1. Juan and Steve were back out first thing that Friday and had the unit replaced and operational in 4 hours.\n\nWe'll be sure to continue to use Steve and A1 for any of our future needs for HVAC.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626c96bdd6117b:0x6ef1a8e08c40db04"}

After a year of begging Alms Pump to come reconnect the electric wires in the older pump house that they disconnected to put a check valve,  I had to hire an electrician ($126) to come restore electricity in the pump house so that the lights could be turned on for freezing weather that was 2 days after the 2 days of freezing weather.  The bulb receptacle that was removed without my permission was bought and remounted as the backup bulb.\nIt makes no sense to mistreat a customer who is a disabled Army Veteran and have been a loyal paying customer.\n\nBuyer beware\n\nAlms pump does not care about their customers.  You cannot trust them to do the job right especially if you leave them and trust that they will do right by you.   I paid $450 for a check valve but the aggravation they caused me for a year to reconnect the electric wires they disabled, removed a light bulb socket without my permission, and had leaking pipes at the new pump, I should charge them $500 or more.\n\nSo, buyer beware.\n*********************************\nNov 10, 2020 update:\nAlm Pump finally came to fix the leaking pipes..  Hurricane Sally busted the leaking pipes open and water was pumped on the grounds for 2 to 3 days and nights. It could have burned up the new pump. I wondered why there were 4 inches of water on the ground 3 days after the hurricane. Wading through the water, I discovered the pump gushing water from the pipe at the pump.  I shut off the power to the pump. Then called Alms Pump.\nTheir reply was that they had people without water and it would be a couple of days. Well, about 6 weeks later Alms Pump showed up and fixed the pipes to the pump and turned the water back on.  The bill for that meter where no water was used was $60.  This was the first bill where payment was only for water used plus taxes.\nAs to the older pump, Alms Pump  never went to the  pump house of the older pump and never reconnect the electric wires they disconnected to bring the pump and pipes out of the ground to put a new check valve on the pipe of the older pump.\nI have begged Alms Pump to reconnect the wires in the pump house so that the electric plugs can be used to run extension cord to where 2 junipers fell in the yard and need cutting.  To this day, Nov 10, 2020, the 2 juniper are still down.\nThere is no electricity to the switch for the light bulb when freezing weather comes.\n\nMy attorney wrote Alms Pump  a letter and it was ignored.  I gave Alms Pump until 31 Oct 2020 to reconnect the electric wires and that was ignored.\n\nThey will not answer as to why they will not reconnect the electric wires they disconnected.  I paid Alms Pump $450 for repairing the older pump (putting in a new check valve).\nIf I have to hire an electrician to reconnect the wires Alms Pump disconnected, would that make Alms Pumps liable for the payment? My attorney says yes, and, they should be taken to Small Claims Court.\n\nThe senior Alms who started Alms Pump never mistreated their customers as I have been grossly mistreated by this younger generation running Allms Pump.\n\nI will never call Alms Pump to put down another well and pump. Fini.\n\nPrevious post in Sep 2020:\nNot responding to fix the leaking T under the valve they installed.  I have done business with Alms Pump for over 30 years and do not understand why they are not responding to come fix their work. A plumber would not touch it.\n\nAlms Pump. Please come fix your work.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0eec74f9bc57:0xa013dc0b035b77e7"}

Because Pickett installed the roof 8 years ago, we called them about the problem. Josh sent his roofer to our home to see if a cause for the water leak(s) could be found, because from the outside the roofing shingles were not damaged or missing and looked fine. However after a few minutes looking in the attic and walking the roof, it was determined that during construction of my home some 25 years ago, a handful of framing nails used to secure the plywood roof deck had missed the rafter below, and after all these years had begun to back out of the plywood deck, pushing up the roof shingle just enough to let water pass underneath. The roofer walked the entire roof looking for nails that were backing out (not just in the area of the water stains below, but the whole roof), removing all that he found, sealing the hole and making sure the roof shingle lay flat. Two days after the repairs we had a lot of rain, and no water leaks inside the house.\n\nOnce again, Pickett Construction has made my wife and I very happy, and I will not hesitate to call them in the future.

Pickett did the following items in 17 days ... 350 feet of new privacy fence and gates, paint entire house exterior, re-roof covered deck, remove turbines and patch roof areas, repair rotted roof decking around chimney stack, re-flashed and re-roofed the area, installed new LED motion detecting security lights, installed new outdoor lighting over front door,replaced all windows with new double hung, double pane vinyl windows, installed new laminate/engineered word floors on the entire main level of the house, laid tile in both foyers, kitchen and den/study, replaced every interior door and all hardware, installed new ceiling fans in each bedroom and main foyer, removed wrought iron raining in foyer and replaced with wood and balusters, primed and painted all interior trim, scraped popcorn/acoustic ceiling from kitchen, repaired drywall issues in bedrooms and kitchen, textured and painted kitchen walls.\n\nAny \"extra\" I asked about was repsonded with a written proposal so that there could be no confusion or disaggrement.\n\nTo get these things done in the time frame of 17 days ... including holidays ... shows excellent planning and execution. I was kept informed as to what was scheduled for the day, who would be there and what to expect. They arranged for the construction dumpster delivery and pick up. Pickett did a nice job on the site clean up as well.\n\nPunch list items were few and far between and resolved promptly.\n\nThe only thing that would be close to a concern or a negative was the sub-contracting tile guy who was going through a diviorce while he did the job. He did not do a bad job but his distraction resulted in a couple of small punch list things that Josh had Tripp take care of. I was assured that they would not be using this tile guy in the future.\n\nWould I recommend Pickett Construction to you? Absolutely. Want to see pics of the renovation? I have them. Will I use them again in the future? Absolutely. As a matter of fact, my daughter used them on a foreclosure she purchased in Calera. She got prompt thorough quality work done as well.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888928b42506b8af:0xcb8d4f70d1041df1"}
{"user_id": "108852040032783306603", "name": "Tim Calhoun", "time": 1396761930047, "rating": 4.0, "text": "Pricing:\nWe contracted with Pickett to complete some work on our house to prepare it for sale. We were looking for some typical wood rot to be replaced and exterior paint. We also requested an interior paint quote. I think the quote was a bit high for the exterior work, but not so bad that I didn't go with their services. The quote for the interior painting was outrageous, so we opted for another painter. The other painter's quote was nearly $3000 less than the quote from Pickett. We were also having some plywood put in the ceiling of the carport, because the builder used interior drywall in our neighborhood. Pickett gave us a \"complimentary upgrade\" to beadboard instead of plain plywood. This really added a nice touch to the carport ceiling, and was an appreciated upgrade. They only requested 1/2-down to start the work, which we felt was certainly reasonable. They also honored their coupon they regularly have (often in the Alabaster Newsletter, or ValPack). We printed ours from the ValPack website.\n\nWorkmanship:\nThe quality of the exterior work was pretty good. There were a few spots where the painting got a bit \"sloppy,\" but was overall good work. The beadboard in the carport made a great upgrade to our carport, and added a touch of \"class\" to an otherwise mundane area of the house. Unfortunately, due to our unusually cold winter, the holidays, and several bouts with rain, our work was regularly delayed. It took a bit longer than expected to complete, but didn't delay our schedule of listing the house. The little interaction I had with the crew was polite and courteous, though at times the project manager came across as mildly arrogant. Communicating with the PM via email was the best medium, although he sometimes took a bit longer than expected to return messages.\n\nPost Work Follow-up:\nAgain, the delays in returning messages made for a challenge in clearing our post-work \"punch list,\" but this was also around the holidays, so we conceded a bit.  Had there been more clear communication about workday expectations (e.g. workers will/will not be onsite today) this would have made for better overall feeling about the length of the job.\nDuring our home buyer's inspection, they found more wood rot that was inadvertently overlooked by the crew. While I don't expect the painters to look over every square inch of the house (heck, neither did I!), it ended up being a significant portion of the chimney that had rotted out the edge of our masonite siding. One would expect that at least part of that might have been discovered and either repaired or at least alerted me to the potential change in an estimate so it could be repaired. When we approached our PM about correcting it, he gave us a price quote. After paying over $6000 for the original work, this was certainly unexpected, especially with their \"1 year warranty.\" I spoke with Josh, the owner's son who is also in management with the company. He immediately started working with me to find a reasonable solution. I ended up having to pay a bit more, but we did come to an acceptable compromise on the final cost of the supplemental work. In the end, Josh personally stopped by the house to deliver the revised agreement and took pictures of the missed work. It turned out that the rot was more severe than even he expected. He opted to continue to honor that revised estimate and didn't charge anymore. Josh really worked hard to make a relatively displeasing situation wok out well in the end. Josh was absolutely committed to service and ensuring my end satisfaction. He even reached out after the supplemental work was completed to check in on my satisfaction, and knowing there was a bit of a sour taste, still wanted this Google Review. Josh knows what it takes to listen to customer concerns and immediately find a reasonable solution that works in the best interest of all parties. Had it not been for Josh's actions, my 4-star rating would have been a high 2-star, or low 3-star.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888928b42506b8af:0xcb8d4f70d1041df1"}

The project involved demo of some existing kitchen cabinets, replacement of a cook top and stove with a range, replacement of a vent hood, installing new kitchen lighting, laying tile, painting cabinets and bookshelves, painting trim, and painting walls.  All of this was handled by David's crew without having to sub out any work. The quality of the work done was really top-tier.  We used David's decorating consultant, Lindy, to help pick out colors, and the result has significantly brightened and beautified the two rooms where we spend most of our waking hours.\n\nWhen you undertake a project that takes this much time, you quickly realize that you have invited some strangers into your home for a lengthy stay.   Well, the guys David sent did not stay strangers for very long.  They were cheerful, friendly, and helpful to us.  They added, without cost, some features to the project at our request, even though these features were not in the original contract-- for example, installing a dimmer switch in the kitchen, replacing flood lights in our dinette area so they would match the color put out by our new kitchen lighting, cutting out the trim along one wall of our living room so our bookcase could lay flat against the wall, and installing wall outlets in our bookcase.  They cleaned up after themselves every day and hauled away their own trash.  When they moved furniture around to do some painting, they always put it back where it had been.  It got to where we enjoyed having the company at our house.  At the end of the job, we were glad it was completed, but we were sorry to see the guys leave.\n\nAll the work was done with great attention to detail.  They found and installed tile to match our existing kitchen backsplash tile.  They worked on our project every weekday for three weeks.  On some days, they worked on our cabinet doors and bookcase at their shop, but on the days when they did not come, David always called us to let us know they would not be there and what they would be doing that day.\n\nWe will certainly call on Lisenby Construction if we undertake new remodeling projects.

That being said, everything that I have researched recommended being there for the home inspection to see for your own eyes the problems and repairs that need to be made before making a decision on buying a house. Unfortunately only my wife could make part of the inspection as I could not due to work demands after the hurricane. Mr. Wesley made me feel like I was there and explained the concerns to me as if they were his own. Our transaction broker suggested that we not be \"nit picky\" so the deal would go through. With Mr. Wesley's help, we were able to find the issues that we would not, and could not budge on. I strongly recommend him to anyone based on our experience. He even took time out of his Saturday during the half time show to go over the report in more detail with me. In a world rife with carelessness, his personalized and detailed attitude was refreshing and really made us feel important.

I had wondered about whether a particular wall had wallpaper or paint on it and as the very kind person Wesley is he took the time away from what he was doing to take covers off outlets and determined the walls were in fact painted and then discussed with me the best way to cover the existing paint job.  This was above and beyond what he came there to do.  This is just one example, there were a couple more times during the inspection where he stopped and offered his expert opinion on things.  The inspection he did was very thorough.  I could not be more pleased.  He was extremely honest with his findings and I 100% trust his judgement and advice.

In fact, surprisingly, at the time, following Barry, they were covered up in work, but did not take advantage of the storm event.  Moved our project to a priority and I actually had to tell them to stop working and go home. It was late at night!\nI will be calling on this crew for many years and their work goes beyond fencing!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a11a5a02a8def:0x813880290497cecb"}
