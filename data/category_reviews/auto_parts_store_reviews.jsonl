After getting the motor in it was knocking called and talked to a lady who said owner wasn\u2019t in and he\u2019ll give me a call back, he never called me back. I called a couple days later and he answered I let him know what was going on and he said you only have a 30 day warranty, when in fact my paperwork states I had 60. Thank god I had kept the receipt. He told me I had to fill out the warranty paperwork and present receipts. Ok no problem but on the warranty form it states that the timing belt needs to be replaced, this engine has a chain. He informed me that regardless belt or chain it\u2019s all the same. Well I got some news from you buddy there not, a chain shouldn\u2019t have to be serviced under normal conditions, a belt yes I agree it does. But if the motor is knocking that has nothing to do with it. This is a fair warning for anyone purchasing from here he will not refund your money and will think of any way possible not too, and he uses the square app which makes things much harder to get a refund through your credit card. But I am happy to say after over 8 months I have received my refund and hope this guy flies out of business and really feels it.

I live about an hour and a half away so I really love it!  I did all my negotiating via email and set up a test drive appointment. Very, very, easy sale for the company. My biggest disappointment is the fact that the car was filthy when I arrived and the battery terminals were severely corroded. I am convinced nobody from the service department even looked under the hood until I made them.  I wanted the terminals cleaned,  I wanted an oil change,  all fluids topped off and a cabin air filter change (Very minimal requests for a car dealership) I stated it would have to be detailed inside. The detail department worked on it but they would only be there until 12 or 12:30. So we concluded our business (paid cash) and I went to lunch without the car.  Well by the time I got back the headliner was much cleaner but it smelled terribly in the car (like stagnant mop water). Nothing else was even wiped down and unfortunately the detail department was gone. There was sticky crusted disgusting something in all the buttons so some would stick in certain positions. Literally the battery terminal was only brushed with a wire brush to knock off the corrosion. I don't think the oil was changed. When I got home the oil did not appear new. I think they put new on top of the old then they mixed together. The cabin air filter was not changed. I removed it to check because everytime I used recirculated air instead of fresh it smelled bad. It has a new one now and it no longer has an odor.\n\nMy salesman was okay, but seriously the easiest commission ever. Wish I would have at least gotten an after the sale phone call. Just to check in. Would have made me feel better about the other issues.\n\nMy complaints are only directed to the service and detail departments.\n\nI am now looking for a truck in the $20,000 range (same as my Maxima) and I am not even looking at this company now.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb264d8d2482b:0xf6be7f6160faedaf"}

They were holding the door for each other and then was holding it for me, waiting for me to catch up and come out. Before I got to the door they were approached by a lady. She told my children to either go out the door or go find their moma or daddy and they they were letting the air out. I was appalled!! I asked her what was the problem. I asked her name and she mumbled something and I asked her again and she told me she didn\u2019t owe me an explanation!!  Come to find out she was the owner. The salesman walked up to me try to find out what was going on. She began to butt in, so then the gentleman walked me out the door to discuss it. it started to rain, he offered to grab an umbrella for me. We make our way into the building and the owner runs up to the salesman and tells him he is her employee and He better not walk me out the door.

The managers there try their hardest to make sure they get you the best rates and best deal to fit your wants and needs. They have highly trained mechanics to help with any mechanical problems you might need, and the service department will make sure everything is done quickly and properly. Don't even get me started on their detail department, wow, that's the only word that comes to mind when I think of how clean and detailed my car was when I purchased it. When you come to SKCO Automotive your greeted by a wonderful team of experts whose sole purpose is to have you leave in the vehicle you wanted and happy that you chose their establishment.

About two weeks later, I noticed one of the lug nuts was almost falling off. One round and it would have been off on the ground .This infuriates me even more, because I specifically instructed the technician to make sure I could get the lugs off with a regular lug wrench, as I do my own tire rotation and oil change every 5-7.5k. Three of the lugs were so tight I had to stand on the hands. Again, one was falling off, three were almost impossible to remove.\n2. of course I got talked into the 89$ alignment\n3. Its not my vehicle ( wife ), so it took me a couple of weeks to notice the bad vibration at 70mph, so back to the shop to get tires re balanced, which I already pay 75$ for. I did not go back to the Mavis because I don't trust them. They couldn't even tighten my lugs\n4. When I get to the new tire place, I find out that all of my tires are set to 41 psi. 41!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Now the tires are cupping, which means they will need to be replaced soon.\n5. One of the tires was out of balance\n\nThey were super quick to get an alignment and do it, but they couldn't even get my lugs on and get the tire pressure right?\nThis place is an embarrassment.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1591476660676, "text": "We apologize, Phillip, We at Mavis believe you deserve nothing short of the best.

I ordered the 3rd set of tires down the list that were recommended for my vehicle (2017 Ford Transit 250), Michelin Defender T+H. I work 6-7 days a week as a contractor so Sunday was really my only option to get tires on my work vehicle. I arrived early for my appointment, confirmed my appointment, and confirmed the tires with the employee behind the sales counter. I confirmed that the tires I ordered will be the best fit for my vehicle with the employee and he said they will be great for it. So my wife picked me up and we went about our day. I received a phone call at 11:18 informing me the tires are installed on my vehicle but they\u2019re not going to work then proceeded to tell me they can order the correct tires for it but they won\u2019t be here till Tuesday July 21st. I explained I can\u2019t just leave my vehicle up there not working for 2 days, and asked if they can just put my old tires back on the van. The employee responded with yes but we will have to charge you for mount and balance, my only request was to install the tires with the best tread on the rear which he agreed to. I received a second call at 4:10 stating my vehicle was ready but that they close at 5 and needed to be there before 5 to pick it up. I arrived paid the clerk $75.96, received my keys, walked out to my truck to find my tires low, tire light on and the rear tires (almost bald) on the passenger side and the front tires (still had a good amount of tread on them) on the drivers side which was not what I asked. I asked if they could add some air to my tires and get my tire light to turn off. They did add air to my tires but when I asked about the tire light the manager had to stop putting Alabama stickers on his truck brought a computer tpms sensor out and showed me very quickly the tire pressure was fine and told me this would be expected with used tires... My tire light never went off like he said it would. Today is July 29th and I have yet to receive a phone call stating my tires have arrived or a update. I emailed Mavis corporate on July 23rd and have not received a response or anything. Never once did anyone apologize for the inconvenience that this mishap caused me that was clearly Mavis Tires fault and caused me to pay for their mistake. I at no point complained or expressed any frustration to the employees there because I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. I don\u2019t ever leave bad reviews for businesses because I know what that can do to a business, but I did want to take a minute and send you a email about my experience. I ended up purchasing a set of tires from Discount Tires on Hwy 280 and it was a great experience. I called them in the morning they called me as soon as the tires arrived, and installed them the same day in less then 1 hour after leaving my vehicle with them. Upon arrival there was no tire light on and the tires had the proper amount of air in them. I hope this email helps in one way or form, I\u2019m not complaining but just find it hard to understand why Mavis Discount tire would charge a customer any amount of money for a issue/mistake on their end.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1596119205061, "text": "We're sorry, Nick Lions. we apologize your appointment time was not honored.

When we arrived today for the appointment, the man at the register told us it would be $259, which is much higher than we were quoted originally and from other tire stores. We told him that we had been quoted $224 including product, labor and taxes, and he said no it's $259.  We feel like we were victims of a bait and switch. We chose not to accept the new price, and we left. We will never go to this business again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889243046b8fdb5:0x8416411afed1d2d3"}

He said something to the effect of why pay for a new one when I can fix that one for less than half the price. He done great on it.

Of all the things I've took him to fix over the years, I've never had an issue with any of their work that required me to take it back. Also my a/c quit on my truck due to advance Auto selling me the wrong part. Long story short advance Auto settled with me on just giving me every single part to put a complete new a/c system on it. So I stopped by Dixon's to see how much to flush it out after the the parts were put on on plus charge the system with freon. They priced it to me.

Her boss suggested Automasters due to good experiences he has had there. They told her the tire she was driving on was dangerous because it had developed a bulge. They also told her she needed new rear brakes. I'm sure most of you are like me tired of being ripped by dishonest repair places. Well, to my surprise this place was honest, they told her exactly what was wrong, and fixed it right, and they gave me a reasonable price.  I highly recommend Automasters for that reason. Just give them a call, talk to them, I think you will agree. I'm so glad we have the ability to review places now.

They miss diagnosed it and I paid over $500.00 for repair. I had my truck 2 days before it started doing the same thing again. I called to let them know and got the vehicle back over to them. They had my truck a little over a week and claim it was not doing anything for them and that it was old codes showing up. Well since I have had my vehicle back it once again started doing the same thing showing up the same codes. I decided to take it to another dealership and to my surprise the codes that they told me was old was not old they just cleared them instead of fixing my truck. I'm very upset because they repeatedly lied to me over and over. I will not recommend the service dept at all. They just played around with my truck and I called to let Myla know that it was doing the same thing again and that I took it to another dealership and they showed me how codes had been cleared and showed me the history codes.

I walked out of that dealership with an uplifted spirit and felt through the whole process that I was receiving amazing fellowship and as if I were being edified through this whole process.

I told him they could stop and I'll bring in the light myself after buying it cheaper elsewhere. He tells me I will still have to pay $135 for the diagnostic. No problem. He comes back and tells me it's already in. I ask well where is my car? He says they're finishing up. 45 minutes later he comes back and tells me that they put a new light in and it didnt work.

Things didn't go quite as we had planned. Our SUV was cutting out pretty bad on the highway. It was getting worse the closer we got to Mobile. I contacted my friend who's daughter lives in Mobile to see if she might know of a service place. I talked with her daughter and she informed me that her husband, Kyle, worked for Joe Bullard Cadillac. She gave me the number for the service department and said to speak with Haley.  About this time the check engine light came on in our vehicle. It was flashing on and off, then would stay lit.\nWhen I spoke with Haley in the service department she asked about the service engine light. When I told her it had been flashing intermittently she was immediately concerned and said we should get stopped as quickly as we could to avoid internal engine damage.  She then helped us get started with finding a tow service. We were 50 miles aWay and had four people so their usual towing service couldn't do it, but she got the ball rolling for us. She gave me her direct phone number so I could call if I needed anything.\nOnce we got to the dealership Kyle helped us get a loaner car while ours was being repaired. Haley kept us informed as they learned what was wrong. Our technician, Mike, came in on Saturday to work on our vehicle because we needed to leave to head back to Missouri on Sunday.\nTo make a long story short...God used all of these people to help us during a difficult time. They made this experience so much less stressful than it could've been. THEY WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND TO HELP US! And, they did it all with a smile.

What I didn't like was that the mechanics were excessively rough with my vehicle. I had to have it towed and the towing company left it at the gate. Christian got me a loaner car, which I appreciated very much. When I picked up the loaner there were 2 guys who were trying to get it started to get it up to the shop. I needed to grab a couple things out of my car so I stopped to do that. For some reason they needed to open the back hatch. I was traveling with my animals so I had a large kennel in the back. I watched them put my seats down (rather roughly) and sling my kennel from the back to atop the back seats. It made me cringe but at this point I needed to get going as I had some stops to make and  I thought surely they knew what they were doing, this is a Cadillac dealership afterall and these cars cost a lot. They will surely be careful... When I got my car back, instead of them putting the vehicle back they way they found it, the kennel was still strown across the back. (As a plus though, it was washed! Which I appreciated since I had been on the road and try to take care of my car!) When I went to move the kennel back in place I noticed that there are scrapes across the plastic sides in the back. Greeeeaaaaaat. But, at that point I was leaving to head back to my home state and couldn't worry about it. It was more important to get home safe. They told me in addition to the battery that I needed new air filters, a rear wiper blade, and the throttle body cleaned, all easy enough for me to do myself. So, now I am here doing said maintenance and when I popped the hood I immediately noticed that my positive battery terminal clip has been broken and won't stay shut. Great. I am now back home, 3 states away. I will be back to the area, and am considering moving my family there but if they don't make this right I will find a different dealership to maintenance at.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1517174513045, "text": "Hi Jami,\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave your review and detailed feedback.

The problem today was a broken window regulator on the rear driver's side.  My wife has been the sole driver of this car.  We have no children in then home.  My conservative guess is that this window has been lowered and raised no more than 10 times in its aborted lifetime.  My wife was told a plastic roller had broken.

During the second year we owned the car the driver side dash assembly fell off the dash while my wife was driving.  At around the 4-5 year of ownership your service supervisor convinced my wife that she needed to replace all four tires (around 10,000 miles) because they had \"dry-rotted.\" ($800)  I've owned two Cadillac De Ville's prior to this, and have never experienced what has to be either poor construction, low-quality parts, or untruthful service managers.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da8e0caaef5:0xa8eb3c2a1737d68b"}

His extensive knowledge of the vehicle I wanted (XTS) and the history of Cadillac itself impressed me by far. The hospitality didn't stop with Mustafa. Roosevelt Harris also did a fine job answering all the questions I had about the different cars and prices. He also mentioned a couple of nice restaurants we could try out while visiting Atlanta, GA which we did and absolutely loved. Curtis Williams came by and personally greeted us and also had a nice conversation with my fiance. Last, but definitely not least, Jon McCartney was absolutely amazing (and not just because he actually knows where Winnfield, LA is located lol). He worked very hard to get the financing I needed to get the exact vehicle I wanted. It was a hard sale for me, but he showed us that he wouldn't give up. I really appreciated all the time that each of them took out to make our experience the best car buying experience we have had. I would recommend this dealership without thinking twice (I already have mentioned them to others), and I will be bringing others to come do business with Joe Bullard Cadillac in Mobile, AL.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da8e0caaef5:0xa8eb3c2a1737d68b"}

We saw one on the interstate and decided to go look at them. When we got there it was freezing and windy and Darren Robinson was in the parking lot moving cars. He offered his help and we told him we were in town to Christmas shop not spend all day at a dealership, we just wanted to try the car on for size. he escorted us inside for coffee and cocoa and went to get the car. we test drove it. we loved it but we were not there to spend all day at the dealership. we left our personal information to be reviewed and were going to shop when Darren notified us that we would be using the cadillac for the day via loaner form approval. we really enjoyed using the car. we Christmas shopped all day and when we returned to the dealership we had been approved for the car with our payments within dollars of request. Jon McCartney had to have been the most professional financial manager i have ever encountered. He was a real person who made us feel right at home and comfortable to speak openly. very friendly and personable. then Roosevelt Harris enters the picture. a gem. a diamond in the rough. so charismatic so joyful and helpful and accomodating. I cannot put into words how much Darren helped to familiarize us with the cue and features. he was so knowledgable of the cars systems. he was an absolute treasure. I cant say but one thing about Joe Bullards team, \"you are doing something right\". I got hugs from everyone when i left. i felt like i was part of a family there. I even got a text message from Darren on Christmas morning wishing us a merry Christmas. i literally spent 2 hrs tops at the dealership and received the most beautiful CHristmas gift I could have ever dreamed of. but the most inportant thing was the environment and kindness that we experienced while there. oh and my son loved the lounge with computers and coffee/cocoa which made his time there enjoyable also. we will definitely reccomend Joe Bullard Cadillac to friends and family and we will definitely be repeat customers ourselves. my only hope is that we have the privilege of having the same staff in years to come.

We had to wait so long the detail crew had left so we had to bring our car back the next day to get it detailed and floor mats put in because they forgot them in the car. The sales crew had little knowledge of the features of the car. Sandy Sansing name has always represented professionalism to us although in the past we dealt with the Ford dealer in Daphne.

While you were out looking at buildings, our staff members were assisting other customers in the store as well as on the telephone. We have ordered signs to put on our lot to let future customers know to step inside if no one comes out. Hopefully this will eliminate any unsatisfying experiences in the future.

They made us a proposal, \"If we  can cut you a deal on a new one, can we have your business?\" Well, of course if the price is right then, yes. We drive a grey CX-5, everything is great, but they are calling this car \"new\" and it has 7500 miles on it. Well, it's never been owned they say its a \"demo\" car. Then my husband tells them he wants to be at $19,999 financed for this car (yes, we were putting several thousand down - we didn't expect a miracle deal). They only get it down to $20,010. Then he says, well if you throw in remote start, we will take it. They came back with each of us paying half so, we decided to buy the car.\n\nThey told us that they could get us a killer interest rate of less than one percent. When we got back to financing, it was another story entirely. We ended up wit ha 4.99 interest rate because \"less than one percent is only for \"new\" cars\" well when you were trying to negotiate this deal you said it was a new car and now that we are financing you've classified it as a \"used\" car.\n\nAfter we left, we began driving to my dad's house which is probably 100 miles away. The check engine light came on before we got there. We had O'Reily's check the computer and they said it was low oil pressure. We called and they has us call the Mazda tow truck to come pick it up and take it to the nearest Mazda which was in Birmingham. (They told me to get a rental during this time and they would pay me back.) They called for me to come pick it up three or four days later saying it was a computer problem and it was fixed. When we got there, 4 error messages were popping up on the dash. We left the car and called the sales manager at Julio Jones Mazda who never called us back and said he never got our message.\n\nI went in to talk to the Julio Jones Mazda sales manager about this problem on Monday. They had me sit there for a while and eventually said they spoke with the technician at the Birmingham Mazda and they said I must have taken my foot off the brake too early and it caused the car to throw up those error messages. So, they blamed me for the problem.\n\nLater, the technician from Birmingham called us personally and said they had screwed up and not fixed it properly to begin with. So, the sales manager at Julio Jones Mazda was either misinformed or blatantly lied to make me think it was my fault.\n\nWell, we finally got the car back and it has been running fine. No more issues. However, they still haven't paid me back for the rental and it's been almost a month. I called about this and they said they lost my receipt and asked me for the amount again. I still haven't been paid and they haven't bothered to call me back. That was a week ago.\n\nSimultaneously, I took the car in to the Julio Jones service center to get the remote start put in on a Thursday. They told me it would take a day, maybe two, to get this done. The service center is telling me that I owe our half of the remote start that was supposed to be included in the deal. Obviously, they didn't include it in the price like they said they would. Also, they had to give me a rental car because they couldn't get the remote start to work. It's now Monday and I have no clue when I am going to get my car back. I called today and they said they still couldn't get the remote start to work.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't wish this headache on anyone and I wouldn't recommend this dealership to anyone. It has been an absolute nightmare since we signed for this vehicle.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1554413123364, "text": "Hi Dylan, thank you for your feedback.

The employee further told me that their delivery truck would be there on Wednesday. He seemed to indicate the truck would bring newer dated batteries. I left my name and number but never got a call. The following Monday I visited the store again and spoke to the same employee. He checked and said they didn't get any newer batteries in. He said he was going to the Alexander City store that afternoon and would see if they had a newer battery. He again said he would call me either way and let me know. I confirmed that he still had the note with my name and number. And again he never called. I sent an email to AutoZone's national website regarding their lack of customer service. They replied and said that my email was being forwarded to the district manager and that I would be contacted within 24 to 48 hours. That didn't happen either. I sent a second email to AutoZone letting them know that the district manager never contacted me. They said my second email was also forwarded to the district manager.A day or two later the district manager finally attempted to contact me.

I let them know my concern with not being able to get it back to the dealership and the woman didn\u2019t care. I ended up making in to town and the truck shut off on me which meant I had to pay to get it towed less than a mile to the dealership. Even though I had a appointment I was told that they had to work me in because it was electrical at that point since it shut down on me (even when I expressed my concern two days earlier). Our battery was put in wrong when we bought it at a auto parts store. We dropped it off Thursday and went with out it until the following Tuesday.

Took my 6.0 LQ4 block, crank and heads to have them reworked, cleaned and check to see if they were still within spec limits. We discussed engine gaskets rebuild kits. I left and then called on the phone to discuss more pricing and gaskets again. I went back to stewarts to bring some more parts to be cleaned but on that visit talked again about rebuild kits and gaskets. Now each time i talked to the owner about the gasket sets i asked, were they felpro? his answer every time was yes they will be felpro. He gave me a price which was little more then what i had search online for but i decided to go with his kit since the gaskets were definitely felpro . well is snowed the next day and roads were closed so i had to wait another day for him to finish. roads were still bad so he came in late but he was finished around lunch time. So when i get there to pick up my parts i ask where is the rebuild kit. The machinist shows me the box and the gaskets sets are not felpro, they are Victor reins gaskets. I refused to buy the kit because he told me a they would contain felpro. The machinist told me that felpro and victor reins were made by the same company that they were the exact same gaskets. That was his first lie too me. Those are two entirely different companys, with different pricing and materials. so we deducted the kit and now i owe for the machine work done, which is 345.00 I pay the balance go home and start unloading the block and notice the cam bearing that they installed for me were damaged from the installation too. Took it back and the owner said he doesn't know any other way to put those bearings in. well duh!!! but you don't damage them when they go in , if you do damage them then you take them out and install new ones. but they sent me home with that crap. so i decided to look over the heads real good since things are already not good. well the heads are aluminum heads , they look as if someone took a wire brush to clean the mating surfaces on the heads. they are scratched badly. there are several scratches going across the from one cylinder to the other which will leak when it is installed back on the block. So i took the heads back to stewarts this morning and asked to talk to someone about this and the owner wasn't there but the machinist was. so i showed the head to the machinist and asked what he did to it. he said he milled it. i asked is that acceptable? he said yes. i asked if he could show me any where in writing, online or any mechanic that can tell me that those scratches on the mating surface of the head was acceptable .The machinist looked at me and said pick my head up and get the hell out of there. You can imagine what my response was. :) but I'm not happy with this and the place of business is just horrible. I have been building engines for over 23 years and i have never seen anyone tell me that scratches on a aluminum head was acceptable to install. They refused to take of this and now i have to take the heads and have them resurfaced if they can even be resurfaced again. i also heve to take the block and crank to another machine shop to have them check and correct everything stewarts touched. BEWARE SHOTTY WORK AND BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. STAY AWAY if you want good work performed.\n\nYour Desired Resolution:\nAt this point all i want is a complete refund for the services they performed. I tried to go back to talk to them and i was told to get the hell out of their store. The work performed was bad and i don't fell comfortable letting them touch anything else of mine.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889cb974de7cfd5:0xb07e55d35fc40cf9"}

This is not my first Hyundai since reinventing itself and blowing our minds. Needless to say I purchased what is now my 5th Hyundai.  However, i'm here to brag on the man who walked my husband and I through this entire process in this humid Alabama weather.  Initially, I came in to take advantage of the $50 GIFT CARD that Hyundai was offering for simply test driving its vehicles, but I also knew that I would potentially be driving off the lot with something new as well. Brandon Blagg was awesome from the gate. He stood and walked over to me, invited me to his desk, and inquired concerning my business. A few questions later, a copy of my license, and \"BAM\" we were test driving a base model Santa Fe.' One would think that this guy designed these vehicle with his level of knowledge concerning them. Recalling that I have own several vehicles in my lifetime, it is feasible to understand that we have dealt with our share of sales consultants. This is by far the first person who not only informed us of what we would potentially enjoy about the vehicle, but patiently explained in detail its benefits, and demonstrated  to us its functionality. He took a base model vehicle and literally painted a picture that lifted it beyond it's level. He hung out with us for over an hour doing comparisons and contrasts. He was honest concerning pro and cons, but never negative.. not one time. For him every vehicle had its benefits, and for every person there was vehicle that fit them. THIS IS WHAT HE DID! He didn't interfere with our choice, but he made sure that we would be satisfied once we left  the lot for good. In the end we ended up purchasing a Santa Fe' SEL 2.4 engine with both the Convenience and Premium Package. He didn't use a hustler tactic to cause us to go for a higher grade, it was simply his transparency and patience that ultimately led to our selection. Recalling that this was in 90 + degree weather, this man didn't stop until the tires shined.  He made me laugh, shared stories, explained who was whom of the CEO vs. COO, and also wasn't shy around me whatsoever. He even blew bubble gum bubbles for our delightful 6 year old who stood amazed at the excellence his gum blowing abilities. Brandon Blagg, job well done. You deserve all that's coming for your hard work and dedication to service. Aside from our direct experience with Brandon, everyone rocked. Their pleasantness was superb, two of the women conversed with me, they offered treats to my babies, and others smiled and waved. There wasn't a rude attitude in the building. The lobby and bathrooms are well designed and clean. As lengthly a process that car buying could be, they have enough going for themselves to make you relax and enjoy your time.\n\nThanks Again, Tae A.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b128e81df3f:0x8980930b2c0cfffb"}

I test drove the vehicle on a Monday and pointed out a few cosmetic issues that I feel should have been addressed prior to placing the car up for sale (only a few hundred dollars to correct).  That combined with the manager coming outside to talk to me smoking a cigarette, should have clued me in to the professionalism and pride taken at the dealership.\nI was asked that if the problems I pointed out were corrected,  would I purchase the car? I agreed.  The following day I recieved the bill of sale and I noticed that the price shown on the internet was not the price shown on the bill of sale. When I asked the manager, the explanation I recieved was that the car was headed to auction the day I saw it and the price on the internet was the auction price, not the sale price (what does that have to do with me? And the price I came intending to pay is the price that I saw advertised ).  I was then told that they would sell it to me at the internet price but I would have to pay for the repairs which would be $400+.  Since the price was still under book value,  I agreed.  I was then told that the car would be repaired, HAND WAXED and ready for me in a couple days.  I was informed Friday that the car was ready. I drove up Saturday only to find the car just as dirty as it was when I test drove it on Monday(they sprayed the dirt off but there was still hair and dirt on the inside of the car.... wheel wells were dirty, etc). Of all the cars I've bought,  no one has ever tried to delivered me a dirty car! I discussed this with the manager who appeared to care nothing about it.  I left with no intention of buying the car,  but the salesman,\nMr. Willie, called and said that he would take care of it...... he took it to a local shop and had it washed and vacuumed.  As a customer, when money is spent, whether it be $30 or $30,000, you want to feel good about spending it. That's not the feeling I left with.  In the end, I purchased what I feel is a great vehicle.   But the service is what will definitely keep me from being a repeat customer or recommending to anyone else.

This was the worst car buying experience ever. My original salesman was nice but knew nothing about a car at all. My battery had a dead cell when I first purchased it. I took it back for the battery to be replace and it took four hours to get a new battery. I asked them to take me to the service center to find out what was taking so long and the guy that work in the front said my battery has been there for two hours. And the guys that were supposed to be working were playing and joking around the next time I needed work done was three days later I noticed the bumper on the car was popped out of place, the 12 volt adapters didn't work, the service light had come on, the key tumbler was messed up in the ignition. I went to try and get that fixed and they told me it would be two days well I asked if they would give me a replacement car to get back and forth to work they told me no they don't do that. Ok so I paid for the work myself. A few days later I discovered my account was overdrawn 500 dollars and when I ask the finance manager why my account was charged and I paid 1000  in cash his response was well we wanted 1500 for the car and u couldn't do that. So they took it upon themselves to take the other 500 dollars. Now after they agreed to give my money back.  I waited a week and called and he said I could pick it up across the street so I went across the street from them and the guy over there didn't know what I was talking about so he called Cleveland Moore the guy I've been having problems with to asked him where I needed to go Cleveland didn't know that he was on speaker phone and said \" she so damn stupid\" he really called me stupid and then when I informed him he was on speaker phone he said so. Meaning he didn't care. So I feel disrespected and I was so upset I called a manager who said it will be handled and I will be waiting to find out the results of this because if they are not satisfactory I would like to speak with the owner myself.

Further more 5 days later, it's still listed on the internet as available. So NOW I'm positive it's to lure customers in. If someone is awaiting approval for financing on this vehicle, the very least Jim Burke Hyundai should do is post a flag on the car saying; \"Sold Pending Approval of Financing\". In my opinion, that would be \" Professional Business Protocol\".\n\nI'm of the opinion that they might possibly do this to get customers to come in when it looks like a certified car is lower priced then average.\n\nI believe they tried to do a \"bait & switch\" maneuver on me by showing me a same priced vehicle that was the same color but a different make and model.\n\nThe sales mgr. also told me he would find me a Pre-certified car in the same price range that same day, however he never followed through or even had the professionalism to call me back one way or the other. I called him later that afternoon, I didn't want the other car I looked at, at another dealership to get sold, & asked if he could call me back by 6pm  to tell me if he had found another car so I could make a decision. He never called.\n\nBottom line... before you make the trip to see a specific car, make absolutely sure it's still for sale.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b128e81df3f:0x8980930b2c0cfffb"}

And if you do, please, make sure you ask them to print and show you any TSB's (Technical Service Bulletin) on the vehicle you are considering. A TSB is not like a safety recall and therefore the dealership is not required to make the repair. Make them prove to you that they have repaired all of the items on each and every TSB. However, I can almost promise you that they will not make the repairs before selling you the vehicle. I purchased a used 2007 Hyundai Entourage van from Jim Burke Hyundai's used car dealership in March this year after having purchased a new Elantra from them last year. I did not make them show me the TSB's because I wasn't aware of them at the time. Unfortunately there are several of them on the van I purchased. One of them had to do with a part that causes called the \"Junction Box Switch\" or Instrument Panel Module that causes the battery to discharge. That means when you go out to your car it simply won't start!! I found the TSB on it and it says in large print that it was issued to all Hyundai General Managers and that the repair should be made before retail sale of the van. Many of us believe that purchasing a used car from what you think is a reputable dealership will protect you from these type issues. Well...this dealership is not reputable and should be put out of business. I have contacted them to give them a change to try and make this right to keep customers happy and try to get return business but they obviously are not intersted in this.

The vehicle in question was brought in because the ignition switch was defective. Due to the connector going to the anti-theft module was not making connection. After I spent 30 minutes on the phone with the chevy dealer I found the connector was not available. I instructed your daughter to go and get a complete unit with a new pig tail. After explaining to them that a code reading would bring no results to identify the issue. I did allow the vehicle to sit in my parking lot until the problem could be addressed. Most places charge several hundred dollars to do this. Several days later they brought in a switch from a junk yard that was ripped out and badly damaged. I told them they could not use part due to being damaged. After a couple days a night time worker offered to help with diagnostics, he brought his scan tool and tried to diagnosis the issue. Found the anti-theft module was not making any connection with the vehicles pcm. He spent over an hour trying to help your daughter for free. He normally charges $70 an hour for this. We have gone out of our way to help your daughter every way we could. Including letting the vehicle sit for over a week. No way did your stand out in the cold while we laughed at her.

Wish I could give them no stars. I called and asked for 2 tires for my car, they gave me the total price for both being installed for $155.16 before taxes. I told them let's do it and to order the tires. They called me back a few hours later telling me the tires were in. I drove 30 minutes down 280 for the tires. I pulled up and they told me they would get me right in and taken cared of. I went inside for a few minutes and saw my car was up on the lift, I waited for about 15-20 minutes and noticed my car was out of the shop, so I asked them if it was finished, and waited and waited and waited, and after talking to three different people it turned out they didn't do anything to the car at all. They just pulled it into the shop lifted it up, and then lowered it and pulled it out, and never relayed the information about why they did this. When I finally got someone to talk to the guys, they said that they didn't have the tires I ordered, and I told them that they had called me and told me they did and that I have a voicemail from them stating that they did, and I played the voicemail for them, and then talked to the guy directly that left me the voicemail. So, they go and look and turns out they do have the tires after all. They pull my car back in and put the tires on, then ring me up for $211.00, and I'm like, \"I'm not paying that\", then I have to talk to the manager that's \"running\" the shop, and finally after 3 hours I get the price they told me, thank goodness I had the voicemail from them for proof, and I got out. Never. Going. Back. Maybe the most unprofessional atmosphere and experience I've ever had with a business. Truly disappointing in every way. They were also very rude to the other customers that were waiting patiently as well. They would blatantly ignore you when you'd approach them with a question about your vehicle or the situation they were putting you in. Just straight up walk past you and not say a word to you or look you in the eyes. If and when they finally did talk to you, they just mumbled their words and you couldn't understand a thing they were saying. They need to clean house, get rid of the manager and all. If not that, then just do the entire state of Alabama a favor and close up shop completely, because you're not doing any good for anyone. Like, you're not even doing your jobs, like at all. Since I left, I've actually been wondering \"what's even the point of this shop\"? The guys are all just hanging out. Finally the guy that did put the tires on my car was just some dude, that wasn't even in a uniform like the rest of the automotive crew was. He was just in some shirt and ball cap with sun glasses, so I'd at least like to thank the random guy that probably doesn't even work there that actually did the work. Maybe he was an angel or something....? If it turns out he is an actual angel and it's some kind of real miracle, it's still not worth going back for.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889166b0910fbb5:0x6f7e7664c9e1abdf"}

Wouldn\u2019t even listen to me trying to explain my situation and that they told me on the phone they would service me if I got there before 7. He just walked off while I was talking and I had to follow him inside. Only once I asked to speak to the manager did he explain it was because they were full and wouldn\u2019t finish before 8. I asked them to please help me out as my wife had to get to work tomorrow and my spare tire was going flat. They were no help so I went to NTB tires down the street and they quickly took care of me.

I went in back in April because I needed new brake pads and rotors. After waiting about 5 hours for them to install, it was finally done. About a month or 2 later, my vehicle starts to squeal anytime I apply my brakes. I took it into Goodyear at the beginning of October as the sound was getting unbearable. They checked my brakes and said that the rotors were cheap and needed to be fixed. They suggested me to take my vehicle back to fix the shorty work Mavis did to get warranty work as Mavis said I had a \u201cwarranty\u201d. The next day October 3 I took it into Mavis. Sure enough after looking at my car for 30 minutes my calipers were hanging down. I waited another 4 hours for them to put 2 calipers on. Why I paid them another 400 dollars is beyond me. As I was leaving there parking lot my vehicle was squealing when I applied the brakes but it seemed to be better. About a week ago, I noticed my vehicle started to shake and when I backed up it sounded like I had a flat tire. At this point I know I was intentionally being conned out of over 800 dollars from Mavis tire. I take my vehicle to pep boys on Sunday.\n\nMy calipers were loose again. They didn\u2019t tighten the damn bolts on the calipers. One caliper bolt was gone. The other one was about to be gone. Could have caused a huge accident. This is a terrible place of business. Eugene has no integrity in my opinion. I want to get my money back.\n\nI called customer service today talked to an answering service. Customer service never called me back. Please avoid this place at every cost.\n\nI have tried to send the picture of the receipt to the gentleman's phone. He asked me to take a picture and text him...

We dropped our car off to get 2 new rear tires.

We left and the tire pressure sensor was still on so we brought it back and waited 30 mins for them to try to fix it and they said it was fixed and would go off after we drove it 10 miles. We waited 2 days and it never went off so we took it back and had to wait for them to go get new sensors and install them. We wasted so much time for them to try to figure out what they were doing.

On the one hand, Anthony, the sales person who I dealt with, is really nice, helpful, knowledgeable, and wants his customers to be happy. On the other hand, there were so many problems with my install, it just seems like things are really disorganized over there and quality control might be a little lacking.\n\nI went to The Car Stereo Shop because my 2005 car didn\u2019t even have an aux port, and I wanted one. But Anthony then informed me I could get a video head unit which would allow me to use Android Auto like a new car can, and that sounded awesome, so I decided to do that instead of just getting an aux port (I wouldn\u2019t really need the aux port since I\u2019d be able to play music with Bluetooth or USB cord). Also, he suggested a speaker upgrade from factory speakers (without being pushy about it at all), and I realized it would be nice to have non-factory speakers for a change. So I ordered an install of the head unit, speakers, and a new Sirius satellite antenna since the old 2005 one wouldn\u2019t work with the head unit.\n\nThen the problems began. For example:\n\n--When I went to pick up the car after the install, the Sirius satellite antenna had never been installed.\n--When i went to pick up the car after the Sirius satellite antenna was installed, the microphone (needed for hands-free phone calls & Android auto commands) no longer worked.\n--When I went to pick up the car after the microphone was fixed, I found a small chunk of my dash had been ripped out during the latest repair.\n--The Sirius radio kept cutting out, and when I asked them about it they said it was just the trees blocking the signal, but finally I was so frustrated I contacted Sirius and they sent me a replacement antenna, and after replacing the antenna the radio didn\u2019t cut out at all so it turns out I was right.\n--Also, there were numerous times when scheduling was difficult or delayed because they were \u201cshort a tech.\u201d They always seemed to be \u201cshort a tech.\u201d\n--Also, the billing system was really disorganized. There were times we\u2019d be looking around for a paper receipt to see how much I had paid them, how much they\u2019d quoted me on price, etc., rather than just looking it up on a computer.\n\nSo the whole process of the install had a lot of issues. BUT, now that the install is done, I am really happy with my new stereo system. And I\u2019m grateful to Anthony for all his advice. He made me aware of potential stereo improvements I hadn\u2019t considered (video screen, Android auto, new speakers), without trying to push stuff on me. Also, the shop did a really nice job crafting custom molds for the Tweeters and installing everything so that it looks natural in the car. And Anthony couldn\u2019t have been nicer about all of the issues I was having with the install and making them right. He was genuinely apologetic about everything and worked really hard to get fixes done as soon as possible.\n\nSo if you\u2019re looking for a new car stereo, I do think it\u2019s worth visiting The Car Stereo Shop and talking to Anthony. He\u2019s great. Just be aware of the potential issues -- who knows, maybe they\u2019ve improved things there by now.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2a91e4c1211:0xdbfbe1cc1f0cf71f"}

We almost made the deal twice. After making our down payment and payment requirements very clear, the sales persons involved went to get approval. When they returned, the vehicle had been discounted, but they added a \"fee.\" That's the only thing he would say, \"a fee.\" They were trying to deliberately be vauge and, in our opinion, dishonest. After discussing their \"fee,\" we never actually achieved full disclosure. We were told the vehicle was at a different dealership within our city and we could go there to finalize the deal. They said that they would call ahead and we should just go over there. Our credit had already been run multiple times, and we had received approval from the credit company. With this in mind, we went to the other dealership location. As we arrived at the other location, they hadn't been given all the details as we had been led to believe. So the process began again, running in circles of double talk and running our credit again... We left at closing time and expected a phone call the next day to complete the deal... That has yet to happen days later. I used to have great respect for Greenway Automotive. It appears that Greenway has only taken over these dealerships at face value, and the same crooks that were already in place are still running things just like they always have. Avoid Greenway Honda in Florence, AL, and Greenway Chevy in Muscle Shoals, AL, if you are planning to make a deal on a used car. They are not to be trusted unless you have the cash to pay up front or your own financing.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1620053636252, "text": "LJ, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.

The problems began when the tech showed up over two and a half hours  late to the appointment, then he informed her that they ordered the wrong glass, and that the price would now be over $900 to get the right glass.  When I called them to ask if they would stand by their original quote I was given lots of excuses about how their receptionist made a mistake and that we just spoke to the wrong person, basically saying it wasn't their problem.  After a short argument about standing behind your word, she requested a copy of the quote (knowing full well that it was quoted over the phone) and hung up on me.  I called back and was told that they couldn't afford to even give me a discount after wasting three hours of my wife's time, much less stick to the original quote they gave us.\n\nI can understand making a mistake, or having an employee make a mistake, but at the end of the day small businesses fail or prosper based on their image and customer support.

I write this review after driving an hour and a half to do business with them.  First off all, they do more than trucks.  30 inch rims for your car they do it, headlights, taillights, lifts, flares, tonneau covers, etc... if you want it they can get it.  There prices are hard to beat.  But let me talk about what sets them apart from everyone besides their exceptional pricing.  From the moment you walk in you are treated with respect and that they are glad to see you there.  They listen very intently to what you want whether in person or on the phone.  This is missed by so many other places.  They go through getting prices as well as can show you options.  They do this to make sure you get exactly what you want for the best price.  While doing so they take notes on the conversation to ensure they don't have to ask you several times because they forgot.  Making sure they stay on top of it and making everything move flawless.  The business is very well maintained and the showroom is definitely a showroom, not just a display, spotless.  Respect and honesty is projected so loudly by the staff, you will feel like its your own family that runs the business.  I can't say enough about this because I have been there a few times for different purchases and  the entire staff is friendly as well as great to interact with.  As I return to them next week to make another purchase, driving an hour and a half versus using the internet, I know I am meeting people who are like family, getting the best price, the right part, quality parts, but also the best service that I have seen in the state.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bfdfe2467e0eb:0xd5c2a691b573b7bb"}

Of course there's more to the story but enough has been said to bring the customers awareness up..for it is my duty & obligation to expose such when at the customers expenses.\nIt speaks volumes when you bring things to their attention yet they fail to acknowledge you or allow an explanation....so I chose to terminate my employment and since then...I've been trying to contact those in charge so that I may retrieve my other toolbox at the Pelham location but have yet been able to. Goes to show the level of care when they lose a highly trained technician because the so called service manager has no real knowledge of automobiles but is allowed to make decisions above his experience...but I'm being hindered in accessing all my tools since i can't the owners to meet me there to get my belongings. The Pelham store momentarily closed due to lack of business but yet they don't see as to why when it's self evident.\nPlease take your business elsewhere...even if it's to one like Hellen Keller...you'd have a better chance of getting professional lasting repairs.\n\nAttention to management: I need my tools from the Pelham location and have notified Chris and txt Rick only to receive absolutely no reply. If interested in the truth....please contact me....", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1496168867705, "text": "Hello Frank,\nWe always appreciate receiving reviews from our valued customers based on services received.

(Employee)\nDate of incident: 2/20/21 - 4:30-5:00pm.\n\n\ud83d\udd25Bought a refurbished starter from there a few years ago. Returned it because it went bad and had a warranty. Did not want to deal with another refurbished starter, so I requested a brand new one. Was told they cannot get a brand new one which is fine. So they told me I could return the defective refurbished starter I had for a refund so I can use that refund on buying a new starter from another store. At that time, that particular employee was real helpful and kind to me.\n\nThen the incident on 2/20/21 happened when I returned on that date with my defective starter. was dealing with the store manager Mike and his employee Thomas D. at the time. I was told that the starter needed to test bad in order for me to get a refund which is fine, because I had my mechanic test the starter beforehand and I recorded a video as evidence. After waiting a good few minutes because it seemed like something was wrong with the machine, the store manager Mike comes out and says that the starter tested good, but that he would still honor the refund. I told him that's fine, but the starter should have tested bad because my mechanic already tested it and I watched him test it, so I pretty much told Mike that the machine is to blame, then he got defensive and rude with his tone of voice about the machine clearly stating that the machine was not incorrect. To avoid further debating, I directly said to just do the refund. His attitude regarding the situation was unprofessional and unacceptable.\n\nWhat makes the situation even worse is the fact that the employee Thomas D. asked me for my driver's license on returning the defective starter which should not have happened, because I have my receipt. When I asked him why he's asking for my driver's license, he said they were supposed to do that on returns, but that's obviously not true. Something didn't feel right, so I called another advance Auto parts store about the situation and that store told me that advance auto of Enterprise were in the wrong for taking my driver's license. My driver's license has the address to my Mother's home because it's an old address and I am not comfortable with that address being on file because I'm protective of my mother and concerned for her safety. I do not trust people I don't know, and I definitely do not trust that advance Auto parts store anymore and ever again.\n\nThey acted very shady and I felt discriminated because I'm part Asian. I've been shopping there off and on for years for myself and for my Mother. As of now, I am no longer a customer and I want my information out of that system immediately. Yes, I got my refund, but I shouldn't have had to go through that much trouble to get it, or feel that uncomfortable. Everything that happened that day was pretty much recorded on my phone along with two eyewitnesses that were with me in case I need them for future reference.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1617481519561, "text": "Hello KJ, thank you for leaving your comments about your visit to our Enterprise location.

I scheduled a service appt online for my Stelvio. I also checked the box for a loaner vehicle. I was scheduled for 4/27/21 for an oil change. Once I checked in I was told by Tom Williams, Manager, that I was not required to have any major services done on this visit but maybe the next time I would need to have my brake fluid flushed. I let him know that I would need a loaner vehicle. His response was, We don\u2019t have any so Johnathan will take you to work. Once I picked up my truck and I was driving off I immediately noticed a different feel to my truck. I just thought it was different because they had done a tire rotation. A few days later I noticed a noise when I braked. It gradually got worse and louder. I called and spoke with Jonathan. I told him about my concerns. He told me it was probably a rock stuck between my rotors and that if it was the brakes my sensors would have let me know it and its probably just a rock but if I brought my truck first thing in the morning it would be a quick and easy fix. He told me they didn\u2019t have any appts available and that they didn\u2019t have any loaner cars for me to drive while they inspected my truck. When I arrived on 5/7 Jonathan stated you are gonna have to leave the truck with us you need new brakes and rotors. I asked why and he said you are metal to metal. So that\u2019s when I immediately started asking what happened when I brought my truck last week, he apologized said the tech just didn\u2019t catch it. I asked what about my sensors, why didn\u2019t they go off, he stated the sensors are on the inside and this was on the outside pad. None, of this was making sense to me. I asked him for a quote for the service to be completed and of course it was approx $700 with a 10% discount. I\u2019m fuming inside by this time bc not only have you all inconvenienced me when I could have had this service done last week, but I was in danger and you lied on my vehicle\u2019s multi point inspection, or maybe you didn\u2019t even do an inspection at all, but now you\u2019re gonna double charge me for labor. I asked him who is the service manager and he stated Tom was. I explained that every time I have come here you all have told me that you do not have loaner vehicles but the last time I was there(for my oil change) he told a customer on the phone \u201coh no worries we\u2019ll put you in something when you get here and you\u2019ll be on your way\u201d. Johnathan replied, \u201cOh that was probably a Maserati owner and he\u2019s gonna put them in a loaner Maserati\u201d. I stated, \u201cso you are telling me that you all hold certain customers to a higher standard because of the type of car they drive\u201d. He stated they don\u2019t have any loaners, and someone could drive me to work. I literally paced the parking lot in disbelief bc of the lower standard of service based on the brand name of the car I drove, the oversight of my right rear brake being completely gone and scrubbing metal to metal, and the fact that over half of the cost for me to have the service done was a charge for labor for some techs that clearly half do their job. People think that it\u2019s a myth that women get mistreated when it comes to their vehicle service but I experienced it first hand. I could have chose to be an irate customer but because I am a black woman I chose to keep my feelings, emotions, and anger inside and take the poor customer service I received. However, I do have a choice in what type of car I drive and what type of customer service I feel I should receive. I was even just considering upgrading my car. I did not feel valued and I don't think they provide the same level of customer service across the board.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891231ed5d9cf5:0xecab1d88df1cefaa"}

Definitely the best car buying experience I\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 I was given a fair price for my trade, and the sales price of my new car was more than fair.\n\nMy salesman, Beau Beggs, made sure I completely understood every single item during the buying process.\u00a0 He is very well versed in all aspects of the Alfa line, and took the time to ensure I understood the operation of all the new car\u2019s systems.\u00a0 From the time I walked in the door, until the time I drove away I never felt pressured or hurried in any way.\u00a0 For the first time, buying a car was actually enjoyable.\u00a0 Thanks Beau!!\n\nNow I get to brag about the service department manager, Tom Williams.\n\nAbout 800 miles later I was driving home from work when my sunroof blew out for no apparent reason.\u00a0 Needless to say,\u00a0it\u00a0kind of freaked me out.\u00a0 I called Tom while I was still on the interstate.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t avoid the problem, didn\u2019t ask a bunch of questions, and even though it was late in the day, he didn\u2019t suggest any other avenue to solve the problem other than to bring them the car.\u00a0 Because the glass was still falling from the sunroof Tom sent a tow truck to pick up the car and ensured the driver wrapped the car to prevent any further damage.\n\nWhen I arrived at\u00a0Birmingham Alfa\u00a0I found out that all the loaner vehicles were out.\u00a0 That didn\u2019t stop Tom from taking care of the situation.\u00a0 He simply put me into a used car (another Alfa with only 2500 miles) until another Alfa loaner vehicle was available about a week later.\u00a0 In the meantime, Tom communicated the issue with Alfa, and made sure they would take care of the problem, and of course they said they would.\u00a0 I was told parts were on order, and Tom would stay in touch with me as repairs progressed, which Tom did because, well... He\u2019s Tom and he\u2019s the best.\n\nWhen the sunroof blew out the glass hit the trunk and the spoiler, causing several paint chips.\u00a0 I knew they would have to touch up the paint, and that the paintwork would cause the value of the car to depreciate, and talked to Tom about it.\u00a0 I knew he would do whatever he could to remedy to problem.\n\nWhat I DIDN\u2019T expect was what happened next.\n\nI received a call from Tom.\u00a0 He had communicated the issue up the food chain, to include Alfa themselves.\u00a0 The Alfa brand very, very rarely has any issues at all, and they were more than a little surprised to hear of this one.... and they definitely wanted to make things right.\n\nBirmingham Alfa, due in no small part to Tom Williams\u2019 leadership and superb customer service, replaced my car.\u00a0 My\u00a0brand new\u00a0car.\u00a0 With another\u00a0brand new\u00a0car.\u00a0 No hassle, no hoops to jump through, no problems at all.\u00a0 In a word:\u00a0 Amazing.\n\nSo.... I say all that to say\u00a0this;\u00a0 If\u00a0you are looking for a new vehicle (or even a used one) I cannot recommend a dealership more highly than Birmingham Alfa Romeo.\u00a0 Go there, find Beau Beggs, buy something.\u00a0 You will not be disappointed.\u00a0 As a matter of\u00a0fact\u00a0you will be pleasantly surprised in the experience.\n\nSooner or\u00a0later\u00a0you\u2019ll need that vehicle serviced.\u00a0 When you do, take it to no one other than Tom Williams. There is no comparison.\u00a0 I have never been so pleased in the caring customer service he has provided.\u00a0 both on my 2017 Alfa that I traded in, and the new one I am currently enjoying.\n\nI don\u2019t know who actually owns Birmingham Alfa, but if you happen to be reading\u00a0this\u00a0I want you to know you\u2019re doing something right.\u00a0 Keep up the good work, and keep your good people like Tom and Beau.\u00a0 People like them are what keep your\u00a0customers\u00a0 coming\u00a0back.\u00a0 I know I\u2019ll be back, and I\u2019ll keep recommending Birmingham Alfa to others.\n\nThank\u00a0you Beau Beggs, Tom Williams, and Birmingham Alfa, for being the exception to the rule.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891231ed5d9cf5:0xecab1d88df1cefaa"}

Its good knowing that some people still do try nd make conversation instead of being creepy nd quiet lol.. I would recommend Kilgore towing to anybody that needs a tow. They r very fast nd professional nd made sure I didnt sit out in the hot sun for hours waiting for a tow truck to pick me up like most tow companies would make u do..

I called them in advance, and set up an appointment to have the install take place. They promised me they'd bench test the amp I provided to see if it functioned properly before installing it. After sitting at their store for 2 hours waiting, I decided to get my brother to come get me to go get a bite to eat. I got a call from them telling me that my amp didn't work after I'd left, and they told me that I'd have to have a new amp to get the subs to work. So I gave them the OK to install the new amp, which I purchased from them for $130.00. After 4 hours waiting total, they finally had the job finished, which was a RIDICULOUSLY long wait for a simple sound system installation. When I checked out the job they'd done, they had replaced the heater control wrong, and I couldn't use the knob for changing from cold to hot on the panel. So I fixed that myself while sitting in front of their store. I paid for the job, a total cost of $270.00 for installation, wiring and amp, then I got ready to leave. I noticed the amp of mine they'd said didn't work was missing, and when I asked where it was, they assured me it was in the trunk of the car. So I got in to leave, and decided I'd check just in case to make sure. Of course, the amp WAS NOT in the trunk. So I went back inside and had him check to see if they could find it, and of course, one of his employees brought the amp back to me. Today, about 3 weeks after the job was done, I had a friend hook up the old amp just to prove to me it didn't work. The old amp worked PERFECTLY, with no issues whatsoever, and actually hit better than the new amp they'd sold me! So not only did the owner of the business LIE to me and tell me that my amp was worthless, but he also tried to KEEP the amp from me, knowing it worked and figuring I just wouldn't care that they kept a broken amp. Of course this business does not do refunds, so now I am out the cost of the amp they sold me for no reason other than to steal money from me.

Years ago, I told the cashier I had a Cutlass, and he asked me what the make was. I told him, \"Dude, it's a Cutlass. It's an Oldsmobile.\" His response to me was, and I'm dead serious, \"Sorry man, cars aren't really my thing.\u201d\n\nBack in February, I needed a new alternator. Super simple, easy to find part, never had any trouble getting one for this car. Round one, the one they sold me was clocked wrong. We tried to clock it ourselves, because my car was immobilized 1hr 30min away and I didn't want drive to the nearest NAPA to return it. Well we took it apart wrong and broke all the wires.\n\nI took it back and explained what happened. They told me they couldn't do a warranty swap because I broke it. Which I'm sure is technically correct, but also a really bad way to handle it since the part they sold me was wrong, and I had the old one when they sold it to me. Two separate cashiers looked at the old one and the new one side by side and sold it to me anyway.\n\nI just bought a new one instead of fighting it for round 2. The guy that sold me the second one accidentally just gave it to me, assuming it was a warranty replacement, AND refunded me on my card, so I actually made money on this transaction. Which is a good thing because this one immediately whined because it had bad bushings straight out of the box.\n\nRound 3, I gave up and gave an auto shop a ton of money to buy one from a specialty shop already clocked and install it for me, because a 15 minute home repair was taking a week.\n\nA week or so, another shop thought they discovered a radiator leak (I later found out the top hose was just loose and spraying coolant, so this is all really ironic). I went back to NAPA and asked for advice. Fatal mistake.\nOne of the guys, and he's super nice but dumb as a box of rocks when it comes to cars, sold me some Radiator Stop Leak. I also bought some other radiator additive that supposedly helps rejuvenate the o-rings or something. Not sure how that is possible for something that doesn't actually go inside the cylinders, but this guy works at NAPA so I'm sure he's got this.\n\nHe tells me I can dump both of them into the radiator and it will be fine. I follow his advice and read the instructions on the bottle. The system had just been flushed and filled, and the radiator and water pump are less than 5 years old. I let the car idle for 15 minutes and run the heater full blast.\n\nI drive the car for 30 seconds and the hot light comes on, and the shift point for first gear has shifted up. I drive it to the shop and the guy immediately tells me I ruined my coolant system, and probably cooked the transmission, because Radiator Stop Leak is garbage and it does damage. They had to take the radiator out and all the hoses off and blow them out by hand, because the system was so clogged up they couldn't even flush it out with the radiator machine. It cost me $371.\n\nSo these $20 additives clogged up my cooling system to the tune of $371, and now I need a new transmission to the tune of $3,000. My car is parked because it will be at least 2 years before I can afford to fix it.\n\nRadiator Stop Leak essentially laughed at me on Twitter, and I don't have the receipt anyway, AND NAPA DOES NOT ARCHIVE RECEIPTS. They have computers, but I guess they just don't save them on purpose.

However, I was willing to pay for it since I live over an hour and a half away, and it is a big deal for my car to be safe. Immediately after I left I noticed that wind was whistling through one of my doors and my brakes were squeaking. Then my radio completely stops working, and I decided to give this place another chance. We then brought my car in to get diagnosed, and were not made aware that they did not have a shuttle or anyway for us to leave the property besides uber.  After the diagnoses we got told by the service lady, to bring our car back in two days on Wednesday and that our rental would be free for two days, and that warranty would be covering the costs. Later that day we get a call from this same lady and in this call she tells us that my car would cost us at least 1800 dollars to get fixed, and that we had to pay for the rental car that we were driving. They also said that the pipe that needed to be fixed was bent in on purpose, and that we had done it (keep in mind that the only people who drive this car are two females who know nothing about cars). We were livid. They put the car back together and we got a second opinion, and turns out what they stated is wrong isn't.\n\nThe sales lady also reprimended a child for something she knew nothing about.

My factory window tint is so bubbled that I can't see out of my back window, poor windshield visibility in the rain, leather on the door panels and center console is coming apart, transmission sounds like it slips and does not want to change out gears, absolutely no power when you are merging into traffic or at initial take off so bad that I basically have to floor it and it jumps to 6/7 thousand rpms and on top of it all my sun roof leaks!!!!  There have been so many service bulletins posted about defective parts that it is ridiculous!! I did the recommended oil consumption test and within 2 months my oil wasn't even touching the dip stick!! I am supposed to be getting my pistons and rings replaced as well as numerous other things (NOT by King Honda) but American Honda will not cover the cost for their KNOWN defects with certain parts and it makes me sick to know that I only have 107 thousand miles on my car and 7 months left to pay on this piece of worthless trash and I'm at a total loss basically!! The best way to waste $22,500 is to go throw it away on one of King Honda's vehicles! I will NEVER own a Honda again!!

I must say, that the service rendered was indeed, \"service with a smile.\" After my delightful purchasing experience, I returned to my hometown approximately 41 miles west of Auburn and elected to, for the sake of time, have all my service needs performed by the local Honda dealership nearest me. This would be the trend for the next couple of years until I started experiencing a problem with my keyless ignition system. Time and time again, I would go in to this local certified Honda dealership and my problem was never resolved. I was even told by them that the only way they could get to the root of my problem was that my car would have to stop working completely. Well needless to say, this caused me extreme stress and anxiety. At this moment, I picked up the phone and gave Mr. Dave King of King Honda Auburn a call. Immediately, he pledged his absolute commitment to working with Service Manager Randy Melius and the other dedicated service professionals to identify and fix my ignition problems. Within two days of making contact with Mr. Dave King and getting my car to King Honda of Auburn, my fears subsided. His service team did just what was assured to me. I am no longer living in fear of my car not starting which compromised the safety my family and me.\n\nIn closing, please know that the automotive professionals of King Honda of Auburn will be there for you years after the ink dries on your purchasing contract. Words could never express my appreciation to owner, Mr. Dave King, service manager, Randy Melius, and their bonafide service professionals for their commitment to meeting the needs of their customers!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c132456a45:0x37bab76a5afd1067"}

The vehicle still have 40% life of oil before the next oil change.  Since I live some 900 miles away from Auburn and not sure when is the next time I'll be here.  But I want to get the oil change for my kid before I leave Auburn.  I came in the dealer at 3:30p and since this dealer is the smallest honda car dealer and pretty confusing if you are the first time visiting the service (no sign or direction to the service dept).  At 3:45p, I entered the door to the service counter and saw two man sat by the counter texting on their phone and asking him (buck is the name) if it is ok that I can do a quick oil change.  His replied was \"we are closing at 5:00p and we are wrapping up so no more service for the day\" I told him you have at least 1hr 10min left.  He notch his head but we are closing.\n\nI laughed so hard because this honda service dealer is so much unfriendly and not willing.  How can you show up to work and not working?  Something is really wrong here.\n\nI am writing to share my bad experience at \"king honda service dept\" so reader out there to save your time, energy and money else where you and the service you like other than king honda.\n\nOn my way out I stopped by the front sale office and share my experienced to mr. Randall / GM.  He seems to acknowledge my concerns and took down my contact info.\n\nI took my business to \"Express oil Change\" 3min away from king honda dealer and they really treating me like a real customer.  My fav guys are Michael and Zack.\n\nUPDATES...3/15/2017 @ 5:47p = 4-stars\n========\nI received a phone call from Mr. Dave King (the owner).  He first introduced himself and sincerely apologized to me of his service dept staffs behavior.  I have to give Mr. Dave King a lot of credit to reaching out to me as a upset customer and asked me to come back to his dealer to offer to do oil change if I havent done it (he actually said he would do it him self).  That enough to tell me that he genuinely care.  Instead he offered a certificate of free oil change on our next visit.\n\nI want to thanks Mr. Dave King and Mr Randall for their action and care to their customers.\n\nBecause of these efforts I have decided to move my rating from 1-star to 4-stars.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c132456a45:0x37bab76a5afd1067"}

They kept me another 20 minutes after I said I needed to leave for an appointment, and even had the sales manager come out asking us, \"Why do you hate my car\", to try to convince us to buy the wrong one again. They didn't even pretend to care if I got the car I wanted (even though I'd have been spending more money), they just wanted me to buy whatever they could push off on me right that second.

I had an OUTSTANDING & EXCEPTIONALLY POSITIVE experience purchasing a brand new 2021 Hyundai Elantra SE at the Tameron Hyundai dealership.\nFirst off, I received a call from Andrea in customer relations after I visited the website. She was SO friendly, pleasant, easy going and helpful!\nShe helped me set up a time to come in and look at the cars available.\nWhen we got to the Hyundai dealership at noon, we met with Kevin Dailey.\nMy son and I felt so at ease with him. Kevin was AWESOME!!!\nHe was very friendly, respectful, attentive and knowledgeable.\nHe gave us a great introduction of the Hyundai Elantra SE we wanted. Despite the torrential downpour and flash food warning sirens and crazy scary lightning that day, we enjoyed the test drive with him.\nThe car drove like a dream through all that terrible weather. Kevin did a great job of working to get my monthly car payment rate at a price I felt comfortable with. He also guided me on how to coordinate with my AAA car insurance agent while waiting on financing dept, then he introduced us to Chayse. Chayse also did an exceptional job of getting all my financing paperwork together.He generously provided copies of documents I needed to get my new car\u2019s tag and registration done at the DMV.\nI had no real expectations that day other than to test drive a car.\nMy son and I researched a lot and compared the Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic and Hyundai Elantra SE. The excellent warranty, and better safety features, more cabin room, and other specs sold us on the Hyundai Elantra SE. Our prior vehicle broke down in February. It has been a tough 3 +months without the ability to go anywhere.\nFrom start to finish we had an incredibly positive experience with everyone at Tameron Hyundai.\nFor us, it\u2019s not just about a car. It\u2019s about our freedom to get out and live life. We are TRULY GRATEFUL for our entire experience!\nKevin also scheduled our first maintenance appointment for November before we even drove off the lot!\nWe were thrilled to hear the warranty is doubled and our maintenance is will be handled at Tameron as well! AMAZING!!!\nAfter driving in our last vehicle for 20 years, I\u2019m SO GLAD we decided to trust our instincts and research about our new Gorgeous Hyundai Elantra and the Tameron Hyundai dealership! I posted Kevin\u2019s business card on all my social media. This is THE BEST Mother\u2019s day gift ever!\nIf you ever need to look for a new car I HIGHLY recommend Kevin Dailey and the entire team at Tameron Hyundai!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a1067f2749:0xf08fc8940d9b4549"}

Her service advisor, Brian informed her that the oil leak was coming from the o-ring for the drain plug due to it being cracked. Brian said this is considered a \u201cwear and tear item\u201d and that she should probably get her oil changed since she was due for another one in around another 1k miles.\n\nThis is where my issue begins, I call Brian to get more information and he is immediately defensive when I ask him for the information about what is going on. I asked him why the O ring isn\u2019t just a parts warranty issue, they pull the plug, put a new seal in it, fill it back up with oil and quote a filter IF she wants to put one in since it is close, he mumbled and tried to get his thoughts together and said i may not understand how warranty works. I\u2019ve been a technician for a different brand for 8 years we use the same computer systems as them and parts warranties generally don\u2019t only last a month, regardless Brian was beyond unprofessional in our coversation and within our 20 minute conversation he tells me:\n\n- o rings are a wear and tear item, which if it was replaced during the service, a month ago.. it shouldn\u2019t be \u201cworn\u201d.\n-She didn\u2019t make an appoitment for two weeks prior(we have the paper work that says she did, that they printed out for her today) and so there is no way that his technician could have left it loose or over torqued the plug because it would have been noticed sooner than a month(it was).\n- for all he knows I did this to attempt at getting a free oil change\n- this may be something I (me) would do to a customer but they would never not take the blame if it was their fault.\n- she should start checking her 2018 vehicle for oil leaks every morning just like he does so that next time there is a \u201cfaulty o-ring, that is also a wear and tear item\u201d is noticed within a month.\n- he doesn\u2019t have to speak with me because the car isn\u2019t in my name.\n- there is ZERO management in the building including service manager/director and general manager for me to speak with other than him.\n- and finally he said the oil change had all ready been performed all he did was have his technician do what was approved on the service recommendations which\nHad zero approved items\n\nOver all, the man was beyond unprofessional had a snarky attitude from the beginning and essentially tried to shift blame onto me instead of just making the situation right.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a1067f2749:0xf08fc8940d9b4549"}

Choose wisely consumers********\n\nFound a vehicle at this dealership on Cargurus for $4994, checked the dealership website before making the trip, car listed there for the same price with a red line marked through it saying \"don't pay list price\". Arrived to the dealership, took a test drive, checked the dealership website while on the test drive, same price  of $4994 with the red line marked through it.  Sat in the dealership waiting to get a price to pay cash, waited almost as long as I would have if I were financing it for the young man to come back with an \"out the door price\" of $7900. Sir what happened to the price of $4994 that is on your website????  Now would you look at this, the car is no longer on the website yet it was there 30 minutes ago on the test drive. Is that why I sat there so long? So that you could remove the vehicle from the website and come back with an inflated bs price. Sounds like shady business to me. I WILL NEVER patronize Tameron Hyundai but who there cares, no one. It was only a $5000.00 sale anyway. But you DEFINITELY get 5 stars for being unprofessional, unethical and full of it!

I had been researching a Hyundai Accent and wanted to look at them. I ended up working with a man (his name starts with a J) who took me to the used accents. When test driving the car he only let me go around the block, I mean the car didn't even get over 40mph. He did not show me that the car was certified, no car fax, and the price was 2-3 thousand dollars than every website I have looked at about this car. In fact, a brand new Hyundai Accent was listed only a few hundred dollars more than the used 2013 one I was looking at. When bringing this up he told me they were not willing to work with me on the price and when I was going to leave he mentioned that \"Were not the type of people who will call you later and lower the price.\" So I left, then I went down the street and bought a Honda Accord that was a year older, had more miles on it and paid $1,000 more than the price J told me he wouldn't budge on the Accent. Why? Because Billy at Tameron Honda treated me as a serious buyer who was paying cash and needed a car instead of a 20 year old college girl who J hurried out the door thinking I wasn't ready to buy.

However, I did find  Tameron Hyundai that allowed me to come in, and they checked my car.\nI first was met by Joe Bajalia, Service Manager, who was Great! I told Joe I was concerned about my safety, and I had a 4 Hour drive back home. He called in his National Award Winning technician, Chris Cochran. Chris took my IONIQ for a test drive, and also checked out the car with his device that identified Car trouble.\nAfter Chris\u2019s Evaluation, he educated me on what I was experiencing in the steering , and how the car is designed to work on the interstate . I felt very comfortable in his confidence and his explanation.\nThe Previous dealership where I had my car serviced in South Alabama did not put enough air of equal portions in the tires, and Joe got a very polite professional technician to make sure the tires work properly inflated. There was one other man that assisted me when I arrived . This man wrote up the paperwork.

When I purchased the car I told the salesman that the car needed tires and he told me the car didn't  need tires and the tires look like that because they are \"low profile\". I just had tires put on the car. I purchased an extended warranty that was supposed to cover everything for 2 years or 24,000 miles. I noticed that when I  purchased the car the drivers seat rocked a little. The seat has gotten progressively worse and I took the car to a Nissan Dealership and was told the seat needs to be replaced, the warranty doesn't cover it, and it would be $1,748.00 to fix.\nDear Tameron,\nYou will never get another dime of mine!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a1067f2749:0xf08fc8940d9b4549"}

The sales people are fantastic and supportive.  Management is patient and helps explore every financial option available to get each customer into the right car.  Specifically, Corey L Hooper spent a significant amount of time learning what I wanted, but more importantly, what I needed.  He was courteous, knowledgeable and a real pleasure to work with.  Each question was answered respectfully and with assurance of trust.  I never felt pressured or pushed to select any particular vehicle.  Nor did I ever feel uncomfortable or out of place.  This purchase brought me in for a used truck.  While normally I enjoy purchasing new vehicles because of Tameron's incredible warranty, this time I needed a truck for work purposes.  Corey went through the available used stock, finally settling on the truck I now know, I truly need.  Thanks to Corey Hooper and the entire Tameron family.  Every person I had the privilege of speaking with was more than willing to help in whatever fashion they could.

He displayed a tremendous amount of respect for my desires with regards to the sale, we both managed to appreciate each other's role in the brief relationship, and we were both able to come to an agreement that both saved me an acceptable amount of expense and allowed Tameron to earn a profit from the purchase.  Mike was very forthcoming regarding his thoughts on the car, as well as advice for making the most of the transaction, and it was and is still very much appreciated and made the overall interaction much easier through which to navigate.

We began talking numbers but were never persured. We had our one year old and three old with us but they made them feel at home supplying balloons and snacks.

I\"ll be up front, I made every stupid decision you could buying a used car. The Yukon my wife wanted had a little difficulty starting (that was my first warning sign I failed to heed). When I asked the salesman he just brushed it off as it hadn't been turned on that day (my second warning sign).\n\nWhen we got into the room for negotiations I told him upfront what my requirements were. He then (what I later learned is a typical salesman trick) went to \"argue\" with his boss about giving me the deal I wanted. After a few hours he finally invited me back to his \"bosses\" office to sign the deal.\n\nWhen I sat down to sign, he handed me a stack of papers that I spent some time reviewing. I honestly could not make sense of the numbers. When I started asking him about them he responded, \"I thought we were here to buy a car!\" (my final warning sign I failed to heed). I caved to this high pressure sales tactic and just wanted to get out of there as quick as possible as it had already been 4+ hours. When I finally got my vehicles they said it took so long because they had to \"clean\" them. Worst cleaning job ever.\n\nThe NEXT day the Yukon I bought died in a parking lot. I should have taken it back and got my Expedition back I traded in but I felt like I had to make do with what I bought (besides, I bought the warranty!) Took it to a local repair shop and sure enough the fuel pump needed to be replaced. Lucky for me, I only had to pay the $100 deductible!\n\nLess than a year into owning the vehicle, the transmission went out. Fortunately for me I again ONLY had to pay the $100 deductible to replace the transmission. Little did I know, transmissions tend to go bad again after they go out the first time. About a year later, the transmission went out a second time! That was the final straw, so I traded it in at Driver's Way where I had a MUCH better experience.\n\nNow, my second car I mentioned I bought that same time along with the Yukon ended up having a broken motor mount and the A/C compressor went out less than a year after purchase. Both vehicles were only 3-5 years used and less than 75k miles on them. Maybe I just had terrible luck from Tameron Hyundai but I can't help but feel they knew about these issues and just passed them on to me based on their sales practices.\n\nTameron Hyundai lives by the moto \"Caveat emptor\"...

I do not have any record of any transaction and we keep great records.  On the off chance that this is a real review under a pseudonym we keep excellent records and have a good warranty policy and any engine repair we did would be covered by warranty.   I would be happy to sit down with you and go over what was replaced and what warranty options you have.  Of course this would require this to be a legitimate review that has actually done business with us. Having only 3 reviews all of them one star and hundreds if not thousands of miles apart seems suspicious.  In the future I would recommend a more convincing fake name and maybe use a different profile for reviews in New York  and Alabama when you are leaving fictitious reviews."}, "gmap_id": "0x886284fc24084d2d:0x43d078e4239c6b69"}
