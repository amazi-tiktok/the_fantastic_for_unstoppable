They said that they would have someone come out to pick it up and that they would call the day before they were supposed to pick it up (scheduled for today 4 Oct) and give me a time. They were also supposed to call the day of pick up to let me know they were on the way.\n\nStill haven't received a phone call and it it currently 4:21 pm. They close at 5 pm. My wife called Lowes back today at about 3:40 pm and they said they would contact them again and if we didn't hear from them that Lowes would call someone else.\n\nNeedless to say, I am NOT happy at all.
