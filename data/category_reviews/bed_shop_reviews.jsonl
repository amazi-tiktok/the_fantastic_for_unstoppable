Ms. Pettaway chose to do an in-house lay-a-way payment option and put half of the total purchase amount down. We typically do not process in house lay-a-way orders until its paid in full, but we went ahead and ordered the set to try and help her out. Deniscia called to check the status of her order on Saturday March 13th , I, Krystine told the customer we had not received the order yet, that due to COVID, manufacturing has slowed down, which prolonged our delivery on inventory. This is actually an issue we've been patiently having to deal with, as a vendor during the pandemic. It typically takes about 2 weeks from when you pay it off in full, and we would get in contact with her once we received the order from the manufacturer. Ms. Pettaway then called back 20 minutes later with a third party on the phone, at which time both parties proceeded to yell at me using profane language. I explained the situation again being as polite as one can be when faced with someone yelling and screaming on the phone.\n\nI, Krystine, spoke with Deniscia again on the 17th, 19th, 22nd, and again on the 26th when the order had been delivered from the manufacturer. I , Krystine offered the Denescia free delivery for the inconvenience of having to wait on the order despite only putting down half. When the customer came in to make the final payment, I said \"Hello, How can we help you?\" She told me she was here to pay the final payment on the order. I then asked if she wanted a refund because after speaking previously Ms. Pettaway said that she wished to cancel the order and get a refund. Upon making the final payment we arranged for our delivery driver to deliver the products to the customer free of charge.\n\nDeniscia called us Saturday March 26th saying the boxspring was broken. After speaking to Ms. Pettaway, her mother called us yelling, calling us names etc. We asked Deniscia to submit photos to us so we could file a claim with the manufacturer so they could warrant the workmanship of the product. Upon reviewing the photos, Josh noticed the boxspring was upside down and called Deniscia Monday March 29th to let her know the issue was an upside down boxspring and that the manufacturer warranty would not cover damages that the customer caused by putting the foundation upside down. Despite knowing that, Josh offered to come over and fix the boxspring for Ms. Pettaway on his free time to rectify the situation. In response, he was told, there was nothing we could do to make the situation any better and that the customer would leave constant bad reviews.\n\nWe kept in constant contact with Deniscia, speaking to her 5 times in the course of 3 weeks. We worked with her by splitting up the payments and even ordering the set despite not having received full payment. We also provided free delivery for the inconvenience of having to wait. A full refund was also offered to Deniscia who refused it, finally we offered to come over and repair the boxspring for Ms. Pettaway on our free time.\n\nOnce the customer and third party became combative with the use of profanity on the phone with us, the phone call was terminated. Our policy when a hostile work environment arises, is to remove ourselves from the situation. We have offered Deniscia Pettaway several different solutions in order to solve the problem and move forward successfully.\n\nWe have exhausted every option in order to appease Ms. Pettaway in an attempt to rectify the situation. There is nothing further we can do to make Deniscia satisfied despite the countless options given to her.\n\nFurthermore, we stand behind our process and our policies and are confident we did everything in our power to have a successful outcome."}, "gmap_id": "0x889c175fd00c2a63:0x8f737bc346918443"}

Josh asked you multiple times if you were sure it would fit your space, you were very adamant about getting a queen mattress today and reassured him a queen size mattress is what you needed. We did not have any measurements other than those that you gave us, as a we did not measure your space, you did. Our return policy complies with Mississippi state laws, in that we cannot accept returns because of a contamination policy they have in place. Also, we explained this to you on the phone and you asked us to do something unethical and take back your mattress, that had been inside your home. Once you became combative with the use of profanity on the phone with us, the phone call was terminated, because our policy is when a hostile work environment arises we remove ourselves from the situation.
