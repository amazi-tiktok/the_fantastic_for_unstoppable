The property is full of spiders. One or two spiders is expected for an outside unit BUT 10+ spiders inside unit is unacceptable for a unit I've only had a couple of months. That shows lack of pest control or even Raid! I have spoken with several employees, multiple times, at this location about pest issue and requested for their DM  (Nathan) to call me which as yet to happen even though they noted in my file several times for him to call me. I've been complaining for weeks. They have also decided to increase the storage rental an extra $22 ( I've only had the unit 6 months and according to the fine print, they can increase every 6 months if they choose to). Employees have openly complained to me about management and company and how they hate working for Public Storage (I have the recordings). Unethical and poor company values. If i was not out of state on a job assignment, i would've moved my property months ago! The ONE star is for the employees who work onsite because they all were helpful even though they have no control or say over any issue. And I wonder if they are offered the people below me some type of incentive for a \"5 star\" review?!? More than likely. Save yourself and your property the stress/insects, and CHOOSE ANOTHER STORAGE COMPANY! ~~~Update~~~ Nathan, DM, finally decided to call me. Ironically. He informed me that they have Orkin pest control which comes monthly and that maybe the location of my unit is why I have a MAJOR spider issue. He refused to provide me w/ a date of last service from Orkin. According to him, it would be too much of an hassle to go through the paperwork to find invoice. Really?!? His advice is that i consider moving allllll my property to a different unit which isn't near trees. Really?!?! Sooooo, after some prompt investigation and people I know, I have a invoice showing where Orkin last serviced the property in Sept. 2015 and this review was written on July 2016....

My grandson graduated high school and was offered a full scholarship at Auburn University. As an average family we made the decision to rent my home and I would move in with my daughter and assist with getting him through college. So I packed up my most precious belongings and searched for a climate controlled unit for myself. The staff were most helpful and assisted me in getting an end unit so that I could get to my things easily if needed. Being a single woman and trusting your entire life being put into storage can be so stressful. However Ashley has been great, her kind words and helpful attitude have made me feel comfortable about leaving my life of independence and helping to write a new chapter in life for my grandson. I certainly hope that IStorage knows what a wonderful employee they have in Ashley. I would not hesitate to recommend this facility to anyone for their storage needs. I still have 2 more years to go before I can once again be independent and I can do that with no worries\nThank you so much Ashley !!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886286a6c9aad44f:0x78be7047b6726e8a"}

They wanted my car insurance, car registration, home owners insurance, etc to store items (car and household items).    .     Prices are also high. $25 paperwork fee.

I can keep it in the local \"dry storage\" Marina where it's kept inside protected from freezing and put in the water any time I want for $130 per month, with full service.   You call their local phone number and it also goes to a corporate 800 number call desk. This place was a LOT cheaper before it became an \"iStorage\" franchise.

However, my experience with public storage has been far from pleasant. 2 months after moving into my unit I went by to check on my furniture (2 bedroom sets and a living room set) and was horrified when I was greeted by a dead rat at the front of my storage unit. The explanation given by the customer service representative Nyrie was, \"We try to tell people not to leave food in their unit. It probably came from another unit.\" Today I went in to close out my account and was told that although I was closing my account out today December 5, 2017 I would be charged until the end of the month. Originally I was told that the amount would be prorated however was later told that they no longer prorate because their competitors do not prorate. I followed up with the district manager Jennifer Sanders and was told that unless I kept my personal lock on the unit they would rent the unit out to someone else although I was charged for the remainder of december, which I must say I find inappropriate. She then proceeded to hang the phone up. Next time I will keep my business with grand slam storage. CHEAPER ISN'T ALWAYS BETTER!

I tried to piddle with it but decided that I needed to let an expert handle it since water had gotten in the motor. I had some bad luck with previous PWC mechanics in the area so I was apprehensive. Fred at Advanced Watercraft took it in and diagnosed several issues. It was back running in a week. Me and my kids took it out the day we picked it up and by the end of the day it had taken on water again. WAIT! I know it sounds like they didn't fix it, but I took it back to Fred and AW- he was apologetic and accommodating. Turns out in addition to the items he had fixed, a previous mechanic had routed some water lines incorrectly and caused an additional water issue. Although it was not his fault, Fred insisted that he would fix the boat and he did it at no charge. This type of commitment to service is rare these days.

The previous day on the 1st I spoke to the manager on-site.  She was very nice and very customer service friendly.  I spoke about vacating my space so I wouldn\u2019t be charged for another month.  It didn\u2019t seem like a problem, she mentioned coming to get her when I was  finished, and I even made mention that I may not be done that day.  I was told no problem.  I came to the office on the 2nd at 10:00 am, let her know I was out, it swept clean and empty.  I then at that time asked if the auto-debit would still go through on my account as has been done religiously for 2 years, she said yes but that the pro-rates refund amount would be returned in approximately 5-7 days.  Today is a week and a half later, I tried to contact the site, spoke with an extremely rude customer service rep (NOT the on-site staff for clarification), and after with the District Manager Jordan. I was informed that I would not be receiving any money back as the rent is month to month and nothing would be done-however when I moved in I was pro-rated for days then? That it was policy....I fully understand that, I deal with policy every day-I am also have a responsibility to act fairly and not hide beyond policy and take care of my customers.  When I asked specifically (and while in the office ON THE 1st) when I would receive the difference back-that would have been the time to be upfront, transparent and honest about the truth about the intent to not refund the remaining days on my unit.  If I would have not been told a refund was coming I would have stayed the month-and not called regarding my pro-rated refund.  If that wasn\u2019t what I was told why would I be calling? Bottom line here, I moved up the street to Extra Space Storage, rented the same size unit for $18/month.  I was paying Public Storage $89 after 3 increases over 6 mos.  for the same size unit.  At this day in age a simple apology for the miscommunication and an effort to reimburse me something would have been appreciated and seen as compromise, the lack of an attempt to make it right is unacceptable to me.  It\u2019s not the $89 at this point it\u2019s the principal of managing my expectations as a consumer.  Please go up the street to Extra Space Storage, who were very decent about not wanting to steal their customer by the way, business is business.  The pro-rated refund would have been easier at this point instead of a negative google review and friends that also rent there and now will know to relocate.  Hope it was worth it, I do plan to make further calls.  At this point I do want my money over the principal of standing up for myself and what is right.  By the way, I work for a large property management company in town and in 2 other states that I travel, we were using Public Storage on our marketing material for new move-ins to our apartments and giving them this location in just Birmingham.  That will be changing.  Hiding beyond policy is one thing, refusing to see your company miscommunicated and screwed up is another.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888922751385a587:0x11a09201c8c5123b"}

We had continued issues with billing and of course now that we informed them we had moved out, they said they couldn't do anything about the billing issues and hung up on us. Their excuse was the number of units they had made it confusing. ok, it's weird that you can't handle taking a payment that you have a contract stating once a month. I have pretty basic storage needs but wow, this place ended up being more trouble than it was worth and we pid more than we were supposed to every month.

The facility is very clean and well maintained.  My only complaint has to do with their price increases for no apparent reason.    We have had 3 price rate increases in 1.5 years, going from $130 to $150 to $182 ... I  believe their units are staying full, jacking up the rates in hopes folks will leave and they can rent at higher pricing.  We have been inconvenienced a few times, when they re-did the blacktop, we could not pull anywhere close to units, having to walk & carry, they closed a couple times with no email notice causing us to drive an hour only to find them closed!  I was more inline thinking we should get a credit for inconvenience.  We will be checking other locations/ as there are several new going up in the area but only because of price.

Yes, most places do that, however, Christy didn't just try and throw specials at me, or get me to spend more money just to have extra space.

You can tell a lot about a place during the move-in and move-out processes. This place is the best. I also learned that the humidity in the Madison Alabama area is not good for cardboard boxes. Stacked cardboard boxes began to fail over time. I do recommend the tough storage tote bins from Home Depot. They hold up well and can be stacked to the ceiling. You can seal the tote bins with Ty-wraps and large moving companies will take them without an issue. The plastic tote bins also do well if it decides to rain on moving day like it did on mine. Of course, I always recommend being a good steward of the rental space keeping it clean and reporting any issues (none for me).

I have sent your comments to the management at iStorage Laceys Spring for review and you should have received a call from the District Manager to discuss your concerns. We value all our customers and work hard to keep our prices competitive and fair. Unfortunately, operating cost such as property taxes, insurance, maintenance, utilities, overhead, etc. are not stable and increase year over year.  For us to maintain excellent service levels we must pass along a portion of those increases to our customers.  In addition, unlike several of our competitors who raise rents every couple of months, we process increases annually.  We are continuing to make improvements throughout the facility including asphalt, paint and building repairs to ensure that your experience at iStorage is the best possible. We look forward to serving you in the future. If there is anything more we can do to improve your experience please email us at info@istorage.com or give us a call toll free at 844-311-2342.

On both days I checked my account balance. It was $0.00.\nSix days later I received a text message advising me to pay my bill to avoid late fees. I logon the SAME day to make my payment and see that I've ALREADY been charged a late fee. In other words, they give you five days out of 30 during which to pay your bill without avoiding a late fee.\n\nOh, also, apparently there's a door in the back that always remains open and unlocked next to a fence that's about 3 feet high so all of their security systems either don't work when they should or do work when the shouldn't.\n- the exit gate that has worked 2 weeks out of 4 months I've been there\n- I've been given 4 gate codes which have been turned off without warning or notification\n- There's no CERTAIN number of days during which the property manager is required to remove the lockout on your storage unit if you don't pay your bill within those 5 days. It certainly ISN'T the SAME or NEXT day which would be the case if there were an attendant. But then if there were an attendant that back door probably wouldn't remain open and unlocked.\n\nThe first night I got there I will admit the customer service agent was pretty helpful getting me into the unit since neither the gate code I was given or the building code worked for me. They were able to get me inside after a couple calls and they were nice enough so kudos for that.\n\nI think this is the only company I've ever had to deal with that doesn't send you a bill before they send you a late charge. Red Dot conveniently reminds you of your monthly payment...the same day they charge you the late fee. I've never received an invoice or payment reminder prior to the late notice which I receive via text message and email.\n\nI've also received text messages telling me when the gate will be closed for holidays and stuff. The message I'm getting is they want you to know when you can't get to your stuff and they want you to know once they've charged you a late fee but don't want to notify you when your bill should be paid on time. No worries, I've set a reminder of my own so sorry, you'll have to do without the extra $10 you've been accustomed to receiving.\n\nThe exit gate has been broken for almost 2 months. For a while it would still open automatically when you drove up to it but it could still be pulled or pushed open from either side. Now there's just a big chain around it. They could probably have had it repaired for the amount they've charged me in late fees but they're probably too busy slapping red pad locks on units they've yet to send out a late notice on.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb4b797cd74c5:0x6014f12e5009bb8f"}

We were quoted a fair price for the storage unit. We were also told that if we presented proof of our homeowners insurance (which we did) that we would avoid paying their monthly warranty fee. Well, I was unable to pay my first bill online because their website wasn't cooperating. I called and had them email my account info to me again. Still didn't work. So I called and asked if I could pay over the phone without having to pay the customer service fee they usually assess for phone payments. The lady agreed, which was great, but guess what was also included on the bill...the warranty fee!  I really didn't notice until I received the invoice for the following month, and wouldn't you know it, there is that warranty fee again! So I called the iStorage location to get it cleared up. She removed the warranty fee from the upcoming bill, but refused to credit my account for the prior month's overpayment because I paid over the phone! The way I see it, that type of behavior is, at the very least, wildly unethical, and may even be criminal.\n\nEdit/Update: I just received a call from a nice lady from iStorage.  She apologized for the error and credited my account.

I confirmed my lease was ended twice with a public storage employee and that I did not need to do anything else, I was payed up, and they proceeded to pass off my \"bill\" for another month to a debt collector. Lower management was initially helpful and confirmed that I did indeed vacate long before they said I did, and he was going to fix the issue, but then he saw it had gone to collections and there was nothing he could do with that. So he gave me the contact information for management out of Birmingham, and they never returned my calls. She answered once and the call dropped or something? And I could never get her to answer again. My fiance and I used their advertised discounts on our first two months, and ended the lease before the outrageous increase on rent the third month. We couldn't afford their regular rates. What I do know is that the company did yet again refuse to correct their mistake when I refuted the charge with the debt collector. My next step will be to pursue legal action if I can. Hopefully I do have enough proof that I did reach out and end my lease. They have hurt my credit and charged me for a space that I cancelled. Their discounts in the beginning are nice, but they will absolutely charge you for whatever they decide to. When you cancel your lease, they might simply just have \"forgotten to write it down\" and then refuse to fix it. I wish I could press charges.

Also, I have taken two 12 foot trailers and a 26 foot truck on one-way adventures. Every time the equipment is ready and the service is super fast. Alex the on-site manager is by far the nicest and most accommodating employee I have ever met at a place like this. It is always a pleasure to go in and see him. Leah, his competent co-worker, is equally as pleasant and adept at getting the job done for the customer with ease. I really can\u2019t speak highly enough about the staff at this fantastic location.

Clifton, the General Manager, took us on a tour of the grounds, the building, and our storage unit.  We chose climate controlled due to our stored items.  Clifton was super kind, pleasant, polite, patient, and informative.  The facility, grounds, and unit were extremely clean.  The price was better than any others close to our subdivision.

They were fine at first but must have changed management. Due to theft out of their mailbox, you have to mail checks to a P.O. Box.  I never missed a payment in 4 years, but twice showed up with their lock on my unit.  One was a mistake on their part - wrong unit - , the other because I was ten days late with a payment. When I went to the office to have their lock removed they would only accept cash, not a debit card or a check, to remove the lock. Nevermind that I had never bounced a check in 4 years, I had to run to the bank while the movers I hired waited and the clock ticked per hour.  When I called the office on my way to the bank to check on their policy of whether they would prorate the month, Charlene said she was not going to argue with me.  I tried to explain I simply wanted to know if she would prorate the month, or not, and she hung up on me.  I asked her when I returned with cash why she hung up on me and she said she wasn\u2019t going to argue with me.    They are not a nice management.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892923a1b6d9ed9:0xc7f9bea469580427"}

My husbands belongings from his divorce are in it and my mother in law has been paying it.  She is 83 years old and has had a stroke.  I have been paying her bills since August.  The guy there knows that i pay the bill.  I've never been called for a late bill and as I live in her house now to provide her care, i would know if she had been called. It's never been late.   Now they are calling and harrassing her for money because a LATE fee will be added on TOMORROW.  I tried to call Yesterday and NO ONE would answer.  I've paid it on the 5th of EVERY month since I've been paying the bills and I get a woman....(always been a very nice man in the past) who is a witch and says she is the manager.  I became angry with her and asked her what I needed to do to close agreement out as I was going to come get my things out of the unit.  She said my mother in law would have to come there to do it.  She KNOWS my mother in law is bed ridden and can't handle the account.  I even got my mother in olaw to tell her she could discuss the account with me...........she insists that SHE has to come by to sign off on the contract.  She advised my mother in law that she set her up on AUTO PAY.  I promise you I will have a new Debit card and I dare her to try to charge anything on this account.  They won't get one more dime out of me!!!\n\nSince I can't respond to the response I received on this.....I will say that My husband IS ON THE LEASE.  It is HIS belongings.

If you can have Wanda add her daughter-in-law to the lease, then she can have control of the account.
