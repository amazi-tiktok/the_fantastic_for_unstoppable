I booked a flight for my wife's birthday, but it had to be rescheduled due to weather. TN Balloon doesn't control the weather, and like Logan said this morning while we were soaring over Williamson County, \"I'd rather be on the ground wishing I was in the air than in the air wishing I was on the ground.\" The entire crew works hard to ensure your ballooning adventure is a great memory for a lifetime, so we were happy to reschedule. This morning we arrived at the meeting point and were whisked away to a launch site. When the balloon was ready, we took off just in time to see the sunrise over the horizon. Floating over Williamson County was an amazing experience that our pilot Logan made seem effortless. He explained the theory & science of balloon flight, the controls, and what to expect with an easy professionalism. The entire flight was something that we'll remember forever, and experiencing what seemed like a precision touchdown was awesome.\nIf you've always wanted to float above the earth while hearing everything below you and around you, then I highly recommend TN Balloon. They stay booked up, but it's 100% worth the wait. We'll definitely fly with them again.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsYSF91vKWDfwr4OoJtk3bSqheOYqSkR1ZVWut=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTVv25_ABynAY2ur3QVSk6naBgD8ohJsyPCPuC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOh0Zg_QpGVLWgKFaDyR4_vzXcLXVE4V7pamnej=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfRqG6PNRrIA-_7SUWmap0R_C0SfFG6LPh-_-H=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzpIEtmpCLIXlJsgi_DguK46hfN1meO0fdX1eQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeWeEcAnhhkfzGpi_LbSKF0baJ0AQ9CjAXj_1u=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN17F6oeha5tZsaTBF8xXS4nRS_t2A4CPM7dbvh=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOW7QjT2oKw_8ob3uf2Vv5NDhaxRqro4I2NMGuu=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOmzRg7jPf8TjtMxZtCVwrQ69ux2gjsdosPqpX=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886478d130e265ad:0x57381b7ed64d6395"}

Our original date had to be rescheduled due to storms, but Logan was great about tracking the weather and keeping us informed. It is obvious the second you meet them that Logan, Tina and the crew truly care about giving people a memorable flight. We took off from Arrington Vinyards, and floated over Arrington, Peytonsville, and Franklin for an hour. Set up and packing up were both fast, and fascinating to watch happen. We enjoyed the Balloonist's Toast of champagne, and the fun of meeting new people on our adventure. If you've always been curious about ballooning, take a trip with the good folks at Mid TN Hot Air Adventures.

After checking our records it seems you purchased a discounted Holiday Gift Certificate for $360 on 12/18/2010, that is 6 years ago.  Our gift certificates are non-refundable as are most gift certificates in the United States.  The next transaction I have with you is 12/10/2012 where I refunded $300, which you agreed to, and canceled the gift voucher.  I am not sure why you waited another 3+ years to write this review.  I find it fair to refund most of original cost for this Gift Certificate which is non-refundable to start with.  I am sorry you were not able to fly and yes we rely on good weather to safely fly.  Please read through all of our information available on the website and if you have any further questions please call us before making any purchases.\n\nThank you,\nLogan"}, "gmap_id": "0x886478d130e265ad:0x57381b7ed64d6395"}
