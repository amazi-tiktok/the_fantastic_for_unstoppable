The owner of this facility and the manager were told on multiple occasions by employees and were aware of the following: Fire extinguishers (they only have 2) being extremely out of date, last checked back in 2015\u2014 also no evacuation plan, or safety drills, air vent maintenance doesn\u2019t take place\u2014 vents/filters not properly maintained can easily catch fire, this company works with LIVE animals, the safety of your dogs are not being considered as you can tell from the images.... everything is layered with years of dog dander and hair.\nWhen the heater gets turned on the smell of burning hair lasts for days and the company uses wax melts up front to mask the smells. They also stuff the vents they don\u2019t clean with smell good beads to mask the smell.\nEven daycare dogs are kenneled. Employees hang around upfront until around 9 when they decide to start putting dogs in daycare\u2014- this means if you\u2019re paying for a full day or even a half day of doggie daycare starting in the morning your furbabies are missing out on 2+ hours of socialization. This facility doesn\u2019t properly clean the daycare room. And weeks worth of hair is noticeable near the drains in the daycare play areas, this is extremely unsafe for your animals/the employees. The smell in this building that\u2019s separate from the building your drop off your dog is horrific. Dogs are left unsupervised in daycare, and the daycare supervision in maintained outside of the daycare rooms- so instead of dogs getting that one-on-one attention they are only monitored when barking has increased. Because of that, rooms aren\u2019t cleaned right away causing burns on paw pads from dogs playing around in urine. Most dogs have to be ran through Grooming to be spot cleaned before leaving. Bored dogs have started eating the walls of this establishment because of the lack of social interaction they receive. This facility illegally mentioned to employees that they can not pay overtime to them when they have worked 40+ hrs. Because of this, I believe the care of the animals that go there are being affected.\nDuring the recent snow storm an employee managed to chase a already nervous dog around the front lobby of this establishment causing him to run out of the front door. This dog was missing for a week and found with his hip shattered, and he had ate an entire toe off of himself.. this establishment paid his vet bill which included the cost of utilization. Clearly the proper training of employees is not being conducted. This facility also does not clean kennels often and when they do they use a dirty mop to wipe out the kennels. This is probably a factor to the outbreak of kennel cough they are currently battling.\nMany times employees just feed  dogs breakfast without even bothering to clean the kennel first or move the dog to a clean kennel.. that means that they were eating breakfast in their own filth and kenneled with it until daycare started up. In It\u2019s hard enough trusting someone, let along finding out an establishment you\u2019re paying LOTS of money to is neglecting your animal. This establishment recently caused the death of a small 4 lb dog, and they are trying to cover it up. By deleting comments and blocking any negativity they receive. I refuse to be silent. This facility is anything but transparent!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb344b45a6c63:0x685d3a5c7b681a37"}

When I first boarded @ Piper's 2 years ago I requested that he be kenneled at night with only little dogs and was shown a room off the hall on the right where I was told the small dogs stayed. When I asked why he was put in the big room this time with the big dogs she said \"well, you didn't request that he be separated\". If my file had been consulted I'm sure it would reflect my wishes. There was no I'm sorry we didn't contact you about his injury, etc. He literally had to be carried that night and Christmas day every time to potty, to food bowl, etc. While I understand this may not be the norm @ Piper's, ( had never happened to me before) since it happened this time, I'll be making other arrangements next time. Beware. Things are not always as they seem. Ask to see where your dog will be put at night. I was told they  NEVER allow tours! That's shocking! I've ALWAYS toured where I board my dog.

This review is completely unfair and not honest. Her dog was seen here four months ago. We don't know why she is suddenly writing a review. First, we don't keep pets here just to make money. We did not charge her $900 for boarding. That's just not true. Hospitalization (boarding) was charged for her pet to stay here for two nights at the cost of $108.22, which included administering the pain medication and antibiotics through the weekend. We stayed late to examine, sedate (to eliviate her dogs pain while she was positioned for radiographs), administered intravenous fluids, splinted her leg, and administer pain and antibiotic medications to her dog through the weekend. All treatments that we provided were completed at her request and signature. The charges weren't any different than would have been charged at any other clinic in Birmingham. This client was not our client and she couldn't get in at any other vet in the area late on a Saturday morning just before we closed at noon.\n\nFinally, we could not discharge her pet because he was completely asleep (sedated). It's something that vets just don't do. Bad things can happen when patients aren't kept quiet and still to rest and stabilize while under anesthesia. Also, the liability of someone driving in a hurry down the highway, slamming on their breaks and causing their dog to fly through the air and breaking it's neck is not a smart thing to allow.\n\nAlso, our honest experience had been that the surgical center doesn't see patients for routine fractures on the weekend. They are kept hospitalized at a general hospital or at the ER until Monday. The emergency hospital that is associated with the surgical center IS open 24/7 for emergencies throughout the weekend. That is probably the information that the client is referring to. This wasn't an emergency as he wasn't in shock and we had stabilized him on intravenous fluids. We literally called down there today and the technician told us that a bill for observation through the weekend for a dog with a simple fracture on intravenous fluids, antibiotics and pain medications at the emergency hospital would literally approach $2000.\n\nSo, we saved this client over $1000, saw her dog when nobody else would, stayed late and provided high quality medicine, and did what was best for her dog.\n\nThis review is not honest or accurate and should be removed."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889046cf4f5b825:0x6863f15c86bf3033"}

I still can't find poor reviews about the medication online, for the record.  He also said that he preferred to not use 1800PetMeds because it was too much trouble for him to fax in prescriptions.

We strive to give our clients and their beloved pets the best experience we can offer. Your sweet baby Mercedes came in on 7/14/20 for a spay, which went perfect. Unfortunately the morning after her surgery, we noticed that she was vomiting a little, which we immediately informed you about. When we spoke with you about the vomiting, our associate suggested treatment, which you approved. The relief veterinarian that was on duty thought a fecal exam (stool sample) would help us to be sure that there were no other issues associated with her vomiting, which may have been miscommunicated (we gladly refunded this nominal fee). With this test we did find that Mercedes had hookworms, which can be associated with vomiting in many pets. We informed you of her results and suggested we deworm her. At that time you declined that service. At pick up the receptionist informed you of all charges before finalizing any payment, which at that time you agreed to with no questions asked or problems. When we spoke on 7/16/20, two days after your sweet baby had her surgical procedure to discuss your overall experience, to our surprise you told us that you were unsatisfied with our services. At that time you stated that when you first called for a price quote you were quoted $129 for the spay and were also told that included an IV catheter. This could not have happened as all of our receptionist have been on staff for quite some time and know that these procedures are not included in the surgery fee. I think what happened (because it happens a lot) is that you truly wanted these important protective measures for Mercedes but it all added up to more than you expected it to be with the treatment for the vomiting and nausea. Also, on the sheet that you filled out with the list of recommended pre-surgical procedures such as blood work and IV catheter, the price is clearly stated next to it. Plus there is a box to check yes or no as to whether you wanted the procedure or not right next to the price. Why would we ask you to chose yes or no if it was already included?

BEWARE!!!\n\nSo to start this off please understand, I am not a medical professional, however I professionally remove and rehabilitate wildlife. I am very experienced in just about all wounds, injury's, illnesses, and human harm caused by domestic and non-domestic animals.\n\nI have recently adopted a Dutch Shepherd, my primary vet for all of my inquires is Mercy Hospital(whom in my experience I would trust with my own life!)\n\nMy dog was a rescue, obviously covered in parasites from previous settings.\n\nI explained the situation to the profession under review( my wife made this appointment due to the ease involving COVID-19, as mercy was booked)\n\nKeep in  mind as a wildlife professional, I have already assessed my dogs illness.\n\nThe main reason for a vet was to acquire a  accurate heart worm test.\nWhen handing over my beloved Dutch shepherd I caught myself telling the vets office about her harmless  Sinus Arrhythmia Heart Rhythm(very common in dogs while sleeping)\n\nLonger story shorter, the vet personally talked to me telling me that my dog has a serious heart murmur, and attempted to sway me into the tests to verify. I already knew with no doubt there is not a heart murmur.\n\nThe doctor himself turned into a upselling salesmen attempting to use sympathy to sway me into purchasing tests. I am also a licensed insurance producer for Alabama so I am very aware of salesmen tactics, and I will say he tried. He tried very hard in his sympathetic approach claiming I need to do it now, its very serious.\n\nI then proceeded to my normal vet at Mercy Hospital for a second opinion. My Vet listened to my dogs heart for an extended period, as well as got another in house vet to listen as well as me, we all concluded there is no murmur and the heart is in great condition, afterword's ran tests to conclude.\n\nThis goes to show, don't try to scam people on sympathy, you never know how educated the other party is in your field.\n\nAlso as a consumer warning always be weary of ratings when choosing a service, especially when life is involved, a huge amount of services either pay for reviews, or pay there employees a commission per 5 star review.\n\nI wouldn't use a dishonest practice such as this, but I also can not say my mentioned vet is your best choice, I only speak from personal experience.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1591036913227, "text": "We unequivocally and absolutely DO NOT upsell unneeded diagnostics at this hospital! We offer and provide medically what is appropriate for each pet. We are sorry that Mr. McAllister did not have the experience at our clinic that he wanted. Due to the accusative and completely unfair nature of his review, we must clear up numerus false assertions that he has made. We have reviewed the chart from his dog's visit with the doctors and staff involved. After discussing, all involved remembered clearly the visit. To say that we use sympathy to perform inappropriate diagnostics is completely inaccurate and unfair.\n\nFirst, he requested (just like any other clinic, our receptionists write down EXACTLY on the chart what the client requests for us to do) to have his dog examined because lately she had been mopey. That was his exact words. The primary request was not to have a heartworm test performed. That was a secondary request.\n\nSecondly, his dog had a heart murmur and wasn't feeling well. That is something very different than a sinus arrhythmia which is completely benign. The further cardiac diagnostics that we offered to fully assess the heart condition in a rescue dog was completely indicated (remember this is a rescue in which the medical history is unknown) and was the best medical practice for this dog. Sometimes diagnostics that are performed come back normal and that is great but it doesn't mean that the diagnostics weren't indicated. All vet hospitals offer tests that commonly come back normal.\n\nBoth of our doctors have been out of vet school 24 and 47 years respectively and are very capable of diagnosing heart problems. They do not offer diagnostics that are not indicated but they do offer the best medical diagnostics and treatments for all pets. Do some pet owners decline to have offered diagnostics performed. Yes, every hospital experience this on a daily basis. Do some murmurs come and go? Yes. Did this happen in this case? Maybe.\n\nAlso, why did the other clinic go ahead and do the further diagnostics if it wasn't indicated?? The answer is that they were indicated! Unbelievable! The diagnostics that we offered were indicated.\n\nSo we were presented with a large breed dog that was approximately 5 years old (which makes it middle aged) and had been RESCUED. Dogs that have been rescued commonly have heartworms because they haven't receive proper care which includes heartworm prevention. If it had heartworms they very well could have and commonly can cause a heart murmur.\n\nBottom line: for someone untrained in the veterinary field that rescues and rehabilitates animals to accuse us of using sympathy and scamming people to increase diagnostics is deplorable. The other clinics in the area know we don't do this just as we know they don't practice this way either. This clinic has been here for over 45 years and the current owner has owned it for the past 15 years. We have a great reputation and thousands of happy clients.\n\nThis review is a good example of LIBEL and is illegal. It should be removed!"}, "gmap_id": "0x8889046cf4f5b825:0x6863f15c86bf3033"}

DO NOT take your pets here. Especially if you have cats. They are extremely careless and are very inconsiderate of mixing pets. The whole time I was checking in, a huge retriever kept sticking his face into the carrier I had Lulu in. The front desk saw that, saw me pushing him away, saw the owner doing nothing about it, and didn't say a word. Truthfully, everyone there seemed nice enough but they are incredibly sloppy and careless.

BYW, please don't tell Sasha she's a c-a-t.  Sasha was adopted from All Creatures 12 yrs ago as a 6 wk old when Dr. Allen held the reins and my son was a lab tech.\n\nWith the arrival of Dr. Hankes (and my son was gone to college), as you can imagine there were questions about the changes coming.  I have been so very pleased with the continuation of great services and getting to know another vet who is not only a well trained physician but truly loves all the pets that come in and wants the very best for them and their guardians.  The big bonus is that Denise (Sr. Lab Tech), who Sasha usually sees - and Sasha's very shy, has won over my baby and even has her choosing to stay with Ms. Denise instead of me after injections and exams some days.  That says A LOT for the caring ways of the team at All Creatures and who they are as crew members/care givers not just employees..\n\nRecently, Sasha had a period of rapid weight loss after getting a kidney issue under control and Dr. Hankes found that she had a growth on her thyroid as well as fluid around her heart causing breathing issues.  She was a very sick little girl.  Dr. Hankes treated her heart and brought it under control and within a period of weeks.  Dr. Hankes, teamed with Dr. Hall, was then able to remove the problematic portion of the thyroid and the growth.  Now 4 wks after surgery, her heart is doing well - she's gaining weight and running round the house like a wild 4 yr old instead of a 12 yr old.  Dr. Hankes and Dr. Hall did a great job with the surgery, the staff let Sasha recouperate in her basket with a blanket from home and are now keeping a tabs on her for a while to make sure her remaining thyroid is functioning properly.  Thanks to their great care, we're looking forward to many more years together.\n\nI have recommended All Creatures to my family, friends and new neighbors who are in need of a vet and have for years and hope you'll see them, too.
