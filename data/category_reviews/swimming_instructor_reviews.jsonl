I'm sure the staff works hard to keep the pool nice. Unfortunately, this is not a public pool like Google lists. This pool is private. A lady told me on the phone that I could come to the pool as long as I paid two dollars since I'm not a member. I drove twenty miles here thinking I would get to enjoy the water when I came. I was told by one of the staff that only people who are members get to come to the pool and their guests when I tried to give them the two dollars I had. I left upset that I was told one thing on the phone and given a completely different story when I got there.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4dbf9f83ddc3:0x73ebccf03f3863a8"}
