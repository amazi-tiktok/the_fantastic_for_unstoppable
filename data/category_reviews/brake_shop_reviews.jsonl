Nobody said anything to me about it, they just tried to get it back in place but it kept falling down. When I called to report it, they said they would order another one and replace it when I took my car in for its next oil change. When that time came, my husband took the morning off and drove  the car the hour and a half drive it takes to get to this dealership. My husband was told the rear view mirror cover had been replaced but when I got my car back, I noticed it had NOT been replaced. I called the service department and was told that it had indeed been replaced. When I inquired as to how the service tech then managed to break TWO covers and not mention it, I was told they would need to get back to me. When they called me back, I was told the the part had never actually been ordered and that they would order it and ship it to my house so I could replace it myself. This is not the first time I have had issues with dishonesty when dealing with the service department at this dealership. I had issues with them not being honest when I took my former BMW in for service as well. It\u2019s the closest dealership to me and still an hour and a half away. It\u2019s a shame that honesty and integrity mean nothing to them. The fact that they just pushed the cover back up and tried to pass it off as \u201cfixed\u201d tells a lot about the care and pride they put in to their work.

Since my initial visit to the McGee rd service facility back in December,  which did an excellent job, I have had 2 bad experiences.  1st bad experience was with my wife's car. She had the oil changed at the eastern blvd facility.  Approximately 1 week later her car's check engine light came on and the fault was for dirty oil. She had the oil checked at a local change facility and it was a quart low. They did another oil change, and I have the filter from that change and it is not as clean a filter as you think from 1 week previous. I had also gotten my oil changed in my truck a few days after she did at the eastern Blvd facility.  So I decided to take a look at my oil and filter. The filter on my truck had an install date written on it from the McGee Rd facility of 12/9/19. The date I first got Express to change it. They supposedly changed my oil and filter on 2/7/20 at McGee rd. I will also attach a pic of the filter . Needless to say this is a very bad way to run a business.  Engine damage from dirty oil is very significant possibility from these action.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO43eqZAxl6i36R5mIsoxQpWPbaVCPg79nGVXA2=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1582925050257, "text": "Hi there, Ernest.

Unfortunately, the extended warranty company on my truck is a joke. And that's just the truth.  If you can avoid it - do not use Penn Warranty Corporation.\n\nRick has fought on my behalf to make sure the work on my truck was covered, as it should be. He is fun to deal with and is honestly just a good guy. After doing a bunch of work and the warranty company telling him to tow the truck to someone else (to avoid having to pay), he is still helping me out. He could've given up on me and the warranty company - and tried to get me to pay out of pocket.

I took it back again and they connected the hosing and told me I needed a new pump.  I probably needed a new pump, but I felt like this should have been told to me the first time.

The staff was friendly enough, but the price was a little steep $51.50 but, I paid it because I was in need. Drove straight home from there. (about 3miles). Woke up Sunday morning and it was flat. Aired it up enough to get it back up there Monday morning..  When I got there and tell them the problem they took the tire off and said my valve stem was bad and charged me $20 to replace the valve stem. I thought all was good, woke up Tuesday morning it was flat again. I called & spoke to Chris who told me that it was more than likely a cracked rim and there was nothing he could do about it. Today...FRIDAY, I took off work to take my car to Fortners. They first told me that the tire was the wrong size. Then when they got it off the rim they showed me 4 plugs where the tire had been repaired 4 times, previously. For $30 I got an almost perfect Firestone tire, that was the right size with alot of tread.

So finally I had enough an asked the guy to please finish with my car, because I had to go rest before getting on the road (at that time I had been there close to 2 hours). So he did, an I was on my way. We made it through Montgomery without any problems, an then I was awaken by a loud noise, screeching tire sounds, and the sight of my front driver tire rolling away parallel to my truck, heading towards the grassy median. By the grace of God we were not hurt. The inside of the rim was shredded, the bolts were gone, the studs ate up. All this was caused by the a negligent employee that didn't properly tighten the bolts to secure the tire. I spoke with the owner about getting help, but none was offered, an he even tried placing the blame somewhere else. But I will never give Chris Tires anymore of my money/business nor will I recommend them to anyone. I spent over $600 to have my car fixed. I even checked the other tires an the bolts were not secure on them either. Lesson learned, u can't support everyone.

Be careful if you have insurance; once I brought up that my insurance might cover the work, the owner got really shady and kept telling me that it wasn't a good idea to contact my insurance company.

When I finally got the owner on the phone, he protested that the job would cost me about $6,000, but calling around and showing the invoice to other mechanics in the area, they told me they would do the same job for about $4,000. I ended up having the car towed to the dealership because of the bad vibes I got with APT.\n\nIn summary, I cannot attest to their expertise fixing the car, but I definitely didn't like their low level of professionalism.

I went with the discount tires, because the last set I got from a Mavis ( trussville AL) lasted a decent amount of time mileage wise.\nHere is my list of grievances\n1. About two weeks later, I noticed one of the lug nuts was almost falling off. One round and it would have been off on the ground .This infuriates me even more, because I specifically instructed the technician to make sure I could get the lugs off with a regular lug wrench, as I do my own tire rotation and oil change every 5-7.5k. Three of the lugs were so tight I had to stand on the hands. Again, one was falling off, three were almost impossible to remove.\n2. of course I got talked into the 89$ alignment\n3. Its not my vehicle ( wife ), so it took me a couple of weeks to notice the bad vibration at 70mph, so back to the shop to get tires re balanced, which I already pay 75$ for. I did not go back to the Mavis because I don't trust them. They couldn't even tighten my lugs\n4. When I get to the new tire place, I find out that all of my tires are set to 41 psi. 41!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Now the tires are cupping, which means they will need to be replaced soon.\n5. One of the tires was out of balance\n\nThey were super quick to get an alignment and do it, but they couldn't even get my lugs on and get the tire pressure right?\nThis place is an embarrassment.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1591476660676, "text": "We apologize, Phillip, We at Mavis believe you deserve nothing short of the best.

I ordered the 3rd set of tires down the list that were recommended for my vehicle (2017 Ford Transit 250), Michelin Defender T+H. I work 6-7 days a week as a contractor so Sunday was really my only option to get tires on my work vehicle. I arrived early for my appointment, confirmed my appointment, and confirmed the tires with the employee behind the sales counter. I confirmed that the tires I ordered will be the best fit for my vehicle with the employee and he said they will be great for it. So my wife picked me up and we went about our day. I received a phone call at 11:18 informing me the tires are installed on my vehicle but they\u2019re not going to work then proceeded to tell me they can order the correct tires for it but they won\u2019t be here till Tuesday July 21st. I explained I can\u2019t just leave my vehicle up there not working for 2 days, and asked if they can just put my old tires back on the van. The employee responded with yes but we will have to charge you for mount and balance, my only request was to install the tires with the best tread on the rear which he agreed to. I received a second call at 4:10 stating my vehicle was ready but that they close at 5 and needed to be there before 5 to pick it up. I arrived paid the clerk $75.96, received my keys, walked out to my truck to find my tires low, tire light on and the rear tires (almost bald) on the passenger side and the front tires (still had a good amount of tread on them) on the drivers side which was not what I asked. I asked if they could add some air to my tires and get my tire light to turn off. They did add air to my tires but when I asked about the tire light the manager had to stop putting Alabama stickers on his truck brought a computer tpms sensor out and showed me very quickly the tire pressure was fine and told me this would be expected with used tires... My tire light never went off like he said it would. Today is July 29th and I have yet to receive a phone call stating my tires have arrived or a update. I emailed Mavis corporate on July 23rd and have not received a response or anything. Never once did anyone apologize for the inconvenience that this mishap caused me that was clearly Mavis Tires fault and caused me to pay for their mistake. I at no point complained or expressed any frustration to the employees there because I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. I don\u2019t ever leave bad reviews for businesses because I know what that can do to a business, but I did want to take a minute and send you a email about my experience. I ended up purchasing a set of tires from Discount Tires on Hwy 280 and it was a great experience. I called them in the morning they called me as soon as the tires arrived, and installed them the same day in less then 1 hour after leaving my vehicle with them. Upon arrival there was no tire light on and the tires had the proper amount of air in them. I hope this email helps in one way or form, I\u2019m not complaining but just find it hard to understand why Mavis Discount tire would charge a customer any amount of money for a issue/mistake on their end.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1596119205061, "text": "We're sorry, Nick Lions. we apologize your appointment time was not honored.

They were very friendly and honest and the vehicle was just as described except for one minor issue.  I had been told it had a new battery, but during inspection we discovered that the battery was not new. It was just a mix-up and they were happy to install a new battery while we were finishing up the financial side of the deal.  Would have loved to have gotten the car at a bit lower price (who wouldn't?) but this was an exceptional low-mileage one-owner specimen, and they did work with me on the price.  I've shopped Miatas for quite some time and lately Carvana seems to have almost cornered the market on clean low-mileage Miatas and have jacked the prices up really high.  But I was able to buy this Miata well below what Carvana would have priced it at, and I feel that I got a good deal considering the current market and the premium condition of this vehicle  (and lots of buyers have had very bad experiences with Carvana, so I'm glad I didn't have to deal with them).

I was told to come back that Saturday; May 2nd so that a mechanic can look at it. I went that Saturday and had the lights repaired. That same Saturday night my entire driver side taillight went out. I knew they were closed Sunday but I called just in case I could leave a voicemail to give them a heads up about me coming in on Monday; May 4th regarding the taillight. May 4th they tried to repair the issue however ALL of my lights started malfunctioning. They tell me to come back that Wednesday; May 6th so that their mechanic can look at it. They gave me a work order stating that they are working on diagnosing the problem in case I got pulled over for no brake lights, reverse lights, headlights or turn signal. They proceeded to pull my vehicle through the shop and when I got inside it I noticed an airbag sensor that was not there before. I asked John if he could have it cleared out and he said that he would have the mechanic do it on Wednesday and that it should be no problem. I then attempted to turn my AC on (which was on while they were working on it but John said that he had turned it off) but the AC wouldn't come on. I get out of my vehicle and ask John if he could have the code cleared because I felt that it was messing with the operation of my AC and it's been 90\u00b0 lately. John then tells another employee named Skyler to come clear the code however the code does not clear. During this time the owner comes and introduces himself and asked me and another customer if we were being tended to, the other customer stated that he was already tended to then I stated that I was being tended to and pointed to my vehicle. The owner then leaves to never return again. They then proceeded to turn the vehicle off in hopes of resetting it however at that point the vehicle would no longer start. John then told me that I needed to leave and that I could return Wednesday to have their mechanic look at it but at this point, I had no dash lights, interior lights, exterior lights, no AC, no radio, no power steering, and sensors going off. The vehicle would no longer start up. I started to get upset, John claims I brought my vehicle in like that which is 100% untrue, I drove it in with no issues other than the driver taillight but I was unable to drive it away. I defended myself and vehicle over that statement then John pulled their doors closed while several employees including a manager/ assistant manager watched. I ended up having to call the police (because I had no clue what else I could or should do). The shop then claimed that I had a bad battery and that was the result of all of this however when they put a brand new battery in there it did NOT fix all the problems, the vehicle did start up and it did have headlights but that was it. After me refusing to tow my vehicle away and almost 2 hours later Mitch (I believe the manager or assistant manager) then offered to let the vehicle stay and have their mechanic look at it on Wednesday May 6th. May 6th, I went to go pick up my vehicle and John was working the front desk, they tried to hand me my keys in the lot hoping I would just leave immediately but when I asked for a full detail work order on what all had been done to my vehicle, I received attitude and was told that I should be happy that they fixed it for free and that they don't document all the work that's done on vehicles. I sat up there until I received a work order (over 30mins later) but when I received the \"work order\" it stated, \"gave customer a battery and replaced 10 fuse\". I told the mechanic that that was not a detailed work order but I was told that was all I was going to get. I do not believe that they would have fixed the damages their employee, John, caused to my vehicle if I did not have 4years of documentation from the one and only other mechanic I've been to, video footage from my own vehicle and computer readings from my Vivint smart security proving the condition of my vehicle.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e9b414671032d:0x29e4a24dd6f16484"}

However the reason they don't get the extra 3 stars is because they are always trying to sell you stuff you don't need, which is why I stooped coming back to this place before. Decided to give it a try and it was the same think.\n\nThe service guy called me in the garage to show me \"something on my car\".  He had the air filter open and he pointed to it and pointed to my EXHAUST MANIFOLD and told me that my injectors and inside \"there\" was full of  \"gunk\" and that I needed a fuel injector cleaning for $59.   FIRST, the fuel injectors are NOT inside the EXHAUST MANIFOLD or the air filter.  Second, unless you took apart my valve cover you HAVE NO IDEA how clean/dirty my injectors are.  My car is fairly new which quite low mileage and very well maintained,  don't try to scam me into something that I DON'T need,  or even if I did you wouldn't know simply by pointing to my Exhaust Manifold.\n\nThere is a good reason the place across the street \"Firestone\" was packed with people and they are more expansive and this place was empty.

He asked multiple times if it was ready, was told only 20 more mins, then 30...well 2 hours after the said time he left. We had plans at 11am, so those didn't happen WHICH could have been planned for-like loading up my kids (one being a newborn) in the car and picking him up. No apologies for the extra wait time and never honest about how long it was going to take.\nCome that following week, SURPRISE, there was an oil leak on the garage floor AND the check engine light was back on. So we took it back once again. He was told that it was just old oil coming out and it was fine and that some other piece needed to be replaced for the check engine light. Like why wasn't this fixed the first time!? Unless we got super unlucky and something went wrong within the 3/4 day time.\n\nWell now it's about 4 months later and there's still oil spots on the floor!\nSo we called today, I got a so-so person on the phone and was told to bring it back in, no \"oh my goodness! That's not what we like to hear..please bring it back in!\" It was just \"bring it back\".\n\n1st, can we make the comparison on the comment from Ashton Morgan below?? This was the SAME day, the SAME time and my husband remembers talking and waiting with Ashton.\nWe aren't very knowledgable on car repairs and we should've gotten a 2nd opinion(the Garage in Pelham is literally walking distance and everyone always has great things to say about them, but this was just for a cheap oil change-never again!) ..but we just had a baby and didn't have much spare time or sleep to decide these things with a clear mind.\n\nI just reccomend going somewhere else for piece of mind EVEN for an oil change, even if this was just a random bad day (which look at the rating-use your brains people! We didn't and now we're paying for it with our time and now a nasty driveway and garage floor) for the people working on cars, there has yet to be a verbal apology-and now if we get one it will just seem forced.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1463972408579, "text": "Dear Jennifer,\nMy name is Rick and I am the owner of Precision Tune Auto Care of Pelham.

The office attendant (Mike, I think was his name), was straight-forward, respectful, patient, gave me a phone quote, had the work done timely, with the final bill ending up being a little less than the original quote, even after adding the tow bill & taxes. It was a very welcomed change from the experience I'd had at another local shop I'd been referred to (but later warned about from several other past customers) where I repeatedly had to endure rudeness from the know-it-all mechanic, immediate breakdowns from same issue I'd just paid to have repaired, & ignored voicemails asking to speak to the owner. Guthrie's owner followed-up the very next day to make sure everything was going well with the work on my car. I would much rather pay for a job well done the first time than a little less and keep breaking down, having my car towed, finding another way to work at the last minute to keep my job, and then constantly being talked down to in person & over the phone (while the owner justifies it as him \"being from New York\",... to which I reminded them both that he's now n ALABAMA, & that cocky attitude won't do here, especially with me!!... 3 different types of repairs... never fixed after being told they were!).

The Manager indicated they provided those services and I made a 7:30 am appointment for a few days later. Appointment day I arrive at the appointed time to locked doors and wait 15 minutes for someone to show up, while I was waiting I noticed trash from the previous days services and appointments all in the service bays. With the late open and the trashy appearance I should have left as these are signs of poor management. They took custody of my vehicle for the remainder of the day, of which I had to call them at closing time to see if there was an update, they were unaware of the status and had to call me back. When I heard back from them they said it was done and we agreed I would pick up the following morning, when I arrived they indicated half of the things I asked to be done weren't done and they can not do them (rear dif & and tire service). I was not charged for the items but now I need to make another service appointment elsewhere.\n\nSeparately, one of the Technicians blocked my wife and kids in while they were dropping me off. I went out to ask him to move of which he replied \"she can get by\", I followed up and asked him to please move, she is driving a larger unfamiliar vehicle (my truck) and would appreciate some extra space.

TAPCO kept my car for over a week while making no attempts to contact and update me on the repair details. I had to call them daily. They did not give me an estimate for the repair and I was stuck with a $200 bill after paying them $300 the week prior. I went in for a new belt and to look at an oil leak and $500 later and my oil light is still on. Also they misgendered me (transman) the entire transaction. Very cool. Also your car will be sitting outside unlocked after they have worked on it.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1623959183961, "text": "Cale, I apologize that you felt mistreated. You brought the vehicle in for the oil leak and we found your axle seal to be leaking. This is on the transmission side of your vehicle. The seal was replaced and you also requested a new drive belt which we happily installed for you. I advised you that there may be further oil leaks, and we would need to keep an eye on it and to bring it back in if oil was still visibly leaking on the ground. You had the vehicle towed in for a no start issue. After 3 hours of diagnosis not charged to you, we found that there was an ECM update needed for the vehicle. This is not a service we provide, and I know the advisor informed you that we were waiting on the programmer to come and flash the ECM. The advisor should of given you a rough estimate of cost for this service and I apologize he did not. We also did not know what the cost would be for the service because it has ranged from $45.00 to $400 in the past. So as we knew the fix, the cost was out of our hands. Once the programmer arrived, he performed the flash on the ECM, the vehicle cranked, and he gave me a bill for $200. We called you, let you know the vehicle was repaired and the cost was $200. We literally did not make one dime off of you, and spent 3 hours of diagnosing to confirm we had the right fix for you ( Normally a $345 cost). If your oil light is still on, then you may have another oil leak on the engine side and would need to address that issue, just as I advised you personally. As far as misgendering, we apologize, not really sure what else to say. We will do better with that situation as a whole. We apologize again for the way you feel. We were just doing our best to get your vehicle back in your hands, at the cheapest cost possible. We are not magicians, nor fortune tellers. We do not control when a vehicle breaks, or what mechanical part may fail and start leaking. All we do is advise the best path forward with as much information as we have to give the customer the best chance to make the right decision for themselves. Thank you for business. Please let us know if we can further assist you with your cars in the future."}, "gmap_id": "0x88891bb89a66390d:0xc218ac2ba8793b57"}

I normally work on my car myself, but am willing to pay others to do so when problems are above my experience. I asked them to fix whatever it was that made the check engine light be on, which I knew was something with the vacuum system. I also asked them to fix two windows that weren\u2019t working. They \u201cfixed\u201d my car and gave it back to me. Well on my drive home, I discovered a rat chewed halfway through my seat belt and left dropping in the floorboard that they did not clean up. The next day I let them know when I got off work and they said to bring it in and they would fix it. And they did, but they replaced my seatbelt with a black one and my interior is grey. When they replaced my window regulators, they left metal chips from drilling all in my carpet and leather interior, so they did not do a clean job and did not clean up after themselves. ALSO, my check engine light came back on and was running the same codes as it was before I brought it to them. So then I had to leave it with them for several more days. They had my car for over one week. One last thing is that my driver window was tight before they serviced it and made no road noise. Now, it leaks air over fifty and I don\u2019t want to have to bring the car back to them for a third time. That same door now makes an awful rattling noise when it shuts, which it also did not do before they touched my car. I have had pleasant experiences with them in the past, and I left reviews those times as well but service was not what it use to be this visit.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1608237580748, "text": "Arthur,\nSorry to hear about your displeasure with our work. Lets start from the top. The vehicle was brought in after you personally attempted to repair many issues with the vehicle yourself and admitted that you may have done something wrong as everything you had done has still not fixed it and the same check engine lights remain on and the vehicle was running rough, even after you worked on it personally. We used our extensive diagnostic equipment and found multiple leaks throughout your vehicles intake system. I personally called and told you we had found these leaks and would need to take off the intake manifold you just put on yourself to see what was going on under it, as that is where the main leak was. I also notified you that there was an code in your ecu for the EGR system and that it may be triggered by the massive intake leak and we would need to correct the major leak first, and let you drive the vehicle to see if there was still an issue with the EGR system. The EGR Valve was also covered with epoxy from what looked to be a band aid repair from a previous time. This could be an issue, but during the diagnosis we did check each component of the system and did confirm the actuators and the valves were operating as they should.  Once we had your approval for the work, we moved forward. Once the intake manifold was removed, we found that you had left the old intake gaskets on the engine and also used the new gaskets of the intake manifold you just replaced. This is what we call being \"double gasketed\" and quickly saw this was the issue with the massive intake leak. We purchased new intake gaskets since the new ones you installed were severely damaged. We removed the old gaskets and cleaned the surface to ensure proper sealing on installation. Everything went together very smooth on the install and a quick smoke test found that the leak was no longer and the issue was repaired. The codes were cleared and the vehicle was test driven and confirmed that the vehicle was running properly and no longer had any further codes in the system. You were called and told the good news and were made aware that the EGR valve was still in question but would need significant miles put on it to be addressed. Once you took the vehicle and drove it, the light came back on and when you brought it back in we found that the same EGR code was back and found that the EGR Valve that you epoxied was blocking the air passage and triggering the light. You were not charged any further diagnosis and we repaired the EGR valve and there was no further issue.\n\nAfter these issues were handled you requested that we look at your windows. The window regulators were found to be the issue at hand and they are riveted in from the factory and are very difficult to perfect. We Use OEM ford rivets and installed them to perfection with the factory holes in the door that were not modified in any way shape or form. I do apologize there is wind noise with the window now, we would be glad to take care of this issue and resolve it for you at no cost.  I was also not aware of the pieces in the floor that were claimed to be left by us, and I sincerely apologize for the possible mess left behind. I would be glad to provide a complimentary vacuum of your interior from a detail shop of your choosing. There was a good bit of mess on the floor, including crumbs and such, so we may of overlooked what mess we made, versus what mess was there before we began our work.\n\nThe seatbelt issue. We have never had a rat issue before at this location. We have been here for 8 years and never once faced an issue of the sort. We have biweekly pest control services done and stay very proactive with pest control due to the known issues of old downtown buildings and sewer systems. When brought to our concern, we replaced your belt with an OEM Ford part and purchased it by your VIN number at no cost. The interior in your vehicle was sun faded and that is why there is a color difference."}, "gmap_id": "0x88891bb89a66390d:0xc218ac2ba8793b57"}

They charged my daughter $100 to tell her that her check engine light meant her gas cap was loose. If they'll take advantage of a 19 y/o girl who's out of state, what else do you think they'll do? Seriously: $100 to read a check engine light code and (literally) tighten a gas cap. #epicfail", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1608235243266, "text": "Kevin, I believe you may not fully understand the process of diagnosis on a vehicle. We take pride in our diagnosis and ensure the diagnosis is correct before we tell a customer any type of estimate. Our standard diagnostic rate is $100 and we roll that fee into the repair if you decided to do the repair with us. We have signage throughout the main office with this verbiage and discuss the process with customers as they drop a vehicle off. But yes, lets walk through it so you and everyone can understand. First, we read that check engine light on the vehicle, and used the $6500.00 computer scanner to do so. We went through and found every lasting detail on the issue down to the date it happened and how often it happened. That is where Autozone stops. They get their $30 scan tool out and tell you 10 guesses of items it could be. So now that we have a lot of data, and approved $100 of diagnostic work on the vehicle ( up to 1 hour of diagnosis ) we can move forward and start using our years of training and knowledge to properly diagnose your vehicle. Now my technician gets out his smoke machine (a $1600 tool)  that pressurizes your daughters Evap Emissions system and also fills the system with smoke so we can determine if there is a leak on the system. Then we put the vehicle on our $4500 lift to ensure that we inspect every inch of the system that has a fault. We also use the scanner in the above mentioned process to activate all of the solenoids of the evap system to ensure they are working properly and letting the system properly work. So now that we have used our multi thousand dollars in tools and years of knowledge that is priceless, we have determined your daughters system is actually in perfectly working condition and the only fault is that a personal mistake happened of someone leaving the gas cap loose! Whew! Seems like quite a lot for such a simple task, right?  Well what if you went by the local auto parts store, got a free scan on the vehicle and they sold you an evap canister for your daughters vehicle and then you take it somewhere for an install and spend $1000.00 and the same problem remains. I am sure this review would look a lot different if you took into consideration the time, the effort, the knowledge, and the care that was put into your 19 year olds daughter vehicle to ensure we did not sell her any parts or service she did not need and made sure she was getting the most honest and best value possible when she put her trust in our shop. I apologize you feel like we took advantage of her. I hope that you see we spent a careful amount of time ensuring we had a proper diagnosis, and realize that doing so does not come free. This business is how we feed our families and have done so for 8 years. If we did not charge customers for diagnosis, then we would become a charity, and likely go out of business, and your daughter would be stuck down the street at the dishonest shop that sold her thousands in repair work that was not needed. I am certainly glad to hear your daughters vehicle is still doing well and the check engine light has not come back on after our thorough diagnosis, with out costing her any extra money.  If you would like to further discuss this issue you are welcome to call me, Michael Lee, the owner whenever you would like to. I would be glad to walk you through our process and make sure you fully understand the extent of work we did ensuring your daughters vehicle was safe and properly diagnosed and why the $100.00 was charged. Most would consider it an #epicsave , you know, since we were the honest shop that did not take advantage of her and took every possible step to make sure her vehicle was diagnosed properly.

I normally avoid chain stores like Firestone because I know they try to scam people, but it was my last option to get my car examined.  I was helped by a woman I think was named Sabrina, and she fed me the biggest scam I've heard with my car, I don't think she realized I knew more about cars than she probably did.  She told me the tires were done and needed to be replaced NOW, the air filters needed replaced NOW, the battery was dead and needs replaced NOW, and the radiator needed to be flushed - and they'd conveniently do all of this for me at a hefty premium.  I was silently laughing at myself because two of my tires had 20K miles left on them (yes the other two need replacing soon), my air filters were replaced 8 months ago, my battery was brand new (I took it to auto zone AND advanced auto parts and they showed me the readings and the charge was fantastic, they laughed at Firestone for trying to pull one over on me), my radiator was also flushed within the last year.  I finally called her out on the battery and she looked me right in the eye and had the immoral audacity to say the battery was still worthless.  These are common things places like Firestone try to trick people into having repaired, because most people don't have the knowledge to know any better.  It was funny because they didn't even identify the things that were wrong with my car that I knew about.  They checked off that both headlights were working great, even though I knew and verified that one of the front headlights was dead... did they really even look my car over or just pretend to then hand me an appraisal for all the \"broken\" items I needed to have them fix now?  If you do not know much about cars, do not trust Firestone, they will sense your naivete and pull a fast one on you.  Always get a second opinion from a more reputable garage shop (I prefer privately owned places that rely on their honesty for business).  This just reaffirms the longstanding distrust I've had for places like Firestone, avoid them if you care about your money and your vehicle's longevity.  This visit was a total scam and employees like the one I dealt with do not belong in a customer service position.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889164cb1f7e4bf:0x4ed3bd94504e471a"}

Tried to sell me an alignment with no explanation.  When I asked to see the numbers one wheel was so slightly off that I really beleive it could be calibration error as the old tires showed no signs of uneven wear and the car never pulled.  Today I went in for an apppointment at 9:00 am.  Every bay was full and I was told they were \"down 3 techs\".  Took 2 hr and 15 min for rotate and balance and oil change.  I specifically asked twice to include the full size spare in the rotation.  Left only to see it was not done.  Incidently, it's running the same air filter as on last visit and today it was \"fine\".  They also did not mention an issue with the suspension they said was problematic before.  So if today they were really busy and everything was \"fine\", and last time they were not as busy and they offered multiple unnecessary services, makes me wonder about how much pressure they get to \"sell\" services OR if, when they are busy, they don't do a thorough inspection.

She told me \"no\" but she could take me inside and give me the specs for the vehicle from the tablet. Ok, fine... thats good for the moment. We get in and she starts running numbers on what the payment would be and telling me what the truck had it in based on what was on her tablet... disregarding the fact I asked her multiple times to go outside and get it unlocked so that I could get inside of it and look. I know what I can afford, I already did the numbers before I got here. All I wanted to do was look at it and see if it fit my family's needs. She finally unlocked it but when I started touching the touch screen she yelled at me like I was a kid even though there was little damage I could do to the vehicle (not that it was my intentions but) since the vehicle was in demo mode. I was also not allowed to sit in the drivers seat. She had told me multiple times that the truck was out of my price range, knowing NOTHING about my finances because I had not yet disclosed that information in any form. Then she had the \"manager\" come out and he told me the same thing, that I couldnt afford this vehicle but they could put me in a cheaper vehicle. Long story short, they lost a purchase from a client who makes over $100k per year because \"I couldnt afford that vehicle\".

Now let me tell a story.....\n\nMy wife\u2019s car was giving vibrations by my own accord and felt by the look of things, balancing would fix the issue. She was due new tires but I had a month or so before committing to new set. The tires had whooped out on the back two, but good tread even in the low spot and could not be balanced.  Still safe just rough riding by my account. Ordered tires, set up an appointment with a different tire shop on Saturday,  loaded up the new tires in her car. Saturday appointment was not booked (I can\u2019t get it done) so I figure I would set up an appointment with another local shop close to work for Tuesday.\n\nMonday...\n\nMy wife calls me at 9 am with a blowed out tire. She already late. And she already told me them tires got to be changed before today.\n\n(Disclaimer.:  Her car came with no spare and I had been inactively looking for one).\n\nSo I\u2019m deep in the dog house if you didn\u2019t read between the lines.\n\nShe gets a tow to Superior Auto Care and they get after it in due time. Not unreasonable for a spur of the moment and professionally put those new tires on I already had in the truck.(I double checked and correct torque and the exact psi to spec and not \u201cnormal\u201d like most shops I have dealt with)\n\nThe question I had all morning..... was it my misjudgment and my wife is mad forever or was it a nail that even new tires could not prevent?\n\nBy all evidence from Superior Auto Care, it was a screw.  True detectives they are and me and my wife had a great week.\n\nIt was just a flat not a blow out by the pictures. she had. Her safety even by my own misjudgment would not have been compromised. But I\u2019m glad it was a screws fault and not my misjudgment.\n\nGreat guys over there. Phillip was more than helpful. Couldn\u2019t ask for better service in this situation by my wife\u2019s accord.\n\nShe got to work late, held it over my head while I didn\u2019t know if it was my fault. I committed to a lot of things I would do this week I had been putting off not knowing it was not my fault.  But, I\u2019m sitting here a happy man. Walked the dog while having conversations with my wife. Deep stuff that could have went the other direction.

He also drove me to work when I was dropping my car off so I didn't have to walk in the cold to work while being sick. He also was willing to drive to Atlanta while my car was having mechanic issues but thankfully, I was able to drive home with his help. I'm not sure what I can say to make you understand that all the amazing guys who work here genuinely care about you. The best part about this place that I frequently visit is that they love my 78 lb dog Waffle and are great about him visiting when the car needs work. They often ask about him if he is not with me. My first encounter with Firestone was with Brandon but since he left, I love the whole team.

Purchased a used vehicle from this dealership in May of 2020. I was sold when I was told that my vehicle had an Auto Nation warranty of \"90 days or 4,000 miles.\" Sounds great doesn't it? Well after being hurried along in signing paperwork so the vehicle could be mine I was very happy with my purchase. However, less than a month later, and still well within my \"warranty\" coverage period I got a Christmas tree of lights on my dashboard. I was told to take it to its dealership and from there I could then make the claim. When I called to make the claim, Auto Nation's warranty service said there was no vehicle with my VIN in the system. I then called the manager there who told me, \"I never signed any contract stating I had a warranty and it doesn't matter what I was told because it isn't in writing.\" I realized the manager was right about this however, I was being told one thing then they intentionally rushed me through signing paperwork so that I wouldn't catch that I never signed anything for my \"warranty\". The deceptive methods of these people shows that they are talented at one thing and, one thing only and, that is lying to people. These people are clearly slimy and cannot be trusted, save yourself the hassle and do not purchase a vehicle from here. Learn from my mistake, don't come here.

As we were on vacation the shop kept us updated on everything that was going on. (A part was having to be ordered from out of state) The original quote was $1,000 which I was OK with because they wanted to do a transmission flush as well. For the amount of work and parts I was happy with price. They called about half way through our week long trip to give us an update and the shop owner stated he would have it done before we got back or worst case senario, the day we got back. He also stated he thought it would be a bit cheaper, about $950, well that's great. No problem there! So the day we got home he called and said the car was finished and that he was able to do all the work for $860!!! He very well could have charged me the $1000 and I would have gladly payed. He instead did the honorable thing and charged me what it cost him! Also, very clean shop!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1553791759458, "text": "Thank you, John!

I went in back in April because I needed new brake pads and rotors. After waiting about 5 hours for them to install, it was finally done. About a month or 2 later, my vehicle starts to squeal anytime I apply my brakes. I took it into Goodyear at the beginning of October as the sound was getting unbearable. They checked my brakes and said that the rotors were cheap and needed to be fixed. They suggested me to take my vehicle back to fix the shorty work Mavis did to get warranty work as Mavis said I had a \u201cwarranty\u201d. The next day October 3 I took it into Mavis. Sure enough after looking at my car for 30 minutes my calipers were hanging down. I waited another 4 hours for them to put 2 calipers on. Why I paid them another 400 dollars is beyond me. As I was leaving there parking lot my vehicle was squealing when I applied the brakes but it seemed to be better. About a week ago, I noticed my vehicle started to shake and when I backed up it sounded like I had a flat tire. At this point I know I was intentionally being conned out of over 800 dollars from Mavis tire. I take my vehicle to pep boys on Sunday.\n\nMy calipers were loose again. They didn\u2019t tighten the damn bolts on the calipers. One caliper bolt was gone. The other one was about to be gone. Could have caused a huge accident. This is a terrible place of business. Eugene has no integrity in my opinion. I want to get my money back.\n\nI called customer service today talked to an answering service. Customer service never called me back.

Learned I needed the outer tie rod ends done, among a couple of other things. So I shopped around for cheaper prices and came across Midas in Hoover, AL. Took my vehicle to have the radiator and outer tie rod ends replaced/repaired and an alignment done on January 29, 2015. A week ago or so I noticed something was off with the ride of my vehicle. It would pull and had a slipping feel when turning and braking and just driving in general. It worsened and I felt I shouldn\u2019t be driving it. I started thinking I needed to take it back to Midas because something wasn\u2019t right with the steering and suspension (which they\u2019d \u201crepaired\u201d). On February 23, 2015, I cranked the car up to leave work and the steering wheel loosened and turned far right on its own. Called AAA to have my baby towed. The AAA guy instantly diagnosed it and said the tie rod wasn\u2019t done right. The pin wasn\u2019t inserted in the tie rod end. We found the bolt that came off in the parking lot.\n\nAll three AAA guys diagnosed the problem and confirmed about Midas improperly installing the outer tie rod ends. One even said that could be a lawsuit and Midas would eat the cost. Had I drove home, that could have been my life on the road. My baby was towed home on a flatbed and then towed straight to Midas the next morning on February 24, 2015. I was not confident in Midas working on my CRV again. Especially since they didn\u2019t do the job right the first time and it had to be done again. And on top of that, the same technician from the first time ended up working on my car this time around. They apologized and claimed the part was defective. I seriously doubt that. This was completely their fault. Point blank.\n\nAnd to top it all off, that same technician (initials TT, according to my invoice, I believe) that worked on my car both times and drove it out afterwards, stole $20 from my ashtray compartment. He reached down and picked something up off the floor and got out of my car while putting something in his pocket. We caught it before leaving and went back to confront the guy, a short white male that looked to be in his 30s maybe; thick southern drawl. They compensated my stolen possession\u2026with the exact money he stole from my vehicle -- minutes before. We made a little scene about it. It\u2019s the principle of the matter. I usually take my stuff out of my car when having it worked on or having it in the care of someone else. But I failed to completely take all my significant possessions out\u2026like my frikin\u2019 gas money left in the ashtray. Another technician informed us that that wasn\u2019t the first time something like that happened around there and that \u2018we didn\u2019t hear that from him\u2019.\n\nSo not only does Midas not properly repair parts on a car, they also search it and steal possessions. I\u2019m not confident in the repairing of their wrongdoing. I\u2019m wondering if something else might go wrong. Their credibility is shot with me. I actually feel I should be refunded the cost for labor, if not the whole amount. And since it was a \"defective part,\" they should refund me the cost for parts since the problem had to be fixed (and hopefully it actually is, this time and nothing else goes wrong from them working on it). I will be going to the home office about this. I will reach out to corporate about this. I will review the hell out of this Midas location. A situation like mine was potentially life-threatening and a definite lawsuit waiting to happen. They will not be getting my business.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1424964016387, "text": "Hey there, thanks so much for sharing this with us. Very sorry to hear about your experience.

We almost made the deal twice. After making our down payment and payment requirements very clear, the sales persons involved went to get approval. When they returned, the vehicle had been discounted, but they added a \"fee.\" That's the only thing he would say, \"a fee.\" They were trying to deliberately be vauge and, in our opinion, dishonest. After discussing their \"fee,\" we never actually achieved full disclosure. We were told the vehicle was at a different dealership within our city and we could go there to finalize the deal. They said that they would call ahead and we should just go over there. Our credit had already been run multiple times, and we had received approval from the credit company. With this in mind, we went to the other dealership location. As we arrived at the other location, they hadn't been given all the details as we had been led to believe. So the process began again, running in circles of double talk and running our credit again... We left at closing time and expected a phone call the next day to complete the deal... That has yet to happen days later. I used to have great respect for Greenway Automotive. It appears that Greenway has only taken over these dealerships at face value, and the same crooks that were already in place are still running things just like they always have. Avoid Greenway Honda in Florence, AL, and Greenway Chevy in Muscle Shoals, AL, if you are planning to make a deal on a used car.

I know it's all to protect them from liability suits. What ever happened to trust, recommendations, honest opinions? Every answer to every question seemed will rehearsed. Two days later my alternator goes out! Maybe a coincidence, but it seems like everyone I put my trust in the professionals, things start going wrong with my car. Don't trust mechanics, lawyers, maintenance individuals, had one of them tell me, \"if we fix it too well, we'll be out of a job, always have to leave something for another day.\" There's no real honest people in this area, not anymore. Bureaucrats have got their fingers into everything. Law suits are the \"American Way!\" So you can't really blame them to avoid taking responsibility for their actions. I know what my part costs, they were going to charge me nearly $500 in labor to loosen and tighten bout 6 bolts? A little extreme, they did an estimate but I never got to see it, I asked to see the defective part, but was given the excuse we would have to put it back on the lift. Since it wasn't on the lift, they had no plans to fix it!\n\nAllen from Phenix Firestone called, his only concern was why I was so critical of him.

If I could give zero stars I would.  They were to fix a Cv boot leak and replace pads on my front breaks.  The employee got into a car accident and damaged my car.  In addition, the break work was incomplete.  I had to after waiting over 5 hours immediately return to them for noises in the breaks.  But back to the accident, the police took statements from the witnesses.  The report states it was Precision Tune and Auto care at fault.  The employee even stated he was sorry and didnt see the other driver.  They were intially so appologetic. When I tried to contact Precision about repairs the manager Chris said he was waiting on the police report.  I kindly had my insurance make a copy for him and delivered it to him.  I call week later again asking what will happen or if someone will contact me.  He gives a different story getting short with me and saying they arent responsible for anything.  I asked if his company's insurance co will call me he got short with me.  I have complained to corporate but since this is an independent franchise their hands are tied so they say.  They charged me 584 for work performed and my car still has issues and damage to the body because of the employee's negligence and nobody is willing to fix the issue.  Who wrecks your car and then tells you their not responsible.  Well the manager Chris did.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891eb36e3b51c1:0x57c8fdb7a539f62"}

One of the store managers has manhood issues and thinks that all should bow down into him when he's nothing but pie. His name is Chris and have been employed by Precision multiple times...he has been known to steal cash from the register and also, had a bad drug habit as well. I'd strongly advise that you take your vehicle elsewhere. The owner of this Precision also has other locations around town and he doe not care about truth concerning how his business is ran but rather gotten money hungry at the expense of his employees and the customers.  Nor is their word any good for they tell you what you wanna hear but not man enough to deliver. All Precision Tune locations need to be under new management or close their doors for good.\nI speak this in truth for I was once employed with this establishment. I'm an ASE Master Certified Diesel & Gas Technician...yet was treated with disrespect and was lied to about the pay scale. I've seen firsthand the deceit & trickery of staff. Nor do they abide by standards placed before them in order to maintain a respectable business. Of course there's more to the story but enough has been said to bring the customers awareness up..for it is my duty & obligation to expose such when at the customers expenses.\nIt speaks volumes when you bring things to their attention yet they fail to acknowledge you or allow an explanation....so I chose to terminate my employment and since then...I've been trying to contact those in charge so that I may retrieve my other toolbox at the Pelham location but have yet been able to. Goes to show the level of care when they lose a highly trained technician because the so called service manager has no real knowledge of automobiles but is allowed to make decisions above his experience...but I'm being hindered in accessing all my tools since i can't the owners to meet me there to get my belongings. The Pelham store momentarily closed due to lack of business but yet they don't see as to why when it's self evident.\nPlease take your business elsewhere...even if it's to one like Hellen Keller...you'd have a better chance of getting professional lasting repairs.\n\nAttention to management: I need my tools from the Pelham location and have notified Chris and txt Rick only to receive absolutely no reply.

Here is what happened.  Called got a verbal quote of $139-189 per axle for a brake job with rotor's turned which is fair they are just below the dealer which was $200 per axle.  Went the next day to have services done to my car.  Before they began work they inspected it and determine I needed pads all the way and rotor's on the rear and a brake fluid exchange.  Estimate price was over $700.  I declined the brake fluid exchange and they offered some \"competitive\" discounts brought my total down to about $580.  Still more than it should be.  Asked for a printed estimate when I saw the estimate I knew something was up.  They had part numbers and prices on the estimate.  Quick Google search confirmed the part numbers and prices from a local part supply store that they would be getting the parts from.  They are marking up parts pricing 100+%.  Industry standard is between 10-25%.  Then they told me that the estimate was nearly at cost and if he went any lower he would lose his job.  Nothing but scam and scare tactics were used with me and I didn't take the bait.  Tried to email the address on the general managers card it wouldn't ever go through.  Called the corporate office gave them the info and the pictures I have attached here and they said a regional manager would get back with me still have not heard from that person either.

My car had been at the shop for almost a month and the only information given to me the first week was that it could be my motor. Each week I called to get an update and I was given a day that he would look at it. Well of course that never happened.  On Wednesday I went by the shop since I was in the area to get an update. David's wife went and spoke with David only to tell me it could be my motor and he has not had a chance to look back at it. My next question to her was when will he get a chance to look at it. And with an attitude she told me she didn't know and for me to speak with David.  I went over to David and introduced myself and he explained the same thing that he told me over three weeks ago. I explained to him that I'm in someone else's car and I need an update. He then begins to explain that other cars were ahead of me. And like I told David my car has been at this shop for almost a month and I've called weekly for updates and that is something you could have explained to me while we were on the phone. He also told me he would look into the recalls for my car and that never happened. I researched that information and presented to him on Wednesday. Then he says I'll look at it by the end of the week. I had just called him Friday morning and he told me that he would look at it that afternoon and give me a call but here we are in another week and I'm supposed to believe that he was going to look at it by the end of week.

He's extremely knowledgable and kind, and will repair your vehicle effectively while charging a fair price. This shop may not look fancy, nor does it even have a website, but this is a quality mechanic who you can trust.\n\n(Not so) quick story:\n\nWe have a 2013 VW Tiguan, which had a series of oil leaks over the past year. Each time the car began to malfunction, we took the car to the jack ingram dealership, where we would be given some roundabout oil leak explanation and reluctantly let them do the $300+ repair. The car has ~90,000 miles and is up to date on scheduled maintenance.\n\nIn May 2020, the car indicated low oil and started to shudder on the interstate with a low oil issue again, so we took it to a local firestone and capped off the oil then drove to jack ingram. While the service representative (Megan) was extremely pleasant and professional, her explanation of the mechanics' diagnostics was absurd. She said that the timing chain needed to be replaced (at 90k miles, a part which should last at least 120,000 miles) along with the chain tensioner and a series of other gaskets, totaling ~$3,400. As some sort of bizarre sales oriented pressure tactic, they offered an alternative - replacing the engine - as they printed a quote that was approximately $12,000. The car is maybe worth $6,500.\n\nI asked for a parts list to understand the extent of the bill and noticed that these people want to replace every durable bolt, washer, screw, etc. possible in order to drive the price up as much as possible (image attached). Obviously, we took the $140 hit on the diagnostic fee and went elsewhere.\n\nThankfully, after calling local shops, we found Powell's Automotive in downtown Montgomery, where David Powell's team actually conducted a diagnosis with UV dyed oil to find the source of the leak (high pressure oil pump), which had nothing to do with the timing chain (tensioner returned to the correct position once the oil was returned to normal pressure). The timing chain was absolutely fine. We ended up paying a fraction of the cost for the correct repair on the vehicle to a company that actually wants to do the job right.\n\nWe would have spent $3,400+ for an unnecessary new timing chain and STILL would have had the same issue, had it not been for Mr. Powell. He was extremely professional and diligent with the issue, even driving the car 40+ miles to confirm the issue was resolved after repair.\n\nIf you want the job done right, and for it to be priced fairly, go to Powell's Automotive.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e8179d711e9d5:0xd6499be4d1ee5f7a"}

A new water pump was installed, but didn't last 100 miles. I returned the vehicle only to have the auto shop refuse to replace the water pump free of charge. I removed the water pump that weekend to find they cross threaded the new water pump and warped the unit. No wonder it did not function properly. After re-tapping a couple of screws and several hours out of my Saturday I replaced the new pump myself. Now I am out the price of another water pump, thanks a lot.\n\nMany people do not know this, but each repair job has an attached amount of time associated with it. So, if an auto center changes your brakes in 30 min but the book says it takes 1.5 hours, then the shop charges you for the extra hour as an extra rake. Now, I do not mind paying the extra as long as the quality matches. This shop may do quick work, but it is not at the quality I am paying for. Poor value given, and they would not make it right either. Basically the repair guy did not remove all the necessary components (like a radiator) to save some time and shoved the water pump in at an angle.\n\nI will never use them again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888c4e6e0b99431:0x62babd6da353f44f"}

They fixed both and stuck to fair estimate.\n\nI wouldn't do business with them now after my last experience.\n\nMonth 1 & 2\nOur car needed a new engine. The shop owner wanted to get an engine from his supplying junkyard. He missed one that became available. This process took about 2 weeks before we decided to find an engine ourselves which he was not happy with but agreed to. He said they could have it put in within a 3 day period. The engine company we bought from needed it done in 10 days for warranty purposes. Griffith used all of the 10 days to because other cars came in front of me while we had to wait on engine. They finally got it in and started but had to send to dealership because the car went into anti-theft mode and wouldn't start. We had to actually arrange the drop off to the dealership ourselves. I feel like we were running his business for him because he was almost never there. The employees even mentioned that problem in passing.\n\nMonth 3\nWe become worried after not hearing anything from dealership or Griffin for about 2.5ish weeks. I had to contact dealership for them to tell me that they told Griffin that the car needed a major fuse panel that could be $1200+. I called Griffin to tell him I approved the install because we really needed the car. It's month 3 folks!\n\nIs it Month 4? Getting close anyway.\nWe had to go ourselves to the dealership to confront them about not getting to our car. This should be Griffin's job. The dealership says that the part didn't fix the problem. Car still doesn't work. We decide to give up because the car needed another part for $2400 to \"maybe\" fix. We decide to just give up. Dealership is trying to get more money from us even though they didn't fix the problem. Griffin is trying to put that on us. We said we would pay for his time, but does this seem fair? Griffin himself might be a knowledgable mechanic, but he is a rookie business owner with no organization or management skills of his people.  He wasted a huge amount of our time (3+months), money ($6000+) and stressed my wife and I to no end. We are going to have to scrap our car with a new engine that doesn't run.\n\nThey do good oil changes and put a muffler on another car we brought, but he also made me pay for the part up front which shows bad business to me as well.\n\n* FINAL RESULT\npaid griffin $1400 because the car ended up not working out. He said he made no money and it would have been $2000 if it had worked + whatever it would be to charge AC. When we walked in to pay he didn't even recognize us. My wife and I talked to this guy several times in person and on phone. The waiting area had mice running around too FYI if you are scared of them. After that we went to the dealer shop that had our car and basically gave it to the tech working on it. he paid for the dealer work and gave us a little cash. When we went to clean the car out I noticed that the driver seat leather looked very dirty and worn. Griffin said he was sorry.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888c4e6e0b99431:0x62babd6da353f44f"}

I didn't know for sure exactly where or what was causing it, didn't want to spend my only free evening of the week with my wife and kid trying to figure it out, but also didn't want to leave a leak overnight so I took off work early to go get it fixed.  My vehicle needed an oil change as well anyway so I took it in and explained it was likely the filter or one of the lines that needed replaced.\n\nSure they changed my oil no problem, but the guy came around and said he wouldn't fix the leak, that it was a \"missing o-ring that they didn't carry in stock\" and I'd need to take it back to whoever put the existing filter on and have them do the repair.  Now, I replace my filters every 40,000 miles or so and I've moved a couple of times since then.  I have no idea where I was exactly when I replaced my filter last, because it's a small fix.  I got there at 4:30 pm, close of business at 6, so it wasn't like I pulled up at quitting time.  I had to take more time off work the next morning to disconnect everything myself and find it was simply a hairline crack in the filter.  The mechanic that I talked to didn't even verify anything, except what I already knew that yep there's a fuel leak there.  He just spewed some bs that he thought sounded good because he didn't feel like doing his job...

Not only did they drive the same,  they were significantly cheaper than the big name brands. The biggest plus, I was back on the road in about an hour. I've waited over 4hours at some places in the past. Since, I've replaced tires on my other 4 vehicles using Pete Shirley. Asked them to put on something they normally stocked on these 4 vehicles, and all road out great, and in and out of the store in a timely manner. They also don't sell the gimmicky road side warranty.

I went in to get oil change and a get a quote on new master cylinder for my son's car. My son had a free oil change card that his mother gave him.  This his first oil change of his first car I bought him last year. He's had the card for over a year and it has no expiration date on it. The service tech \"manager\" said he didn't think the card was still good. Again, it had no expiration date on it. He said well it should've been signed by manager, though there's no place for it to be signed by a manager. The \"manage\" said well anyone could've just picked it up and put the date on it and brought it back.  I said I didn't do that nor did my son or his mother. I told him I didn't appreciate being accused of stealing a free oil change card. He said two other people did that yesterday. I said that is not my fault nor an excuse to accuse me of doing the same thing. He could not understand what he had done over a $34.95 oil change. He called the owner and the owner said the card fine, of course. He did not apologize for accusing me of stealing the free oil change card. He said he had to make sure it was ok or it would come out of his paycheck. Again, no reason to ever utter someone could have just picked one up and brought it in unsigned. All he had to say is he had to call his owner to see how to process the card not accuse me of possibly stealing it. With that lack of ability to understand the damage to the customer for your handling of this made me question giving someone like that the responsibility to work on the brakes on my son's car. So, I took my free oil change card from his fingertips and told the inexperienced \"manager\" that I'd take my business elsewhere. As I left he said the free oil change card was \"null and void\". He just had to be right. He would not listen to the customer who was getting ready to pay $559 for work plus and extra $36 for the full synthetic oil change. Hint empathy people. I only do business with people I like period and though I just met this guy he gave me reason not to like him in under 10 minutes. I had never been in a Meineke in my life until today and will never do so again. Thanks to this manager at the South Huntsville shop.

They were able to replace that at no cost to me. Secondly, screws were missing and clips weren't reinstalled. The manager assured me they would be replaced, and they were. Lastly the radiator was mounted improperly (very wobbly, almost hitting the engine). This was initially resolved with plastic zip ties and told by the manager that it was repaired and I was good to go. Obviously this was unacceptable at an initial service fee of $105/hr. They did end up properly mounting the radiator but only after I noticed the \"shade tree mechanic\" level of work.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1622217940957, "text": "This is definitely not the experience you should expect from Meineke, Ryan.

It did not solve the problem, so they took everything apart and replaced my coil - saying we will not charge you for what you do not need - nor charge you for the additional labor.

They are very professional, kind, and pleasant to work with.\n\nI had a blow out, on Friday, September 7th on I-459 while driving South @ 5:45 pm. I hit SIRI on my phone and located the closest tire store to my location and I sure am glad she steered me towards Darrin Gilliam and his team. I slowly limped my way to the store and got out at 5:55pm on Friday afternoon and Mr. Gilliam asked how he could help me. I told him I needed a tire that I just had a blow out and was traveling to Hale County and needed to get home. He checked his inventory, but did not have the tire size I needed, but went well above and beyond to find one for me. He had two other guys and himself on phones calling all around to different stores trying to locate one and I was worried about them closing the doors at 6 pm, but he stated they do not close the doors until all customers are taken care of and would not leave me stranded.\n\nAfter locating a tire and having it brought there, Darrin Gilliam, Jasson Trammell and Matt Ramirez installed the tire and rim and helped me get back on the road. I have never ever been to ANY BUSINESS 5 minutes before closing time and especially on a Friday afternoon to receive great customer service like this. These gentleman stayed over with smiles on their faces just to make sure I was taken care of, regardless of the time.  While I was waiting, I did notice this location was very well organized and everyone there worked together as a team. This store definitely has their ducks in a row.\n\nThe management and workforce in this store is \"bar none\" the best I have ever seen. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t live close enough to do business with this store, but I will recommend anyone in this area to make this your \u201cgo to place\u201d for all of your automotive needs. I will check out the store in Tuscaloosa and see if their standards are as good as this store on 5036 Bond Blvd. Thanks again guys for all your professional and kind help on a short notice at quitting time on a late Friday afternoon. This store should win the store of the year award!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1536677351270, "text": "Chad, thank you for taking the time to share your positive Express Oil Change & Tire Engineers experience!

When your vehicle originally came to our center it would jerk and not even move, after diagnosing the obvious transmission issue we discussed a low mile used transmission was the best option for your budget and overall goal of repair.. The original repair was done in April and has been fine until now.  You came back to center for an issue that I agreed is there however the codes being set were manufacturer codes that could not be read by our computer. My recommendation was to have a dealer scan to diag said codes to determine if in fact it was in transmission at which point it would be taken care of under your warranty.. I take a lot of pride in what we do here and would never not repair a vehicle under warranty. In fact in your case with it being a used transmission from a supplier I wouldn't be out anything to repair your transmission if that's the issue. The supplier of your transmission under the warranty would have to provide a replacement unit and compensate our shop for the issue because of there transmission falling prematurely . Again I completely understand your frustration but there is a reason for the instructions given and it certainly wasn't to not honor a warranty. It was simply to gain more information to submit a warranty claim to the supplier to replace the transmission if again it was found to be faulty..

In March of 2018 my transmission gave up in my truck. My family had been using Aamco Trussville since the doors opened, so obviously I would trust them with mine. In July my truck started making noise one morning, next thing I know it had locked up tight before I could even react. Could not even turn the crank with a socket and all the spark plugs out. I called Aamco in Trussvile just to make sure it couldn't be the trans they had just \"rebuilt\" . I was assured that there was no way a transmission failure could cause an engine to seize like that and they would be happy to price me some engine work. Being in the auto industry myself, I decided I woukd price and engine and install it myself eventually since I had another form of transportation to get me by. Well here I am in Jan. of 19, still in warranty. I have pulled my motor and behold, the transmission is locked up tight, WILL NOT TURN. Motor turns fine now that it is disconnected and has great compression on all cylinders. I contacted Aamco Trussville to tell them my situation and was fully expecting them to be gentlemen and fess up to their mistake. As soon as I mentioned it was out of the truck and I could bring it down for them to see, I was told it would not be under warranty because I pulled it. The only reason I pulled it is because we were all under the assumption (including Aamco) my motor was locked up. They are now saying they are under new management with new staff and can't take my word for someone else that was in the previous staff telling me what they did. Well, Aamco of Trussville is Aamco of Trussville.I just want my truck back. My wife is a stay at home mom and Ive been driving her only form of transportation lately. This is a strange position for both of us to be in, I understand that. But whats right is whats right. I work hard and am an honest man. I feel like I am being taken advantage of and thrown away because they have all the customers they need. I know places like this, cant stand by the product, rotate staff.
