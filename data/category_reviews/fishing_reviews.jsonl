We did the \u201cNear\u201d shore 4 hour fishing trip. He has a smallish boat but it was just the right size for us.  We fished the old lighthouse and the Red Fish were biting and fighting!  The kids loved it!  First we tried for speckled trout near the docks and had no luck but luckily our change of scenery paid off.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_m8tVYTjAwoOXe54AGUm47xclNOrzLnOBC-uO=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHzj27AY-87sPXfqTBrK9yeVdVPNlxJcSFA7xt=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzyzARo4k3hkE7k_MpNloT6fCqSNUZZSI3W2cQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfvdl2bY3GzOnUb0Qgpx1NPRI2oiKdDdsXK8dS=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxf8RLNl6GBqthqFuCn3wCKI301mfutxbIdxkg=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_3YJFbL_hZKOwnklj8ZJn302e5mWXhtE6gLbi=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBhEXExECK4wQupb9DLDi5AavX2msr1E_hXkst=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSfoXV5WmDA-KYI8rWyEciRavFXYT5BByylHm-=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a07aa2e4ec34f:0x7ac21160a1a14f0a"}

Expensive chartered fishing trip and we mainly stayed within site of the marina and caught only one tiny fish.  He had us back at just before the 4 hour mark from the scheduled meeting time.
