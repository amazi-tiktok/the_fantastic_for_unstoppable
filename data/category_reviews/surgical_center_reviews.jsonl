On Dec 8 2020 Dr. Bonazt entered the room and began talking with the door of the room wide open. I asked if he could close the door while we discussed my injury. His response no because of COVID-19 a violation of my patients rights mind you Dr. Bonazt was not wearing a mask nor gloves so much for concerns. Also, while waiting on him the door was closed the entire time and anyone else that entered closed the door behind them. He ask me what my job title was twice which I\u2019m sure was on my report. He indicated that the fracture was healing pretty good I didn\u2019t need surgery and therefore there was nothing else he could do. I question him because I must be 100% my strength in my hand indicated that I could hold up to13lbs briefly. I asked him for copies of the report he denied me of that also, stating that workman\u2019s comp would have to request it. Forgetting when I visit him the first time he did.

The paperwork said to come in at 8 am and the procedure was at 9am. We arrived before 8 he checked in and he was given an id about 8:20 and the nurse informed him he arrived early. We didn\u2019t think anything of that statement until he was called back again before 9am. She told him his appointment was at 10am and he was suppose to be there at 9am. He told her no that\u2019s not what my paperwork says and she sent him back to the waiting room. Long story short we watched people come and go after we arrived.  I complained and he complained and we showed them the paperwork with the highlighted arrival and procedure times. Again go sit down and we will call you. They called him to the back we\u2019re both thinking for surgery shortly after 9am. I was called to the back thinking he was done at 10:30 and they still hadn\u2019t done the surgery.  I was told around 10:45 to go back up front it was 11:50 when they called me to the back again. At this point only 2 of us were In the waiting room. I know things happen but not once did anyone apologize or even acknowledge they had made a mistake. We had the paperwork with the time to arrive and the time of the surgery. If you make a mistake you fix it I feel like because we complained they put people ahead of us. How could we get there before 8am and only me and one other person be left in the waiting room. It was 12:30 before we were able to leave.

Before I started the awful prep solution (I had already gone all day without eating anything but green Jell-O) I wanted to make sure we were still going to have the procedures with the expected snow, and since my doctors office was closed Wednesday all day, I messaged my doctor on here.  She said that I should have gotten a call from Madison Surgery Center (which I never did) but that they would open at 9am the following morning.  So Daddy and I got up and left his house (in Hazel Green) at 7am Thursday, drove 20mph, sliding around everywhere and finally made it about 8:40am to the Madison Surgery Center only to find that NO ONE was there.  We waited until 9:15am or so before we finally headed back home, sliding and driving 20mph.  Madison Surgery Center had decided to close and apparently had text my doctor at 3am in the morning Thursday and let her know they were going to close.  They never called me at all.  Thankfully, my mom was ticked off and called until she could get me in at Crestwood (so I wouldn't have to go through drinking the prep stuff and not eating again the next week in order to have the procedures done.)  My doctor was so nice and got a babysitter for her son and came in and still did my procedure at Crestwood the same day!  Dr. Roath was really great and so was Crestwood and all the nurses who took care of me there.  She was very sorry for the mix up and said that Madison Surgery Center should have called me.  Very aggravating that Madison Surgery Center made no effort to let me know that they were closing and my Dad and I basically risked our lives driving to Madison in the ice and snow, with me dehydrated and starving from not eating or drinking all day, only to have to turn right back around and drive back in it.

My doctor's office was closed but I was able to speak to my doctor via facebook.  She said that I would receive a call from MSC (which I never did) if anything changed but that they would have a delayed opening the following morning. I got up and checked their website which still said they would open at 9 am.  So me and my driver got up and left very early because I was also told that if MSC opened and we didn't come that there would be a $75 cancellation fee.  We made it there only to find that NO ONE was there.    MSC had decided to close without no notification to me at all.  Now this is bad enough for any procedure but can you imagine having to take that awful prep solution again (than cost me $32 the first time)?  Very upset.   We later found out that there were other patients that they didn't call.  Several pulled up that morning for procedures but left when no one was there.   Very aggravating that MSC didn't call to let me know that they were closing while we basically risked our lives trying to get there.  So disappointed in MSC and how they handled the situation and their lack of respect for their patients.\n\nThe next day when MSC opened, I called them and spoke to the office manager because I felt like I was owed an explanation. I was very nice and only asked what happened.  She basically told me that they had tried to call and  had a wrong number.  They didn't call any of my doctor's other appointments that were scheduled for that day.  Guess they had wrong numbers for them too.  In fact, they said that they were working off of an incomplete patient listing.  She also went on to say that they had two employees show up which I quickly disputed because I got out of the car and knocked on the door and it was dark and no one was there. She backed off of the claim at that point.  I didn't receive any kind of apology from her, which I still feel like I am owed.  I know that sometimes things happen like bad weather which is out of our control but with this age of technology at least the website could have been updated.    The website still said that MSC would open at 9 am the following morning when I was up taking the last of my prep.  I feel like this was very unprofessional,  I would avoid using MSC.  There seems to be no sympathy at all there towards their patients or at least none towards me when I called.  I am still in shock over how things were handled.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626f7f172518b1:0x4e7f8341bf56837e"}

Just a few days after that, I went to pick up my new remakes.  I was not satisfied with the field of vision they offered, and Ashley showed me the three types of lenses available.   I selected a set with a broader field of vision and, in spite of the $80 increase each of the three sets would entail, placed my order.  The next day, Ashley called to tell me she had discussed my case with the manager, and they had decided to wave all further fees, so these three new pairs would be free!   Double-wow!   I was impressed and, frankly, touched by the empathy, attention, personal concern, and expert service I received from Eyecare Associates.

I normally see either Dr. Harris or Dr. Jackson. On this visit I was seen by Doctor Fredrick Jackson and it was a truly amazing experience. Everyone was extremely courteous and friendly. I was really impressed with Dr. Jackson on this occasion. He took his time explaining everything he was doing and why he was doing it. His explanations and genuine concern went a long way in putting my fears to rest. He not only took an interest in my eye health, but he was also very forthcoming with sharing some possible solutions to other areas of my overall health that could potentially affect my eye health. He offered some possible solutions to help with bouts of vertigo I have been experiencing for a couple of years now. He suggested some things that I could try to help to minimize the severity of the migraine headaches that I have been suffering for more than thirty years. No one else had ever made the suggestions to me that he did. I can't wait to put them into practice to see if they will help even the tiniest little bit. Thanks, Dr. Jackson, for one of the most enjoyable appointments I have ever had. And trust me, I will make sure that you are highly recommended to everyone that I know who needs a good optometrist. Keep up the good work.\n\nHad my yearly exam on February 4, 2015 and must say that it was a very interesting experience. Even though the wait time was a few minutes past my appointment time, I clearly understand why. The doctors spend as much time as needed with each patient and I realize that I will get the same type of treatment when it is my turn. Also, Dr. Harris' staff are extremely kind, considerate, and compassionate. I just love Dr. Harris to death (no offense Dr. Jackson, I love you, too). Even though he informed me that I have cataracts, he took the time to explain all of my options and shared his experiences with his father's surgery. I left the office feeling very good and felt that Dr. Harris had provided me with all the information that I needed to make a decision. Once I made the decision, he even scheduled an appointment for me--talk about the personal touch approach. I would highly recommend Primary Eyecare Associates to anyone. As a matter of fact, my entire family uses Primary Eyecare Associates. So, if you are looking for a good eye care center and optometrist, give them a call, THEY ARE THE BEST I have ever used.

Dr.Hedden at my consult seemed nice enough it was a bit of a wait but he apologized for it no biggie or so I thought . I must admit that they do tell you that you probably won't go back immediately you will have some wait. Well I was coming from out of town my surgery was to be at 9:30 am I didn't get called back until 12:20. I had asked what was taking so long as I was paying for a caretaker by the hour and hadn't eaten the night before, I asked the Dr. personally about it he said sorry but sometimes in surgery things happen it shouldn't be much longer he seemed to get agitated but still professional offered me a refund I stated no since I had waited over 3 hours by this time please proceed as soon as possible. While another hour and 30 minutes go by with me in this thin bathroom no nurse or anything comes to check on me I put my clothes back on and ask the lady at the front how much longer she states she didn't know and she went and found someone. By this time I go back to my room then comes in Patrick who was very nice and was going to start my IV, they called him out of the room then comes in Nurse Manager Win (Nguyen ). She states how can we make you happy I'm like at this point just get my arm surgery started and I'm happy I told her I was fine I just wanted to get it over with since I have come all this way. She states I dont think we can make you happy you're going to give the practice a \"bad review\" I said I am about the lack of communication but I can't say anything about surgery. I was like I'm over it I just want to get my arm lift done so I can go home. She basically said they didn't want to do it because I complained about the wait time. Who or what person taught these people business etiquette I wasn't loud I just stated that I would be giving a review to let people know how they treat their patients. I stated again I'm fine she extended a discount on cool sculpting I accepted I thought everything was fine. Dr. Hedden comes in very very nasty and stated we're not doing your surgery and we're giving you a full refund and I told him I was fine I wasn't happy but not angry enough not to have my surgery after I have waited over 5 hours he storms out wouldn't hear it. They didn't give me a on refund on my travel or hotel, informed the spa not to do my cool sculpting, and also would not honor a gift certificate that I was given. I wasn't all smiles and giggles, but I didn't get loud or curse. The staff couldn't believe it and said they had never heard of such. Please don't go there Dr. Hedden is a bully and don't dare ask to question why you are waiting or you too could be out of money and time beware stay away awful !!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1504756710051, "text": "We always try to do everything to accommodate patient's. What happened in this case which she is not disclosing is that she requested a late arrival time. She was told in doing that she could not be given an exact start time but that she would be following other cases. She expressed that she was upset about the wait when she first arrived. Our office manager offered her and her care giver a free spa service for the inconvenience. She seemed to be happy at that point. When she was brought back I explained we were sorry for any delay but that when someone ask for a delayed start time that it becomes more dependent on the cases before them which are not something that can be predicted. She then explained she was upset that she was paying for a sitter she hired and was having to pay her. I explained we would pay for the sitters time for her delay. Again she seemed happy with that. She then told the nurse that she also wanted some other procedures for free or she would write a bad review if she was not given them. She had voiced this to several staff members. I then went back into the room and told her I did not feel comfortable operating on someone who was blackmailing the practice in an attempt to get procedures for free. That this was not the right way to start a doctor patient relationship and that we would offer her a full refund and cover her sitter for any inconvenience but that I could not proceed now that threats were made in an attempt to get more free services when we had already tried to do so much for her. She then went up to the spa and asked for monetary exchange for the free spa services we had just given her. We always do everything we can to help our patients and do whatever we can to make their experience as nice as possible but this was not our fault. There is a reason we are one of the busiest practices in the country and it's because we do great work and take care of our patients. We treat everyone as if they were family.

I would NEVER recommend him for anything. They were 5 hours behind the day I got my surgery. I went almost two days without food or water. When I went back to have the IV put in, because I was so dehydrated it took two different people to stick me about 12 times. Finally got back and they stuck me in the supply closet/room where all the implants was. I was like what the heck. I should have walked out. I told the anesthesia to please give me something for nausea before they woke me up, due to I will start thowing up. I woke up in a wheelchair, at my car, 8pm at night, throw up bowl and throwing my guts up. The anesthesia basically said okay to my husband and took the wheelchair and took off. I felt like I had been hit by a train. I thought I was truly going to die that night.  I was sick and hurt for days. When I went back I was so extremely disappointed in my upper and lower eye lift. Dr Hedden was like, oh well that\u2019s all I can do. Long story short, breast augmentation drop huge in 2 years, I had them removed by another surgeon. The other surgeon also told me Dr Hedden did not remove the fatty tissue in my lower eyelid, so that\u2019s why I still had sagging. I was also told Dr Hedden\u2019s office was known for breast implants in and out, in and out. Trust me, you get what you pay for.  Go to a better surgeon!!!

I personally checked every Glenda as well as the one and only Tippett but who has a different first name. I looked at all of those patients charts to see if anyone may have had the surgery this person talks about and no one did. So she most likely has us confused with another practice. I\u2019m going to respond to this review though just to give some clarification on our practice and how this could not have happened. First of all no one is ever asked or told to go without food or water for more than 6 hours before their scheduled surgery time. That\u2019s just no safe. Second this person states she was put in a closet. Not really sure what practice could really look like that but ours obviously does not. Anyone reading this can simply take the virtual tour which shows our operating rooms and see that we are probably the nicest surgery center in Alabama and with cardiac size operating rooms. So I really believe she has us confused with another practice. We do all types of cosmetic surgery and are world renowned for all types of cosmetic breast surgery as well. But for the last 15 years I have always charged the same price. I just think that\u2019s doing right by the Patient by trying to make plastic surgery more affordable. But what she put as what she paid is nowhere closed to what we charge for the procedures she states she had. We always remove fat when lid surgery is performed but some fat has to remain around the orbit to cushion and protect the eye. We also have some of the best anesthesia staff in the city and always give patients nausea medication and never have someone leave before their wide awake and able to take care of themselves. Anesthesia does not wheel them to their car. Our recovery nurses help them outside. Lastly I give my cell number to every single patient that comes through our office if someone has a problem I would hope they would actually call the number. I give out my number because I truly do care about all of our patients that\u2019s why I even still make house calls if needed."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889160ab45d4869:0x3e6975f2afcb69a5"}

I have contacted his office serveral times to discuss the issues and was brushed off. I will now be seeking a malprimalpr lawsuit, as the implants have caused more and more pain over the years and made my job as an exotic dancer impossible to perform. I can not even look in the mirror without crying and I suffer a lot of pain. I would not recommend this man to anyone. He acts like he is the best doctor until you have an issues .my deformity issues showed as soon as the swelling was down and I was informed that this was his mistake. I am also suffering CC due to him placing textureed implants when this was not what I was asked for at all. His resolution to this issue was to just remove the inplants he placed, leaving me with scars and saggy breasts. I plan to gather all of the women I have found in online support groups that he has wronged.\nEdit*** I am most definitely one of your patients and have the serial numbers on a card to prove that you used a textured Sientra implant on me. When I confronted Dr. Hedden about this and the double bubble within weeks after surgery, he told me that he would remove my implants and not offer any money back or to replace the implants. I wore all support recommended and didn't try to go back to dancing until years after surgery, which I can also prove. I also have records from a plastic surgeon that I saw in Georgia within months after my surgery, who informed me that a doctor should not have used the implants used, neither texture nor size, neither of which Dr. Hedden spoke to me about before or after surgery. All he did waswbrush me off. I have been suffering since surgery and plan to sue if something is not done to make this right, and especially since you are now denying the use of textured implants. Also, I don't have my full name on this site and use a nickname for my own safety.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1540401214274, "text": "We tried to find this patient in our system but no one comes up with her name or anything close to it. We also do not use textured implants as the carry a risk of patients developing a form of cancer. So I\u2019m not sure if this is a patient of ours or even a true patient.  But I will try to respond to her issues. We do perform close to a thousand implants each year and do have several patients who are also dancers. I always try to stress this to dancers ..that you must wear very good support during the healing process and reframe from dancing for the first 3-4 weeks. Otherwise your pocket is not healed enough to prevent migration of the implant down and to the side which is the direction the muscle wants to push it. Patients that come in with no droopiness and wanting a good small implant do not have their muscle changed and so most of the time the implant will not shift much. Also going above the muscle would typically not lead to this but patients would be at higher risk for rippling and capsular contracture (CC). But if someone wants either a very large implant or they have severe droopiness then it will lead to some of the inferior pectoral muscle having to be detached to allow the larger implant to fit or the droopiness to be camouflaged. Thus running the risk of lateral drift if the muscles are used too soon such as an exotic dancer going back to work right away and or not wearing support. So it is very important to always follow the guidelines from your surgeon to minimize any risk of complications. We always offer bliss insurance which would cover any cost of fixing any issues as well. So I\u2019m not sure she is a true patient or our patient because she would have most likely obtained this.\nAddendum; she called our office yesterday and is using a different name here but she is very mistaken she does not have textured implants. My nurse called the implant company and gave the serial number to them as well. This is not the appropriate placed to discuss these issues as she should come back in and see us but she wishes to slander us and make accusations that are completely wrong. When someone comes in with droopiness , one breast lower than the other and their breast drifting to the sides because of their chest wall you have a few options all of which are always offered to patients. Asymmetry and droopiness.. best treated with a lift with implants ( cost twice as much and leaves scar that not all patients want ) or biplaner breast augmentation ( less cost , less , scaring but carries the risk of feeling the implant at the bottom and slight double bubble) or going above the muscle (requires silicone, higher risk of capsular contracture). If she really wants this to be educational for you she would consent to her pictures being shown which will show where she started and where she was 3 months out and let everyone judge for themselves. Now it\u2019s very easy to seek a second opinion and a doctor not that busy to say ( without even seeing your before pictures) that something was done wrong. You must understand not all doctors offer all options and some have no experience with biplaner approaches. They will be quick to say something was done wrong so they can charge you to be reoperated on. Always be careful of the doctor giving an opinion without seeing your before pictures. Again this is not the best way to discuss your concerns."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889160ab45d4869:0x3e6975f2afcb69a5"}

I had a breast augmentation in July of 2012 and it was okay. I did 290cc of saline I can't say anything bad about that surgeon. I just wanted an upgrade I wanted them bigger and I wanted silicone! I had a friend that went to dr. Hedden and she was very pleased with him, so I decided I scheduled a consultation with him it took me about 2 months to get a consultation. I was in the office for probably 15 mins before I was called into a room to see dr. Hedden! Me and my boyfriend played around with the samples while we waited to see what size we liked. I was kinda hard for me to tell what it would look like since I already had implants. Originally I was wanting to go to a 450! But me and my boyfriend continued to talk about it and said we really couldn't even tell a difference so we picked 500 (he wanted me to go a lot bigger being a male of course) but I researched and researched females my size and 500 cc of silicone gel, and I truly liked the size and I felt those would look best! My consultation was July the 14th and that day we scheduled the surgery for august the 10th. My surgery was scheduled for 8 I got back in the room about 9 around 10 the took me back for surgery. I remember waking up around 12:15 and I left at 12:30, I ended up getting 525cc silicone gel! It was a super easy process. I felt like everything was done in a timely manor. I stayed the night the night of my surgery and had to follow up post op day one, while I was there I got some juvaderm injections in my lips! It was pretty painful but I have to say I absolutely love them! They a beautiful I've received so many compliments on my lips! I'm now post op day 5 I can pretty much do anything I'm still a little sore! I will return to work Friday and I can't wait to show off my lips! I highly recommend dr. Hedden and his facility. He truly listens to you and your concerns. He puts his patients first. The staff is awesome as well, they make you feel at home. And the anesthesiologist was great to!

This disrespectful vet had our Lab, who had been our family pet for 12 years, for the entire day. Somehow between keeping our dog for 8 hours, charging us 400$ just for bloodwork and X-rays, he failed to notice the 5 pound tumor on our dogs spleen. The tumor caused our dogs spleen to rupture in which we took to another vet in town, who was amazing and their entire staff treated us with the upmost respect and professionalism. They had to do emergency surgery for which our pup didn\u2019t make it. Aside from overcharging us, and missing the key diagnoses for the situation, he was extremely disrespectful and unprofessional to my wife and I. His passive aggressive, sarcastic remarks all of which regarding money, were almost overwhelming. Not to mention that he didn\u2019t even send any meds home with us to help my dog. Neither myself nor anyone I know in our community will be using this vet ever again. He really needs to do some self reflection and learn how to be respectful and professional all the way around.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1607195277424, "text": "Mr. Burgamy,\nWe were perplexed by your scathing review because as you left our office on Monday, Nov. 30th you thanked us repeatedly for all we had done and assured Dr. Johnston and the rest of the staff that Cooper would be returning the next day for the free treatment that had been offered. We were even more surprised by the hostile text from your father that was sent to Dr. Johnston after hours. Thankfully, your father was willing to answer our phone calls and understood our position. It has come to my attention that you may have heard a briefing between the vet and staff, which is often much blunter than the conversation between a vet and the client by necessity. Unfortunately, I believe that this misunderstanding may be the source of this perplexing review. Our staff would never speak to a client in the same manner as they do to each other as we understand that clients do not handle these situations on a regular basis. All conversation that has taken place between you and the staff at Pike Animal has been compassionate and courteous up to this point.\nI would like to assure you that our staff does not bring up money unless asked to do so by the client. We did everything in our power to help you and Cooper. I would like to remind you that we did not only offer ICU care for Cooper, which was declined, we also offered 7 days of free out-patient treatment which was also declined. We highly doubt that your other vet offered any free treatment for Cooper.\nIn veterinary medicine, there are many variables. Cooper presented as a 12-year-old Lab who could not walk; therefore, we were searching for hip dysplasia. Dr. Johnston informed you gently that as we ran more tests more health issues would be found due to Cooper\u2019s age and pre-existing health conditions. Once initial diagnostic testing had been run, Dr. Johnston did inform you that Cooper\u2019s prognosis for recovery was poor. Pike Animal Hospital and Dr. Johnston do not make these calls lightly and run every diagnostic test necessary before coming to this kind of conclusion.\nOur heart goes out to you for the loss of your beloved pet. It is unfortunate that you cannot find it in your heart to see things clearly at this time and have chosen to accuse Pike Animal Hospital of any form of neglect or misdiagnoses when so much was offered to you in kindness. We have attempted to reach out and extend our condolences as well as hear your feedback and try to put to rest any miscommunications, however, we have been met with no response. It is regrettable that you misunderstand the situation and this review is all the more disappointing. Each case presented to us is different and as such we must customize treatment accordingly, which we attempted to do for Cooper and would have been able to do better had he returned for further treatment. Please bear in mind that Pike Animal Hospital did everything we could for Cooper. Cooper was a fine dog who the staff here at Pike Animal Hospital, especially Dr. Johnston, grew to love in his short time here. We would like to offer our condolences and hope that you will be grateful for the love and memories Cooper bestowed instead of looking for someone to blame for his loss."}, "gmap_id": "0x888ded6dff28b8ed:0xdf0940acbba4f090"}

Dr. Johnston was truly over the top in his care of our baby who\u2019s surgery was a great Success!!! Removal of 2 Kidney stones.

I lost a Toy Poodle that I was told had pyometra and needed to be spayed immediately. I took her in and she was extremely sick. I went to visit her, and they had her in the boarding runs, surrounded by barking dogs. I asked for her to be moved to a more quiet place, so they moved her to the cat room. A couple of days later, I came to visit her again, and they had her in a \"parvo\" kennel that was being used for storage. She died shortly after that visit.\n\nA couple of years later, I brought a Heeler in because she was throwing up. Same scenario--pyometra. They spayed her and her health continued to decline. After a few days, she was stable enough to come home. When my husband got there to pick her up, Dr Johnston said she \"crashed\" when he took her IV out. A couple of days later, the doctor recommended that we euthanize her.\n\nI came in to pay my $1200 bill and pick up my dog's ashes,  and the doctor didn't even bother to talk to me. The young man at the desk apologized and hugged me. Then he handed me a stained pillowcase with a plastic bag full of ashes. I couldn't even get a list of procedures that they did on my Heeler.\n\nIt has taken me a long time to be able to write this review. Look around the clinic when you go in. There are used needles laying on counters and the place needs to be deep cleaned. The exam rooms are full of junk, so he uses the exam table in the middle, where the public has no business going.\n\nI've been to a lot of vet clinics, and have worked at a couple. This one is sad.

Since you have chosen to remain anonymous and this event occurred years ago, I have little recollection of the specific details. I do, however, remember you said you previously worked in vet clinics before. You were shown that my equipment is constantly upgraded and all approved treatment protocols were followed. You must still be grieving to write a scathing one star review so long after the event occurred. My heart goes out to you. I would have met you at the door with your ashes had I known you were here.\nI am also very sorry that you did not have your dogs spayed. That would have prevented the deadly pyometra, not the lack of a \"deep cleaning\" which all but brand new clinics require. To ensure transparency, we do encourage clients to watch us work on their pets in our treatment area. All treatment areas have surgical instruments and needles in them. If a client does not care to watch, they always have the option to wait in the lobby. Since the time of your visit we have an entire new staff. I have shown them your review in an effort to reemphasize the importance of client communication, compassion, cleanliness, and grief management. Sometimes during upgrades to our facility, we regrettably must utilizes all the storage space including the exam room and isolation ward. Sounds like you caught us at a very busy time and we made some mistakes in those areas, but unfortunately those things could not have prevented the tragic outcome. All animals I see get the best care I can provide. Tragically, they do not all survive and I have as much trouble accepting that as you  do.\nI have been practicing for 30 years now. Losing a patient gets hard every year. Online reviews are new to me. I take them all personally and would much rather speak in person. I am very accepting and open to constructive criticism.  As you can tell by the vast majority of my reviews, that my cherished clients are pleased. I know it is impossible to please everyone and save every pet, but I do try my hardest. It breaks my heart to know how you must feel to write this review after a loss so long ago. Again, I am sincerely sorry you are still grieving and I am hurting too.\nMy very best regards."}, "gmap_id": "0x888ded6dff28b8ed:0xdf0940acbba4f090"}

I personally experienced this situation below on 10/08/2018. If you get a bill from them, double check everything. They are trying to make patients responsible for their own adjustment errors back in 2014. They just caught these errors they made in 2018 because they waited 4 years to audit their books. That being said.......my story below.\n\nUOC is a good organization and has always done a great job whenever I have visited their office. However, I recently received a bill out of the blue saying I owed over $300.00. First and foremost, I pay my bills on time and do not let my accounts become delinquent. I called their office to find out why I received a letter saying I owed money since I was recently just in their office and they never mentioned this balance before. I found out they recently did an audit on September 28th, 2018 and realized they made an internal accounting error from 4 years ago. So when my account was adjusted back from THEIR mistakes, my account showed an open balance and they sent me a bill demanding payment.\n\nLong story short - Their company made an internal accounting error and they just caught this 4 years later and are now trying to back charge their patients for their OWN mistakes in their accounting department. I went down to their office and they were not willing to work things out with me based off of their own negligence in their bookkeeping department. Not until I told them that my attorney and I were going to sue them and I was going to bring in Fox 6 News on your side (to expose their company with what they were doing behind the scenes to their patients) did they try to eliminate my bill from where they made a mistake (now my patient balance is zero - how convenient). I have never heard of any type of business back charging someone for THEIR own mistakes. It's called have a check and balance system in place, perform a yearly audit on your books and train your office staff to do their jobs correctly.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a8248c5be74b:0xdbb8984dced86eb"}

His expertise is incredible!\nUpdated 7/10/20\nReturned again to see Dr. Krauss due to the natural progression of my injury . I\u2019m a year and 3 months post fall from a high ladder. I still feel that with Dr. Krauss I receive the best care I could ever get from a doctor. He was given a mangled mess and today I walk and am living a life I honestly thought I never would. I will be forever grateful to Dr. Krauss and the years he has taken to master his craft.\n\nI feel that with Dr. Krauss I have and will continue to receive the best of care. He is very detailed and thorough whether it\u2019s an office visit or a surgery. No doubt he is the absolute best. He has made a horrible accident somewhat bearable with his knowledge and skill.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888922bd85c058bf:0xd342ce7858f3d7ae"}

After my current pediatrician, Dr. Rivas, advised it was time to transition to an adult provider. During the time he was my provider, Dr. Ginevan worked alongside my psychiatrist to continue maintenance of my ADHD and when necessary, he worked with specialists to manage my delicate GI condition. This included references to appropriate clinics and scheduling of applicable tests ie. Colonoscopy, EGD, etc. I truly trusted Dr. Ginevan and was incredibly grateful to have found such a wonderful physician. I never minded the fact that his office was always moving locations or that his appointments had become a nightmare to secure. I still referred only my closest of friends and family to see him. Always assuring them they'd be nothing less than satisfied with him as they're provider. Those were the old days... in 2013 I moved away to live on base with my then husband. I moved back in 2015 and returned to Dr. Ginevan. He and his staff had undergone a complete restructuring as they were now a part of the mega-merger trend and had merged with the tri-cities health giant Shoals Primary Care LLC. Due to the merger Dr. Ginevan no longer had any of my previous medical records from all of my time spent under his care which led to massive complications to my continuity of care. (I now understand the importance of my responsibility to secure medical history documentation and maintain my own current updated personal medical record.) Also, SADLY, due to the implementation of a governmental-esque standard of operating procedures, it is my opinion that Dr. Ginevan no longer maintained the level of patient care he had became known for. His office staff has always been grade-A; to be commended. If you are considering seeing Dr. Ginevan as your primary care provider this review is for you. In closing I want to say that this review in no way, intends to slander or cause malice.

I ignored that fact and still decided to give the doctor the benefit of the doubt because I could understand things sometimes happen. However, upon my scheduled visit as a first time patient it was for 7:30 am, and I arrived at 7:15 am for new patient paper work. I signed in and no one even showed up at the front desk until my appointment time, where I  then asked for my paper work and filled it out. About ten minutes after that, another woman called me by the wrong name and when I corrected her, I was made to feel as if I had done something wrong. Also, you can not hear when you are being called because the TV is loud, so people are talking over the TV, and I have two ear infections. After filling out my paper work, I was then called back to the window, where I was asked to write down my SSN, but I had already written it down twice on the form already. This told me they obviously were not paying attention to the information they were entering. After this, and already feeling on edge from just the front desk experience, I am called back by the doctor's nurse practitioner who tells me to step on the scale, and with a horrible tone says, \"you're going to have to take some of that off.\" Meaning my purse. I ask where I should put it in case of a designated area, which seem to make her even more annoyed and she replies with, \"I don't know.\" Very snappy. I am a new patient and felt like I was asking a very simple and non offensive question. We then walk to the exam room where she informs me that I would not be seeing the doctor and that he also would never been doing my exams or ever seeing me other than a quick peek in the room. Which, as someone looking for a long term doctor, it does not feel comfortable not even meeting my doctor on the first visit. When I tried to explain that I was uncomfortable with the fact she would only be relaying my issues to the doctor, and that I didn't feel comfortable having my health looked after in third person, and that I didnt understand why they wouldn't tell a new patient to begin with when making an appointment that he or she won't be seeing a doctor. She then got upset about it and told me I could reschedule or abort because she had been doing this for 40 years. Which is fine and I explained to her I was fine with her seeing me, but that I didn't feel comfortable having a doctor diagnose me without speaking with me and knowing me as a person. She gets more upset and I said I think it would be best just to cancel because at that point, being someone who has been diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder, I was overwhelmed and ready to go home. She proceeded to then say to me, \"Fine then. Adios.\" I feel as if the entire situation was unprofessional on many different levels. I decided to keep searching for a new doctor. I would not advise this practice if you want to get to know your doctor for long term use, or have anxiety issues, seeing as how it is the only doctor's office I have ever been in where the lobby is loud and over packed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d48b48019956d:0x80858f3d5bf2d029"}

NEXT , I go in for my inr check and my levels are still below standard so he send me to Hellen Keller to do bloodwork and says he will call with the results. No call..... Instead I call up there later in the day and she says you need to come pick up you medicine. So I go get it they have switched my medicine with no telling me no nothing I am a breastfeeding mother.

After surgery, the doctor said it\u2019ll be about 30 minutes in recovery. As my wife was pacing back and forth outside our room door, about an hour to an hour and a half went by without being informed of anything that was going on with our daughter. Finally the anesthesiologist came and told us that she was dehydrated and had to stick her multiple times for an IV. We get our daughter back and saw some of the IV sticks on her and brought her home to find even more than we thought there were. They stuck my 15 month old child around 59 different times trying for an IV. They stuck her in both wrists, hands, arms, feet, ankles, inner thigh, center of her stomach, side of her stomach, and her neck. No baby should have to be stuck that many times to try for an IV. I have pictures to prove it. She\u2019s had bruises all of her body for about a week now bc of all the needle sticks. I just can\u2019t imagine sticking a baby with a needle almost 60 times and being okay with it.. We are waiting on getting the medical records to see everything. I sure hope they didn\u2019t use the same needle a lot of those times. I\u2019ve been told that can cause infections.\n\nI told my aunt that has been a nurse for 41 years and she said she has never seen anything like that in her whole career as a nurse and a she works with babies in the NICU everyday.

Once I'm taken in for my procedure, I'm taken to a tiny room that is dirty & not enough room for the nurses to room around my bed. I'm told Dr. Dasher books every 15 minutes on Friday which explains why I'm waiting 2 hours starving... I had the same procedure done several years ago at a facility close to home & the experience was nothing like this. I won't use this place again. Even the lady they had in the parking lot taking your temp was rude & nasty. Just overall not a good experience.
