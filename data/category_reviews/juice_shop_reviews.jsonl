I was desparately needing\nhealing on a cellular level in my gut. I ordered the juice every 3 days and I received my order\nevery time with little to no hiccups. The owners even left for vacation and were communicating\nwith me from paradise when I had questions.\n\nNot to mention, juicing from home 4-5 times a day is so laborious and time consuming...\n\nThis is the fourth time I've done a juice fast for this long, but the first one I've done outside\nof my home. This time was different. There was hardly any hunger, no crankiness or headaches.\nI was able to sleep at night and I had amazing energy. Through this fast, I did lose 20 lbs in 20\ndays but that certainly was not the reason for doing it. The doctor wanted to put me on 20 days\nof antibiotics. So, was this expensive? It wasn't cheap but it was an investment for my health\nand much better for my body than taking so many antibiotics. I did see the doctor halfway through\nand they were very impressed with the outcome and my vitals.\n\nI even called them on the day I started back to solid foods because my  yoga teacher training graduating\nclass was celebrating at the Mexican restaurant. The Juicery made sure I had something raw and vegan and\nhealthy to take with me so I could be included in the celebration.\n\nI've been off the fast for about ten days. I crave the juice like I wouldn't have ever imagined. Since\nI came off, I've decided to be vegan and gluten free for a while and it's working wonderfully for me!\n\nI truly believe that the fresh Almond Milk from The Juicery and the Cold Pressed juice changed my\nlife! I look forward to working with them in the future to help fulfill my juicing needs! Everyone who\nworks there is so helpful. I love the owners, the vision, and the concept.

My wife and I are not in Auburn so we chose this company to deliver an arrangement for Valentines Day for my mother-in-law in Opelika. We ordered a higher dollar item other than the lower priced special. Specifically for the reason of having more fruit and less chocolate as we were hoping for something a bit healthier because of health issues. They charged our credit card for the higher priced item we ordered but delivered the lower price special with added chocolate and it was a smaller item. In addition to the wrong item - they did not deliver it on Valentines Day. We called several times and they acted nice at first and promised to deliver the item the next day. Late in the day mom called and said it was never delivered. We called back and it was being delivered late in the day - a day late - and it was the wrong item, not the higher priced one we paid for.\n\nWe called again and one of the employees admitted they went to the wrong house on Valentines day so somebody got the higher priced item. My wife called again to at least get a refund for the overcharged amount or to have the right item delivered. We were promised the right item would be delivered. The next day, no delivery.\n\nAt this point, several days after Valentines Day my wife gave up so I started calling, was promised a refund or a deliver of the right item. There was no refund or proper delivery. I was then promised at least a call back from the owner, then another promise, another promised call back. I never heard back.\n\nMy mother in law never received the correct item and and we never got the refund. We finally tried to cancel payment with credit card and to get a refund but they disputed it - said that the item was delivered. Did not mention that it was the wrong item, and that it was late, missing Valentines Day. I'm sorry that they delivered the item, possibly twice, to the wrong house, and then the wrong item to the right address. That's three deliveries, three trips, three items. However, those mistakes are not our fault. All I know is that my mother in law never received what was ordered.\n\nI would not recommend this company to another person.\n\nI would probably have written a different review if the owner would have called me back as promised by the several employees.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2ce2392dbe3:0xba2152bd50d19c00"}

Other options; almond milk, oat milk, coconut milk, coconut water, etc and have many options for protein as well. We use Real fruits and veggies-it\u2019s not broken down into a powder.Also, you can create your own or substitute any ingredients on the menu.  I\u2019m sorry you feel that it\u2019s costly, but it is costly to use Real ingredients. We do offer discounts to gym members (with proof of membership), military , and 1st responders. We also offer our loyalty reward program which is a big savings.. our customers are most important and we want to help keep the community healthy. It does cost money to be healthy but more to be sick. If you haven\u2019t signed up for the loyalty reward program, I highly recommend. Ty and look forward to seeing you again."}, "gmap_id": "0x88928d4d40b4714f:0x187a24b966a1cd3d"}

The best thing is to let the staff know what you're in the mood for and ask them about their favorites (it's how I was introduced to their tomato tart, which is really outstanding).\n\nThe Pantry also makes fresh juice, and it all tastes amazing. I haven't studied the long-term benefits of juicing, but I know the juices here are delicious and make me feel great, so that's good enough for me. You can buy juice made that day out of the cooler or order something specific made while you wait.\n\nThis place is all about special little touches. The restaurant itself is small and incredibly charming, and they'll do things like serve free goat cheese samplers sometimes or serve cucumber water to add something special to every visit.\n\nThe Pantry also has a big selection of jams, cheeses, wine, beer and specialty items that make great treats or gifts for foodies.

The building is spotless, and the workers are nice.\nHowever, I asked for both my juices to be light ice or no ice (I don\u2019t like ice). I proceeded to be charged $5.50 more for each juice, totaling $14.25 per juice. I had ordered two juices and a toast, and, with a 25% tip, my total came out to $50. I was like excuse me? I asked for a receipt and was like there\u2019s no way I\u2019m paying $5.50 extra each drink for asking for light ice/no ice. Just give me less juice. So ultimately I had to ask for a refund. $8.75 is a lot for a juice to begin with so to put it bluntly don\u2019t come here on a budget.\nI cook solely organic / grass fed / free range food.
