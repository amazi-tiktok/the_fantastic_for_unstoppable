This gym has won several state championship in the last few years at all levels. Since it has been said that he dose like military that must be a joke since Mr.Jeff  is a veteran and two of his children are in the military! As of now they are not able to have boys gymnastic since the demand and resources are not available but they are able to sign up for tumbling and cheer classes.

Enterprise Gymnastics and Cheer isn't just a gym but a family to me.  Jeff Pangallo has been nothing but professional to all three of my daughters that attended, my oldest also being on the competitive team Level 4 then 5.  He truly cares about the girls in a \"non-creepily\" way and has devoted so much of his life to gymnastics.  It angers me to read such a harsh review of this gym!  Every single staff member has been nothing but courteous and professional to not only my children but myself as well.  We are a military family and it broke our hearts to leave Enterprise and the gym!  We have yet to find a gym that begins to compare to EGC.  I highly recommend this gym and Mr Jeff to everyone whether you have children just starting out to girls on a more advanced level.  I cannot say enough how much this gym means to us, DO NOT hesitate to sign your kids up.

We have been enrolled and taking classes at this gym for 6 years and have been very pleased.  Mr. Jeff and his staff work very hard to push each student to do their best.  I have had girls in the regular progressive classes, the cheernastics class as well as on the competitive gymnastics team and have encountered nothing but professionalism from the coaches.  I have never witnessed inappropriate behavior among any of EGC's staff.  My children have learned gymnastics and cheer skills while having fun and they have enjoyed every aspect of the classes as well as the team practices.  I know it has been asked about boys being enrolled in the gymnastics classes and the answer seems apparent as boy's gymnastics requires different equipment.  This is equipment that EGC does not have nor do they have room for it.  Boys are however allowed to participate in the cheernastics classes.  I intend to be a part of the EGC family for years to come as I also have an infant and I am already making plans to enroll her as soon as she is walking.

She only says hello and welcomes the people that she likes. I never get a hello when entering the building. She keeps her food at the front desk for everyone to see. I think it is very unprofessional and disgusting. Sometimes she even has the tv going for herself. It comes off as lazy. All she does is complain about every little thing. She never has anything positive to say. And she will literally yell at you if you do something she doesn't like. I feel like she needs to be replaced with someone with a little more pep in their step, someone who has good customer service, who smiles, and is friendly, someone who makes everyone feel welcome. This lady is the first thing you see when you walk through the door and it's not a pleasant view. Other than her,  the gym is great and the teachers are great. I think the gym is a little unorganized upfront. The front desk has things everywhere. Just a little time organizing and cleaning the front would make a huge difference at this gym. Again the teachers are amazing!!! Couldn\u2019t ask for better.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d89bc6d3b23:0xa1f875e17ee79710"}
