This review will be long but also describe my experiences so that people can get a good idea of the company. The first course I took with them was Impulse Control with my dog Arnold. He and I had completed beginner and intermediate obedience courses with another company.\n\nWe just happened to go to Love Them Train Them for Impulse Control because their schedule better matched ours at the time. Meredith Dempsey, is a great teacher to human and pup students.\n\nWe learned so much-got much more out of it than I ever dreamed. I decided to take Arnold to their tricks training course. They were very transparent that while they teach the how, not all dogs may be able or may want to do all of the tricks. The company emphasizes force free training and they follow through with this. HOWEVER,  the trainers, Rebecca (owner and trainer) and (Ally-trainer) made it so much fun that Arnold would come home and just offering to do tricks.\n\nWhile we were taking the tricks training course, we ended up adopting a dog (Ginger) from a shelter. The trainers at this company had all worked with her at the shelter (she was being considered to become a fire dog at one point) and know of her excitability and energy levels. I mention that to mention that I chose to enroll her in beginner obedience.\n\nAnother company had evaluated her temperament for daycare purposes and considered Ginger reactive and unable to do daycare or interact with other dogs safely at the time. They suggested reactive dog training courses. Now, we already had Arnold. Arnold is pretty chill so I figured they would get along. For me, it was rough at the beginning because it was an adjustment for all of us and a first in regards to having a multi dog household.  It wasn't love at first sight but Ginger was not reactive towards Arnold.\n\nI brought up my concerns with Love Them Train Them. Meredith suggested I get a second opinion regarding daycare and suggested a specific daycare. Ginger did very well and the staff at that daycare were quite surprised that I had been told Ginger needed reactive dog training before going to daycare.  Rebecca and Ally reassured me that Ginger has great learning abilities and that Anthony (the one currently teaching the beginner obedience course we are taking) would be excited to have us.\n\nI reached out to Anthony before the course regarding the other company's thoughts as to Ginger being unable to take a beginner obedience course until a reactive course was taken. Anthony (who had worked with Ginger a good bit at the shelter-so I am sure that helped) told me he would make it work. And he has. The improvement in the past month has been incredible. Ginger does need a little more classroom modification that the other dogs but bit by bit, the modification is becoming less and Ginger is continuously improving. Even though Ginger already knew Anthony, watching him work with the other dogs has me fully convinced that even she hadn't know him, she would still do well.\n\nDuring all of this, Ginger and Arnold had been getting used to each other. And me, used to having two dogs. Some things came up that caused me to question Arnold's and Ginger's capability of safely living together. But, when I reached out to Meredith (who knew and had worked with both dogs) she told me that both Arnold and Ginger are great communicators and to trust in my dogs' ability to communicate. This helped me to relax during their interactions (they love to play rough) which in turn helped them better enjoy others' company.\n\nI could add so much more but in a nutshell: Love Them Train Them only uses force free methods, packs in a lot into one class, are willing and capable to work with what others may see as problematic, and their classes are fun!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1620268808725, "text": "Wow!

The workers leave dogs in pee and poop filled kennels for hours before they are cleaned.\nThe dogs don't go outside from 4pm to 7am the next day.\nThey have had 2 cases of kennel cough since spring break, and have still been using the same sponge to clean all of the dog bowls.\nIf your dog is having a health issue while boarding, the workers will not tell you about it if they don't think it's serious. There are dogs who get incredibly sick either from stress or other health problems that result in blood in the vomit and/or stool. The only thing they do is take the dogs food and water away and don't let them outside.\nThe dogs water bowls are only checked at 7am and then again at 4pm. So your dog may be going without water for any number of hours between those times and the workers will ignore it. The bowls are only cleaned once per day, so if your dog is boarding for several days, there's a very good chance that they'll have the same bowl of water over the course of their stay. They have a major rat problem there, so often times there is rat feces in the water bowls.\nThe dogs are left alone all night with the rats, which your dogs could be eating over night, making them very sick and possibly catching diseases.\nThe workers do not have first aid training, so if your dog chokes on the mulch that is outside in the play area, then they are told to \"look up an instructional video\" to help the choking dog.\nThey don't pay attention to what the dogs are doing because they're too busy on their phones to care. So if your dog poops mulch (very bad for his digestive system) then it's because they were eating it from the play area. There are also several dogs who eat poop, so if your dog has that habit, it's probably only getting worse because they think they're allowed to do it while staying there.\nWhen the dogs are playing outside, they are sometimes not given water for several hours due to certain dogs not liking the water hose.\nI have witnessed a coworker giving the wrong dog her medicine. Once that realization was made, still nothing was done about it.\nIf your dog is not good with other dogs, they are set as \"individuals\" where they play by themselves. These dogs are only getting 10 minutes outside to play, and then they get 10 minutes inside to play. They are supposed to have another 10 minutes to play but are usually skipped because the workers want to go home early. So if your dog is boarding over the weekend and they're not good with other dogs, then they're only getting about 20 minutes of outside time every day while the other dogs get over 2 hours.\nThe weekend hours are different, so all of the play groups are shortened and the dogs are left alone for a lot longer than they normally would be.\nTheir medicine is put in pill pockets in their food. If the dog doesn't voluntarily eat the pill pockets, then that dog will not be getting their medicine that day.\nThe dogs only have access to their food for a couple hours a day. So if your dog is a grazer and doesn't eat all of their food at once then they will be eating very little over the course of their stay.\nThe kennels are painted very poorly, paint is always chipping off the walls, usually because dogs are chewing it off.\nWorkers regularly spray dogs in the face with Bitter Apple spray. This spray is supposed to be used for dogs that have problems chewing their fur, and is not meant to be sprayed in the eyes or nose of the dogs, but they are regularly sprayed in the face if they are barking in their kennels.\nIf you request for your dog to be given a bath, they will usually bathe the dogs very early in the day to get it out of the way. Once they're bathed, they are not allowed back outside and their food and water bowls are taken away. So if you dropped your dog off at 8am to be picked up around 5pm, there's a good chance that your dog hasn't been outside or had food or water since about 10am.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1519324162478, "text": "Hi Lori, I wanted to reply here as well since I did not hear back from you regarding this same review you left on Facebook.\nI'm truly sorry this is how you felt about working at CDT.\n\nAs one of the owners, and the person responsible for systems management in the locations I am very upset to hear these things.

Carlile  came back out and made adjustments as well as explained the best amount of time to have the delay set at. Very knowledgeable and took very good care of us!!

Though my wife and I wanted to allow our two boxers access to our entire yard we really did not want to put up a traditional fence which would reduce the openness of our property. The Invisible Fence provided us the solution we needed. Our dogs now have access to the front and back yard and don't have to be let outside on a leash. We decided to have our fence separate the front yard from the back as there are times when we don't want our dogs in the front yard. This has worked out great and I'm glad we chose this option. Additionally, we had the fence section off a portion of our yard for a vegetable/flower garden. We did not do this at first but we just couldn't keep the dogs out so after a year or two we had Invisible Fence come back out and run a fence around our garden...problem solved.\nAs far as the quality of the product, in the 10 years we've had the fence the only issue we had to call about was my fault. I ran a plow to close to the fence and severed it. Fortunately it was a quick repair as the technician has the equipment to find the severed line quickly.\nOne final point, my impression of Invisible Fence of Huntsville's owner, Troy, is that he has a genuine passion and understanding of dogs which allowed my wife and I to comfortably follow his suggestions. After over 10 years of using the Invisible Fence of Huntsville myself, nor my wife, have any reservations recommending this business to family and friends.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1594869907044, "text": "Hi Clinton,\n\nThank you for taking the time to review our services.\n\nWe appreciate your business and the opportunity to serve you!\n\n-Troy"}, "gmap_id": "0x8862405eaaf921d1:0x6ddc6dd2237f0e25"}

When we first moved into our house, we were concerned with how to contain our curious, fence jumping hound, Hannibal. Our yard isn't really set up well for a physical fence, plus the escape artist has a 6 foot vertical jump so it just wasn't practical. We found Invisible Fence at a home and garden show and later called to have them come out and give a quote. A week later we had our invisible fence installed and began training the hound! Troy (and Jack Fate) is great at working with excitable dogs and spent a good amount of time working with Hannibal on the first visit. It went so well we only needed the one training session and Hannibal knew where the boundaries were and not to run. When we acquired two more dogs, we had them added to the fence and again training went great. Our neurotic Jack Russell puppy had it figured out in two days which is the fastest she's learned anything, and our Shitzhu had it down pat in 10 minutes. Both are chronic runners if they get the chance so it's a relief to know they will stay in the yard now.\n\nAny time I need batteries, I can call the office or contact Troy and he'll either drop them off if he's in the area or I pick them up just a few miles from my house, usually the same day. That's a huge convenience for me, and a life saver when batteries suddenly die!

Troy worked with our animals and did everything in his power to ensure the safety of our animals. He also worked very hard to ease our minds from the beginning by listening to what our problems were with the animals and recommended different solutions to fix the problems.  I have two dogs, a 7 year old lab and 1 year old lab.  My 7 year old is very timid with invisible fence systems because we had one in the past and it scared her to death. We trained her incorrectly.  Troy listened to her story and was very compassionate with her and very gently worked with her to her comfort and eased her into the training.  She went from a timid dog that wouldn't come off the porch with a correction collar on to a happy safe dog who uses her whole yard.  My 1year old lab, well.. HE's a lab!! He is stubborn, and when the wind hit him just right would be down the street with other dogs and he was being the neighborhood menace.  So, Troy worked with him.  He obviously needed more correction than my 7year old Lab so Troy made that possible.\nHis guaranteed program where the fence works is true! It works because he doesn't leave you ALONE to train your animals. He gives you the tools and comes back and checks to make sure everything is ok.  That is service people!! He is there anytime to answer any question I have had since day 1!  So, would I recommend this company and this product, 1000% yes!!!

I wanted to wait a full week because I had my doubts that it would work with my two two year old Doberman Pinschers.  Troy said it would, as well as work for our older untrained and UNTRAINABLE Shih Tsu!  I had my doubts, especially as one of the Dobies doesn't like bicycles after having been run over by a bicyclist.   We had paid Lowes to install a fence in part of our yard only to discover it was going to take almost 90 days for them to install it.  We called Troy after about 2 months and he said he could fence our entire yard in about a week, at much less than what we had paid Lowes.  Following rhe instructions Troy gave us we had all three dogs off leashes on day 2.   The dogs are happier having the run of almost our entire yard where we had originally planned to only fence 1/4 of it.  Best of all, when Troy came back for follow up training, he brought little discs that we put on either side of our kitchen island and set them so the Shih Tsu could pass through yet the Dobies are blocked.  No longer must we prepare meals while the Dobies hangout in the kitchen trying to eat our dinner before we do.  Better still, we put a disc just inside our daughter's bedroom door to keep the Dobies out so the cat isn't bothered by them and has a safe place.  Oh.....and we have a swampy section that runs across the backyard.   Troy waded through it doing the installation.  Snakes, what snakes?   The system works beautifully and the dogs and the humans are all much less stressed.

Max is a one year old Border Collie.  It had become increasingly unfair to him to be confined to a small space.  Up until a month ago, Max's options were limited to being in the house or waiting for us to come home to let him out and play.\n\nWe finally decided to call Invisible Fence of Huntsville.  Troy came out and to meet Max and us and completed an initial assessment. He is so personable, professional, and most of all kind.  Max really liked him.  Troy took great with Max.  From our conversations, you knew that Troy is passionate about his work with animals.\n\nThe following week, Troy returned for the fence installation.  We marked off the area and he went to work.  From start to finish, it took four hours which included the first dog training (e.g. adjusting the sensation,  reassuring  Max.)Troy returned several days later for the last dog lesson.   By then, Max was acclimated to his new found freedom.  He understood the boundaries and how far he could push before he was \"corrected\"!  He was now free to frolic, play, and \"herd\".  There was also an immediate impact to my family.  We were regimented to take Max out a specific times... and no-one wanted to take him out at night, in the cold or the rain!  All we have to do now is open door. Max takes care of the rest!  Moreover, there were no accidents in the house to clean.\n\nWe strongly and highly recommend Troy and Invisible Fence of Huntsville.

We've kenneled him other places before, but he came home the happiest when we used Piper's. He came home clean and happy, and the staff seemed upbeat and positive both at drop-off and pick-up.

The owner of this facility and the manager were told on multiple occasions by employees and were aware of the following: Fire extinguishers (they only have 2) being extremely out of date, last checked back in 2015\u2014 also no evacuation plan, or safety drills, air vent maintenance doesn\u2019t take place\u2014 vents/filters not properly maintained can easily catch fire, this company works with LIVE animals, the safety of your dogs are not being considered as you can tell from the images.... everything is layered with years of dog dander and hair.\nWhen the heater gets turned on the smell of burning hair lasts for days and the company uses wax melts up front to mask the smells. They also stuff the vents they don\u2019t clean with smell good beads to mask the smell.\nEven daycare dogs are kenneled. Employees hang around upfront until around 9 when they decide to start putting dogs in daycare\u2014- this means if you\u2019re paying for a full day or even a half day of doggie daycare starting in the morning your furbabies are missing out on 2+ hours of socialization. This facility doesn\u2019t properly clean the daycare room. And weeks worth of hair is noticeable near the drains in the daycare play areas, this is extremely unsafe for your animals/the employees. The smell in this building that\u2019s separate from the building your drop off your dog is horrific. Dogs are left unsupervised in daycare, and the daycare supervision in maintained outside of the daycare rooms- so instead of dogs getting that one-on-one attention they are only monitored when barking has increased. Because of that, rooms aren\u2019t cleaned right away causing burns on paw pads from dogs playing around in urine. Most dogs have to be ran through Grooming to be spot cleaned before leaving. Bored dogs have started eating the walls of this establishment because of the lack of social interaction they receive. This facility illegally mentioned to employees that they can not pay overtime to them when they have worked 40+ hrs. Because of this, I believe the care of the animals that go there are being affected.\nDuring the recent snow storm an employee managed to chase a already nervous dog around the front lobby of this establishment causing him to run out of the front door. This dog was missing for a week and found with his hip shattered, and he had ate an entire toe off of himself.. this establishment paid his vet bill which included the cost of utilization. Clearly the proper training of employees is not being conducted. This facility also does not clean kennels often and when they do they use a dirty mop to wipe out the kennels. This is probably a factor to the outbreak of kennel cough they are currently battling.\nMany times employees just feed  dogs breakfast without even bothering to clean the kennel first or move the dog to a clean kennel.. that means that they were eating breakfast in their own filth and kenneled with it until daycare started up. In It\u2019s hard enough trusting someone, let along finding out an establishment you\u2019re paying LOTS of money to is neglecting your animal. This establishment recently caused the death of a small 4 lb dog, and they are trying to cover it up. By deleting comments and blocking any negativity they receive. I refuse to be silent.

When I first boarded @ Piper's 2 years ago I requested that he be kenneled at night with only little dogs and was shown a room off the hall on the right where I was told the small dogs stayed.

There was no I'm sorry we didn't contact you about his injury, etc. He literally had to be carried that night and Christmas day every time to potty, to food bowl, etc. While I understand this may not be the norm @ Piper's, ( had never happened to me before) since it happened this time, I'll be making other arrangements next time. Beware. Things are not always as they seem. Ask to see where your dog will be put at night. I was told they  NEVER allow tours! That's shocking! I've ALWAYS toured where I board my dog.

I always thought she enjoyed it as she seemed excited to pull up and be dropped off. At around a year old, I started noticing a lot of staff turnover at the facility. Although I should have taken heed, I did not and my dog continued to attend day care regularly. I began noticing that my dog was very timid of the staff. In particular, she was called by one of the managers/trainers and immediately backed up, tail between her legs, and laid down in a submissive position behind me. This time I took note and my dog never returned to the facility. I still have pre-paid day care days that will go unused. When I inquired about my dog\u2019s reaction, it was explained to me by staff that my dog was regularly kept separate in a kennel in the back during the day. AND, that her \u201ctraining\u201d involved being taken into the yard, on a leash, while other dogs were allowed to approach her and she was given commands to obey. THIS RUINED MY DOG. She has dog aggression issues to this day, largely due to her extreme anxiety which I believe was engrained into her at a developmental stage while at JHH. Please do not take your dog to this facility for daycare.\n\nAlso, please note that most of the favorable reviews were posted at least a year ago.

I moved to Birmingham a few months ago and did not know a soul. I came for graduate school with my best friend (Oliver) and the center of my world. I shopped around for daycares like my peers do for their human children. I chose Just Happy Hounds because the staff was friendly and I loved how my dog was always playing. He does not spend hours alone in a kennel like he would at home. They have far exceeded my expectation for customer service and outright exceptional care for my puppy. Oliver had a scratched cornea from playing a little hard and required surgery. I was stressed about what to do. I thought I could not take him to daycare while he recovered for surgery. He required extensive medications and needed to watched more closely in the cone of shame. The JHH team took care of Oliver post-op just as well as I would have at home. I never have to worry about my best friend while I am at work/class all day. I know he is being loved and played with as he is at home. I could not be more thankful for such incredible care of Oliver during his time of extra need. As a nurse, I am always caring for everyone else.

Having a less stressed dog who listens and knows who is in charge is going to make a world of difference in our home. In just a few hours, she was responding so different than what we have been used to for the last six months. We were at our wits end with her behaviors and in the few hours Theresa was here to help me work with her I could tell a difference in her anxiety level and her behavior. I was able to go in my kitchen without a dog under my feet, answer the door without her coming too, walk her on a loose leash without her pulling in front of me. The results were amazing. Theresa will be back in a month and we will continue to work with her everyday at home to see a dramatic difference in our sweet dog. After a few hours of training she is worn out and sleeping peacefully in our living room, which would have never happened before.\n\nI am so glad we sought some extra help with Theresa from BarkBusters!

We saw tremendous improvements in Sophie's behavior after just the first session, and over the next month it continued to improve. Sophie has developed anxiety and we're still working on keeping her calm when neighbors walk past the apartment, but when something hasn't worked, Theresa has always had another method to try.\n\nWe chose to work with Bark Busters because they claim to use positive reinforcement and better communication rather other less pleasant methods like shock collars. Sophie is a sweet dog who has a strong bond with us and we didn't want to hit or mistreat her. Theresa shares that mindset and the Bark Busters methods really have deepened our bond with Sophie.\n\nI also really appreciated that Theresa invited me to attend the training sessions even though Sophie belongs to my sister and my sister is paying for the training (not me). But because I keep Sophie during the day while my sister is at work, Theresa knew I would be spending a lot of time with Sophie. Consistency is really important to make these techniques work, and having attended the training sessions, I can work with Sophie at home during the day, which has helped our progress.\n\nFinally, lots of people claim to love dogs, but you can tell quickly that Theresa really does care about the clients she works with. If something isn't working, she doesn't force it. She's patient and she tries to tailor what she does to the dog and family she works with.

After we decided to work together, she sent me some information to get me prepared for our first meeting.  Even though she was greeted at the door with loud barks and bared teeth, she kept her cool and within about 1 hour he was eating out of her hand.  I was impressed, but the real work was yet to come.\n\nShe walked me through several different exercises/activities to recondition his behavior and train me to set the tone for what was expected in the house and out on walks, and gave me some equipment to use while training.  While neither I nor Bodie were perfect right away, the progress was astounding.  She recapped each of the activities with me before she left, and I felt very confident in 6 or 7 of the 8, but that's ok.  Part of the package she sent me later was a detailed action plan for the first 4 weeks, including a checklist for the daily activities we are supposed to practice, and a reminder on what I was supposed to do with each one.  OK!\n\nEven now just a day or two after Theresa has started with us, this dog is the best behaved it's ever been. He used to bark in my face every time I would get dressed because he knew I was going out somewhere and there was a chance he could go on a car ride or a walk.  He also used to crowd me in the kitchen while I was making dinner or getting his food ready or his treats ready.  But one of the early things she taught me was how to hold a space in the kitchen to work when I want, and to let him in during normal times.  I decided to test that right after she left by making myself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Normally when he smelled peanut butter he was *right in there* hoping to get some for himself but this time he stood patiently about six feet away, and just watched until I called him and I was finished. It was the same thing for filling his food bowls and stuffing his toys with treats. Amazing!!  I cannot tell you how much more enjoyable it is to get dressed in the morning and come downstairs and put my shoes on and have a breakfast without a dog barking in my face the whole time because he expects to go for a walk or go for a ride.  He's still there next to me happy as ever, he's just not barking!\n\nWe're still working on the \"loose leash\" walking techniques, and it seems weird to have to correct him all the time instead of letting him wander around, but he's starting to figure it out, and that means less corrections.  Honestly it's better exercise for both of us when he does it correctly because we keep a good pace. He still gets to pee and poop and enjoy the outside, but we actually get moving well enough to get some real exercise, and it's much more enjoyable and less strain my back if he's not pulling the whole time.\n\nI'm excited to see how far Bodie and I can take this training, we're both learning at the same time.  I feel like I made the right decision to hire Theresa with Bark Busters, and I look forward to showing her how much progress we've made by the next time we all get together.  Thank you for making my dog more fun to be around, and safer too.  I can't tell you how much it means, but you saw it on my face.  I WISH we had done something like this earlier.\n\nIf your dog is running your house, and/or sometimes out of your control, please do something about it - call Theresa and get some help.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1613874509997, "text": "Thank you Chris.

Came home exhausted each time as if he had a blast. As far as the friendliness of the staff, that was a hit or miss, honestly. I only interacted with one lady who I think may have been the owner that was really really sweet. Anyone else would come get my puppy from the car in the mornings, not say good morning or anything, just grab him and walk inside. I don\u2019t know a single staff member\u2019s name because no one ever introduced themselves to me. His very first day at daycare, he came home with scratches on his face from where he\u2019d gotten into a fight with another dog. His second time at daycare, I got a call from one of the staff members there letting me know that he\u2019d got bitten in the head by another dog & was asked if I wanted to come pick him up. I debated on not going back after that but decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. A few weeks later, my puppy contracts Kennel Cough from there which ultimately developed into pneumonia. As any other pet parent, I was angry because every dog is supposed to be fully vaccinated in order to attend there. $250 later, thankfully, he made a full recovery. I didn\u2019t take him back for weeks because I was paranoid. However, I moved closer to the area and decided to give it another shot. Took him back on a Friday. A few days later, I notice he isn\u2019t feeling well & end up having to take him to the emergency vet at 2:30 am. What have you know, Kennel Cough AGAIN. He\u2019s been sick now for almost two weeks. Needless to say, I will not be returning to this facility.

Our COVID Care protocols have definitely made it much more difficult for our staff to interact with our clients with conversations.  We have really missed these interactions too!  We do feel strongly that our curbside dropoff/pickup services as well as our staff wearing full PPE is in the best interest of our community, our clients, and our staff - but it has definitely left us missing those close interactions and relationship building with our clients.  I'm sorry you missed that too.  We are definitely learning how to best create relationships with our clients in the climate of COVID safety.  Your feedback will be very helpful as we continue to grow and change with these new and ever changing restrictions.\n\nI'm also sorry to hear your pup got cough while he was participating in our services.  This particular strain of cough this year has actually made several national news stories as it has shown up all over the country.  It's been a nasty strain.  We worked very closely with our veterinary advisory team to be sure we were utilizing the absolute best practices in cleanliness and disinfectant protocols throughout our facility.  We also did our best to inform all clients honestly and openly about the outbreak.  We feel very fortunate that we were able to get it under control so quickly because of our amazing veterinary advisory team.  Just like childcare, dog daycare does pose a slightly higher risk of dogs getting upper respiratory infections and sometimes GI upset in group play.  We do our very best to inform our clients of this by having it clearly stated in several places on our General Client Agreement all clients receive and sign before their first day of daycare with us.  While we sincerely wish the bordatella vaccine required by our facility was able to protect against all cough, just like the human flu vaccine, it does not.\n\nAgain, we appreciate your feedback and wish you and your dog well and that you are able to find another facility that suits your needs.  Please let us know if we can help you with any pet care needs in the future."}, "gmap_id": "0x888923bd8bf81a99:0xf88dcba01a8213d"}

However, I found the classes to be ridiculously unprofessional. They charge the going rate, $20 per 1 hour class session for 4 sessions. However, the classes never start on time, the instructor is rarely prepared with her materials, generally she is looking at her phone several times per lesson and disappearing into another room, and 2 of 4 classes ended early. The instructor clearly knows how to train a dog, however this place has a business model based on you dropping your dog off for several weeks and a thousand or more dollars later they train the dog for you. I have no doubt she is exceptionally effective in that environment, but these classes where you learn to train your dog yourself are over complicated, incoherent, and lack any kind of structure. I feel like mostly they are used to get you to admit you need to drop your dog off with them, because that is the only way the dog will get trained. I've had better experiences with a big box store training, and that isn't saying much. There are significantly better training places for the same money with a whole lot less agenda. Hint: look for a non-profit dog obedience and training club.<P>\n\nResponse to the owner:\nFirst off, it's labelled a rolling class. You don't need to offer \"a missed class at no extra charge\", that's part of it being rolling. You show up for 4 classes, whether they are consecutive or not, and I checked ahead of time to make sure that was the case. Second, in 3 of the 4 classes there was no socialization time unless you count the period of time we all waited in the office while the instructor was running late. Ending the class early twice ensured no socialization time. You offer 14 days of board and train for $1100 and 28 days for $2100. Both of those cost more than the thousand dollars I put in my review. So yes, you offer both cheaper and more expensive options, personally I think I hit the middle pretty well with my review. I put in my review you charge the going rate. I don't dispute that. I also said the trainer knows how to train dogs, the trainer simply didn't do much to help people learn to train their own dogs in this one class. Finally, the Birmingham Obedience and Training club is a non-profit club, they just aren't a charity.

I am the owner of Roverchase and you have not contacted us in your 4 week training so, until this review, I was unaware of your unhappiness.  I have called the other puppies in your class period and they have all been exceptionally pleased and have all signed up for additional group classes for continuing education, so I am a bit confused.  I would be more than happy to talk with you about your experience.  I do know that your dog missed a week of Puppy Kindergarten and we were very happy to accommodate your schedule and allow you to makeup your missed class at no additional charge.     Puppy Kindergarten is a socialization and basic manners class and not a true \"training skills\" course.  This is very clear in the description of our class on our website as well as the materials given in each class period.  As mentioned previously, I would be more than happy to speak with you about your experience, please feel free to call the front office at 205-332-0203 and ask for Abigail.  Also, as a note, our day-training program is our most popular program but it is hardly \"thousands of dollars.\"  Most of our clients spend between $250-450 for four weeks of all day training where they drop their dog of several times a week each week.  This is hardly \"thousands of dollars\" and is, in fact, some of the best prices is town.  Our Puppy Kindergarten class is also priced competitively with \"the big box store\" but you are taking this class from one of the most highly experienced and certified canine behavioral consultants in the city.  As an additional note, our prices are less expensive then the Obedience Club in our town, which is not non-profit.

Aidan did a great job and took time to work on things that I specifically was having trouble with when there was not a big class. I took my dog to daycare and the owner, Abigail, stated that he was having trouble and recommended a behaviorist that comes to Roverchase every Thursday and Saturday. The price was $400 dollars which I was happy to pay because I really wanted the best for Blue (my dog). We talked with the behaviorist for about an hour and that was the end of the session. The behaviorist did not really teach or show me anything that I did not already know. The behaviorist did not even see the behavior that I was having trouble with but yet she was quick to write out a treatment plan. The behaviorist did say that I would need to do private lessons with Abigail which is not included in the cost. So for $400 dollars I talked to a lady for an hour. This is a big scam and I am really troubled that Roverchase would be a part of it.\n\nMy appointment lasted 1 hour. We left right after 5 and the appointment started at 4. So go back and check your cameras again. Yes, I was happy to pay the $400 dollars which I stated previously. But I was under the impression that I would get useful information and more than just talking to a \"Behaviorist\" for an hour. Again, how can she, the behaviorist, tell me what is the cause and real problem without even seeing the behavior. I even emailed the behaviorist trying to get a refund because that was not what I was expecting. Not even wanting a full refund because I understand that she did take time out of her day to meet with me. But I think she can keep the $80 dollars deposit and refund the $320 since I do not need her \"expertise\" any longer. But she has not responded to my email which she specifically stated was the best/fastest way to communicate with her. And as far as reviews need to be left honestly and in good faith...I did that. You decided to lie on your response by saying that you checked the cameras and that I was there for a little under 2 hours. Your cameras times are off or you lied.

Thank you.\nTo address your concerns regarding your experience with Dr. Biehunko, I will do my best to address them in an organized fashion.\n-  I recommended Blue see Dr. Biehunko when Blue presented to daycare last week after a 5 month absence from Roverchase.  Prior to Blue\u2019s absence, we had discussed at length Blue\u2019s increase reactivity and dog related aggression and you indicated you did not want to address it with us at that time but wanted to work with it on your own.  We advised against it.  When you presented last week, Blue came for a day of daycare and was significantly worse in all behaviors.  I recommended a consultation with Alabama\u2019s only Veterinary Behaviorist, Dr. Biehunko.  I thoroughly explained how Dr. Beihunko\u2019s consultations worked, that they were $400 and for that price you received a 1.5-2hr consultation with her expertise and she would make a diagnosis, a treatment plan, and then have 6 months of medical management and follow up.  I was very clear with you that there was no doubt that Blue would need additional lessons with me and that it would be at additional cost.  You remarked that you felt this price was fair for her experience and expertise and made your appointment for later in the week\n- I do rounds with Dr. Biehunko each day for our shared clients.  She had already been thoroughly briefed on Blue\u2019s behavior at Roverchase the day he returned as well as my notes from his behavior in December when we last saw him.\n- Your consultation with Dr. Biehunko was just barely under 2hrs.  I checked the time stamp on our cameras\n- In your consultation with Dr. Biehunko we were all very surprised to hear that you insisted that Blue has received no training outside of his training at Roverchase.  In fact, you insisted this was true even when specifically questioned about this by Dr. Biehunko and the Roverchase trainers who sat in on the session with you.  As I\u2019m sure you know, it\u2019s extremely difficult for any doctor to communicate effectively and efficiently with a client when that client willfully withholds pertinent information from that doctor that impedes the treatment plan.  As you can see from the attached screen shots, not only has Blue been in training with another trainer, but it was for the very issue he was presenting for.\n- Finally, since your consultation was just over 72 hours ago, and we are very clear that treatment plans can take 2-4 weeks to become effective, it\u2019s hard to understand how you can already be so unhappy with your results.\nI certainly believe that pet owners are allowed to train and handle their pets as they see fit and that there are many fits available for many different preferences.  However, I hope we can both agree that reviews need to be left honestly and in good faith and this one has some glaring issues.  I hope, in light of this, and in light of you many months of happiness with Roverchase, you will consider removing it.  We certainly wish you and Blue only the very best and much success in all of your endeavors.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nAbigail Witthauer\nRoverchase\n\nEDIT::  attachment will not post.\nDescription of photo attachment:  Blue the dog on a trainers business page looking at the screen wl a clearly visible electronic training collar, caption from the trainer, \u201cBlue the Australian Cattle Dog rocked his first lesson.

I took my Australian Shepherd here because they said they would help her with her people aggression issues. All they did was put her on medication that literally made her go crazy and she was even worse on the meds than off. And they told me to lock my dog in a room and never let her around anybody. That her best hope was for her to learn to wear a muzzle, that she would ever be able to be around people. When I tried to call for an appointment I never got a call back from them and I called and called for 3 weeks. It's been well over 2 months now and still haven't heard from them. Took my dog to Dale at Just Happy Hounds in Birmingham and she is a new dog. Completely off meds she never needed to be on and her aggression is under control. She absolutely loves 3 of the workers there and runs up to them to be petted. All I needed was someone to actually tell me what to do to help my dog. Not someone that just stuck her on meds so she would be too doped up to do anything. I have heard absolutely awful things about the people that work there from past owners that brought their dogs there. Please don't take your dogs there.

They have a great set-up for tons of outdoor play and lots of special dog activities as well. It is the ideal place to leave your dog when you are not going to be home as their day will be full of fun, stimulating activities, tons of exercise (broken up by group nap-time!)  and best of all, love and affection - oh, and a bath at the end of their day to boot!v If you are looking for a Doggy Daycare or boarding place for your pup, you won't want to look any further than Walks and Wags.
