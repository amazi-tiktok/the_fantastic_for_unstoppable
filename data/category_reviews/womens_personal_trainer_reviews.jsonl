The professionalism of their staff had made me feel eager to get down there and begin training. First day I was amazed by the community, I was welcomed with smiles and assistance not just from the coaches but the members as well. I truly felt that I was apart of a Team. The amount of effort you put in you will get the same energy back ! I highly recommend for beginners and for those who are new to the area and want to feel apart of a community.
