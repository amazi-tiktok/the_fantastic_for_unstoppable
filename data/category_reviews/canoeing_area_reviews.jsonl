So we checked it out. 2.8 mile ride down the dirt road from the entrance off county road 112 to the actual beach area. Dirt road was in good condition. Ounce at the end we found a nice place. Quiet beach area to relax on and nice water to swim in. A couple families just enjoying the day. Seemed like a good family friendly place. I would imagine on the weekends it gets a few more visitors.
