Fresh, juicy tomatoes burst with sweetness along with pungent garlic. The sweetness and acidity of the balsamic add another layer of flavor and fresh basil turns it up with herbaceous flair. Rating: 4.5/5\n\nBrie and Marmalade Bites starts with a phyllo cup filled with orange marmalade, brie, and herbs. It is a light bite and would be great as a passed hors d\u2019oeuvre for a wedding or corporate event. The creamy brie combined with the sweetness and citrus flavor of the marmalade pair perfectly together. Rating: 5/5\n\nCaesar Salad is made with fresh romaine lettuce tossed with house-made Caesar dressing with anchovy. I love Caesar salad but it is very hard to find a place that makes it correctly. If you do not like anchovies, do not order a Caesar salad. It is just not a Caesar salad without it. Chef David makes a great Caesar salad dressing, not too thin and not too thick. The perfect viscosity to cling to the lettuce. I love that Chef David makes a crostini seasoned with butter, salt, and pepper instead of chunky, clunky croutons. It\u2019s easier to eat and elevates the salad as well. Chef David, you need to bottle and sell that dressing! Rating: 5/5\n\nChicken Marsala is made with mushrooms, shallots, garlic, and parsley served over angel hair pasta. The chicken gently bathes in the sauce and really infuses the flavors into the chicken. It is tender and unlike any chicken marsala I\u2019ve ever had. But that sauce is like liquid gold. It clings to the angel hair pasta like silk sheets. You can\u2019t help but lick the plate afterwards. I could see this on a fine dining establishment\u2019s menu. It is so refined and delicious! Rating: 5/5\n\nChocolate Fondant (Americans refer to this as a chocolate lava cake or molten chocolate cake) is basically a bi-product of a flourless chocolate cake and a souffl\u00e9. Chef David served his with macerated strawberries and strawberry coulis. If you go to my Instagram, I have a video of the chocolate \u201clava\u201d flowing from the cake. I have tried many of these in my lifetime, but I think this was the best. I don\u2019t know if it was because I had right out of the oven but it was just amazing! The perfect ending to a perfect meal!

The ribs fall off the bone,  and I truly recommend the chef salad.  All dressings are homemade. Price per person is about $10-14 for a full meal. Homemade lemonade and sweet tea are outstanding. Don't forget dessert.  The pecan pie and lemon pie are the best around. If you've got the time to wait, their steaks are excellent too.

To my enthusiasm n surprise, Country's BBQ. I grew up in Columbus, Ga and go back from time to time. And EVERY TIME I do go back 1st place I stop is Country's. I LOVE Columbus Country BBQ and longed for it. About 3pm when we first walked in, the Mgr told us \"to walk over there, grab a menu and seat where ever we wanted\". There was 2 other couples in dining area. The waitress was outstanding!! I don't remember her name, but she was super bubblely. But we were so disappointed with the food. I ordered my usual; pulled pork platter. Husband ordered his usual; 1/2 chicken. Well the pork was drowned in chutney n coleslaw juices, which totally ruined the taste mainly b/c I don't like chutney. I used a numerous amount of napkins to dry up the juice. Husband's chicken looked liked it was cooked the day before or real early that morning. The BBQ sauce was dried and skin was wrinkled up and some spots were burnt. It was very dry. Husband informed waitress and she was very helpful and offered another one, fresher or something else. He ordered another chicken. The 2nd chicken was a more moist but didn't compare to the taste of Country's in Columbus. If Jim is affiliated with this establishment, he would be ashamed. Also, the Mgr had fixed a plate for herself and sat and ate. Not once did she come over to ask about why we sent it back.  How convenient it would've been since we travel through Montgomery often and it's closer than Columbus for us. Needless to say, we won't be coming back or if by some chance we do, we will hope to remember and not order the same thing.......", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1448860779322, "text": "Dear Pamala,\n\nI am so sorry to hear about your recent experience at our Zelda Road location. I am glad your waitress was wonderful, but I am disappointed to hear about your food experience. Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention so I can address them immediately.

I am not sure if the staff was just busy at time of order or what.  While calling in the order the person taking the order seemed inpatient. We picked up the order 10 minutes later and noticed there was only one person dining in Country's BBQ, 4 staff in the kitchen and one or two staff in the dining area. About 4 orders were picked up while we waited 10 more minutes (added item to order) for our order. After getting home I realized my 1/2 and 1/2 order of fried pickles and onions was far from being fried.  In fact it was very clear they had gone straight from the container to my take out container. Not cooked what-so-ever. I was soo disappointed. Was really looking forward to trying the side dishes. Now I travel a lot and have been to great BBQ places across the US and outside the US and this is definetly not one of them. Anyone who says Country's BBQ is great has not had good BBQ. Aside from the poorly prepared side dishes the BBQ (chicken and beef) was just okay, definetly not worth mentioning. Being that the food was just okay at best there was no reason to call and complain as we would have only gotten more phone attitude.  Would not recommend this place.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1425420647795, "text": "Dear Robert,\nPlease allow us to apologize. We get a lot of good comments about our marinated barbecue onions. We have garnished our plates with these for 33 years. We only started frying these a short while ago. I have found the ticket for that evening and it is obvious that we filled the order with or regular marinated onions not fried\u2026 The order the chef got reflected barbecue onions and pickles, not fried or half-n-half. A simple miscommunication.  Please feel free to call the corporate office anytime you are not satisfied. 334-271-2017. I would be glad to forward you a replacement coupon or a refund. Thank you for taking the time to advise us.  Your business is sincerely appreciated.\nSincerely,\nMark Powell, Owner"}, "gmap_id": "0x888e81c3f76d90f3:0x34347714fabe9d0f"}
