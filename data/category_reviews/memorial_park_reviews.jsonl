I met also with Carla Layne about the rooms we would be using. To my surprise on the morning of the visitation and service we had Alabama Football decorating the rooms and also my moms favorite flowers and even some seeds for us to take home of my mothers favorite flowers.

To walk into this beautiful funeral home once again after eight years since our beloved father passed, literally took all of our breaths away as my siblings and I were grieving and crying, but there stood waiting with open arms was so very kind and professional, Leonetta Prevo, who then kindly directed us to our own private room and introduced us to Stephen. Our parents many years ago had purchased the complete funeral package so as to help ease our worries and hearts when this time came, and Stephen already had neatly laying out on the table the complete folder of our sweet mother's wishes that she and our father years ago itemized all the way to which color flowers with dear Alisa's wonderful help! Every single thing was so patiently explained to us by Stephen and Leonetta. Great respect was shown to us by them as we explained certain things we wanted to do for our mother's preparation in applying her makeup and fixing her hair. We were treated with compassion and professionalism as our requests were honored and arrangements were made where promises we had made to our beautiful mother were fulfilled! Our wonderful team of excellent professionals were not only with us at our Church the day of our mother's funeral, but were also with us the evening before for the visitation making sure that everything was as we wanted for our dear mother! Stephen kindly moved beautiful flower arrangements exactly where we requested and remained to make sure we were at peace! Alisa unbelievably had more beautiful, baby pink roses delivered by a florist to Southern Heritage the very day of our mother's funeral and lovingly added them in the blanket of roses that was to be placed on our mother's casket! My siblings and I just cried at the absolute beauty and fragrance of our beloved mother's blanket of roses that Alisa personally saw to being so perfectly gorgeous! A million \"thank you(s)\" does not suffice for the gift of Stephen, Alisa and Leonetta to our family and to all the families blessed to have their amazing help, compassionate hearts, and continued support on this very emotional journey!  Their attention to every detail without pressure has prompted me to do just as my beloved parents and purchase the complete package with Leonetta and Alisa!

My 44 year old daughter was buried at Southern Heritage in Pelham, Alabama on May 18, 2013.  I have had to constantly fight with these  people since that time.  I had to beg them to put sod on her grave; after several months they managed to cover the grave with sod.  After that a large hole appeared at the foot of her grave - it took them several weeks to fill in the hole.  I took my 14 year old granddaughter to the gravesite today (Mother's Day) to visit her mother's grave and we were horrified to see the shape it is in.  There was a pile of old discarded flowers in the back of the headstone, a huge ant bed covered the back of the headstone, weeds and dirt covered every inch of the grave and there are large ruts, which were apparently left by a vehicle of some kind, that circled the grave.  I have constantly called and complained about the condition of my daughter's gravesite and I have been given one excuse after another.  These people have a very flowery presentation and the graves that are close to the entry of the cemetery look good but they have no care or concern for the graves, such as my daughter's, that are out of view.  I would not recommend Southern Heritage to anyone.  I am very hurt by the lack of care and respect we have received from Southern Heritage.\n\nOctober 10, 2018\nThe above posting generated positive changes.  I am not one to compliment basic expectations.  However, with the assistance of Doug Glasscock, General Manager, there have been consistent improvements.  The area of my daughter burial has been well maintained, groomed and cared for.  The area displays the respect and care which should be afforded a loved one. I appreciate Leonetta.

We knew the type of service we wanted for her, and even though he did not know her personally, we could not have imagined how perfect it could have been.  It was so much more than we even imagined.  It was a true testament to our mother - her life, her love for her children and grandchildren, our love for her, but more so, her love for her Lord Jesus.

Michael, Sergio, Mack, Sandra and Jeremy all played a very important part in making the traditional Greek Orthodox funeral service beautiful for our Mother. Their warmth, compassion and desire to make everything to our satisfaction certainly helped ease the pain at this very sad and difficult time.\nHaving lived out of state for over 26 years, handling details can be a challenge. Many thanks to Sergio and Jeremy for going above and beyond to make our plans happen. There are many traditions involved with a Greek orthodox funeral and I am so thankful for aunts and relatives who assisted with those steps. My parents are both part of old, long-time Montgomery families that make up much of the local Greek community. I was comforted by Sandra in the office who was so sweet, understanding and knew my aunt.\nMichael Cox was an excellent funeral director and remained calm and constant throughout the process. He was outstanding at the church and ensured our requests. He lead an informative meeting at the family table to finalize  funeral dollars and expectations. Mack in \"PCP\" was such an easy person to work with, as three of us made sure mom's make-up and dress was just as she would have expected!\nAt 10:30PM after Mom's funeral, I realized that while there were lots of people in attendance, there were many friends about her age that were missing. Having the obituary put on the website was made very clear and that it was at no cost. That's great, but in order to reach more of her target age group the good old newspaper is definitely the best approach!! So many friends reached out when I printed the obituary the day after her funeral. They simply did not know mom had passed away. This leads to my strong recommendation for white-chapel to assist with actually contacting the Montgomery Advertiser and  with submitting the obituary. Of course we are responsible for the cost. I would encourage at least a small informative notice to persons in this age category. I feel there was definite confusion on that situation... at least for ME. Apparently I misunderstood exactly how the newspaper obituary operated.  If I could only re-do that part!!!\nEverything else was absolutely perfect, mom looked beautiful and the flowers were gorgeous (thank you Michele)!! She would approve.\nWith the exception of the disappointing newspaper glitch... I would highly recommend White Chapel-Greenwood Funeral Home services along with their dear and assuring staff.\n\nMany thanks to all!\nSincerely,\nAngela", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81e7b631bacf:0xa863195dd44c65f"}
