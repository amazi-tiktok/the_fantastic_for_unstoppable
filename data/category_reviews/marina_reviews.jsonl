Didn't think it was a huge deal and would have appreciated if they just stored the glass somewhere safe, but instead they had to stop the boat and all 4 members of the crew took about 15 min to put it back in its place.

They brought fishing stuff for my son when we changed our mind last minute, and got us out on the water quick. Their recommendations of where to catch a fish and where to see dolphins were spot on!\n\nThe boat itself was easy to use and had great technology. Good sound system and excellent depth finder / gps. Boat was in tip top shape and easy to use. While I am very experienced on a boat, a beginner could use this pretty easily.\n\nWe took the four hour trip. The only problem was we should have gotten the full day rental!!!  Next time!  I will definitely rent from them again.\n\nFinal part was the gas up and check for damages. They quickly assessed the boat and saw it was in good shape. Four hours of boat time and just about $20 of gas only, so efficient as well.  No hidden fees or charges at all.\n\nWe appreciate y\u2019all making our day so fantastic!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a07b1ee0a0e57:0xd9fd06f174faed2"}

Other then paying more every month I\u2019d say it wasn\u2019t a bad stay the management is friendly for the most part I never had any issues with them.

It allows us to provide information to future guests.   I'd like to respond to your \"downsides\".\n\nYes, we collect a $20 deposit on the \"key pass\" to the pool, which is similar to a hotel key to provide safe passageway into the pool for authorized users.  What you failed to mention is that you get that $20 back when you return the key, so you're not out any money.\n\nSecondly, the sites are metered, and tenants are charged .16/kWh for power usage, and one is invoiced anything usage over the $50 allowance.  Anyone is welcomed to monitor their usage by taking note of the meter reading.  It's certainly unfair for a 22' unit to have to pay a higher rent to cover the usage of a 42' unit which has 2 or 3 air conditioner units, therefore, we keep all things even by giving each monthly guest a $50 allowance toward their power.  How they use it is up to the tenant.  You were also here during the summer months when temperatures were extremely high and often record-setting, so yes, you would more than likely have a higher power usage to keep the camper cool.\n\nThirdly, the site you were on is one of our smaller and cheaper sites.  We have larger sites as well.\n\nLastly, we are located next to a scrap yard, and they do move scrap around 6 days a week.  Their weekend noise is no different than during the week.  You must have just been off on the weekends to hear it.\n\nAnd yes, we're continuing to make improvements on the property, including the addition of 21 more sites so we may welcome more guests!"}, "gmap_id": "0x886285bb06e87b7f:0x94a3d5c4ffaec253"}

The very affordable rates make the location a win to begin with.  The massive capacity of this large and expanding boatyard is another positive, though they graciously made room for me even in the midst of the fallout of Hurricane Sally .  However, perhaps the best aspect of the facility are the brilliant array of professionals associated with it who are able to attend to any matter that one might face.  Though I intended to perform all the work on my boat, I was delighted to find both excellent, generous guidance and reliable, experienced service providers to attend to all my needs that were beyond my own capacity.
