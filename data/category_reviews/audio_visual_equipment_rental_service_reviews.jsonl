I can not say enough about how professional Platinum Events was through this entire process.  We had a high school dance.  From the beginning to the end, the experience was wonderful.  First was the immediate responses to all questions and communication.  The website was professionally and clearly laid out.  The \"ala carte\" choosing of the services they provide was so user friendly.  All communication was done by email so everything was clear for me.  I didn't rely on any  verbal committments, it was all recorded in emails.  The price...frankly I don't know.  I live by the motto you get what you pay for....I love capitalism.  And if I paid more than other services, I don't care....I got what I paid for....a wonderful experience.  Our services included a DJ, lights, sound system, and mirror photo booth.\nThe DJ set up was compact, high quality and the DJ screened the music for me...(i had enough on my plate).  Their website allowed my daughter to upload a spotify playlist easily and he screened it.  It also allowed a timeline that he respected and utilized..  The website has event planning section ......It was great.  I wish I was gifted at writing so I could paint a picture of what a wonderful experience but.....I had a wonderful experience and will recommend and utilize them a hundred times over!!!  We also utilized the Mirror Photo Booth...so fun.  Great props, assistance at it's side the entire time, easily usable, I am so glad I upgraded to this but I am sure the starter photo selection is great too but I am glad I upgraded to this one.  They designed a stamp for each of the photos customized to our event and they initiated that process and went with it without much of my involvement because I didn't have time.  The individuals who worked the event were dressed appropriately for the event, cordial, available, cooperative....I appreciated them handling EVERYTHING.  It made it worth every penny.\nMy ONLY suggestion would be to work with them on customizing your props for the event.  That was a shortcoming on my part not theirs.  Their props were great but looking back, I wish I had included some things that were directed toward this group of seniors.\nI can't thank them enough for working with us on providing these high school seniors a winter dance that had been cancelled by those around them twice who were more concerned about perceptions of participating in a \"super spreader event\".  They had a wonderful time, fantastic memories, and NO, we weren't a super spreader event.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889106de6b70cbb:0x61316f3dd30eb306"}

He kept the party going for 5 hours!! The dance floor was full for a solid 4 hours. During the planning process Andre addressed all of my questions within the same day. He was so easy to work with and made me feel confident that we\u2019d have a fun wedding. He played all of our songs as requested and ended the songs where I wanted them to end (we did partial songs during the father/daughter mother/son dance). He did cues for different parts of the reception (toasts, send off, etc). Everyone commented that they had the best time and it was largely because of the music choices! I\u2019m so beyond thankful for Platinum Entertaining, they did a fantastic job!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889106de6b70cbb:0x61316f3dd30eb306"}

I think on Tuesday evening, I decided I wanted a photo booth and so the search began. During my search, I ran across Platinum Ent Dj's website. They offer a Mirror Booth rental. BEST THING EVER!!! What I loved about the website was that you could instantly find out if the booth was available for your event and how much it would cost. I also was very happy that this company was willing to travel to Huntsville, approximately 1.5hrs away from Birmingham, for my event.\n\nFrom the very beginning, Andre was courteous and professional.  This company definitely understands customer service and it shows! They provided an easy and convenient method to pay for the services online which I appreciated. They also showed up early to the event just to make sure everything was in its proper place.\n\nThe mirror booth was a real hit with my guests. Everyone absolutely loved it! Based on my experience, I highly recommend this company to anyone looking for quality service and a stress-free event.

I have always been treated very well from them so, NO I did not want to change. After a while of thinking about it SEVERAL MONTHS and my Son hammering me with the RJ YOUNG name, I did it. I purchased a machine from RJ YOUNG.\nAt first I was skeptical and to be honest I really didn't want to give it a chance (The Machine), but I did and after several months and barely using the machine I starting coming more around it and using it a little more & more. Then I began to really like it because it really printed so nice and pretty fast. It only took me  8 to 10 months to like it but you have to understand I WAS A XEROX Man and I thought there was NOTHING out there but Xerox. The Xerox machine has ALWAYS  performed outstanding and the SERVICE was the best, I was spoiled from that. However, I found out that there was more out there than XEROX! I found out that RJ YOUNG was REAL and believe me they have made a believer out of me. The Service that I thought would not compare to XEROX, has showed me they are just as good and if not BETTER. I never thought I would say that but it is so true. I can not believe how fast the Service Technicians reply to the service calls. They are always polite, and get me back up and running in a very quickly manner. They have such good personalities and a smile! As for the Ladies at the Home Office, Oh My How can you NOT like them. They are AMAZING. They always tell me they will have my supplies on the way or a Technician asap. IT IS JUST SO HARD TO PUT IN WORDS what RJ Young has done for my business. This is a very caring company and to be honest I am so glad that I have some of their product and that I was introduced to the World outside of XEROX. RICO machines have made my life SO MUCH Better and I am so happy that I have changed.

We havent done an event at Hutton and Smith. We do rent gear to other companies in town! Our engineers do freelance with other companies.
