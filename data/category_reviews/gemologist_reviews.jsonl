We had gone to FIVE other jewelers and had no luck. These people helped us for over an hour and would not give up until we found the perfect ring. Fast forward to three months ago when we went to pick out our wedding bands: once again, great experience. They were so friendly & helpful and made the process a breeze. Last month, I brought them my great-great-great grandmother's ring to be resized. Trusting someone to repair a diamond ring that has made it through 5 generations was difficult, but Goldstein's did an excellent job & were very professional. They even discovered two cracks in the ring, repaired those, and kept me up to date throughout the process as well. This is just a great jewelers with a fantastic staff.

I cannot explain what sets Goldstein\u2019s apart until I share the negative experience I had at another jewelry store in Mobile, so I will share that first.\n\nLike I said, I had a ring repair somewhere else first. The other jewelry store not only sized my ring down (when I didn\u2019t ask for it to be sized down), but failed to claim fault for it.  My diamond had fallen out of my setting and I asked the other jewelry store to reset the diamond and also solder my wedding band and engagement band together. When I got my rings back from them, my ring was a size 5 3/4 which is 3/4 smaller than the original size, which was a  size 6 (rings also fit tighter when they\u2019re soldered together, so it fit much tighter than before.) I want to also note that their store never sized me in store either, but rather had the ring repaired with no size listed in their system. Goldstein\u2019s makes a practice of sizing you and placing the size in the system, anytime you come in for ring repairs so that it is never your word against theirs.\n\nWhen I came back to the other store, not only did they not apologize, they did not want to take apart my soldered rings and resize them individually (so as to protect the integrity of them) , but they recommended making the two rings into one. The sales associate also sized me as a size 7 which is A LOT larger than the size 5 3/4 ring they had sent me home with just a few days before!\n\nI felt something was off with how everything was being handled, so I decided to not have my repairs done there but instead have them done somewhere else...which would be how I ended up at Goldstein\u2019s a few days later.\n\nWhen I went to Goldstein\u2019s, they measured my finger and reassured me that yes, the other store had sized my ring incorrectly. The rings wouldn\u2019t even fit on my finger without redness and swelling (which the other jewelry store associate said was due to having large knuckles, or perhaps even the humid weather.)\n\nGoldstein\u2019s assured me they stood behind their sizing methods. The other jewelry store actually told me they didn\u2019t guarantee their fit and scoffed over the phone when asked if they guaranteed the fit. Goldstein\u2019s on the other hand, said that they do guarantee the fit they size you with in store. They didn\u2019t make me feel like I was being unreasonable at any step of the way, like I felt at the other store. They affirmed me, as one should do when providing quality customer service.\n\nGoldstein\u2019s measured me as a size 6 1/2  and I noticed they had a careful attention to fit, and also that their ring sizing methods seemed more legitimate than what I was offered at the other jewelry store (they used individual rings to size me at Goldstein\u2019s, and the other store used a keychain of sorts full of various sized rings. I was more impressed with the Goldstein\u2019s method because if you\u2019re getting rings soldered together, you want to see how the two stacked rings will fit your finger and that they come off easily, versus what was offered at the other store, with only one ring being placed on the finger to determine fit.)\n\nIf I had gone through with the second round of repairs at the other store, I would have been paying for extra gold that I would have had removed anyway because they sized me as a 7, and my true size is a 6 1/2, as determined by Goldstein\u2019s (my rings fit beautifully now!) Goldstein\u2019s got it right the FIRST time versus the other store which didn\u2019t get it right the first two times.\n\nAll this to say, Goldstein\u2019s did everything correctly and professionally. They even texted me to see how my rings were fitting a week later. I call that excellent customer service.\n\nIf you want a correct fit the first time with no back and forth issues that make you second guess yourself, and if you\u2019d rather have extra money in your pockets (unlike I do, since I had to pay for correct repairs that the other store failed to provide) then please, go to Goldstein\u2019s!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1601480386580, "text": "Thanks so much for the great review.

If only I knew my experience with them later will be so emotionally and mentally traumatizing, I'd have never stepped foot in that store.\nI had insisted I'd rather patronize a local business rather than purchase online contrary to what my boyfriend wanted. In the store, I chose a ring that was in the showcase. It wasn't my size so I was told they'd order one in my size, also the diamond for the ring was not kept in the store so i had to wait for over a month for it to come in store. Unfortunately my wedding was called off and so I decided to return the rings for a refund 6 days after purchase was made and three days since receiving it from the store. There is a 15 day return policy for a full refund. I was denied a full refund because as the store owner stated; \" Its bad for my business\" and offered a 50% refund instead, which i refused. I don't understand why I  should bargain for a refund I'm  entitled  to. When I insisted to be treated fairly and given my refund,the store owner  Richard Frank Jr,  made comments suggesting bias and racism against my color and country of origin.Insinuating I'm ignorant and stupid because I'm a foreigner from another country and had an accent.  I have never been treated like this in any other store environment and urge any other potential customers to beware and steer clear of this rude and racist  business. I find Goldstein's store profession and ethics to be unsatisfactory and many other reviews will state the same.

Most recent I was in the store looking for a replacement chain, sterling silver for my granddaughter, who has struggles with speical needs, Angela found the perfect little affordable chain to fit our needs, and even added a little piece of chain, so she could adjust it on her neck, didn\u2019t charge us for her quick fix of placing the small charm on the necklace, that met so much to my granddaughter, I only paid for the small chain and we were out the door, as I was leaving she offered me a water for the road. That is such wonderful service, the kind you don\u2019t get anywhere else. That charm was left at another store for over two weeks, just to be placed on a chain, when it wasn\u2019t ready for my granddaughter\u2019s flight, the jewelry store had a hard time finding our ticket and never seemed to mind, because we were only spending less then fifty. If ever I spend thousands, and I hope to do that one day soon, I will spend it at Goldstein \u2018s.
