The lady on the phone helped me figure out a glitch that was saying my appliance that was purchased two weeks prior was out of warranty. Had to call GE and fix the error. Then they sent someone out in just a few days to find out why my washing machine part of my washer dryer combo was not working. The person named Shawn was super nice.  My husband offered to help move the appliance out from the wall, he had previous neck surgery. Shawn quickly said NO, you sit down I will move it out.  Thank goodness, I wouldn't want to hear about my husbands neck for the next week.  : )    He found the problem right away.  We had a washer in this cattery building before and only used cold water. We had a fire and built a new building. When the carpenter put the new lines in, my husband told him to only hook up cold water. Well that was the problem, these newfangled washers have sensors, and the sensor on the hot side said there was no water coming in at all.  Shawn stayed around until the washer ran through the full cycle to make sure that was the only problem. He didn't say we needed a relay, a new motor, a new anything.  All we needed was the lever switched on on the hot water line.    He was super nice, courteous and I would recommend this company for any appliance service you need...We will certainly put them in our speed dial!

The GE unit broke down 1 month before the 1 year warranty expired. Doctor Appliance came out, took the unit, worked on it, and then returned it. It worked ok when they returned it. It was working when they left. This was in late summer, so I only used the air conditioning for a month. This spring I started it up and it isn't cooling! The repair only came with a 90 day guarantee. So, I called them. It is going to cost me $120 bucks just to get them to come look at it, even though their repair was likely not done correctly, (the unit most likely was not functioning during the 90 day warranty, it just wasn't being used in the winter months). Long story I know.\nI'm also extremely ticked off with GE. I now have a $500 unit that will heat but not cool. None of our local HVAC people will even come look at it. They say a window unit is just a throw away. I don't have $500 to just throw away! CUSTOMER SERVICE IS DEAD, A THING OF THE PAST.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1590974139838, "text": "Blake,\n\nI am sorry that you are dissatisfied with our service. I will advise you that your unit was actually warrantied by the manufacturer not us. The manufacturer provides a 90 day warranty on all repairs any company performs regardless to whom performs the repair. Our warranty is slightly different and had the unit not been covered by the manufacturer things perhaps could have been different or at least there could have been more wiggle room.\n\nI completely understand that you may not have used the unit for cooling in the winter. Unfortunately the manufacturers have no way of knowing when a consumer starts to use their unit and it is not up to us to make that decision. We have a contract with them that dictates what we can and can not do. Every step of the process starting from the first visit up to the final repair are documented. In fact we require prior approval from them before we can even put a single part on a unit. The manufacturer will perform a cost to replacement analysis to determine if it is a repair that they deem is worth pursuing.\n\nI strongly suggest you call them and ask them to take care of the issue. I see them offer concessions on warranties all of the time. Especially in a situation like this. I have no issues with being an advocate for you in this matter. Should the need arise, you can direct them to speak with me personally.\n\nGiven your distance from us, we would have to charge a service call if the manufacturer is unwilling to cover the repair. Alternatively, you could bring the unit to us which would greatly lower the service call rate and you would only be responsible for the diagnostic.\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything else I can do to help you in this regard. Should they choose to send us a work order we would be more than pleased to come and help you. We want you to be happy with your product.\n\nPlease feel free to call and talk with me about this During business hours should you feel that I have left out any pertinent information. My name is Jonathan.\n\nKind regards,\n\nJonathan"}, "gmap_id": "0x88617bdf1752d905:0xda96bf56eb1ff39f"}

The manufacturer of your unit contacted us to take a look at the unit and diagnose the issue. The issue is your side wall on the right hand side is slightly pushed in causing the unit to chatter against the steam line internal to the unit. Your wife was shown the issue. This unit is under warranty and thus we did not charge you for any work performed. In addition we advised your spouse as to the installation related issues in your current set up. I understand your frustration being that you were not home and we wish we could have related it to you directly.\n\nWhen asked, your wife said she could have you replace the venting. Due to this being a warranty claim, installation issues can not be covered by the manufacturer. Had your wife requested, we could have charged you separately and addressed your install problem. She did not request this and stated that you would take care of it.\n\nWe try our hardest to inform our customers as to what their appliance manufacturer will and will not cover and are truly sorry if any of it was lost in communication.

I was unable to reach the company on the phone and did not get a callback from the message I left, so I scheduled an appointment online. This was on 11/30/20. Tech came out on 12/4/20 and determined that the compressor was bad and needed to be replaced. they had to order parts. After finally getting the parts, a different tech came out on 1/20/21. He said the compressor was working and some boards needed to be replaced. Again, parts had to be ordered. A while after the expected parts delivery date, I called for an update and was told the parts were in.  An appointment was scheduled for the following week on 3/1/21. On the morning of the appointment, the tech called me and said that the parts were not in and cancelled the appointment. At this point, I was livid and called Kitchen Aid directly to complain. They called S&S and basically were told that the parts were never ordered. So again, I had to wait for parts. On 4/2/21, I received an email that the parts were in and a link to schedule an appointment. I tried calling, but again, got no one and I left a message. I never received a call back.

When I called It was an extremely long wait, but after 30 min of waiting and I was finally connected to Natoshia she was very professional and understanding and got me moved up by a day. So finally the man John came and looked at the dryer he said it was the timer and door switch and that he would have to order the parts and it would take a week.\n\nAfter he left they ordered the part and scheduled me for another two weeks out.\nThe day of the appointment arrived and I got an email saying my appointment was canceled because part was on back order and so they rescheduled me for another two weeks out.\nThey had the part in a week before my actual appointment. So on the date of my appointment he called and told me it was miss-boxed so it\u2019s the wrong part and would take another 4weeks to get the part in!!!!!\n\nI stayed calm and called whirlpool and told them what was going on and they shipped the part out to me within 2 weeks.\nHe came yesterday put it on and now he says the dryer needs a new start button and a fan is broken\nSo he couldn\u2019t see all the problems when he first came in NOVEMBER and looked at the dryer?\nSo now I\u2019m stuck waiting AGAIN! But before John left he said he found the parts local in Birmingham and that he would try to get someone to go get them so he can come back the next day and install it.\n\nI called today and got connected with a woman named Tammy and I explained the situation to her and she responded \u201cwell there\u2019s nothing we can do, we\u2019re ordering the part and we\u2019ll schedule you for feb 3. Maybe you\u2019ll get lucky and get it in on time\u201d I told her what John said to me and she said \u201cwell ma\u2019am we have to order them so you\u2019ll have to wait\u201d I replied to her that I can call whirlpool and get the parts sent within 5days that way they can come install it she said \u201cno ma\u2019am and if you get the parts yourself (from the manufacture) that it will void my warranty!\n\nBut That\u2019s what I did with the other part and he came and installed it so I don\u2019t know what the difference is.\n\nI understand COVID has put a strain on a lot of things right now and I\u2019ve been very patient and understanding with this company but it shouldn\u2019t take 5months to fix a dryer!!! And today after the way that lady\u2019s treated me I am furious. I will never use this company again and have called whirlpool and made them very aware of what\u2019s happened and how I was treated they completely agreed it was unacceptable and after they finish this job they will no longer match me with S&S for my repair needs.\n\nIf nothing is done by February 3rd they will schedule me with another company.\n\nThe only reason I give this company two starts is because of Natoshia, she understands how hard and costly it is not having your appliances when having a large family and tried her best to help.\n\nCovid  can\u2019t be an excuse for everything, I suggest you hire some more technicians so customers aren\u2019t waiting two weeks just to get their appliances looked at and I also suggest you hire more professional people to answer your phones.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888df132a70994f:0xdc635790045d61d7"}

With warranty covered service calls, we don't collect ANY money until the job is complete (with customer pay calls we collect the service call fee on the front end but don't collect parts and labor until the job is complete). In fact, we have to spend money to send a tech out to the house to diagnose (salary for tech and office staff, gas, time, etc.) and we pay for the parts on the front end. So until the job is complete and we are able to bill the warranty provider for it, we are in the hole financially on a job while we are waiting for parts. Manufacturing disruptions and distribution delays are a real thing we're dealing with- Google \"appliance parts shortage\" and there are many articles done by national publications regarding it. We cant just order parts from \"any company\", we have to order genuine parts from the manufacturer or an approved distributor. the parts shortage has had ripple effect throughout our business that has been an incredible challenge to deal with. Calls that would normally take a week from start to finish are now taking months, customers appointments get pushed back again and again because a date we were told a part would be in gets changed at the last minute and we have to call or email the customer to reschedule, more phone traffic to schedule/reschedule/update customers has led to much longer than normal wait times when calling our office, the list is almost endless of how it has affected our business this year.\n\nMs. Lewis, I just want to say that our company doesn't \"suck\". We are a family owned business that has been in operating for 60 years, and we didn't do that by \"scamming\" customers. Everyone that works here has a home and a family and knows what it is like for a major appliance to go out- it stinks and we want it to be fixed for you. We truly do care about our customers and are doing out best to get everyone taken care of but we are absolutely going though a really challenging time right now trying to overcome this obstacle with parts. I really do hate that it has caused you to have a bad experience but I hope that you will keep this in mind and show patience and empathy towards businesses in a time when there are so many small businesses going though challenges that they could have never prepared for and that you might not be aware of."}, "gmap_id": "0x8888df132a70994f:0xdc635790045d61d7"}

We sent them the part number that we needed and they sent us the wrong part (we need a control board and they sent us a console panel). We reached out and let them know that was not the part we needed and restated the correct part that we need, they sent us another of the same consoles. We have reached out to them and let them know again and are waiting for the correct part. I completely understand your frustration surrounding the situation, but I think it is misplaced towards us and should be directed towards your home warranty company.

I read the reviews and thought Oh great-here we go.  I was pleasantly surprised that they called when they were on their way, the customer service people were quite nice and the service guy seemed knowledgeable. He arrived on time, and upon inspection of the stove, found a wire that had shorted out.  The previous week, out of nowhere the stove flipped the breaker and blew sparks all over my kitchen.  He fixed that and left-after ensuring the stove could be turned on without the breaker flipping again.  After he left, I kept noticing that something smelled like it was getting hot so I checked on the stove.  The oven was fine and no smell was coming from it.  However, when I stood in front of the stove to check the oven, I immediately felt heat coming from the warming drawer-even though it was off.  Somehow, either the original problem that the tech didn't find or something he did bypassed the off button on the warming drawer and had it on high all the time with no way to turn it off.  Had I not been home, in all likelihood, we would have had a house fire.  I tried to call him back on his cell and he didn't answer and the company had closed and doesn't have an after hours/emergency number (it was a Saturday when they came and they must close at noon).  DON'T use this company or if you do, make sure you are home the rest of the day in case something like this happens to you.\n\nThe home warranty dispatched a different company after I let the have it and the second guy found the problem-when the stove flipped the breaker and blew sparks everywhere, apparently it fused part of the circuit board so the warming drawer was on-and on high-all the time.  The guy from S and S didn't even look at the circuit boards and didn't stick around long enough to tell there was a problem.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888df132a70994f:0xdc635790045d61d7"}

I took off work to schedule the appointment for the repair man to arrive he came on the day of the appointment but he did not have the parts to repair the fridge.

The repair guy acknowledged that he\u2019d never serviced my model fridge..saying it would be the first time for both of us.... he replaced the door..... an \u201ceasy fix\u201d took 2 1/2 hours... and he did not replace the parts back in the fridge as he\u2019d removed from the old..... He could not remember which wire went to what...  he was so short that I had to give him a chair to stand on to service the fridge...  I tried to explain to him that certain wires did not belong in that area but he was a know it all and put the fridge back together in the way that he wanted...  he then told a family member that was at the home that he could keep the old door at my home to use the door for fishing and to scale fish with the door.  I then asked him to take the door with him because I did not need trash in my home and I am not a hoarder....  he rudely ask my family member if he wanted to keep the door my family said it doesn\u2019t matter to him so the repair guy left the door in my home!!!!!! I tried  explaining to the repair guy that the  door open indicator light should go off instantly when the door is closed.  He continued to work on the light and became very frustrated with me because the indicator light stayed on at least three minutes with the door closed completely..... indicating that the door was still open. I tried to FURTHER explain to the repair guy that  The doors were not aligned properly.  He insisted that the indicator light was to stay on two minutes at most and he was pleased after the light went off and he went home.... I was Livid!!!!!!!!!!  LONG STORY SHORT..... the fridge is now broken!!!! The motor hasn\u2019t turned on I since Monday and the fridge is like a Sona. The ice maker has leaked water all over the floor about 2 weeks after the repair.... the opened door light indicator never worked properly after his repair. and no lights come on other than the interior... and the entire fridge QUIT on Monday....... an 8months NEW fridge...... THANKS REPAIR MAN...... for nothing...!!!!!!!... water on the floor and soaked through floor....... 200 dollars in fresh food RUINED!!!!!

Their website says you can schedule a service within two days, it took us weeks before someone was able to come out.  I own a WhirlPool front loading washing machine and the bearing is slowly fading and it makes a lot of noise.  It's loud but it works.  Today, I was told someone will show up between 8am and 12pm.  He did not show up until 2pm.  During the next hour, he disassembled the washing machine.  After about an hour, he told me that headquarters needed him to finish his other jobs, so he left my washing machine disassembled and started his next jobs.  About 530pm he called and said he had one more stop and then will be over.  At 645PM he called again saying he will come back but only to put the washing machine back together.  Around this time I was hungry and went to get food where I noticed he did not turn off the water and it had slowly leaked on the floor.  I cleaned this up and turned off the nozzle.  When he finally returned, he did not clean up any of the water on the floor and started to put the washing machine back together.  Once it was back together, he told me it will work just like it did before where it worked but was noisy.  So once he left, I started a load of wet towels, which I used to clean up the floor.  During the first 30 seconds, while I was gone getting a fan to help dry the floor, I heard what can only be described as a waterfall.  The front of the washing machine was leaking water profusely.  I quickly turned it off. Needless to say that I waited weeks for them to come repair a working washing machine for them to flood my floor and make the washing machine unusable.  Not only that I missed a day of work waiting for 12 hours when if they just did not come it would have been all the same and possibly better.  Throughout this experience, I did not feel like a customer getting any type of good treatment.  He left to do other jobs without even finishing mine and then ends up breaking it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888df132a70994f:0xdc635790045d61d7"}

I said if they could not do this I would take off work as I have been without a washing machine since November and going to the laundry-mat cost me about $50.00 a month. The guy that made the appointment said that would not be a problem for him to call an hour ahead of time. I had to wait two weeks just to get the appointment. I was not happy about having to wait two weeks but no problem, I will do whatever it takes.  They are in Bessemer AL, I am in Pensacola Florida.

I said he called me twice not 4 times and I called him immediately back after the second call.  I asked if he could come back. He said his office is 71 miles away and he was already half way there.

I have a Bosch Dishwasher that had an issue under manufacture warranty and unfortunately the closest authorized Bosch repair vendors was this one (who has an auxiliary service center in Huntsville), and another company in Birmingham (The Birmingham place seemed very nice on the phone, but I didn't want to wait a couple weeks for a tech to fix it... so I called S&S).\n\nFirst off after calling the other repair place in Birmingham, I found the lady on the phone at S&S very rushy - just wanted name, address, payment method got me off the phone quick... the other repair place took down all my info, make/model, serial #, everything and was going to preorder potential parts so they could do one visit and be done. Dispite my initial impression of calling S&S I went with them anyway since they could come out in 2-3 days vice 1-2 weeks. (when your used to having a dishwasher it's not fun when it's broken...)\n\nSo the first guy comes out, looks at the dishwasher, deems we need a new sump pump, leaves. 2nd visit he comes by installs the new part does a really quick test and deems its fixed and leaves.  My wife goes to run the dishwasher on a full cycle and the draining error code comes up again.\n\nI called the company and was informed someone was coming out the next day to check it. This time we get a guy who didn't even know how to spell Bosch (OK I'm exagerating, but in his words he never seen this kind of dishwasher... had no clue how to work it, fix it, nothing...), treated my wife horribley, he had to call Bosch to walk him through troubleshooting, then proceeds to berate my wife saying it's our plumbing get a plumber the dishwasher is fine, and threatens to charge us if we call for warranty purposes again since it is our plumbing.\n\nJust to give this jerk the benefit of the doubt I took apart the piping under my sink and found no blockages (cleaned it a bit anyway), the sink the dishwasher was hooked to for drainage has never had issues... as far as the intall it was professionally installed by Lowe's and has worked flawless for 11 months so how the heck can it be my plumbing?\n\nAfter fooling with it more myself I found out when the 1st guy replaced our pump it ajared the door that covers the sump pump from the inside of the dishwasher, and some food was caught in there. After I cleaned it and reseated the door correctly it worked fine again...\n\nIn summary my experience: Curt, rushy phone operator; experienced, but in a hurry repair tech (1st and 2nd visit same guy); and lastly rude and unknowledgeable repair tech (3rd visit).\n\nNext time if I had to choose between this place and the Birmingham repair place I'll take my chances with how long it takes the Birmingham folks to come out.... I'd rather wait a week longer and have someone take the time to fix it right then some half fast job, but you know it's all about the $$ the more jobs they cram into a day the more $$ they take in so this is what you get.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888df132a70994f:0xdc635790045d61d7"}

My wife went there because our heating element went out on our dryer.  She purchased the element from them for $88.95.  She called me and I told her that this was a very very high price.  I purchased the same exact heating element on Amazon Prime for $16.40.  I asked my wife to get a refund from Appliance Parts.  They refused.  The box was unopened, had never made it home, barely out of the store.  Appliance Parts said that their policy is no refunds even if this type part was unopened and just purchased.  It really sounds like they just scammed my wife because she did not know any better on the high price.  She just assumed that this was an honest place.  Everybody needs to make a profit but something seemed wrong about this.  After asking and pleading her case, the lady behind the counter reduced the price to $40.  I was still on the phone to my wife and asked if I could speak to the Manager.  The Manager refused to speak to me and started yelling at his employee for reducing the price (which was still $23.60 higher than exact part on Amazon).  I asked again to speak to the Manager but he refused to even explain the policy to me\u2026\u2026..nothing.  So, I went down there.  The lady behind the counter explained that their policy was no refunds.  I asked to speak to the Manager and she told me where his office was.  I asked if he would come out to at least speak with me.  She refused to go get him because she had been yelled at by him.  I asked if this was good customer service and she refused to answer really because she was scared of getting into more trouble.  I went to the Manager\u2019s office and he told me that I was not getting a refund because that was their policy.  I told him that it was bad that he would not even speak to me to explain the policy and that his employees were scared of him.  He stated that I have a right to my opinion.  Wow!!!  I have been to this place in the past and everybody seemed okay.  If something goes wrong it is a completely different story.  By the way, Amazon had already shipped my heating coil.  I called them up and they are intercepting the delivery and giving me a full refund!  Wow on their customer service!  The Manager at Appliance Parts did not have the decency to give me the time of the day without me going to his office.  He indicated to me that he didn\u2019t care about me at all.   I guess if you own a store you can have any policy you want whether it is good or bad, but being extremely rude and not even explaining the policy to the customer takes it to another level.   In my opinion he knew he had taken advantage of us and did not want to discuss it.  In my opinion, you need to stay away from this place unless you are okay with paying 5 times the cost and stuck with the item if something goes wrong.

I have been doing retail business with Washer and Refrigeration Supply for at least 40 years. Firstly, Washer and Refrigeration Supply is basically a wholesale only company.  They do not have any patience with DYI customers.  Since they are about the only game in town, they can treat folks about anyway they care to.  They treat their trade customers entirely differently.  I don't know why they even bother with the retail side of the business; I can only guess since they charge the absolute maximum for retail parts, profit must be the reason.  Here is the best way to approach this vendor (provide you need the part immediately and cannot get it on line) - 1.)Make sure you can handle the repair you are trying to accomplish.  2.)Always, repeat, always, take your old part with you and have them check it with the new part, let them open the package.  If they become surly or refuse to compare parts, just leave with your old part and go on line or call an appliance service and buy the part from them.  A lot of services (not all) will do this.  It will cost you more, but the part will be correct and you will not have to deal with the ugly side of WRS. 3.)Always pay with a credit card so if you truly feel (after following the advice hereon) that they have screwed you, file a complaint with the credit card company.  Lastly, buy on line when possible; this company is a survivor because they are ruthless and they are not going to change.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88893d4e282eb02b:0xc0f254926f26d6d9"}

Sometimes a unit is too old, and has too many problems, to justify repair. We issued a refund after the customer decided to buy a new unit rather than approve further repairs. -- Initially we traced her leak to a clogged condensate drain, but she continued to have the leak. After the drain was found clogged again and cleared, it continued to leak. Further investigation found that that her drawer was not closing perfectly because of a defective gear, which was allowing moist room air into the freezer which was building up high levels of frost, which was also causing her drain to clog. When the unit defrosted, it would produce the leak called us about in the first visit. The rails to the drawer were also rusty, which interfered with proper drawer closure.

This is one of the companies LG forces you to use. Even with LG covering the expense of the compressor, about 350.00 the quote was 800.00 for then to spend 2-3 hours to repair.  The worst part was the tech told me it was a 50/50 chance it would last. The reason behind the ridiculous price, the tech explained that there was a strong possibility that multiple service calls would be made in the first year and they dont get paid for those, meaning the price hike was to help cover their possible future expense  The going rate from several other companies not affiliated with LG was approximately 400.00 to swap out the compressor, vacume to 5 microns and refill with r134.  Today, I am having another company come to my home and swapping the compressor to the non linear compressor, all paid out of my pocket, the entire job cost me 595.00. So how can it possibly be so much for the LG compressor swap if LG is covering the cost due to warranty? Another noteworthy mentioning is that I told the tech I would mount the compressor myself and would sweat on the copper connections myself, but that wouldn't change the price according to the tech. It's called price gouging and its pathetic. Be very cautious when dealing with this company, there are much better options out there, thankfully I found one, thanks Appliance Service LLC. A small locally owned business with an awesome response time (next day) and an affordable price. He also guarantees his work for a year, same as this one.

When the technician came to evaluate my abnormally noisy dryer I was quoted and shown an invoice for parts/labor totaling over $560. I reluctantly chose to have my dryer repaired because buying a new dryer would cost several hundred more dollars. I was also required to pay half of the service fee before Service Care would come out to complete the repair\u2014I assumed so that the very expensive parts could be ordered. When *my technician arrived I was surprised to see him carrying a very small bag of parts and was finished with the repair in less than 30 mins\u2014I was expecting a little bit more for a repair costing well over $500 dollars. Come to find out when I researched the actual cost of parts I found out the parts cost around $35 which means service care charged me nearly 1000k an hr for labor. Please do not use this company. A total scam. Buy the parts yourself, watch a  tutorial YouTube video, and save yourself literally HUNDREDS of dollars.\n\nHeard back from customer service. Per their customer service rep my technician mistakenly charged me for the parts 4 times resulting in a quote that was over $200 dollars more than what it should have been. The invoice I received from the tech clearly states that only one was ordered for a parts/installation fee of $560.11 which alerted my spider sense. Customer service offered me an ultimatum of either $200+ refund because of tech\u2019s alleged mistake (meaning I still paid over $300 dollars to replace a $35 dollar part that took 30 mins to replace) or they would come out to take out the $35 part for a full refund. Despite having been charged a fee of $80+ for an in-home quote which by their own admission was inaccurate they refused to refund that. I only agreed to the repair because based on the description of what needed to be done to repair the unit seemed extensive and beyond my skill set. If I didn\u2019t have to take another day off wrk (on top of the 2 I already had to for the quote and the repair) for them to come out to take back what they put in I would have gladly had them come out and take it out. Found a step by step tutorial video on YouTube and the repair is actually quite simple.\n\nService Care this type of business practice is shameful to charge such ridiculous amounts of money for simple repairs. This is flat out fraudulent and predatory. Their excuse for such high pricing basically boils down to \u201cWe use nationally recognized software to provide quotes...\u201d Translation: We do it because we CAN. Not because it\u2019s RIGHT. They knowingly charge SEVERAL hundred dollars an hr for labor for relatively simple repairs. Buyer beware and be sure to do your research first. This repair could have been easily DIY and done for $35 bucks in parts and a Phillips head screwdriver.\n\nThe owner himself discourages buying parts off Amazon in his response but the Service Care website  actually contains a link that customers can use to buy \u201ccheap\u201d OEM replacement parts...from Amazon. :l\nAgain, a total scam, folks. Stay clear of this place.  Had I not questioned my order I would have been duped.  This is supposed to be a repair that the company does \u201chundreds\u201d of times but no one from company realized I was over charged by several hundred dollars (not a few dollars but several HUNDRED dollars) until I said something about it. Had I went to Publix to buy a gallon of milk and it rang up for $50, the cashier would have instantly thought, \u201cHuh...it\u2019s usually $3.99. Something must be wrong.\u201d Not Service Care. They will take your money and run without thinking twice about it. They still refuse to refund my in-home quote fee for a quote that was inaccurate.\n\n*Technician\u2019s name removed from review at the request of the owner", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1559075893140, "text": "Hi, I'm sorry you were so unhappy with your experience, and I can see why. The technician made a technical error while building your quote. Instead of quoting for a pack of 4 rollers, he quoted for four 4-packs of rollers. The pricing software that we use thought we were replacing those parts 4 times, which increased the quote. (We would be happy to send you a copy of the original quote, which included the 4 rollers, not one). I feel certain that we would have caught that during our billing process, but we appreciate you calling us so soon after your repair to let us know. We're issuing you a refund for the difference.

I also could not find that part for $9 on Amazon. This is a full heater assembly replacement part that includes the heater element, heater housing, and two replacement thermostats and can not be found on Amazon that cheaply.
