It was failure after failure, and I have never before been subjected to such poor customer service.  That\u2019s the short version.\n\nThis is the full story. I ordered (and paid for) delivery from Asian Rim through Yelp Eat24 and, after waiting an hour and a half without getting any food or as much as a phone call, I called the restaurant directly to ask when I could expect my meal. I was informed by Colton that there was no order because they don\u2019t associate with Yelp Eat24 at all. Understandably, this freaked me out and lead me to believe I had been scammed. I then called Yelp Eat24 and demanded a refund after telling them what Colton had said. While they did quickly offer a me a refund (which \u2013side note-- I won\u2019t be getting for \u201cup to 5 business days\u201d), they were adamant that they did in fact work with Asian Rim and that their restaurant had actually already confirmed the order before I had called. I was still falsely placing my faith in Asian Rim at this time.\n\nAfter hanging up with Yelp Eat24, I hurriedly called my bank to inform them that I might have falsely been charged. All of this was quite time consuming and anxiety inducing. On a whim, I decided to call Asian Rim back again and relay to them the information I had been given by the representative at Yelp Eat24 for their own benefit. That\u2019s when Colton then informed me that they did actually work with Yelp Eat24 after all. He just hadn\u2019t known a third party, Backdoor, was also involved and it was their name coming up in his system. He unapologetically told me the food I had originally ordered would be at my house shortly.\n\nBut was it? No. So after even more time elapsed, I called Asian Rim a third time to ask what was going on. I was told by a different person that I should \u201cjust try calling Backdoor.\u201d I had to flat out demand to be told if the food had at least left Asian Rim yet. She finally said \u201cyeah.\u201d No apologies were given and I was rushed off the phone.\n\nThen I called Backdoor and was told that they did pick up the food from Asian Rim, but then realized the order had been cancelled. Aside from the refund Yelp Eat24 says they will give me, no other amends have even been attempted to be made. To reiterate-- his whole ordeal lasted about 3 hours from the time I placed and paid for the order to the time I was definitively told that there was no food coming. To say this place, and Colton specifically, handled this poorly is an understatement. I adamantly advise everyone reading this to refrain from ordering from Asian Rim.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889179da3445e5b:0x39c8686e22b7dc4c"}

As soon as the drinks were delivered, we placed our order from the lunch menu, which may be limited compared to the dinner menu.  I ordered the Thai ice tea and Pad Thai chicken and my wife ordered the Big Bowl Tom Yum Kai Sab noodle soup.  Our meals were delivered in a relatively short time and were very good.

Pad Thai is my favorite dish so I eat it at almost every Thai restaurant I visit and this version was very good but not great \u2026 it seemed like something was missing.

I ordered the mild curry chicken for lunch and took home ginger chicken for dinner.

I figured after my pedicure I'd pick up an early dinner to take out to go home and eat. People were inside consuming their meals and the door was open, so I walked in and began to ask for a menu to order food to go. I was sadly informed they close every day Mon-Fri at 3pm-4pm of course I quickly looked at my watch and saw it was 315pm. I said well can I place an order to go not to dine in and she kindly told me no. I walked back out to see if maybe I missed the sign on the door in eager to please my palate. But NOPE no sign! Nothing by the posted hours, no temporary window sign, no sidewalk sign NOTHING! I was even more upset because this is all I wanted and I was only 10 minutes away from hotel hut there was no way I was waiting another 45 minutes to order after being pampered. I walked in and stated I'm not from the area and I'm not sure how many regular customers you have that just know you're closed for an hour daily but it would be nice if you placed a sign on the door for notice to the public.

She said it was just a fried banana, so we tried it (didn\u2019t care for it, but that\u2019s beside the point). Fast forward to half an hour later when we\u2019re standing in Target and I realize my boyfriend has broken out in hives. I scoured the menu and found out that that fried banana (which was actually under the dessert menu and, again, not mentioned anywhere under the dish we ordered) also contained\u2014SURPRISE!\u2014coconut.\n\nThey are so unbelievably lucky that the hives weren\u2019t more severe or we would have absolutely pursued legal action.

There are so many Menu options, but more than that the food is genuinely Thai. The owner, who I absolutely adore, is from Thailand and she told me she never cooks anything out of a can, everything is fresh to the table. She actually imports certain foods from Thailand because she wants her food to be as authentic as possible. And you can tell Her and her daughters make the food with love. I hate that the pandemic lessened  their business. If I could do it myself, I would keep them in business every day because of how amazing this food is and how genuinely sweet everyone is when you go. The restaurant is nice, has simple, elegant decor, very cozy. The booths are very comfortable. And everything is so well sanitized. My sister was visiting from Virginia on leave and I wanted to take her out for lunch before she had to go back and so we decided to try Sabai. I am so glad that we did. My sister and I fell in love with this place so we decided to take our mother there for her birthday that\u2019s coming up so we could all celebrate together before she headed back to Norfolk. My mother and grandmother loved the food, and they are very picky eaters so that speaks volumes about the quality. I have many friends and family that I\u2019ll be bringing here.
