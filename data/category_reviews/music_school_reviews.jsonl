He has been progressing very fast. Mr. Brown built him a strong foundation of learning the rhythm and beats in the music first. From there he introduced playing the melodies and chords. Mr. Brown teaches theories and techniques along with musical creativity in a balanced way. He encouraged my boy to compose a 8 measure of song in the very beginning of his lessons. Now, my son can play a children song with both hands playing chords and melodies. He comes to the piano -voluntarily-playing all the major scales, 2 octaves going up and down by himself! Mr. Brown uses many unconventional methods to teach music to his students. But they works! I have seen it from my son. Mr. Brown is also good at communication. He listens to parents' concerns and ideas to make the lessons more suitable to the child. I am pleased about my son's progress and music experience with Madison Music Academy.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1597859047058, "text": "Thank you so much for your kind words.

The next school year she made the school jazz band after 5 months of lessons. This young lady is now a music major at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. Hallmans transformed this student that had no passion for music into a musician.\nMy son played the alto sax, I noticed year after year that 7 of the 8 sax players in district band members were Hallman's students, both at the middle school level and high school levels. State honor bands were the same way, Hallman's students. One of my son's peers was awarded the top musician in the state his senior year in high school.\nAfter reading some of the other reviews here I would make the following observations:\nIf you want to put a pacifier in your kid's mouth buy a $50 instrument off Craig's list and have your kids dissatisfied and frustrated from playing an unplayable instrument, then this is probably not the place for you.\nIf Hallmans replace additional pads, it was because they presumed that you wanted an instrument that could actually be played by a student. My experience is when you think a pad or two is leaking and you fix it, you will find the next pad leaking and it was not particularity identifiable until you fix the two pads with the more significant leak.\nIf you want to raise a kid with skilled music instruction and the self esteem from being a good musician, then you have found the right place. The instructors are phenomenal.\nI was always treated fairly with the sales and service and I ended up with a highly skilled musician who I am very proud of.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626bbf454edaef:0x7eab6ee1903e8f2b"}

We are very aware that leavi g guitars plugged in drai s the battery. That was NOT the case here. We took it out and found they had installed a promotional  Progressive Insurance smoke detector battery in it. Instead of what we are used to getting, Energizer or Duracell.

I wasn't looking for anything other than to let them know that a substandard battery had been installed. When we brought it in initially, we asked for the strings to be changed and the battery replaced.

I didn't really think about writing a review after the first guitar that I bought there, but now that I have another experience from a major purchase I just had to say something to the public.\nOver the years I have also purchased smaller items because it was convenient to me to stop by and get things like cables, picks, capos, and other little odds and ends for guitar and bass that I use. This time I bought a relatively inexpensive guitar there; an epiphone Les Paul special, in the TV yellow color. I even traded another guitar towards it.  I thought they were very fair on their trade value and reasonable in their explanation of how that works. The reason I feel like I had an exceptional experience was they treated me very good even though the $ value I was spending wasn't that high. Looking back I was thinking that I don't think I could have gotten a better experience even if I had been purchasing a $2,500 Gibson! I felt like a valued customer and they answered all of my quirky questions and help me find a hardshell case that was in my budget and I am very happy with the final price and how the deal worked out.\nPlease go patronize this business. They deserve it because they work hard for their customers and they let you know if something is within their ability to produce or not. They have my business from now on because of how I was treated on this deal and looking back on other deals too. I think their prices are fair they are better than retail.

But this one man that works there is not the friendliest and makes me and my music buddy never wanna come again... I was gonna buy at least $20-$60 of stuff, and my buddy was gonna get his guitar worked on, but we decided against it after our experience today.\nMy friend and I were playing our guitars together at moderate volumes. No louder than the other customers that passed through. Our volume knobs probably were set around 1. This rude clerk guy came up to us and told us \"turn it down, there are customers in here\". When there was maybe 1 other guy in the guitar room at most. What are we, trash? Are we not customers?\nThough to be fair, there was a little kid who sat behind us who was louder than both of us combined, and he was tremolo picking the most random nonsensical annoying noise (future shredder?), but he should've told the kid to turn down\u2014not us. We both turned our amps off because he was rude the last time we were in the store and we were pretty annoyed at this point. But the kid turned his amp down and continued the random picking and the dude immediately came back and said \"hey, okay, turn it off, that's enough for today\" and took the guitar from the kid. The rudest music store clerk we've ever encountered. There's another guy who is super nice that works there who let us turn the volume up\u2014at least 2 or 3 times what we did today\u2014and test every amp in the store. We bought a $2,000 setup from the nice guy in the past, but this rude guy would probably kick us out of the store before we could make a purchase. I didn't catch his name, but he's average height, blondish, his hair is thinning, and he had a short beard. A nicer worker told us he's been there 3 years, though I'm not sure how he's lasted that long.

I started looking at some envelope filters and some guy came out of the back trying to tell me that envelope filters are only for bass players. Told him about the dead and others, and he changed his stance from \u201cauto wahs are for bass only\u201d to \u201cwell the mu-trons are for bass and the Q-trons are for guitar\u201d.\n\nFirst of all, Jerry Garcia, Trey Anastasio, Keller Williams and countless others use mu trons in their guitar rigs. Second, the Q-tron is just a pedal made by EHX that\u2019s also an envelope filter. Hell people use MXR\u2019s bass envelope filters on their guitar rigs. So the overall musical knowledge when it came to pedals wasn\u2019t very high in my experience.\n\nAlso, when I went to trade my partscaster in, the guy offered me $125 for it. I later learned that this was a pretty bad lowball, as I got offered $200 at a much smaller guitar store. At first I said $125 was fine, if he would bring the price on a boss envelope filter down from $130 to $125. The guy said no, on a five dollar difference. I ended up taking my guitar somewhere else and (thank god) getting $200 for it.\n\nI\u2019m giving this place two stars because they did have a large selection. Not a super interesting selection, but large. Also the staff was friendly, although not as knowledgeable as I\u2019d hoped.

While I'm aware they have an \"all sales final\" on used gear policy, it is their responsibility to properly inspect the gear they take in and not sell something that is damaged internally (in my case, a guitar amp). Idiot salesman also had a smug grin on his face the whole time my brother and I were having to deal with it (all 5-6 hours) and was making snooty comments back and forth. In a nut shell they sold me a dead amp and then laughed in my face about it. If this is how your business treats customers, don't expect to be a business for long. I attempted a purchase with Bailey Brothers about 8 years ago. Was not a pleasant experience. This one wasn't either. Rest assured, that's it. I will not be back.\n\nUpdate: Hey the owner called me just to prove they really do not care about customers. Tried to minimize what happened, and basically acted exactly like Keith did. Also a robotic \"I apologize but we're not going to do anything to fix it\" does not count as rectifying anything. Gee wonder why the Southside store closed! Oh yeah and if you have a bad experience with them and they don't own up to it they'll do like any typical teenager does and tries to badmouth you on Facebook, then stalk your page. Very mature. Screenshots are great though aren't they?\n\nPS: Oh and buddy, if I were mad and desperate to pay my rent, then why in the heck did I buy a $700 amp from you?

Basically, I took my brother to trade a PRISTINE first-owner amp, and we could prove it, in for a Fender Hot Rod Deluxe, used, which is of equal value....and my brother coughed up $100.\n\nI took off work to take him to initially buy the thing. I took off work to bring it in for repair when we discovered sticky crap on the power tubes, and I ended up working until 10PM thanks to these guys. They wanted me to take off work again, after having spent 5 hours in their store. I basically spoke up and said, he might be the customer, but I'm the wheelman, and I'm furious. I mentioned the fact of the wasted gas, wasted trips, and the at least 6 hours of driving they were expecting of me.\n\nThey checked OUR amp out very thoroughly, and even treated my brother like a criminal, saying they are getting his DL in case he stole it. SERIOUSLY people....\n\nI tried to talk some business sense with them, asking them to do something for the trouble, and it would not have taken much. They said no. Then I asked if they can just reverse everything since ALL of the stuff was still in the store.... The guy made up a story of a law, which actually doesn't exist, then claiming he has to charge extra to reverse it all. Guitar Center evidently doesn't know about this (fake) law.\n\nNot ONLY that, but the smug, d-bag attitude that the guy gave me when pushing my brother, his CUSTOMER aside to say \"you don't think we're trying to rip you off do you?\" He did this to put me on the spot, and tried to make me look like the bad guy.\n\nIn the end, my brother spent another $170 to get a new model. In the end, he got what he wanted, but we are both appalled by how the guy behaved to our faces. Beware, their used gear has NO warranty, but they represented at sale that they would ensure the gear works if something went wrong like the day we get it... Well... it did.\n\nYou don't take someone's $700 amp + $100 and then give them junk, and not try to do something proper after dragging someone thru hell. That's the bottom line. I tried more than the guy at this store. You won't catch us in that place again.\n\nConsidering the tens of thousands that my brother spent with other companies, Bailey Brothers missed an opportunity... Not good business. Dishonest, rude, and outright condescending.  Smiled at us when we expressed our frustration with the runaround....", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc388424995:0xdcd777d1864df053"}
