They did a drainage project for me where I explicitly described the design I wanted and it incorporated solid PVC pipe.  On the day of the job, the workers showed up with corrugated pipe.  When I called the owner, he stated that PVC would be $800 more, so feeling like I didn't want to start over with another contractor, I told him to go ahead.  Then I found out that a portion of the water to be drained to the street running from the downspout  was going through perforated corrugated pipe (pipe with holes).  They assured me that the water would be moving and would not leak out into already saturated ground (yeah, right).  Then I came home to find that the grate to catch water coming off the sidewalk was about 1 and a half to 2 inches away from the sidewalk, requiring the water to run over dirt before entering the grate.  The owner tried to tell me that it would be no problem and the bare dirt would not erode despite water constantly running over it.  I insisted that concrete be put between the sidewalk and grate to keep the water from washing out the dirt.  When I came home, I found they had used a type of caulk between the grate and the sidewalk, and had done a messy job of it, I don't know if that much caulk will ever cure.  After two days it is still soft.  Additionally, where they cut through the curb, the re-concreting was extremely poorly done.  It looked like they didn't even use a trowel, much less a curbing tool.  It looked like they basically packed the concrete on with their fingers and left it.  Part of the contract called for doing a brick border along the sidewalk.  After I paid them for the portion of the contract for the drainage, they informed me that they were waking away from the contract and that I needed to find someone else to do the edging.  The pity is, the subcontractor they had lined up to do the masonry work actually sounded very competent.  Bottom line, this is a company that, in my opinion, cut corners at every opportunity, poorly designed the project, provided shoddy workmanship, and then walked away with nearly half of the contracted work unperformed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626519de7ef85b:0x4b6cae1b92594858"}

I contracted with them to do drainage work, a sprinkler system and landscape lighting.\n\nI was told this would take 3 weeks to complete, with each phase occurring on consecutive weeks. The project as a whole took almost 12 weeks to complete, and this was only because I hounded them with calls multiple times per week.\n\nThe drainage work was the first part, it seemed to be fine, though the French drain was not placed the complete length that was discussed originally. Also the fingers of river rich were put in to stop erosion, but almost no grass seed was put in afterwards, so nothing but weeds grew in between the river rock.\n\nThe second piece was the sprinkler system. This was put in during a day, but the ground was not backfilled properly and they needed to come back out to fix it. We were told that they would put down grass seed after the lighting job was completed. The lighting work was not completed for another 8 weeks, and there wasn\u2019t any seed put down afterwards. They were also supposed to aerate and oversees the lawn, but since they could not get their mower into our backyard, they told us they would come back with a smaller mower to pull the aerator later. This never happened.\n\nI had to call them 2-3 times a week for 8 weeks to get them to complete the lighting. Part of it was landscape lighting, the other portion was putting in a fan and spotlight in/on our screened patio. The wiring was placed so shallow, that it came out of the ground within a week and they had to come back to fix. The light and fan was supposed to be put in by an electrician, but was just put in by the owner and his friend. They put a cheap conduit over the electrical wire that didn\u2019t even cover the wire.  They sent an electrician out to fix the wiring, but he just rigged another kind of conduit on the bare wire to cover it up.  The uplighting for the trees was sold to us at $65 a light. I just found the lights online for $45 for a 4-pack of lights.\n\nWe just gave up with this company and figured we would just be stuck with this work. Over the last year, I kept burying and covering up the wire as it came out of the ground and have been trying to repair the grass in the area where they did sprinkler and drainage work. We are still fighting massive weeds from the lack of follow through on planting grass after their work was completed.\n\nI am writing this review today after I just finished replacing 3 lights that stopped working and half of the wiring that was put in for the landscape lights. Turns out they believe that wire nuts are not necessary and you only need to tape wires together with electrical tape before putting it in the ground.\n\nIf you are looking for a company to do landscaping work for you, stay very far away from this company. You will only be sorry if you choose them.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1533529694432, "text": "Thank you for bringing all of this to our attention.  Unfortunately scheduling can be a challenge when dealing with different elements and sometimes issues arise.

The ceiling fan was installed by a certified electrician, as was the wiring for the fan, flood lights and outdoor switch.  We would be more than happy to provide the name of the electricians that provided these services.   The contract states that there is a year warranty covering defects in workmanship and materials.   Is regrettable that we did not have the opportunity to fix the issues that you were having with your lights, thus alleviating some of your frustration.

The backyard was approx 110 ft and open to all, no privacy. I watched the crew scalp the old lawn and graded down to a more level surface. Then they planted about 20 trees which served as a privacy fence. Mixed in a variety of bushes and plants. I could only imagine how it would look when all planting matured. They laid new sod and it looked like a picture from Home and Garden magazine.\n\nThrough the years I have visited my brother and his family and he\u2019d take me on job sites with him. I was amazed to see the complexity of installs he was undertaking. The attention to detail David gives to each install is second to none. I could write a few pages just on that subject. (But I won\u2019t) His new store AquaScapes was an overnight success. I tribute this to David\u2019s insight of products as well as knowledge of the industry. Offering fountains, fish ponds, fish of course and swimming pools from the store, has only broadened the DSLD complete landscape portfolio.\n\nI have to tip my hat to my brother and his team of professionals. His sons Zachary, Miles and Cole play a major part in this well oiled machine as they each have a part in most every install. They are dependable, punctual and treat each job as if it were being installed on their property.\n\nRather you have DSLD perform their expertise on your yard or not, you have to admire how far they have come.\n\nWishing you all continued success!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88893e19213388e5:0xeb3f3999b720c596"}

They are professionals in every sense of the word.\nThey have done multiple projects for myself and my wife.

I have a large fountain in one of the shrub beds in the front of my house. Mind you, this thing weighs like a bazillion lbs. I was recently trying to clean it out and get it ready for Spring and Summer. I accidentally let the bowl tip off the pedestal. Well, I tried to lift it up and get it back on the pedestal. I suppose I\u2019m not as young as I used to be, because I couldn\u2019t budge it. I really didn\u2019t know what to do, so I called DSLD and asked if they could come by and get this monster back on the pedestal. It wasn\u2019t more than a day later, when I got in from work when I noticed that my fountain was sitting upright, filled with water, just waiting to be plugged in. When I called Zach Sharp, ( a great young man by the way) to ask what I owed them, he absolutely refused to take a cent, saying it only took a few minutes and I could not get them to take anything for their time and trouble.

I paid them a deposit of $250. As of today, the work has not been delivered. It was promised 10 days after payment. As of today, they are 100 days past due. I posted an honest review on their Facebook page, starting off by saying I hoped I could change it to a positive review in the near future. They changed their Facebook template to not allow reviews so mine could no longer be seen. They always say they are working on my plan and they will have something in a few days. Then I don't hear from them and nothing is ever delivered. Their Facebook page has photos they post- and therefore imply that the work depicted is their own. Through reverse photo look up I found photos they had \"lifted\" from other sites and I contacted the owners. Indeed they did not have permission to use the photos and it was not their work. When I tagged the owners in the misused photos they were promptly deleted from the Elaine Roberts drafters Facebook page. One of the owners of the business from which they had plagiarized the photos of others' work, did know Jimmy Parker - one of the owners of Elaine Roberts Drafters. He told me specifics of how the owner (Jimmy) of Elaine Roberts Drafters worked for him previously and had stolen from him, and described him as one of the biggest con-men he has encountered. Perhaps occasionally they deliver a product enough to keep up an image, I don't know, but after my own experience and what I heard from Jimmy Parker's previous employer, I sure wouldn't trust him with my money again!\n\nAlso look at their other reviews. Jimmy and Christy Parker are the husband/wife team that \u201cown/operate\u2019 this business they call Elaine Roberts Drafting and Design. (These are their respective middle names.)  Previously they operated under the name \u201cCreekside Designs.\u201d I guess they had to give up on that name after they accumulated so many bad reviews. You can google it. Anyway, three of the other reviews for this business are from the owners themselves (Christy Parker, Jimmy Parker, and their old business named Creekside Designs. A fourth is from a family member - Sheila Parker. So half of the reviews contributing to their \u201c4.1\u201d rating are ones THEY CREATED RATING THEMSELVES!

I put a tarp down in my bed to help protect inside of bed (with bed liner) some and to make rock easier to slide out.  The tarp could have easily gone over the bed rails to the ground if needed.  As the man is loading rock into his loader,  I ask if I need to move my truck and to aid him in placing loader in a better spot. He shakes his head no.  As he begins to dumb rock, rocks are falling into my paint of right side of my truck causing chips and scratches to my paint job.  I had to tell him to \u201cstop and what in the hell was he thinking\u201d because he wasn\u2019t showing any signs of stopping.  I proceeded to the loader and pushed some out by my hand to ensure that wouldn\u2019t happen anymore.  I go inside and pay.  The guy comes inside and sits down behind me and when I realize he is there I recommend in the future just using the smaller tractor for the job if needed to not ensure that you are not dropping rocks on customers paint.  He then says \u201cwell that would have taken him three loads\u201c vs the one.  Well last time I checked if I owned or worked for a company, I would first off ensure absolute customer satisfaction and competitive prices to ensure a repeat customer.  It gets better, the lady that works inside proceeds to say \u201cI am the first customer to every complain about that.\u201d  They did it care to come outside and check and apologize for anything just make up excuses for how nobody has every complained before.  I am sorry for believing that I have a nice vehicle and want to keep it looking nice.  Blows my mind how folks can just say ohh well.  I will admit after that happened to my truck I was a little mad about the whole thing and was not being pleasant.  The main reason was for their lack of care or concern.  Well my ohhh well just may be to take them to small claims court.  Then they can say ohh well to a judge that says \u201cwell, it happened today.\u201d  I clearly informed them I would never be back and recommend nobody else go either.  Embarrassing for them.

I never received a formal quote on paper, just verbal.\nWhen I visited them to choose rock, we discussed the job again in detail and was never given a quote and not many notes taken on their part. I specifically mentioned how I wanted the French drain done, and they agreed and stated, \u201cthat\u2019s the only way we do them.\u201d\nI requested them to come out to my home once more, due to the initial visit being months prior and me wanting to add a couple of minor things to what I wanted done. For instance, I was told $250 for a pallet of sod and for them to lay it, but when they text me a picture of a piece of scrap paper with estimate on it, it said $325.\n-they didn\u2019t do the drain as we discussed, not separating the soil from rock in the trench. When asked to correct it (here\u2019s the kicker) I was told it would be at my expense and they threatened to rip everything up and that I\u2019d be hearing from their lawyer.\n-they put \u201croundup soaked\u201d top soil full of rocks in my front yard in places where the sod was going when specifically asked not to use that soil. In the process, tore up my front yard with their skid steer.\n-quoted me $280 in labor and material to hand dig and lay pipe 30ft or so to get drain to road due to gas lines and water lines. Here\u2019s the catch, they didn\u2019t hand dig and instead used their excavator to dig trench. Then tried to charge me $300 after telling me $280. Not to mention, why charge that much in labor to begin with, if it didn\u2019t have to be hand dug like mentioned. Also, was asked not to drive excavator in front yard, but did it anyway.\n-because they didn\u2019t do the French drain like I asked they agreed to guarantee that it wouldn\u2019t clog for 5 years. When I got the invoice, it wasn\u2019t on there like agreed upon and I asked them to write a statement. They put 4 years instead of the agreed upon 5.\n\nI wish I could make this all up, but I can\u2019t. The moral of the story, protect yourself and get everything in writing so you can hold them accountable for what is agreed upon.!These people are not professionals and do not stand by their word, mostly because I think they make it up as they go and partly because they don\u2019t write anything down (for you or for them). Seriously, who threatens to sue their customer after they messed up and wouldn\u2019t fix their mistake?

The biggest issue is that they did not mark the yard for water or sewer lines and while removing a tree they broke off a 4 foot section of sewer line. The line was several feet below the ground and we did not find out about the broken line for a few weeks. When the sewer did start bubbling out of the ground I had it repaired and contacted Tri state Hardscapes who told me \u201cwe will take care of it\u201d.  By the time they finally came to look at it, their story changed to... you can pay us $500 to fix the sod (1 pallet worth). I had recommended them to a few people but will be making calls and posting on social media about this. I am on a budget and have spent over $10,000 with this company. I gave them the opportunity to fix the issue as a pallet of grass for a landscaping company is very little to fix a problem that they caused. I guess they are just out for the dollar and not willing to make things right or worry about the customer.

I told her our yard looks horrible since it has not been cut since May 2nd and I know when they are there because of the camera. I then asked when they were going to be coming out and she said the earliest would be this Wednesday, since they were done for whichthe week. That  would have made it nearly a month which is totally unexceptable. She then told me that they have long standing customers that have to be taken care of and I responded I am a paying customer as well and she said all their customers need to be taken care of. The owner sent me a message Saturday stating the entire yard would be taken care of Tuesday. It is sad when you pay someone to do a job and it is half done or not at all. Pretty much after each time they cut our lawn I would have to call because they didn't weed eat the fence line or cut the easement as agreed upon. I will not ever recommend them or use them again.

This review is coming at the end of the only season where I used Superior. Throughout the year I wasn't impressed with the invasive weeds that continued to sprawl in the back yard. Normally I was not home when the service was rendered, but one time I stop the person doing the application. He was rather dismissive and said they would get taken care in the future weed control applications. I am not a professional lawn person(hence the reason I pay them)so I had to assume he was telling the truth.\n\nToday, I was home when he came to do the final application. The truck was out front for less than 10 minutes. I have a reasonable sized lawn, front and back and a very difficult gate latch to contend with. There is a zero percent chance that he would have been able to disembark the truck, prep his application material, mange the gate, do a proper back yard treatment, latch the finicky gate latch, do the front and tag my door in that amount of time.  Suddenly then it clicked, this is likely why the back looks terrible - other than the one time I was here with the gate open, the work has never actually been done. (Included below crab grass photos taken today - after $432 in applications you should not see an increase in the amount of weeds - these patches are 2x what they were in the spring.)\n\nIt is evident that Superior does not instill in their employees a sense of pride in their work. I've had the same person so all the applications and a reputable business would develop a culture of doing the right thing. The application person should be invested enough to actually correct the problems a customer and ask for support if needed. Clearly this is not the case with Superior. The operations manager had the approach of blaming me for not bringing it to their attention at an earlier time and after consideration, I believe he couldn't be more wrong. If the applications aren't effective, his employee should be responsible and proactive enough to address this internally and find a solution for the customer.  Obviously these are not priorities for their organization.\n\nCaveat emptor.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMy4-LTuRrGXDNNTQpAp8cJeGNZM6R6wv4XCW6a=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMho-gmsg-5oiMvEhcU7dZYQQf60m_tBAUnM0Gp=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88882b00ada4e425:0xca3738802127df8b"}

I asked/called (repeatedly) for a rep to come out and get with me to get an estimate, I wasn't even sure it needed to be pushed at all I just assumed given my gate size. I wanted someone, a supposed professional, to tell me what they thought. However, after just simply driving by quickly out front of my yard they surmised (and didn't actually call to follow up) that they wouldn't be able to service my yard. It must be nice that you have plenty of business that you can not only turn away potential new customers but also treat them poorly with poor follow through and lackluster effort. I understand the eb and flow of your operations and how you can't push mow entire yards. I wasn't sure that it required that and if it did I would of possibly still been interested in the front yard being serviced which can be completed with a riding mower. You should evaluate your business operations and how you portray the business as a veteran ran organization (with I'm assuming good order and discipline, integrity, and work ethic) because I don't see that in your company right now.\n\nAgain to be clear your representative that \"stopped by\" rolled by for 20 seconds (we are all working from home and I watched him) and surely couldn't have gathered a full sight picture. Which is weird because I asked  your office rep if I could safely talk with him (at distance) and was told that wouldn't be an issue, clear lack of follow through there as well. Also, I was interested in other services your company might have provided but in light of this entire process lacking professionalism and follow through I wouldn't be confident in ANY work you could provide.

We went out a couple of weeks later to work on leveling the area and realized that all three tree stumps were still there.

I understand that companies get busy during this season but they responded rather quickly to secure the job and aren't responding at all now to complete it and it's quite frustrating.

Called a few of the top rated companies on google and could not get a call back. Then Tahj and Pedro rolled by the house one day and handed me a pamphlet. I called them up and Mike responded quickly. Amanda at the office made the scheduling and transaction a breeze. Tahj and Dan started work promptly the day of the project and hammered out most of the clean out before lunch. After lunch Eric and Pedro joined the team and the entire crew finished the job. In 10 hours they had completely cleaned out and dug-up/removed the weeds and 12 over grown bushes from the front, back, and side beds, removed 5 stumps, cleaned out an over grown play area and had taken out 2 dying trees. By night fall, they had the yard mulched and ready for phase 2 - replanting in the spring. The following morning Tahj dropped by to mow the grass and edge the entire property, just as he had promised. You can tell Tahj gave a damn, and treated the place like his own. Eric brought the knowledge and had no problem answering my questions about plants and things while they worked. Pedro kept them honest, while Dan provided the laughs. As a veteran I appreciated that from all the guys. The price was fair for the work performed and worth every penny to us. Thank you guys for your service and for the service. Look forward to the next few phases in the coming months.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1573819430173, "text": "Mr. Nimmo, thank you so much for this review!
