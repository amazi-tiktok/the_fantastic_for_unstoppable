Thankfully, Zion Gourmet Popcorn moved into it's location and kept the sweets selection from Sallie's. Zion Gourmet Popcorn offers the same variety of fudge, chocolate treats, bagged candies, and ice cream as Sallie's did. In addition to this, they have gourmet popcorn that is air popped and made on-site. They currently offer butter, caramel, cheese, and savory white cheddar flavored popcorn. The store was redecorated but still has the \"cool candy store\" vibe that it did before. My kids and I stopped in to grab a sweet treat for their new teachers for the first day of school. We also grabbed some popcorn for ourselves and it was delicious! We will definitely return to try out the fudge, ice cream and other goodies!!
