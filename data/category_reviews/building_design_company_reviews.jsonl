I then worked with Debra on scheduling. Debra also met me at a nearby home to show me a past job they had done to make sure I was 100% happy with the colors and style we picked out. Debra also came to our home for the color consultation. Everything was very smooth. Team arrived to form the patio and then a few days later Blake and team arrived to pour the concrete. He double checked with me and my husband every step of the way to make sure it was what we wanted. It turned out amazing and I wish we would have hired them sooner.

He is professional, knows his craft, and came out to our house often. We wanted to put in a curved edge patio and he came out and measured the land, staked out the space and figured out what would work best. Our schedules didn't align at first but we made it work once we figured out a workable timeline. He came back a few more times and we discussed color of the concrete, size, dimensions, drainage, and a bunch of other details. He was patient and hear do us out, and you could tell he was excited about the project.\n\nWhen the crew showed up they were fast, professional, and methodical. They know their craft. They worked from 6am to 7pm some days, going over the details, re-laying sod, cleaning up spills or little messes (nothing major just normal stuff from the construction), and generally just making the backyard look good again.\n\nAnd the finished product is exactly what we wanted! Josh kept telling us to trust him, he had a plan, he was going to pour some creativity into our project and we wouldn't be disappointed. And he was right! Our once ugly backyard patio space now looks like something out of a magazine! The form is beautiful, it makes our yard flow, and it is just a fantastic job. I HIGHLY recommend these guys.

They are an exceptional concrete contracting company that most definitely puts the customer first.

They had to continuously answer questions and listen to our concerns but did so with nothing but professionalism. They take pride in their work and have been very professional throughout the entire process!\n\nWe went with the stamped concrete design with colors to blend well with our brick. We were unsure of the colors and how they would look next to the brick on our house, but with their experience and knowledge they were able to give us what we wanted. The colors are as close to perfect as you can get!\n\nWe've never known anyone personally that had a stamped concrete patio or have ever viewed a stamped concrete patio of this design, other than in pictures, so fully understanding the process and the amount of work it takes to build a patio, such as this, was beyond our full comprehension. It takes a lot of work, skill and somewhat of an artistic eye along with exceptional pride to produce a nice product. Foxcrete did just that!\n\nThe patio is designed with the appeal of a paver patio, but without stones that will move. The brick lined edge comes down the side walls of the patio giving it a realistic appearance of brick pavers. The colors are a mixture of browns and tans, with the brick edge being a darker color than the inner area of the patio giving it a distinct framed look. We love this design and the colors!\n\nThank you, Josh and Foxcrete Construction Group, for doing such a fantastic job on this patio!

The owner was so helpful that he gave me advise that saved me from $5,000-$8,000. He even went so far as to suggest the color of paint I need to make this project look decent. He offered to refer me to someone else who could work me in sooner than May if I did not want to follow through with his suggestions. He spent lots of time on the phone asking specific questions and was extremely knowledgeable about every single issue I had.\nHe did not make one cent from this phone call but was willing to offer many solutions to help us.\nIf I was not moving, I would hire them to re-do this entire project.\nI am extremely grateful for this company!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1521508938212, "text": "Thank you so much for taking your time out to write this!

Wife answered and advised they could come today, but we wouldn't be home, so then advised they would come on Sunday after \"Church\". Husband called back not even an hour later asking if my home was new or existing construction.  I advised existing, and explained to him my wood laminate had been damaged and we just received money from insurance company. He then told me that they are very picky about the jobs they take on and that they don't like to do existing construction because of the damage THEY could cause to cabinets, or walls. He advised me we would be too much trouble.  Kept saying how picky they are with taking on jobs...could it be that we are black and THAT'S the REAL reason?  Why didn't the Wife tell me this initially?  Guess we'll take our 15,000.00 elsewhere.

I would highly suggest Foxcrete to anyone looking to get straight forward high quality concrete work.\nWe knew we wanted stained concrete floors prior to the start of our build however by the time it came to do floors there were SEVERAL issues with the concrete; footprints, broken out concrete, gouge marks, stains from red clay & cedar.  Our builder, Eric Craig Custom Homes (Fantastic builder/excellent experience) hired another company to score & stain the floors.  My husband & I stopped by the house during the scoring process from the first company and immediately stopped work & started brainstorming with our builder about other flooring options.  Eric had Blake from Foxcrete Designs come out & take a look at our \"complex concrete job\" & give us his professional opinion on the outcome of moving forward with stain/scored.  Blake walked us through the issue spots & his remedies for those areas & gave us his opinion on what the final outcome would look like; nervously we took a chance & so glad we did!
