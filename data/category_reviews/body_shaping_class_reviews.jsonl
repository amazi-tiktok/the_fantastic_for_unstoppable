They have dropped prices and promoted new pricing because they say they care about the community but the truth is they have lost several members over the last several months due to the owner\u2019s attitude and the price is an attempt to get people back. I wouldn\u2019t go back if the membership was dropped to $50. It\u2019s just not worth dealing with him. Plus he is actively trying to sell the business without any of his customers knowing. The gym is suppose to be a place to mentally decompress and this environment does not do that.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bd7c466daaaab:0xaddfe8e82c81226a"}
