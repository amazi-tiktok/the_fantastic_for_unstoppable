The Greek rice was just fair, the Greek fries were just fries with seasoned salt, and I asked for no onions in my gyro and it came covered in them. There is no soda fountain station so you have to order bottled water or cans of soda. No cups, ice, or straws. Would not be very kid friendly at all. The food came in a brown paper bag which looked nothing like the pictures of food we saw on social media. No plates.\nThe one thing we agreed was good was the whipped feta appetizer. Very tasty.

Because of the great reviews, my husband and I visited Cafe Doner Box.  We left extremely disappointed.  We visited yesterday afternoon, June 16, 2018.  A tall gentleman took our order.  While we waited, I had my back turned towards the counter and my husband said, \"Did you see what he just did?\"  He explained that the gentleman who took our order grabbed half of a cookie off of the cookie tray, turned his back towards us, and shoved it in his mouth.  At first I thought my husband was joking, but soon after the gentleman walked over to the window between the front and the kitchen and handed the cooks the bowl of sliced tomatoes from the front display case.  I saw him wipe his nose on the back of his hand, then upon returning the tomatoes to the case, he put his hand in the bowl, grabbed a sliced tomato and popped it into his mouth!!!  I watched him like a hawk afterwards to make sure he didn't touch anything but my tray between the window and the counter.  My husband was like, \"Hey, he is not preparing our food, so I relaxed a little.\"  I was hoping the food would be good, but it wasn't.  The salad that came with my falafel plate was semi-watery and had no flavor, nor did this taziki sauce (I didn't touch the tomatoes).  The meat on the doner plate was OK, but we were surprised that it did not come with pita bread or anything.  The hummus was OK, but I've had much better.  We definitely will not be returning.
