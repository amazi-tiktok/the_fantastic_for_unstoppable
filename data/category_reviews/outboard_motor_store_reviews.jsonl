I sent in a request a request on 5/19/18 to Daivd at outboard repair and salvage for him to honor a receipt for a 200 hp Mercury outboard motor. I had problems with it from day one.  They kept it for over a month and still wasn't fixed. I took it to Steel Creek Marine who is a certified Mercury outboard repair dealer.   They told me that it was not a 200 hp motor but a 150 hp. Big difference.  THAT'S FRAUD. He also said it had major problems and need to be rebuilt.  I have a written statement of the inspection.  So I spoke to David of Outboard Repair and Salvage.  He stated he would replace it.  I dropped of my boat to get the new motor exchanged.   I asked him to please have it fixed by the end of the week.  I called on that Friday and he said he was looking for one.  Then I called several times to see if the boat was ready but I got no answer.  I finally got someone to pic up on Friday 6/30/18. TWO WEEKS LATER!! They said David would have to call me back. He called back and left 2 messages. 1 saying he was still looking for a motor. Another saying that he found one and would have it ready by Monday which was 7/2. I have the recorded messages.  I called to check on it and the secretary now says it will be another week.  Unfortunately I have waited and waited and waited.  ITS NOW 7/21.  There seemes no concern in fixing this problem in a timely manner. I have lost time, money, vacation waiting for this problem to be corrected. I have missed 2 fishing rodeos that tickets were naught for including the Dauphin Island Deep Sea Fishing Rodeo. I have paid for not just tickets for the event but also for my brother I have not seen in 3 years way to get here to fish with him and my dad.
