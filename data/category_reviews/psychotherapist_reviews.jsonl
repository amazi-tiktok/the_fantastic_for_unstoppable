I was experiencing PTSD and extreme distress during my service and was admitted to this hospital\u2019s behavioral health unit twice within a year. Here\u2019s my story:\n\nThe first time I was admitted, it was voluntary...\nI was going through a lot on base, where I lived. My chain of command in the military allowed me to admit myself for a short period of time. They wanted me to get myself together and have me go back to continuing my service.\n\nThe neglect for patients here was disgusting to say the least. The staff allowed my chain of command to enter the unit without my password. They were the last people I wanted to see. I was sure that this was illegal and requested to speak to a supervisor, who told me it was my mistake for not turning them away. Being a soldier, I knew she did not understand that I could not do that and she clearly did not care about the law that her staff was breaking. This was not the only kind of neglect I witnessed/experienced. The geriatrics room was so sad. The older patients are sat down in chairs all day and night, in front of a tv. One of the older men was taken into a private room with a female tech. When they came out, he had a bloody mark on his forehead. Some of us patients noticed but felt that nobody would do anything about it. Another older gentleman in the geriatrics room died while I was there. Nobody knew the cause but he was wrapped up in a sheet and placed into a giant gray bin and wheeled away in front of all of the other patients!\n\nDuring this first stay at this hospital, there was a day where a group of student nurses were visiting to observe the staff and patients. They were observing a therapy group where the therapist was breaking HIPAA laws and verbally exposing each patient\u2019s diagnosis in front of all of the other patients, as well as the student nurses.\n\nThe second time I was admitted, I was court ordered. My command knew I was in distress and did not know what to do with me. I was sent to this hospital a second time and knew that it would not be a long stay. I was met by two giant men, telling me I have been court ordered to the psychiatric unit. I knew that something wasn\u2019t right and that the court order was not justified. This time, they admitted me to the third-floor. There were beds available on the second floor but had decided that I would be better off on the third floor. Anyone who has been to this unit, knows that the third floor is for patients with severe mental health issues... this time, there was a poster on the wall with all of the patient rights (that wasn\u2019t there before)... I read all of my rates and noticed that it said that I could request a patient advocate and a lawyer. When I approached the glass window at the desk, I requested Mary Anne, A wonderful recreational therapist that I remembered from my first stay- as well as a lawyer!... I was met with a nasty attitude and told to sit down because I was court ordered. At this point, I was panicking and angry so I threw a fit in order to get the attention of whoever was above this woman telling me to take a seat. When I got the supervisors attention, I requested that lawyer and therapist. The lawyer asked me if I had been \u201cBaker Acted\u201d but I had no idea what that meant. He pulled up my information on a computer and informed me that I had not been \u201cbaker acted\u201d and could leave anytime I wanted. I was out of there within a few hours!\n\nWhat a horrifying experience this was. The neglect and abuse here is disgusting and I would never EVER recommend anyone admit themselves to this hospital!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88928d9733f9a99d:0xdd43af3d45a5a602"}

Perhaps my previous doctors were influenced by the labels and words used to describe some of my symptoms which caused them to think I didnt need this form of treatment.. I dont know but there are medicines that will help you that you may never have heard of like me.\n\nIt actually makes my brain WORK the right way Versus just numbing it, and covering over the problem .\n\nI am now in a position that I am safely tapering off the medication that I dont truly need to be on(faster than I thought I could) and put that \"mistake\" in the past and I am focused on my life and my future for the first time in years.\n\nNever give up hope! Dont settle for bad help or mediocre treatment that just helps you \"get by\" each day as long as you have your \"meds\"\n\nIf you not thriving or on a path too it dont settle like I did for way too long.\n\nDont assume you know the only things that will work for you and be TOTALLY honest with the Dr so he can help you .\n\nIm even getting back into old hobbies and my next new career goals and even back into My Faith in God.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling please take this as a message of hope that its never too late and never hopeless.\n\nGod Bless and Thank you to Dr. Islam and Thanks to President Trump or whoever in the Government made this Tele-Medicine / new video conferencing option available. Without it I may never have found Dr. Islam.\n\nThank You Dr. Islam\n\nSincerely,\n\nMatt", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923d657d7a777:0xd29d293725d9d7a7"}
