The drive through was closed today so I entered the store (not wanted to go inside trying to keep my husband as well as I can) the cashier, when I asked,  told me the pharmacy  was closed I asked to speak with the manager. The shift manager  can out and I asked him why the pharmacy  was closed he said someone  in the pharmacy tested positive  for COVID-19.  I told him I must have my husband's  prescription because  he could end up in the hospital  without it. His answer  was that he didn't  know when the pharmacy  would open back up and they were having the store cleaned  tonight by a professional cleaning  co. So what is a person to do if they depend  on a medication that they have a prescription for and can't  get it from the co. they have trusted to fill that prescription? The shift manager at 4:10 PM Tuesday  answer  was to call the doctor and get a new prescription sent to another store. I guess he doesn't  realize how difficult  it is to get intouch  with a doctor and a doctor at that time of day. Wouldn't  you think that the owner of this pathetic excuse  for a pharmacy would have had an emergency  plan in plan? We have been dealing with this Virus  for many months and a company this large should have a disaster plan in plan for just this type  of scenario. Pathetic. Everyone of my friends  has had a horrible  experience  with this store. We are going to flood the social media sources and expose  this company for who they are. They care nothing about the people  that keep them in business it's  all about money to this owner. Would you not think that they would close the whole store if someone  tested positive for COVID-19 I mean do they think that the virus decides to stay in one area of the store. Do they think that people  don't  go in there and touch products  before they go to the pharmacy. Just an example the bottom  line is money not care. Even Sonic  hamburger restaurant in Leeds Al. closed completely when one of it's employees tested positive and they sell burgers. The Walgreens in Leeds Al. Is absolutely  the worst pharmacy  in Leeds. You would think if they cared they would have had a disaster plan in place and they could have contacted all patrons that have life sustaining medications of the situation and where they could pick up their medication. There are many other drug stores  in Leeds and the surrounding area. I encourage  everyone who has had a dangerous experience with this co.to stop using  them and contact the head office.

I have been a loyal Walgreens customer for at least 20 years, and have used Walgreens on the east coast, the west coast, and in between.  I\u2019ve never had any issues with any other Walgreens as I have at this store.\n\nTo begin with, I\u2019ve experienced phone wait times for up to an hour.  I just gave up on calling\u2026I go directly to the pharmacy and wait to speak to the pharmacist.  I take a lot of meds, and there are times I have to personally request the pharmacy to fill certain prescriptions, as Walgreens online won\u2019t allow me to electronically file certain scripts. Luckily I\u2019m not far from the pharmacy, and driving over is no big deal for me. If you need to talk to someone in the pharmacy, just save yourself the frustration of calling.\n\nI used to be a Job Coach, so I didn\u2019t just want to hate this pharmacy\u2026I wanted to understand what the problem was (is).  The problem is, they are always extremely busy, and maybe understaffed.  There have been times I have visited the store when there were at least 15 cars in line for the pharmacy; the line being wrapped around the building.  In addition there were also times where there were up to 10 people in line at the pharmacy.   I\u2019ve sat and watched the employees working, and they are all working like crazy.  Nobody is on their phones, no one is standing around talking\u2026they all seem to be working just as hard as they can.  In addition, I\u2019ve always been treated with the level of kindness and professionalism that made me a loyal Walgreens customer many years ago. When I\u2019ve been there I\u2019ve heard the phone ringing constantly.  But In the pharmacy employees\u2019 defense\u2026they are so overwhelmed with customers in the store, no one has time to answer the phones.\n\nWalgreens, if this pharmacy is understaffed, help them find some more employees!  There are a ton of people who depend upon this pharmacy for their medications.  Help this pharmacy to be better!\n\nSincerely, an extremely loyal Walgreens customer.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccea8b57332c1:0xcebb8fff287cdf42"}

They were always on top of ordering one of my  meds they didn't stock regularly, and having it for me by the next day, even if the next day was Saturday, whereas at CVS, I had to wait until a certain day of the week, usually Tuesday I think, to get it. One disadvantage is that they don't store coupons on file, so if you have a coupon, e.g., for a brand-name medication, you need to bring it with you every time you fill it.

It was a little after 8am today and I was picking up my husband's medicine that required (2) IM needles to administer.  I always have to ask for these everytime. These people know it's a vial of medicine that I have been getting for months and months now and yet they never say do you need needles with that? So like all the times before I ask for needles and was told by a nice fuzzy male red headed pharmacy tech we have no needles. I said yet you sold me medicine that requires needles and yet you have no needles to sell me. The pharmacist lady obviously overheard our conversation and chimed in that CVS and Walgreens have been contracted to give the Covid vaccine to all nursing home people so all of their needles will be going to that. She then informed me that I could go to and I quote \"Mom and Pop\" drug store and they would be able to help me with the 2 needles that I need. I said my prescription card is CVS caremark and you send me mail telling me if I shop anywhere else but you, that the prices will be higher because I'm not using you and yet you sell me medicine I can not use because you have no needles. She said covid vaccine is our top priority right now. I said wow I thought the customer would be your top priority. She said you obviously dont understand the importance of this. I informed her I do. I'm a healthcare worker but what I dont understand is I've been asking for these needles long before a vaccine came out. How do you sell me medicine but no means to administer it. Is that what you tell people with their insulin. I'm changing our pharmacy to another pharmacy (NON CVS and NON Walgreens).

I would frequently go in the store, which is right near my home and I would find a bell that said \u201cring for service\u201d.  No one would come when I would ring the bell. I had to go hunting for someone to purchase my items.  There would be nobody at the front and nobody in sight; I would holler \u201chello, hello\u201d and nobody would respond.  I finally found someone and asked who was the manager and was told the manager was Jimmy Jackson.  Every employee in there that has been fired and then rehired or hired in the first place has been rude, obnoxious and very unhelpful in every way. The shelves are always I stocked. When I go in to get my cat litter there is never any on the shelf; and I\u2019ll ask if they\u2019ll go back in the back, after they huff and puff, they will and come back and say \u201ctruck day is tomorrow.\u201d When they say truck day is tomorrow it\u2019s always on a different day.\nAs I went in there four days later, the shelves  were the same and they still did not have my cat litter. I politely asked the gentleman behind the counter if they had any in the back. The young lady behind the counter next to him said \u201cshe\u2019s always like this\u201d to another customer who was standing next to me.

I thought, she must be tired because she didn't look too good. I paid for my medication and walked out of the pharmacy. I went back to my place and noticed half the prescription was missing! I thought that's strange half my medication is missing and I just left the pharmacy that's never happened before, so I assumed it was probably a mistake.  When I finally got in contact with the pharmacy, I explained what happened and a woman responded saying she needed to check their records. After a few seconds she comes back on the line to tell me their counts for the prescriptions were accurate and she couldn't do anything about it. I said, I will come up there with the prescription bottles to discuss this! Then she proceeds to tell me she's the Pharmacy's Manager. At this point, I was getting upset! I told her this pharmacy charged me FULL price for a months supply of prescriptions then only gave me half of it. I told her, I had to pay out of pocket for this and I want to be reimbursed.  She continued to say there's nothing she could do.  Well, that's just too bad, because for a \"Manager\" not to even attempt to investigate  problems when a customer is genuinely upset and telling the truth about a bad experience just baffles me. Why isn't this manager more concerned that a technician took someone elses medicine from the pharmacy's safe and then falsifed records to get away with it?! She's kept saying there's nothing she could do. Really?! Why don't you fire the employee, so this doesn't happen again.

BTW there was an issue with the script that I couldn't have fixed myself. I call a few days later to see if my pills are ready but the rx# changed during the transfer so I couldn't check if it was ready on the automated system. When I talked to a tech over the phone again it was just get the app. When I told her the app wasn't helping me do what I needed and I was tired of hearing about their stupid app she pretended she couldn't hear me by saying hello twice and hanging up on me.

I take one prescription a month which is a schedule three or four narcotic I believe. I go to my doctor and he writes my new prescription every 28 days. I take two a day which equals 56. I drive almost two hours to this doctor and live in a rural area that never has this medicine so I always stop at this Walgreens and every time they tell me they can\u2019t fill it until the next day or I have to wait two days even tho my doctor schedules my next appointment on the exact day my medicine runs out. For example I got my prescription filled there last month on 2/5/20. Went yesterday after my appointment to fill my script for this month which ran out yesterday. Waited in traffic and in line for over 20 minutes only for the cashier to tell me she can\u2019t fill it until tommorow. I didn\u2019t even waste my time explaining to her that I couldn\u2019t turn around and drive two more hours again the next day or that my medicine ran out yesterday so technically I could have gotten it filled two days early as per the narcotic laws. I\u2019m not sure if she dosent pay attention to the quantity and counts thirty days or she just dosent care to actually read the directions on the prescription. This is also a medicine that if I don\u2019t take it causes extreme withdrawals so I ended up having to drive 30 plus miles out of my way and wait two to three days for another pharmacy to fill it. Got home and called and asked them via the phone if I was eligible to get it filled yesterday and the lady said yes. Needless to say these people don\u2019t understand that some of these medicines are people\u2019s lifeline and they don\u2019t understand the danger and inconvenience of having to drive all around the country and risk your health all because they can\u2019t take twenty seconds to read a prescription look up last day it was filled and count 28 days. Drove 30 miles to another pharmacy keep in mind another WALGREENS pharmacy and they told me I could have gotten it filled Sunday. Done with Taylor road.

Especially the one in Petersville anf the young, rude, General Manager, named C. SAMPSON who doesnt have any fairness nor any real decency in True Customer Service. To Social Media i go. Over and over and i dont mind driving the few extra miles to the Florence location or even Muscle Shoals-just to avoid being upset or treated like scum.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d37fd47eed101:0xe9239fb304e28a1"}

I sent prescriptions for an antibiotic and pain medication for the patient. The patient called me after hours stating that the pharmacy wouldn\u2019t allow her to have the narcotic and that I needed to call them myself to verify the prescription. When I spoke with the pharmacist on staff, she berated me for trying to transfer a controlled substance from another Walgreens. I questioned if her e-prescribe was comparable with my dental software, and she basically told me to kick rocks. The prescription ended up going through, but from the sounds of it, she was also very rude to my patient. For someone whose job is literally to help patients obtain medication in order to feel better, this pharmacist clearly had no interest.  Disappointed in the care given to someone clearly in pain and not drug-seeking. My patient is not the first person in the world to have ever had a toothache while away from their regular dentist.

My wife had surgery and we dropped off 5 prescription slips at around  1645 We were told it would be ready at 1830.\n\nWe went to the store at 1830 we were told that they had not been filled any of the prescription and to have a seat, 30 min later they said there was an issue with one of medications and they would have to call the doctor in order to fill the pain medication. I provided them the doctor number which they didn't call, I left the store and got ahold of the doctor who inturn called the store. After talking with the store he then called back at 2032 and said that everything was straightened out and that they would fill the prescription. Went back to the store at at 2103 they had asked if we could come back in 15 min that they just got off the phone with the Doctor (which was a false statement they had gotten off the phone around 30 to 40 min prior). Finally got the pain prescription around 2133. The surgery was over at 1200 and was able to take first pain meds at 2140. Every interaction I had with them they acted as if did not care. When I asked questions they seems extremely bothered and annoyed that I would even inquire on what the issue was. I just hope that another consumer doesn't have to go through what we went through.\n\nI would STRONGLY recommend not using this walgreens to get a prescription filled especially if you are counting on them for customer service (a caring attitude and a quick filling of a prescription). It is truly just the employees that work in the pharmacy.(I was not the only person that was struggling with getting medication, I witnessed two our families having issues as well).\n\nTo be fair the rest of the store clerks I worked with were extremely helpful and polite. I normally don't make comments but it was so bad I really hope nobody else has to go through this type of treatment.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cce7a109fb2a9:0x6628eef08dde343a"}

The staff at the pharmacy informed me to call my insurance and make sure something was not incorrect and were very patient while I did so. This was all happening at the end of their shift. The new co-pay was the correct amount and luckily my family was able to help cover the cost. Fast forward to a few days later and I received a phone call from Walgreens patient care. The pharmacy staff had contacted them on my behalf to enroll me in to a co-pay assistance program through the medication manufacture. The new total monthly cost would be $20! They also applied the discount to the original refill and I was able to give my family back the money I had borrowed to cover the medication. I am truly thankful to the staff at the Fort Payne, AL location for all the help and kindness they showed an out-of-towner.

Be sure to pat them on the head as you go inside. The pharmacist and the entire staff are very knowledgeable and offer any assistance almost before you know you need it. They stock most medication that a chain-type pharmacy stocks - if they don't have it, they will have it the next day. Another reason I love this place is because unlike a chain-type pharmacy, they carry peripheral things that small-town country people like and need - not a bunch of make-up, groceries, toys, As Seen on TV items, and other stuff that just drains one's bank account. They do, however, have a very good selection of greeting cards, a small selection of local arts and crafts, a fair selection general purpose off-the-shelf  remedies, vitamins, pain relievers, and some surprise goodies.

I have had just a few minor negative experiences during this time. Most of the time I was comfortable with the service. Today was a different story. I called about an hour before they closed to finalize 2 scrip. orders. I called at this time because I had tried several times in the past week and today to get thru to someone on the phone, but had too long of a hold time each time. I thought it might be less busy at 7pm. The woman who answered, who I believe was the pharmacist on duty, had a disrespectful tone a couple of times during the call. I mentally excused her then drove to pick up my orders almost immediately. When I arrived the assistant, who was one of the distasteful encounters I've witnessed in the past, was working the drive thru. I told her I needed the pills cut in the required dose which I'd gotten done many times before without problems. It usually doesn't take very long to do as well. I went to wait across the lot when I saw a multitude of cars arriving at the drive thru right before closing time. 15 or so minutes had elapsed and it was closing time by that time so I decided to drive back over to the window to pick up my meds. When I arrived the tech ignored me for about a minute or 2 and then she mouthed something to me without the microphone and immediately walked away out of my sight. I could not make out what she said, of course. I continued to wait patiently. Within that time the pharmacist walked over and in a scolding tone told me to tell her ahead of time I needed them cut. I informed her I did not because I was informed in the past not to do that because I must pay for them before they are cut. She then continued her scolding by telling me \"Well it's just so late.\" Omg...are you not still open for business when I arrived 15 to 20 minutes prior? And it doesn't take that long to cut them.

That night I called and spoke with a lady and asked her what time my meds would be there, cause I was going to Florida at 9am the following medicine, she said it would be after 10am. I told her I was leaving to go to Florida at 9am the next day. I then asked \"why is it taking so long after you ordered it to come in? She said it's because it's a narcotic. So I went on to Florida.

NO MEDS!!!!!!!!! She had not explanation on invoice of why meds did not come in!!!!!

Mr. Witten  was rude from the start. When I explained about the return he cut me off with a terse \"calm down.\"  Had he let me finish he would have known that I wanted to see if they carried the actual item I wanted and I could do an exchange. However, I never got that far because Joe followed up with more mature declarations of  \"it's not my fault you got the wrong thing\" and \"I didn't do it\". So now I am just looking  wide-eyed and gape-mouthed at this pudgy man getting all worked up over a return for SKIN MOISTURIZER.  Mind you,  the item was unopened, still in the original packaging, with the receipt and was within the return period and this guy is giving off all kinds of micro-aggressive vibes like I have done something wrong. I felt super uncomfortable as the store was full of people who could all hear this man lose his composure over a return.  He asks for my driver's license TWICE  which I understand if a receipt is not present but again, I had a valid receipt. When he  finally gets around to processing the return Joe gives me a CVS Gift card and tells me it's a money card. I have never returned anything to CVS before so when I ask him how to use it he admits that it can only be redeemed at CVS.  I point blank ask him why he didn't process the refund per the original method of payment  (my bank card) he smirks at me and says \"alright, alright, I said I would take care of it.\"  He then processes the return to my card but botches the transaction and ends up having to give me a partial cash refund.\nI will NEVER, EVER, EVER  go to CVS again! It is my opinion that Mr. Witten  needs to be terminated  but at the very least he needs some time away from that store to undergo re-training.

When i gave the pharmacist my prescriptions I told him that I had Good RX coupons on my phone and tried to show him but he just walked off so I thought everything was ok. When I was called back to pay one of the meds was almost 50 dollars than the coupon rate. When I questioned the price the Pharmacy Tech rolled her eyes and started popping her gum in my face. The Pharmacist then said I told him I had the coupon but did not give a card, Good RX is an app, so i didn't get the discount. So i showed the tech the coupons and she told me she didn't need them she could just do it herself. She told me that it would be another 10 minutes and when I questioned why such a long time to change the price they refused to fill the medicine and returned my paper prescriptions. I asked to speak to the store manager and was informed by the Tech that he was not there so at this point all i could do is leave.\n\nOnce home called back to the store to get the pharmacist and technicians names and licences number. Well the store manager answered the phone. He then preceeded to tell me that he could not give that information until I told him that it was a matter of public record and that if it was not posted in plain view that they were committing a crime. So when he finally gave me the pharmacist's name , Charlie, i filed a complaint with CVS and the state pharmacy board.\n\nAlso I called around to 2 other CVS stores to check cash prices and found out that he was going to charge me more than the other stores.\n\nIt is no wonder that BCBS of Alabama will no longer deal with CVS.\n\nI would avoid doing this store at all costs in the future.

It's a pharmacy, first and foremost in the business to take care of a patient's needs by filling doctor prescribed medication for sick people. That alone should mean the employees will be kind, considerate, and have the patient's best interest at heart, which requires a certain level of customer service skills. I can honestly say, this is by far the WORST customer service experience I've ever had, in ANY industry! From the pharmacist herself to the tech working the counter, they are the rudest people I've encountered! My particular issue began with a refill which I called in back in August. Once I received a text that it was ready for pickup, I drove over to collect it, only to be told once I got there that the RX was not ready and the drug was not in stock. The tech argued with me about being notified that it was ready until I showed her the text message and then she had nothing to say. I was then told they would call me when the drug was back in stock and my RX had been filled. Three weeks went by and no word so I drove back over to check on it. This time, I spoke with the pharmacist who literally could not be bothered with my questions about when I might be able to get my prescription. She said it was ordered from the 'warehouse' and that they would call me when it came in but if I didn't want to wait, I could go somewhere else and get them to transfer the RX. I opted to wait. Huge mistake! Yesterday, while picking up 2 other prescriptions, I inquired about my refill on backorder. I explained everything that had taken place thus far to the tech and gave her my previous RX bottle for informational purposes. She checked on the computer and said 'this RX has already been filled.' And so I say to her, no, as I so painstakingly explained, it was never filled because you were out of the drug and could not fill it and I've been waiting for you guys to call me when it came in. Immediately she became combative! Then she tells me that, yes, they have the drug in now, BUT, I can't have it because 'oh look, this refill expired a few weeks ago.' Umm. No, it didn't 'expire,' it's been in your system awaiting the restock of the drug! She very rudely tells me that I'll have to go see my dr (and pay the $30 copay,) and obtain a new prescription.
