The have a large showroom with all sorts of options to look at and interact with. We liked how they had multiple tv's playing both the testing videos as well as installation videos. If you don't know which questions to ask you may end up like some of the folks who left negative reviews. For example, the shelters have placards on them showing the total cost including taxes and installation. However, as others have mentioned sometimes a wrecker needs to be involved. It wasn't until I started asking questions about these possibilities before we learned the real cost of installation. They need to know what your driveway looks like because if it's not mostly flat, they won't be able to use only a simple pallet jack to move the unit around. Therefore, a tow truck with a boom needs to be hired in order to get the shelter off the flatbed and into the garage. The good news is they'll help coordinate this and said it usually only costs about a 100 give or take 50.\n\nUltimately, we ended up going with Valley Storm Shelters because of their system to secure the unit to the ground.

However, after they had my money their Customer Service declined quickly.\n\nI gave them a 2 because their product seems to be very durable. They had videos all over the warehouse and explained the whole installation process. They also had videos showing why their product was \"the best\".\n\nWhy I unfortunately don't believe they deserve more than that. They called to schedule to come out 3 different times. Each time they would cancel the night before where my husband has already taken off work. Each time it was the same excuse of \"a part hasn't come in yet\".  I reached out to the manager and said it was fine just schedule when the part came in. Like I said this happened 3 times. I mentioned that we felt like we should be compensated travel fee ($375/ thousands we spent on shelter) for the trouble this has caused my husband with taking off. We were told multiple times they would call and we would have to reach out to the manager days later.\n\nThe final straw... They called to schedule the shelter (4th time) and stated they would be there at 3. My husband works over an hour away and planned to be home by 3. The manager told us he, personally, would call when they left Huntsville to ensure my husband had enough time to get home. We got a call when they were 10 minutes away from our house at 12:58. I called the manager to let him know they would have to wait an hour until my husband got home because they didn't give us our promised heads up and he has not returned my call. I have reached out to him by phone 3 times and texts 2 times so I could pass the information on to the supervisor to ensure no one else has this issue and have not received a call.\n\nI have 3 families planning to get a shelter I have directed elsewhere because of the unfortunate experience we had.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626ee910b39a7b:0x998c1f4476ce6404"}

I studied above ground shelters both online and in person for months and every time I kept coming back to Valley. There is no one who builds & installs such structurally sound shelters anywhere in my opinion. The key is not only the quality of the construction but also the exclusive Valley method of installation, core drilling the slab and installing the carbon steel rods thru the foundation and then also utilizing the Hilti bolts.

The first person we spoke with quoted a price of $1,000.- $1,049. max. As it got nearer to our closing, we called and spoke with him again, verified the amount, and asked that he e-mail us the quote.  We then received an e-mail showing a price of over $800.00 more.  When we balked, they were able to \"get it down to\" $1,424.  We were unhappy about the increase but accepted the higher price and scheduled the date and time for the move, which was to be between 9-10 am today. The installers arrived at 10:30 (understandable due to traffic) and informed us that they must have a wrecker to get the shelter moved onto their trailer.  They called their usual guy (who was a good 40 minutes away from us) but his truck was broken.  They had to get another wrecker lined up and we are still waiting for him as I type this review, two hours later. Why Valley would not have had the wrecker lined up ahead of time is beyond me.  Add to these issues the fact that the CORELOCK system that Valley loves to advertise, that we  requested both by phone and in writing, and that was supposedly included in our price quote is not even available on older shelters. Nobody bothered to relay this information to us even after we supplied them with a purchase date.  We contacted Derrick Owens at the Huntsville store to let him know how upset we were. He apologized and offered to contact the owner, Tim Richardson, and then call us back.  Instead of offering any kind of discount or apology, Mr. Richardson's response was to call the installers himself and tell them not to do a thing without  payment from us upfront and stating that, if they did, they would be fired.  What a guy! As it stands now, we are still waiting for a wrecker.\nI will be waiting until this job is completed to post my review for fear that, if I do, the shelter won't get moved at all.  The bottom line is this, I will NEVER again use this company and I will warn through reviews and word of mouth anyone I can reach about my experience with them. Just awful.\nUpdate:  The shelter is now installed but my anger and disappointment have not subsided.  The only, and I do mean only, good thing I can say about this company is that the installers, Dakota and Daniel were as nice and professional as could be.

The quality of the shelters really is easy to spot.

I spent about a year doing my own research on tornado shelters and tornado safe rooms. I even spoke with Texas Tech University, who pioneered the certification process for safe room designs...they even spoke highly of this company. I couldn't feel more safe and have the piece of mind that I do without their product. After living through the monstrous EF-4 tornado in Tuscaloosa, AL during the superoutbreak of 2011, you have to set the bar high for me. What sold me on their above ground model is the Corelock anchoring system. My particular shelter is secured at thirteen different anchoring points; four of which utilize the Corelock system. This anchoring system uses four twenty-four inch Corelock anchor bolts embedded in 2-3 inches of solid concrete. The quality and strength of these shelters is obvious.\n\nAll of the staff I spoke to when touring the showroom were very informative and answered all of my questions and concerns. I could tell they were committed to selling me safety and not worried about the profits. They were all genuinely vested in my peace of mind, safety, and satisfaction.\n\nThe installation crew arrived at my home on time, ready to work. They were very friendly and personable, but didn't not stray from the job. They kept the work area very tidy and removed all rubbish from the work site. Overall, the total installation took about 3-4 hours.

I specifically chose an upper end cabinet company because I wanted everything done correctly the first time, but that is not the kind of quality WF keeps. In short, save yourself the money and go with Lowe's, kitchen remodels will be painful either way.\n\nThe long story.\n\nWe put in our order months early because we knew there had been issues getting wood due to COVID. They arrived about when their ETA said it would, however one of the particularly custom cabinets was delayed because it was rejected by quality control. The contractor was able to install the rest of the cabinets while we waited, then installed the custom one as soon as it arrived, only to realize it's a completely different color than the rest of our cabinets.\n\nHere's a summary of the issues:\na) Miscoloration on the tall cabinet\nb) Miscoloration on the island cabinet\nc) Miscoloration on the basecovers\nd) Missing the base on one of the drink bar cabinets\ne) Missing the sink front tray\nf) Crack in the upper drink bar cabinet\ng) Misalignment of closed door on upper cabinet\n\nI mentioned these issues to my sales rep who had a representative from WF come to inspect the issues. They showed up an hour earlier than they said they would, which meant that I was running a meeting instead of being able to have a discussion about appropriate fixes for the multitude of issues. After I already stated that I don't normally WFH and had made sure to clear my schedule for the time they arranged it was extremely unprofessional to show up early and then leave before we could go over the issues and fixes together. To be clear, I would have much rather gotten a refund then waiting 6 weeks for new ones, but that possibility was not discussed because the sales person left without talking to me.\n\nAfter insisting on a itemized list of issues with fixes this was the result:\na) Miscoloration on the tall cabinet - new one would be sent\nb) Miscoloration on the island cabinet - covered by decorative panel\nc) Miscoloration on the basecovers - new basecover sent\nd) Missing the base on one of the drink bar cabinets - paid my contractor to make the base instead of building and sending a new cabinet\ne) Missing the sink front tray - new sink tray sent\nf) Crack in the upper drink bar cabinet - not integral to stability and covered by decorative panel\ng) Misalignment of closed door on upper cabinet - new door to be sent\n\nSo, 6 weeks later, the new tall cabinet, basecover, cabinet door, and sink tray to find the following issues. (Anything not mentioned was fine.)\n\na) Tall cabinet was still the wrong color\ne) Sink tray arrived broken\ng) New cabinet door was the wrong color and wrong size, it doesn't fit any cabinet in my kitchen\n\nAt this point I told my sales rep I wanted a refund for the affected items and was otherwise done with this endeavor. I cook in my kitchen every day, I'd already delayed finishing my kitchen for an extra six weeks due to delays from these cabinets and I was not going to delay finishing the kitchen for any longer.\n\nShe said she would contact the WF rep to see about the refund. I followed up two weeks later only to find out that someone put in a new order for another replacement. We had to get that cancelled and after four more weeks we got the refund. Six months later and this chapter of our lives is coming to a close.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUeGGvEup-a1RhJ-YZiXQtJ8zUevZskNKqe59f=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c0c85c8b3e945:0xec973abb4d7a1eab"}

If I had known, I would have paid the extra to get much, much better quality.  The lower, large pantry doors came with several dings and scratches. At least 5 of the cabinet drawers had gouges and large indentations, and the doors above the fridge had several dings.  To top it all off, the slow close hardware stinks.  Nothing glides like it should.  The Kraftmaid would just glide beautifully after you gently pushed the drawers. The Wellborn Forest cabinets wiggle as soon as you push them gently, and they hardly move. You have to push the drawers up to the point where the slow close mechanism takes over, which is basically pushing them shut yourself.  That's just unacceptable. Even though they cost less than Kraftmaid, they still were not cheap.  I insisted on American made cabinets and this is what I get.  As I said before, I am very, very disappointed.

There aren\u2019t strong enough words to describe the level of frustration and anger I feel toward this company. We began our kitchen renovation in October 2017 and now it\u2019s  January 2019 and cabinets are still arriving in the wrong paint color, poorly packaged (and subsequently damaged), and the paint job is inconsistent and chipping. I've been living with the wrong vent hood for over a year, and faulty paint issues (admitted by WB) that caused paint to flake off of these cabinets from day 1. Even worse, the cabinets are all varying shades of white so they don't match. It is very clear there is no QC process in place given the state of my vent hood that had arrived damaged or the wrong size/style and color all together more than 5 or 6 times now. We continually receive wrong items - such as the completely wrong drawer faces, dishwasher panels, and even after this has been escalated to customer service and the VP of ops multiple times. This has gone on for so long now that it originally delayed our project - even with them knowing the project was being filmed by HGTV - and we couldn't even finish off our kitchen for a few additional months as we waited for product. It\u2019s almost as though they skipped a paint coat on these cabinets and sent them out the door as though acceptable. A few cleanings (without chemicals) later and paint rubs right off! Many had flakes of paint missing upon arrival and still need replaced. We have renovated multiple homes and this is our third kitchen install, yet the most challenging company we\u2019ve ever been forced to work with. We had better longevity and less issues when we used Lowe\u2019s cabinets on our first flip home. Shame on this company for all of the money they\u2019ve cost in labor and heartache along the way, for a lack of compensation as a result, and for STILL not getting it right more than a year later. I would never recommend them. For the $20k we spent on cabinets we absolutely could have gotten a much better product elsewhere that would look better and last longer without all this heartburn.\n\nUpdate: It's been 2 weeks since I originally wrote this review, and even with getting the rep involved, my cabinet hood arrived yet again with a large paint gouge, it arrived in a semi-gloss rather than the satin, and it was the wrong hood all together.

The back up sensors were no longer working because the same employee had cut all of the wires when he installed the plug in my bed.

Mr.Odell made a Wonderful Compliment to me on my second full week of working there,i started on the Packing line about one week then I voluntarily moved to Assembly 770 line. I stayed on that line feeling better about the few ones that was working on the line being mature as a work place should be. Well after working on 770 Assembly line for two months or more, Matthew George a young man who has a awful past and was the only one signed up for the position was over that area I worked. He says alot about what he's going to do and doesn't always mark his words, well he heard that I was going to the Head person about him and also another young lady on 770 Assembly line had major issue with him so he came up to me helping with the machine that messes up alot saying out of the blue medleying about me going to the Head person but said nothing to the other young lady. ???? Make this shorter Matthew had me go back to Packing line for like four days training me to do Scopes different ones so I did okay no major mess up as a normal person training well he walked up to a few ones plotted on me the camera will show you that turned them against me and went behind my back and spoke against me in a meeting the same day the Temp Agency Lady ended my assignment,why wasn't I wasn't able to defend myself with the few people on the line I worked the longest on to speak about me. Then Mark Odell spoked against me because he's scared of Matthew George when he Complimented me about my good work. Mannnnn, DO NOT work for Matthew George unless you're going to kiss up to him. He has no Good Remembering Knowledge! He told me after moving me back on the Packing line the same day within 45minutes that \"He knew that I wadnwa going to like it over there', meaning he knew what he was doing to set me up.

I ordered a tube where i can fit my electrical fish rod tools but to my surprise, the product arrives with no end caps.  All while the product picture has end caps, which is basically false advertisement.  So let me get this straight, your customers are coming to your site to buy an empty tube with no end caps?  I can conveniently drive to home depot and get a random pipe for that.  Or even ask my neighbor.  How about putting it in capital letters on your site  that \"the tube doesn't come with end caps.\"  Then it would be up to the customer to read and do the proper product research.\n\nBut wait there's more.  So i was already super irritated at the lack of logic being used on this one but i refrained from writing a bad review.  Instead, I brushed it off, went on the website, and found I can just order these vynil end caps for $2, plus shipping.  Whatever! Right?  It happens!\n\nBut my disappointment didn't stop there.  I received the package, opened it and only one cap was inside.  Again, the product page is titled \"black vynil caps\" and the first picture is a picture of multiple caps.  So once again, misleading a returning customer that already gave you a second chance.  Where is the logic?  I am certain that you have run into this problem before.  Why is it not fixed.  You risk reputational damage for a few extra bucks.\n\nI just don't understand how your number one priority isn't to make life easier for your customers and delighting them at every step of the sales process....

In this email thread, one can note that I had to ask for a copy of the order because I did not receive an email with order confirmation for detail. One can also note in this email thread where I offered input on how the order was processed to improve the process to review an order. Also, the order process is totally in your control. It is your business, your website. I will not be taking you up on your offer for 50% off the purchase price.

The sign was ordered with the incorrect numbers. We have tried working with this customer to get them the correct sign for a while now. We have multiple places in which customers can review their orders, and then we send out several emails that also include the details of the order. This customer entered the wrong numbers in the customization of their sign. This is the first time this has happened on our website, out of the 2,544 address signs we have made and shipped out. When we make custom items, our team spends much more time and effort to ensure that the product is perfect, and the design process is extensive and time-consuming. We offered to remake this customer's sign at 1/2 the price of the retail price, as a generous offer. Had we made the sign incorrectly, we would have sent a replacement for free. However, this sign was ordered incorrectly. We would have lost money by remaking a new sign at 1/2 the price of the retail price, but we were willing to do that for customer satisfaction. The customer refused our offer and continues to blame us for their error. We are always willing to take ownership of our mistakes, and we have done so numerous times in the past, as we are humans and are not perfect. We all make mistakes. The customer refuses to accept their error, and has chosen to write negative reviews about our business everywhere they can to make us look like a bad company. We understand the frustration, but this was not our fault, yet we are still having to explain our situation as a business, taking time and energy away from our customers."}, "gmap_id": "0x886287ad954d6543:0xbd53fcef104d6e06"}

The cakes are all butter, gourmet & all natural ingredients which are expensive. Let me start by saying the Snack cakes are 8.5 oz and our slices are 4 oz.  This means the Snack cakes are double the size of our 1\" thick slices. Also, the prices are shown above the cakes. The cost of the Red Velvet (specialty cake with creamcheese butter cream is actually $8.98 in Sam's Club not $7.48. The $7.48 cakes are non specialty flavors (Original, Lemon Blueberry, Key Lime & Chocolate). It sounds like there is a problem. We stand behind all of our product and I'd really appreciate if you would send a picture of the packaging and inside of the cake, if possible. We will ship you a replacement as we know our cakes are worthy and some of the BEST in the business. Please email us @ emilyshpc@gmail.com and we will gladly get to the bottom and rectify the issue.

THAT'S WHY I DON'T WANT THAT ODYSSEY BECAUSE IT IS A RISK FOR MY FAMILY.\n\nSo far I have not changed the truck or the HONDA COGGIN ORLANDO dealer, or the HONDA car factory.\n\nSHOPPING EXPERIENCE\n\nOn Tuesday 13 / Nov / 2019, the seller WILBERT RODRIGUEZ showed me the ODYSSEY EXL, but after giving me information about the monthly payments, it was not available to me. He offered me the EX model, but I told him that I was not going to continue with the purchase; Well, for me it was a problem that I did not have the entertainment system for my children (BLUE RAY OR DVD), he told me that this was not a problem; that we could try for the EX and they added the entertainment system to me, I insisted several times on the subject because for me it is a familiar subject. The sale was made and it was a hoax, they didn't give me the system.\n\nAFTER SALES EXPERIENCE AND FAILURE OF THE 2019 HONDA ODYSSEY EX\n\nOn 16 / Nov / 2018 MY HONDA ODYSSEY HAD THE TRANSMISSION NEUTRALIZED, it said on the dashboard park in a safe place, check transmission, check emission of gases and the blind spot indicator light. I called the dealer several times, the WILBERT salesperson, the service department, they never answered me, left messages and never returned my call. Call the HONDA route assistance service which also took several minutes to attend to me; They sent me a crane from AAA.\n\nThey changed the battery and restored the electrical system of the ODYSSEY 2019. They give it back to me.\n\nOn 17 / Nov / 2018 the fault returned and the transmission was neutralized again; I left the vehicle in service. I make the exception of that moment that I do not want the truck because I feel insecure in it, it is not a glass that does not rise or a door that does not close, IT IS A PREGNANT SITUATION for a vehicle to neutralize you and thereby put you at RISK TO YOUR FAMILY.\n\nGentlemen of HONDA, I express to you through these lines, I bought a vehicle to enjoy with my family, I did not buy a problem, I refuse to accept being the guinea pig of a fault of the HONDA brand.\n\nJASON WHITTEN general sales manager informally told me that was a problem that HONDA AMERICA had to solve because they don't make cars that only sell them.\n\n(Original)\nHONDA COGGIN ORLANDO LA PEOR EXPERIENCIA DE VENTA Y POST VENTA que he recibido en un concesionario en mi vida!!!.

POR ELLO NO QUIERO ESA ODYSSEY PORQUE ES UN RIESGO PARA MI FAMILIA.\n\nHasta ahora no me cambian la camioneta ni el concesionario HONDA COGGIN ORLANDO, ni la f\u00e1brica de los autos HONDA.\n\nEXPERIENCIA DE COMPRA\n\nEl martes 13/Nov/2019, el vendedor WILBERT RODRIGUEZ me mostr\u00f3 la ODYSSEY EXL, pero despu\u00e9s de darme informaci\u00f3n sobre los pagos mensuales la misma no estaba a mi alcance. El me ofreci\u00f3 el modelo EX, pero le dije que no iba a continuar con la compra; pues para m\u00ed era un problema que no ten\u00eda el sistema de entretenimiento para mis hijos (BLUE RAY O DVD), \u00e9l me manifest\u00f3 que esto no era un problema; que pod\u00edamos intentar por la EX y ellos me agregaban el sistema de entretenimiento, le insist\u00ed varias veces sobre el tema porque para m\u00ed es un tema familiar. Se dio la venta y fue un enga\u00f1o no me dieron el sistema.\n\nEXPERIENCIA POST VENTA Y FALLA DEL HONDA ODYSSEY EX 2019\n\nEl 16/nov/2018 MI HONDA ODYSSEY SE LE NEUTRALIZO LA TRANSMISION dec\u00eda en el tablero estaci\u00f3nese en un lugar seguro, revisar transmisi\u00f3n, revisar emisi\u00f3n de gases y la luz de testigo del punto ciego. llame varias veces al concesionario, al vendedor WILBERT, al departamento de servicio, nunca me atendieron, deje mensajes y jam\u00e1s me devolvieron la llamada. Llame al servicio de asistencia de ruta de HONDA el cual tambi\u00e9n tardo varios minutos en atenderme; me mandaron una gr\u00faa de AAA.\n\nCambiaron la bater\u00eda y restauraron el sistema el\u00e9ctrico de la ODYSSEY 2019. Me la entregan de vuelta.\n\nEl 17/Nov/2018 vuelve a presentar la falla y la transmisi\u00f3n se neutraliza nuevamente; dej\u00e9 el veh\u00edculo en servicio. Hago la salvedad de ese momento que no quiero la camioneta pues me siento inseguro en ella, no se trata de un vidrio que no sube o una puerta que no cierra, ES UNA SITUACION EMBARAZOSA que un veh\u00edculo se te neutralice y con ello pongas en RIESGO A TU FAMILIA.\n\nSe\u00f1ores de HONDA, les expreso a trav\u00e9s de estas l\u00edneas, compr\u00e9 un veh\u00edculo para disfrutar con mi familia, no compr\u00e9 un problema, me niego a aceptar ser el conejillo de indias de una falla de la marca HONDA.\n\nJASON WHITTEN gerente general de ventas de manera informal me dijo eso era un problema que ten\u00eda que resolver la HONDA AMERICA que ellos no fabrican carros que solo los venden.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfNOV8dUGYsgSu4vk9NPpOd_MvD8DxH8mxvx3y=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bd111ec1b7ec1:0xaf96df819ea89f01"}
