My son has a French horn that we were trying to get repaired. Unfortunately, it is not repairable, but John and Mitchell were very kind and chose to educate us, instead of insult us like they did at Arts. They seem to truly care about their customers! They even offered to try to find us a good, used French horn, without any pressure. I would recommend them to anyone looking for an instrument or lessons!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88928d819de509ed:0xec2187b0aef4634b"}
