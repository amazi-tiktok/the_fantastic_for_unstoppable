He has been progressing very fast. Mr. Brown built him a strong foundation of learning the rhythm and beats in the music first. From there he introduced playing the melodies and chords. Mr. Brown teaches theories and techniques along with musical creativity in a balanced way. He encouraged my boy to compose a 8 measure of song in the very beginning of his lessons. Now, my son can play a children song with both hands playing chords and melodies. He comes to the piano -voluntarily-playing all the major scales, 2 octaves going up and down by himself! Mr. Brown uses many unconventional methods to teach music to his students. But they works! I have seen it from my son. Mr. Brown is also good at communication. He listens to parents' concerns and ideas to make the lessons more suitable to the child. I am pleased about my son's progress and music experience with Madison Music Academy.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1597859047058, "text": "Thank you so much for your kind words.

We are very aware that leavi g guitars plugged in drai s the battery. That was NOT the case here. We took it out and found they had installed a promotional  Progressive Insurance smoke detector battery in it. Instead of what we are used to getting, Energizer or Duracell. I called and was told that we should have told them we wanted a better battery. It cost us more than $30 for the strings and a battery replacement. No offer to replace it. The lady said they just use whatever is \"handy\". I don't pay for what's handy. So much for being Pro's. If the lady had simply apologized, that would have been the end of it. I wasn't looking for anything other than to let them know that a substandard battery had been installed. When we brought it in initially, we asked for the strings to be changed and the battery replaced. No one told us at that time that we weren't being charged for the battery, just that what we asked for was $30, if I had been advised of that I would have either asked for a better battery or brought my own.
