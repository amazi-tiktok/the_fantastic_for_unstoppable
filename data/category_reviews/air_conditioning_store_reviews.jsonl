My wife met with Cason and we went into wanting multiple options which i thought were all fairly presented and well explained without any pressure of which to go with. I have a close friend who worked for many years for both Trane and Carrier with many of the dealers throughout Birmingham. He gave me a list of 3 companies he would have out to his home personally. Skelton was one of those, another company that i liked very much, and then one we didnt have a great experience on the quote with. Between Skelton and the other competitor, although Skeltons price was higher we were sold by the labor warranty and some of the other written guarantees, along with the rec from our friend. Installation - I believe it was Mark, my wife was the one on site - went way better than i could have imagined. We arranged last minute to have the unit moved to a new location. All of the work was very well done. I had an idea in my head of what \"the aftermath\" should have looked like and the equipment involved in the move and all that, and i probably would have been satisfied with a lot less. Its obviously a lot of money for most families, so I was bound to have some mix of buyers remorse and hesitation about whether or not we'd gone with the right people However, when i got home and saw the quality of the work, how neatly and efficiently and professionally everything was done, i immediately felt entirely confident in our decision and knew we had some true professionals out at the house. I think its the first time in my life ive spent that much money on something and dont have any regrets or second guessing about who we chose to spend it with. Kudos to both Cason and Mark's teams.

Anyone who accepts responsibility for a mistake and makes a good faith effort to fix things gets a second chance with me. The technician, who was nice and professional, quickly found and fixed the issue (a simple clog). Before he left we got a call from the owner who explained that there would be no charge for the service.

We noticed our air was not working around 3 pm on a Saturday. We were at our lake house in Talladega. I called four other companies, that said they were 24/7. None would return a call. No one even answered. I called Total Comfort and spoke to Gary. We were almost near heat stroke at this point. He could sense the desperation in my voice. He said let me make a few calls, and if I'm able I'll be on my way. Ten minutes later he called back and said he was on his way. Drove from Gardendale to Talladega to look at our unit and see what could be done. He was a lifesaver. It was the capacitor. He had a new one on his truck, and fixed it within 30 minutes. What normally would have cost a lot, on a Saturday evening was a few hundred bucks or so. I would have given them 10 stars if I could have. WE WILL NEVER USE ANYONE BUT TOTAL COMFORT AGAIN!!!
