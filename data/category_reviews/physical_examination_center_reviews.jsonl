My daughter was the first of us to use Dr. Mann.  She came in for really bad neck pain and headaches.  Dr. Mann said it was related to what is now being called 'text neck.' In two weeks of treatment she was completely better! Not only that it's been months now and she feels great- and still playing on that phone! The second patient was my son.  We were told he needed tubes in his ears because he had chronic ear infections for months.  It broke my heart thinking about that so I was chatting with Dr. Mann on one of my daughters visits and he told Chiropractic can be successful in treating that without tubes. So we gave it a try (child adjustments are different and very gentle if you didn't know) and low and behold after months of ear infections they were COMPLETELY gone.  We were thrilled- not to mention we saved hundreds avoiding surgery.  The next patient was me!  I do pure Barre and I was having trouble with my low back and knee.  It turns out that I had mobility issues.  Couple weeks of work and my workout is now a breeze. And finally my husband.  He's had back issues before but not quite like this recent one.  He works at a computer all day.  This time the sciatica was going all the way to his foot.  He is currently finishing up his rehabilitation with Dr. Mann and is already pain free!  I am so glad we came here first! No pain, no drugs, we feel great, and at a fraction of the price of surgery.

It looks like it's been said her a 100 times but I wanted to say why my treatments here allow me to say how much I mean that and miss being in Alabama!  I spend most of the year in Atlanta now because of work.  I have tried and tried to find a chiropractor here that was as good as Dr. Mann but I haven't been successful.  I called Dr. Mann before one of my appointments in Atlanta and asked if he would mind talking to my chiropractor (bless him for doing that) Even after an in depth conversation about the type of treatments I was receiving with Dr. Mann in Decatur I still wasn't getting the same level of relief from my Atlanta chiropractor that I was receiving at Advanced Chiropractic.  My neck is just not the same when I go to other places.  I only get to be adjusted a few times a year by Dr. Mann now because of the move and it's one of the worst things about not being home.  But every time  I am in town seeing Dr. Mann is on the list!  Another thing I always appreciated about Dr. Mann's office is there is always a plan.  He doesn't just say 'see ya' at the end of your appointment.  If I am working on an injury I always know when I need to be seen again.  If I am on wellness I know I need to be back monthly.  Other places I have been don't give any direction and it just seems less professional.  Be thankful for what you have here!!! He's the best!

I'm a fan of all things wellness and am a believer that the chiropractor can save you from surgery. I am also very picky about the places I go for treatment and advice. I had just relocated to the area for work.  My supervisor had also just moved here and said I should give this place a try.  I called ahead and asked about the services provided and some questions about my new insurance.  I had my appointment that evening.  The office is more modern looking than some of the other places in town (past experience has taught me sometimes old building means outdated doctor). The staff and doctors are all nice people and I can without a doubt say that was the best treatment I have ever been given.  My last chiropractor was a good friend and great person but was a smaller build. Just guessing but I think that really was the difference in treatments and let me tell you it was significant.

Like I said in just a couple weeks I could see the changes. I used 2 feel tingling from my back almost weekly. I now haven't felt it in weeks.

I cant say enough about Dr. Mann. He listened to everything i felt that i needed to tell him. He took his time explaining to me what he was doing and why. He recommended exercises to do between visits to help strengthen me back up. After he adjusted me, I felt so much relief. He eased pain that I have had for months. When I left, I felt like a new person. My only regret was not coming to see Dr. Mann sooner!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886284764f6fef61:0x2058cd07a41eab07"}

Attempted to realign a part of my body that didn't need it and when he was done after 6 minutes in the room with me he managed to not fix the issue at all now I'm out over $100.00 and absolutely  no relief for a simple pinched nerve, oh but he did set me up on the \"maintenance plan\" which is 3 visits a week at $65 per visit that's $780 a month! That's more then my mortgage for what every single other chiropractor has been able to fix and treat in one visit for under $50.00. Please be wise and heed this as a warning. I do not recommend this place for anyone. They may be a legal D.C. but it's as close to a scam ad you can get legally.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1546567115350, "text": "Kris- you are being dishonest. Health expenses without insurance can be tough, but that is no excuse for your dishonesty in your review. Cameras show your time in the office was approximately 40 minutes; less than 5 minutes in the waiting room- standard for any first visit. Furthermore, we offer the lowest cash prices for new patients in town and also very flexible payment plans.  You were told the prices before you came in. Our cameras even show you were in high spirits until it was time to pay your bill.  And instead of talking to us and working out a payment plan we watched you go into your car and leave this angry review.  Also, what you tried to tell us was \u2018wrong\u2019 with you was actually incorrect and probably the main reason you\u2019ve had to deal with your back pain for years instead of actullay being \u2018fixed.\u2019 While we have great respect for you and your field, you have to remember- you are not a doctor-  for instance a chiropractor in a car accident should heed the EMT\u2019s instructions because that is what they have been trained to do.  You are also confusing your terminology- maintenance is for wellness patients- and is an optional once a month visit for those who have complete their \u2018rehab\u2019 plan to help stay ahead of injuries and reduce wear and tear on the body. Rehab plans are what you were trying to quote. Certain injuries take time to heal and a proper plan for recovery. You are absolutely right Kris- We do things different at Advanced Chiropractic.  We get so many patients who have seen chiropractors that take shortcuts to treat their injuries and the patient continues to deal with pain for years.  Our goal at Advanced Chiropractic is to HEAL the injury. We have found that if we simply make pain go away we are no different than a pain killer or opiate.  However, with our custom made rehabilitation plans you can escape that continued damage, year after year, which is so important as many parts of the body don\u2019t grow back when you repeatedly injure them."}, "gmap_id": "0x886284764f6fef61:0x2058cd07a41eab07"}
