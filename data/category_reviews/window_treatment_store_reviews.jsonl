You will especially be disappointed and appalled if you had just left Bassett Furniture in Hoover where they took the time to do the following: cultivate a relationship, show you around their showroom, listen to what your needs are, and sit down to customize furniture based on your specifications. For lack of words, the feeling that my husband and I received at RH: \u201cWe are RH, our products speak for themselves, so we are not going to do our job at all. We are not going to try to educate them on our selections/options. I am not leaving my computer to assess their needs. If they want something, they\u2019ll ask me then buy it.\u201d The ONLY information we were given was about looking online and a RH book when we got ready to leave because I couldn\u2019t take it any longer. Not once did the lady offer to look at fabrics with us, to go over color selections, discuss what their process was, etc. (We were wanting custom furniture for a spec home and this was stated.) When I asked a question, the response was very much short and NON-informative, I was told to look online which defeats the entire purpose of going in store.

My shipment is a pallet of 33 boxes of porcelain tile., plus 7 additional boxes they put on the same pallet. The right side of the pallet was coming apart due to the immense weight of the tile . The driver could not move the pallet down the truck. He was not going to be able to pull it up the small slope on my driveway. What on earth were they even thinking?They needed a fork lift. I called Home Depot and they got the Transport company on the line while I was on hold. I ended up being told the transport company needed to take care of this and they would contact me in 24 to 48 hours. Which they never did. I had to call them. On 3/5 Friday I called central transport and they told me the shipment would be delivered on Monday between 11 and 12. They never showed. I checked the shipment tracking and found that they changed it to Tuesday 3/9! I got no call, text, or phone call.So Tuesday 3/9 I message them to find out eta. They said the drivers hadn't left yet and to keep checking they will update me. That never happened.

Home Depot just subs out delivery to the cheapest company....and you can see the quality when your damaged items arrive!\nAnd I pray for you if you have ANY problems with your delivery or installation!!!\nCount on a couple of things: 1) You will spend hours on the phone getting to talk to the right person. Once you think that you have the right person, they will tell you they have to check on something and they will have to call you back. OR, the right person is \"on lunch\" and they will call you back. After giving them ample time for \"lunch\" (3 hours) when you call them back, you will be told that they were \"off today\" but they will return your call in the morning.\nBasically, it's a game of ping-pong and it takes days to get simple questions answered because, obviously, no one who works there wants to actually do anything.\nI can't believe I dropped over $7K in there and they can't even answer a simple question!!!!\nBuyer beware!!!
