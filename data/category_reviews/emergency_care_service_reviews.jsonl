I had a Myelogram done at Image South in Birmingham they did an amazing job with very little discomfort of course they gave the usual possible side effects, one being a headache. I woke up the following day , Saturday, with a mild headache I took a Tylenol and thought nothing else of it. I woke up Sunday morning vomiting very dizzy and the headache was worse. My wife drove me to St. Vincent's St.Clair emergency room and she signed me in and we waited in the waiting room.  We didn't have to wait long until the triage nurse called my name and took me to check my vitals, and the is where competency ended. In all fairness the nurse that came into the room to take care of me was kind and polite. After waiting in the room a PA came in and asked the same questions that had already been asked and decided since I wasn't running a fever I didn't have meningitis and that I needed a CT scan. While waiting for the CT Tech to come the nurse came back in and gave me a shot of phenergan and Imitrex. I have absolutely  no problem at all trying the simplest medications first and I prayed it would work but it didn't. A while later and actual MD came into the room and said, \"your CT is clear were going to let you go.\" I tried to tell him that my head still felt as if it was going to explode and he said call the DR that did your myleogram. I reminded him that it was Sunday and that I wasn't going anywhere until he did something. He left the room and never came back. In just a short while another nurse came in with a paper cup and some ice water. They gave me a norco and a prescription for ibuprofen. I would guess I sae the actual MD for about 15 seconds and the nurse that brought me the medication had a major attitude problem. I told the admitting nurse that I had taken tylenol ibuprofen and asprin already. We left the ER and I went home in exactly the same shape as I went to the hospital.  IF you can at all avoid this ER.

I told them to send me something via my personal email and I would pay it that night. Nothing. I called the next day and asked where was the email invoice? After being placed on hold for several minutes, someone came to the phone and said the bills would go out in the next few weeks. I expressed my dissatisfaction of being harassed at work to pay a bill that would not even be sent for another three weeks as it turns out. Extremely unprofessional and unethical business practices.

I had made two telehealth appointments last week, and neither time were they returned (I see a negative review about this below, so obviously I'm not the only person this happened to).  Finally, the front desk told me yesterday that they couldn't do a telehealth appointment for my prescription refills and that's why I wasn't called.  I was, as you can imagine, a little miffed.  I can understand if they need to see me, but you don't just \"not call.\" - Let the person know why the telehealth appointment won't work so they can schedule to get in.  In any event, Dr. An personally called me this morning and was apologetic.  Their office has been overwhelmed, and I can understand that.  No place is perfect (I certainly am not, and I make mistakes too).  So - the personal apology goes a long way and speaks well of him.  As I had even said in my negative review, I've been seeing him for a while, and always liked him.  And, my experience with his nurses has always been fine, and I have found them pleasant.  One or two of the front desk staff can be off-putting, but most of them are fine too - and it's hard to find good help these days.  So, overall, I'm changing this review.  Yes, the situation last week (not calling me for my telehealth appointments and not even calling to tell me why, so I could get in) was not professional.  But, again, no place is perfect, and I appreciate the apology and the fact that they were overwhelmed.  Probably the front desk staff needs to be a little better trained and make sure to get back to people if a telehealth appointment is not met (by the Dr.).  But, again, overall, I have been very pleased with Dr. An over the years.  I had even said in my review that I would probably still give him/them another chance - and the personal call from him apologizing and then taking care of my needs and basically conducting the telehealth call right then - certainly corrected the matter, and speaks well of him/the place.  I always appreciate when someone cares enough about a complaint to call and try to make it right.  I'll be sticking with him, and can still certainly recommend him (and have recommended numerous people to him who have become his patients and have also generally been very pleased with him).", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2cf6fafcfea7:0x9cd7e100f64d4b6e"}

I have been going to this office for several years now, and each time I go back, I become more and more disappointed in the staff. Not one person smiled at me or asked me how I was doing- I was treated like I was just another body. I brought my ten month old in to see if she had yet another ear infection, as her pediatrician's office was closed due to it being on a Sunday... I was taken to the back with another patient, and given attitude when they realized my ten month old couldn't STAND for a weight check... finally they got her a pad to sit on, then was immediately told to go to a room, in which a gentleman had JUST walked out of. I questioned whether the room was even clean, and an assistant popped out and very rudely announced- \"YES its clean... that is where I just came from... why is there a problem!?\". I responded to her that I just watched someone walk out of the room while we were getting a weight check, and that I was simply asking a question. I do not believe that to be out of line. I have been in the medical field for over 12 years and have NEVER talked to a patient in response to their VALID concerns about whether a room was clean or not. I would have been fired on the spot if I had responded that way to a patient. I should note the room looked dirty...both trash can lids were left up and there was debris on the counter. The tech came back in to get vitals, which was un- successful because my daughter wouldn't sit still long enough for the monitor to work... so instead of changing the approach she just decided she would tell the doctor she couldn't get it done. Dr. An has always been wonderful- but did not offer an apology for the way his staff treated me- even though he witnessed it and made eye contact with me from his desk in the middle of the op floor. I truly believe any office is only as good as the staff they have working for them, and I hate to say I probably will not endure his staff to see him any longer. It doesn't take much effort to be kind and compassionate- two things the practice website claims they compensate their employees for being. If I was not totally desperate to get my baby an antibiotic for her ear, I would have asked for my co-payment to be returned and left.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2cf6fafcfea7:0x9cd7e100f64d4b6e"}

My grandmothers home burned down to the ground Thursday (August 29th, 2019) I called the doctors office that day and wasn\u2019t able to get a hold of anyone. I had a lot going on that day since her home burned down that morning around 4am. This includes me driving from Atlanta to Citronelle,Al! After a few hours of trying to figure out what to do I drove my grandmother back with me to Atlanta. Since they did not answer Thursday my plan was to call Friday! I called Friday and spoke to a nurse and informed her about my grandmothers home and her losing EVERYTHING! I wasn\u2019t sure what medications she was taking and my grandmothers memory isn\u2019t well! So I told her to prescribe her everything because it needed to be replaced. I also had questions about putting my grandmother on the patch and some other things. She said she would ask the doctor and call me back. The main item we needed was her BREATHING MACHINE!!! Well surprisingly nothing was done Friday! I called again Saturday and spoke to a young lady named Jennifer (on call nurse) explained everything again and what I needed. Jennifer did get a few medicines prescribed but the breathing machine issue was never resolved! I ALSO HAD TO CORRECT THE NUMBER the nurse before her added CVS number as the contact number.\n\nSo I had to call back Monday which was a holiday. I spoke to Sheena who was very helpful and called me back with every update! Nothing could be done since it was a holiday!\n\nSo today is Tuesday and I call the doctors office again to get a BREATHING MACHINE for my grandmother, Leslie answered the phone and basically told me it was my fault because they have been trying to call and there was no answer (no one called my phone) she also told me they don\u2019t send prescriptions for breathing machines out of state! She laughed at me when I asked to speak to the doctor himself or to be sent to his voicemail. She advised me he wasn\u2019t in the office 9-3-2019 and didn\u2019t have a voicemail.\n\nHis staff doesn\u2019t know how to communicate, they are lazy, and there is no way of leaving a message for him!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4e1ca74c89e3:0x187d12feda71c7f4"}

And continues to stick needles in my arms. They did no blood work, just a cat scan, didn't see any Kidney stones which UAB in Gardendale seen in urinalysis and was treated and I was well in just 3 days. This hospital is degrading and disrespectful. They have no concerns for the emotional or physical state of the patient, because fro the time I told them I relapsed on meth, I was treated like a street junkie. When in fact I used it twice in 2 years. I was just being honest on a question. So please do yourself a favor and drive the extra distance to UAB in Gardendale.

The local urgent care suggested we visit the St. Vincent East ER for a CT scan/ultrasound to check his appendix.  As we were being discharged from urgent care, I looked up the reviews for St. Vincent and became nervous about visiting a hospital with such low ratings.\n\nOnce we arrived (on a Saturday evening), we were greeted by a friendly Registrar who checked him in and within 10 minutes we were called back to a room.  Within 2.5 hours, they had drawn blood, received the results, ordered a CT scan with contrast, diagnosed my husband with appendicitis, started him on antibiotics and began the process for him to be admitted with an appendectomy scheduled for first thing Sunday morning.\n\nThe nurses in the ER were very kind and attentive!  Always asking if we needed anything and checking in frequently with updates.\n\nOnce my husband was admitted to the 6th floor, we met Kim who assisted the nurse.  I cannot praise her enough for the wonderful care my husband (and myself) received from her!!  You can tell immediately that she has a pure passion for what she does, and the people put under her care!!  She knew I was going to stay the night and without asking, she requested a cot and provided us with extra pillows and even brought me a gown and comfy socks so that I didn\u2019t have to sleep in my day clothes.  She was so courteous during vital checks by keeping the lights off and working quickly to try not to disturb my husband while he was sleeping.\n\nDr. Nguyen was the surgeon who came and spoke with me before the surgery. preparing me for what to expect post-surgery.  They kept him for several hours after the surgery to ensure everything was working properly as the anesthesia wore off.\n\nWhen it was time to be discharged, my husband\u2019s pain levels were creeping up and he asked for some pain medication before driving 3 hours back home.  He was told that he would have to stay another hour for observation if he took the pain meds.  At that point, he just wanted to get home and in his own bed, so he declined the meds.  The nurse was kind enough to call the doctor to get approval for one of the pain pills he was prescribed to help him get home in the most comfort possible.\n\nOverall, I could not have asked for better care for my husband and would have no hesitations recommending this hospital.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890e7347a471ad:0x2850926678005a46"}

I had this same injury almost 20 years ago and was fairly confident that this was the same injury.  When I had this injury previously, I went to St. Vincent's Occupational Health Clinic which was on U.S. 280 at that time and the physician told me that it was CRITICAL that I breathe fully with sufficient expansion of my lungs (which would cause some expansion of my rib cage and the accompanying pain) to prevent the risk of developing pneumonia.  At that time, I was about 30 and in good health and I was prescribed Hydrocodone APAP 10 (mg?) and that worked well.  I had very little pain when breathing or sleeping and recovered within a couple of weeks.\n\nI'm now about 50, about 60 lbs heavier than I was then, and have been unemployed for a while but I'm attending graduate school to attain a Masters degree to teach science at the high school level.  When I visited the ER on the 9th not long after the fall, I received the same diagnosis of bruised ribs, the same warning that I must breathe fully to prevent pneumonia, but then was prescribed 500 mg Naproxen (same thing as Aleve) and a muscle relaxer.  The medicine was almost useless as it was only moderately effective for only about half the period that it was indicated.  I was still not breathing properly and had intense pain for more than 50% of the time.  The pain affected my breathing, my sleep, and my ability to concentrate on my studies.\n\nI called my primary physician (as ER instructions indicated), Dr. Jack Zaremba, after a couple of days and told his nurse that the medication wasn't effective.  They stated that I would have to come in for a visit before they could DECIDE if I needed something stronger.  I had just paid probably $100 on a copay for the ER along with the cost of the useless medication and now they wanted to suck some more money out of me before they could DECIDE if I my excruciating pain was worthy of some effective medication.  I refused.  The ER had already diagnosed me and erred in prescribing medication, so why should I have to pay more money to get an effective prescription?\n\nI'm sure that the opioid \"epidemic\" is affecting the judgement of physicians so that they are hesitant to prescribe certain pain medication, but due to their monopoly on prescribing certain types of medication, they have a duty to make sure that they prescribe sufficient medication to their patients.  The only reason I went to the ER is because I remembered that stern warning by that physician years ago about the risk of pneumonia and I expected that they would prescribe something that would actually help suppress the pain so that I could comply with their instructions about breathing.  By merely calling my physician and requesting more effective medication, they've probably added me to some DEA list of pill poppers.\n\nAfter three weeks, I'm noticing just a slight change in the level of pain which I experience.  I don't think that I'm breathing fully yet, but I don't seem to have contracted pneumonia yet.  I'm just using over the counter pain meds which are just as useless as the prescription meds were, but I see no reason to return to a physician and help them with their country club dues if they aren't going to do their job to relieve my suffering.  The next time I go to the ER at St. Vincent's East will be involuntary and via an ambulance.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890e7347a471ad:0x2850926678005a46"}

Lakeshore (Birmingham, AL) location. After arriving just on time for my 11am follow-up appointment with Dr. Richard Crittendon, and paying my $30.00 co-pay up-front, I took a seat in their waiting room. After about five minutes, I was escorted to the back patient area by a nurse who proceeded to weigh me, then take my blood pressure and my temperature. She then took me next door to an exam room to await Dr. Crittendon. \"He'll be with you in a few minutes,\" she said. I sat in that exam room for the next 55 minutes, listening to the nurses' and Dr. Crittendon's voices passing outside the door. AT NO TIME did anyone \"check in\" with me or acknowledge the doctor's tardiness. At 12:05pm, I left the room and attempted to speak with one of the four nurses at their station just outside; however, each one was seated and on the telephone. Eventually, I just explained to the receptionist that I could wait no longer (another appointment was pending), and left the building. Now, I understand that physicians are often over-booked or encounter unexpected issues with their patients, however, I do believe that a modicum of professional attention could have been paid during my almost one-hour wait. But, of course, they did have time to process my debit card for the co-pay.

Not what I was expecting for what I thought was a general \"walk-in clinic.\" I called & made an appointment to meet with Dr. Pink Fulmer.\n\nThis place exceeded my expectations. As it took a few minutes for the front clerk to check me in; it didn't take long (maybe 10-15 mins) before I was being called back. (I am a new patient). The lobby to this office is modern, has plenty of seating, and has a neat \"charging station\" for smart phone users who are running on their last fumes. :) I got called back and the young lady who took my blood pressure/weight was really nice. We talked briefly of the symptoms and she got me back into my private waiting room.\n\nIt wasn't long before Dr. Pink was in my room talking to me and asking me about my symptoms and conditions. He has a very calming and relaxing personality which puts a nervous person like me to ease. He truly seemed to care about my concerns and listened to all of my worries about my \"condition.\" He gave me a thorough examination, and even had some tests/xrays done that made me feel a lot better about what I \"thought\" was happening to my body.\n\nHe thoroughly went over my results and overall I was really pleased with he and all of his medical assisting staff. They were all really nice as I was super nervous about even being there. (I rarely go to the doctor). I also ended up getting a flu shot while I was there, and the girl who did it (med assistant) was sweet and did the deed quick and painless.\n\nI was sad to learn that Dr. P. Fulmer will be retiring sometime this year; but I really liked this office and will give their other doctors a shot. Fast and convenient!\n\nI also visited their in-house pharmacy (Rx Pharmacy) and I was thoroughly pleased. They were extremely quick and you can't get any better than picking up your prescriptions up at the same time you saw your doctor. It was cheap and the Pharmacy Owner (can't remember his name) was so down to earth and really pleasant to deal with.\n\nOverall, really pleased with this medical experience and glad to know I have this great place so close to where I live!! :) My husband and I will be using them as our PCP.\n\n**Side note** They also do walk-in's!! So if you are considering this as a walk-in option; try it.

I showed up to this urgent care to get refills on my medications, because I had moved to Wetumpka a couple days prior. They were not prompt in acknowledging my arrival into the waiting room, but eventually, one of the two ladies stopped gabbing and asked if they could helped me. I explained that I needed medication refills, and they asked what medications I was on in front of all the other patients in the waiting room. I am not shy about the medications I'm on, but some people are, and they should be sensitive to that. I told them, and they informed me that they don't have primary care physicians, and that they generally don't write prescriptions except for things such as sports injuries or general illnesses that pop up in daily life. I understand that, and said that was fine, I could find somewhere else to go, but they seemed upset at that prospect, and said they would ask the doctor on call if he would make an exception and asked me to fill out paperwork while they asked him. I did, and the doctor said he would make an exception, so I waited and filled out the paperwork to be seen. I waited a good while in the exam room, and when the doctor finally came in, he ho-hummed about giving the medicine that he supposedly had told the office staff he would give me with no problem. He finally asked me if I had enough to patch me over, and I informed him that I did not, so he wrote me the prescription (with refills, so he must not have had too much of a problem prescribing it), and sent me on my way. I left on my merry way, said good-bye to the office staff on my way out, and headed to the pharmacy to fill my prescriptions. Upon handing over the prescription, however, it was discovered that the doctor had given me an *unsigned* prescription! I'm fairly certain that could have ended very badly for him, had I chosen to make it, but since I needed those medications, I grumpily brought the prescription back to the now-busy urgent care, waited about fifteen minutes for the office staff to again acknowledge my existence at their window, and then get them to have the doctor sign his own prescription, that he had issued and sent into the world to have done who knows what with without his signature, begging to have fraudulence done in his name. So he signed it, and I filled the prescription, but the nonsense did not end there. Beyond all of that, I got a voicemail, without my phone ever ringing, which I'm sure was not their fault, but the fault of my phone, but the voicemail said something to the effect that they had made me an appointment that I had not asked for that I would be charged for if I did not show up for at an arbitrary date and time, and to call or come by if this was an inconvenience, and leaving no phone number to call back. I then got a letter in the mail, stating the date and time of this arbitrary appointment I had not asked them to make for me, which I was to be charged for if I no-showed on, that had a number to call if I wanted to cancel the appointment. I called the number, and it brought me to a busy signal, which hung up on me after five seconds each time I called (I tried this three times before coming on Google to look up their actual number to call and ream them out). Supposedly, they have cancelled this bogus appointment that they made for me. My question is: why do they make appointments at all, if they do not do primary care, and are supposedly only available for sports injuries and normal day to day illnesses? Do people nowadays schedule their injuries and illnesses? Why on earth would they schedule me an appointment in the first place, let alone without my asking for them to do so? Avoid this establishment at all costs. If you are looking for a place to receive urgent care or primary care, try PriMed that's right next to Walmart, right up the road. They actually respect their customers, do not make you appointments you never asked for, sign their prescription pads, do not ho-hum about writing you life-saving prescriptions, and treat you like a human being.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c27cb64f2a3e7:0xb33b4b7ec9f29b18"}

Once your insurance company pays its contracted portion, you will receive a statement in the mail explaining the portion your insurance paid and what (if any) balance is your responsibility. You will then have 14 days from the statement date to either arrange for another method of payment or request more information regarding the bill.

She said she would call me back after I told her to go ahead and cancel my appointment. Never received a call. I showed up at the office 30 minutes early and she asked to see me in her office where she tried to further explain the \u201cconflict of interest\u201d that they kept referring to.

Otherwise, you might become another \u201cconflict of interest\u201d like me and not be told until you show up because even though they say they called you and got your voicemail.

All of a sudden the receptionist, patients and staff are running screaming at me to run down the hall. They scream over the intercom code silver. I get up and start going down the hall. The first waiting room I came to was x-ray. The staff inside locks the door and I\u2019m tapping on the window to find out what\u2019s going on. Just so happens I know one of the woman working there. A gentleman asks her if she knows me and she replies yes. They slip me a note through the door telling me to call them in 15 minutes. I hear a woman inside say get forceful and tell him to leave. I turn to look down the hall and every soul is gone except for me and the man who stole a gun out of a car in the parking lot. I had no idea where he was. No one would help me or tell me what was going on. I was locked out in the hallway that is at least 80 yards long by myself with no means to defend myself. The man was obviously sick and out of his mind. I saw him when I pulled up and he gave me an uneasy feeling. I was not scared for me but thought to myself what if an elderly/young woman or a child walked in the door behind him what would they do. The only thing I could think to use to defend my self was a chair that was sitting in the radiology waiting area. I said to myself he will probably shoot me but hopefully I can beat him enough with the chair that he couldn\u2019t hurt anyone else. I was starring down the hall waiting for him to walk/run towards me and I was going to do my best to stop him with a chair. Another thought I had was if I had my gun on me I would at least be in a better position to defend myself. Luckily the police got there and disarmed the man. I was so mad at the hospital staff for telling me to run down the hall and then locking me out of EVERYTHING. I was nothing more than a target at that point. I could understand their policy a little better if I hadn\u2019t been waiting for 45 minutes in the same chair they ask me to flee from while rushing other patients into offices to protect them from a possibility bad outcome. I asked the Administrator what was the big plan for me. Wait till he shoots me then scurry on over to the E.R. All he said was this is not supposed to happen here. Needless to say I am extremely, extremely disappointed in the way St. Vincent\u2019s Blount handled things today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The diagnosis was an upper respiratory infection. After 3 days of taking the amoxicillin my symptoms got worse and the ear pain didn\u2019t go away. I went to a different urgent care center where they did a full work up and told me I had bronchitis. They gave me a steroid shot, z-pac, inhaler, steroids, ear drops and cough medicine.

Had to wait about thirty minutes to forty before I was called to an examination room.\n\nI sat there from 8ish until close to 11. I was told over and over again the practioner would be right with me.  It was freezing in that room might I add.  I was also tested for a blood infection cause of my toe.  She finally came in a little after 11 and examined my toe. I figured she would be able to cut along the side straight down.  I was told then and there she was not certfied/cleared to do such a procedure.  This confused because it is listed on their site they can treat ingrown toenails.\n\nIt was treated and it was painful.  I was told the proper care,  Ina small dose.  But what really surprised me was the lack thereof of a bandage. No ointment was placed on it after it,  but a guaze and a single bandaid was placed on my big toe.  It did not stay on long and started to peel off after an hour,  thus more infection invitation.\n\nAfter that ordeal,  I go to pay and I am hit with a twenty buck charge for my blood work.  I was confused because I had no blood taken from me.  No, it was the prick they did and I was not told at the time it'd be another charge. So I did not appreciate that.  Nor did I appreciate the fact it was 145 for just a blood pressure and pulse check,  examining my toe and clipping?/ draining it and a prick ob my finger.  Nor did I appreciate waiting for so long when I was the second to arrive.\n\nAlso,  when I exited I saw many people dressed formally talking down the hall and outside blocking the path to the doors.  Thus,  they were blocking the way for possible elederly and/or people with special needs. I was told they were busy and hence why it took so long.  I heard people come and go through those hours I was in my room.\n\nAnyways,  she did what she could and did help my toe some and the pain has died down  but i was over charged and unfairly charged for the blood work.

The nurses are instructed to run order tests (technically under the doctor's orders) before the doctor actually speaks to or looks at you -  this happened to me multiple times. Each time, a nurse has told me that the test are \"protocol\" and I can't turn them down - after I signed a patient's bill of rights, containing a clause stating that a patient can refuse any medical care - which is federal law. I had to argue with a nurse to turn down a chest x-ray for a minor sore throat. First, I asked why- she said that it will detect bronchitis. A quick google search told me that it bronchitis shows up on a chest x-ray about 25% of the time. It also informed me that I didn't have any symptoms of bronchitis. Turns out that they also ran a completely unnecessary white blood cell count test, which the doctor told me would not have affected his treatment, regardless of the result (after the fact). The doctor actually looked at me after this ordeal. He was able to tell me that I had an ear infection after a 2-minute physical examination. None of the three protocol tests were in any way necessary.\n\nIn a separate incident, there was another minor sore throat that had persisted for 2 weeks, accompanied by a couple bumps under the tongue. The nurse followed protocol and said they were running 3 tests, including a strep test. I declined this, only to be told in an extremely rude manner - by a different nurse this time -  that it is \"protocol\" and I can't change protocol. I reminded her that her protocol is internal, and it can certainly be deviated from. In fact, it is federal law.\n\nMy insurance company was actually billed for the 2nd incident (I was billed for a small portion as well). I went to the office to request a refund for myself and my insurance company - only to be told by the head nurse that they can't do it. Of course after digging deeper - she literally meant that they can't refund, but their billing company can. This was only the beginning of the battle of semantics. She also told me that she I can't speak to her manager, because she is the head nurse and the manager. After discussing further, I learned that she does have a boss (surprise!). She finally agreed to email him/her and have them contact me the next day. That was a week ago...\n\nPlease understand that this is one of the most important factor in rising health care costs and boycott this place. I have also been to North Alabama Medical Care in south Huntsville twice, and although they do try to pull some BS- it is not nearly to this degree.

This urgent care center has poor performance across the board. I went to see Dr. McKitty today, because I was suffering from severe nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and cold sweats. I am severely afflicted by GERD, and flare-ups like these occur on a semi-regular basis. It took me over an hour to be seen by the physician, though there were only 2 people in front of me in line. All the while I was vomiting and losing precious fluids. When I finally got to see McKitty, she had a smirk on her face and a terrible attitude from the start. I patiently answered her questions, and then I told her about my history of going to urgent care centers over the years for these flare-ups. I told her that I am usually given a saline IV and a shot of Promethazine when I have these flare-ups. To which she replied, \u201cI will not be giving you Promethazine, and you can leave and have a refund if you don\u2019t like that.\u201d I was appalled by the rudeness of this exchange, but more than that I was in shock that this person claims to be a doctor, yet clearly has no fidelity for the Hippocratic Oath. I spent the rest of the day fighting nausea, dehydration, and cramps all over my entire body. I was able to get Promethazine, which I am prescribed, from my family when I got home, but it took over 9 HOURS for me to stop vomiting and be able to get food down. I needed the Promethazine in shot form, which is why I go to Urgent Care centers across the USA. I\u2019ve been to at least a couple dozen of these centers over the past 7 years for these flare-ups, and I have NEVER been turned down for wanting Promethazine in order to relive my nausea anywhere from South Carolina to California.

Worse 'patient/dr. manners I have encountered' I have been having excruciating pain in left knee, sleepless nights and misery for about 3 weeks.

I am a very healthy 84 yr old, just had raving reports from primary Dr. this week on my lab work, agility and very active lifestyle. Dr. Kissels words to me were that's an old 80 year old knee, some arthritis. Take tylenol and get an otc cream. I asked if it could be a torn miniscus he said probably but that knee is old with a lot of miles. No mention of mri or further ckg into it. I could walk 2-5 miles with no limp before this onset, don't take pain pills, have not been admitted to any hospital since 1976 ,clean my own gutters, horseback ride etc. He repeatedly referred to my old knee. Well I plan to use these 'old knees' for several more years to play t ball and dollhouse in the floor with my great grands. Needless to say I cancelled my appt. to go back in two weeks, I heard him loud and clear about my old knees.

She called me at 11:30pm to say she felt lightheaded, a little dizzy, and had what felt like a slight pressure in her chest. She called the ambulance and the EMT's took her to St. Vincent's to be checked out.\n\nI had left Montgomery immediately after receiving the call and arrived at the hospital minutes after her ambulance had arrived (the EMT's were just bringing out the gurney to their rig when I got there) I went into the Emergency Room, told them why I was there and gave them info on my mom (name, date of birth, address, phone, and reason for admittance). The woman told me they were going to get her in a room and then ask when I could come back. I was the ONLY person in the waiting room. About 20 minutes later she said again that they had her in a room and would see when I could go back. Fifteen minutes after that she said a woman had just gone back to see if I could go back. Needless to say it was over an hour before they let me go back. The worst part is that I had assumed they would at least let my mom know I was there. Even though she had been asking them and voicing concerns about how I had not yet arrived no one from the waiting room told her I was there and none of the nurses back with my mom bothered to check if I had arrived. This was not a far walk either, considering my mom was approx. 30 ft inside the doors from the waiting room I was in.\n\nWhen I finally did get back to see her she was hooked up to a heart and pulse/ox monitor and they had a fluid IV in. They took her out to get chest X-rays and a CT scan minutes after I got back there. When she returned to the room about 15 minutes later, the nurse that brought her back first said she didn't know how to hook my mom back up to the machine and the IV...then was going to try...then decided no, she would have someone come in and do it. A half hour went by and no one came in to hook her back up. I stepped outside the door and explained that she had not been hooked back up and the nurse at the station said thanks, and they would come in and do it...which they never did. The original doctor she saw was also standing there when I told the nurse and did nothing. You would think if you were monitoring someone who you think may have had a heart attack you would want them hooked up to a monitor.\n\nFinally, the doctor came in a little before 4am and said that the X-rays, and CT scan were just fine, but there were concerns with her blood work (PS no one had ever come in to hook my mom back up to the monitors). The doctor explained there are three types of cardiac enzymes. One that tells if there is actual muscle damage and that they use to determine if you've had a heart attack (which was normal and my mom did not), and two others. One of the extra two was normal and then the doctor said that the third was \"significantly higher.\" She said that could indicate that although she may not have had a heart attack that enzyme could mean there could be something brewing or big That could happen on the horizon. She wanted to admit my mom so she could see the cardiologist in the morning...which we did. Kicker is when the cardiologist came in and looked at the tests he said it was slightly elevated, but nothing that he found alarming.\n\nAll in all I just felt like even though the ER was extremely slow, and at times there were 4 or more staff members sitting at the desk area within the ER, the overnight crew seemed fairly insufficient at simple things, like communicating that family members are there, or rehooking a patient back up to monitors and IV's.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ec8f4e3dd0d69:0xabe5f655cd2e4f08"}

At 12:13 PM on December 23rd, 2020 I went to Southern Rapid Care for a swollen eye. There was a sign on the door that said all patients were required to wear masks. The receptionist and another worker accompanying her at the front were not wearing masks. There were no coronavirus protective procedures in place. Nurse practitioner Sheila Stephens came into my room wearing a mask and immediately began to touch my eyebrow, without washing her hands and without gloves. She asked me to lie down on the table. She pulled off my mask and put a blue sheet over my face while the eyebrow was left exposed. Without any numbing medicine she then jammed a needle into the abscess, a very painful process that I groaned through. After using a needle she took her ungloved hands and squeezed at the area, forcing anything inside out. After she finished she told me it would bleed for a while and neglected to give me anything to soak the blood. I had to grab a kleenex for myself in an open, dusty, box to stop the bleeding. As I looked around the room I noticed a dried, smeared, puddle of blood sitting in the middle of the room. The bed sheets were also uncovered and had various dried stains, dog hair, human hair, and dirt covering them. They tried to give me rocephin which I denied, I explained that Rocephin causes terrible lower back pain that leaves me unable to walk. She then told me they would give me two shots of clindamycin instead. To my surprise it had acted the same way to my lower back as rocephin. A nurse came in to hand off paperwork to me and I asked her if it was supposed to feel this painful, she said it could be uncomfortable. She tried to get me to stand and move to the counter to sign paperwork so I attempted and groaned in pain as I couldn\u2019t move. She left as I started crying in pain and another woman came into the room. She was slender, tall, with brown hair and sadly I did not catch her name. She came in and demanded with an aggressive tone I stand up, I told her I could not because of the amount of pain I was in. She told me I would feel better if I stood up so I tried again and fell back on the bed due to the pain. I began crying harder because of the pain and told her once more I could not. Then she got angrier and lowered her tone with clear aggression. She told me \u201cI gave a five year old this shot and he was running around after it.\u201d I began crying even harder due to being belittled and humiliated while sitting with clear pain. She kept demanding I stand up and repeating that children run around after these shots. I told her through my tears to stop talking to me like that and she became angrier and left the room. After I signed some papers and grabbed my medication off the counter I attempted to move to the door and nearly fell to the floor. I sat in one of the chairs in my room while sobbing and heard the angry woman talking about me to the other workers outside. They began laughing after I heard her describe my situation, they laughed the entire time I was sobbing and unable to walk. My mom then texted me wondering why I wasn\u2019t out in the waiting room and told me the receptionist had told her that they were helping me to the waiting room. I texted her that I needed help to walk and she told me she was not allowed in. I then began crawling alongside the wall for support, sobbing openly from pain and humiliation I was being put through. As I was walking there were multiple workers in the main area staring at me and not offering assistance. Halfway down the hall my mother and the receptionist came to grab me as I nearly fell to the floor and helped me walk. As they opened the door the brown haired woman said \u201cMake her open the door herself, she doesn\u2019t need all that.\u201d My mother noted she saw an unused wheelchair that I could have been offered but was not. I was neglected heavily at Southern Rapid Care and will be making formal complaints. Do NOT go here.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a064c38aa97bb:0x19a3abf5bef8bd9b"}

I was literally shaking, praying I find some help knowing I'm here until Sunday. When I called and walked in I could hardly sit or move. The lady who answered the phone was like please come we can help you. I was sitting at AFC who had a sign on the door saying they were closed due to the weather. My family was hungry so I was like I can deal with it until tomorrow and maybe it would get better, knowing down deep it wasn't. I tried to have supper with them but couldn't sit without wanting to cry.  This location was close to where we were eating. I got up went across the street and found the most amazing, caring and helpful Quick Care I have ever been to. I would send anyone I know in the Orange Beach area. I'm back at our condo and can sit and enjoy my family. Thank you so much for all your help.

We originally took her somewhere closer to us in Gulf Shores but they wouldn't see patients younger than a year old (very frustrating).  This urgent care location was fantastic.  From the nurse that checked us in, to the first MA that we saw, then the Nurse Practitioner, to the doctor, they were all fantastic and seemed to really care! Part of me wanted to knock off a star because while the doctors are ER doctors and in-network with our insurance at the main hospital, this clinic is out-of-network.  But, that's not really the clinics fault as they explained in full how they continue to try and get our insurance provider to open up the clinic to them as well.  They offered us a flat rate fee or the option of filing out-of-network, and we went with the flat rate fee.  In the end, because of the x-rays, we definitely came out on the better end!

The nurses were very kind, however the doctor was rude.

I was admitted with respiratory/covid /flu type symptoms, yet wasn\u2019t tested for any of the above. Wasn\u2019t  even given anything for my fever. When I was finally released I was given scripts for different medications, than the doctor said he would give me. (After pharmacy hours). His exact words were I guess it could be viral. So basically I paid to sit in the building from 2-10 . And see a very rude provider. If that\u2019s the kind of doctors and care they offer they need to be shut down.... let me put a name to it Dr.Endfinger is a shame!!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1623163572240, "text": "Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.
