I never had the chance to even meet the doctor. Last week I was contacted by the office with an appointment based upon a referral from my primary care. The lady gave me the information to find the office and date and time of appointment. We even discussed my level of insurance so she was sure she had the correct information. I took a day off work, drove an hour and a half round trip. Only to be told I didn\u2019t have an appointment. No one was willing to even look into it or try to make another appointment for me. I was basically treated as though I had done something wrong. Mistakes happen but treating people the way I was treated by the young lady at the counter is not a mistake.\n\nUpdate added.....the office manager did reach out to me the week after I posted this review. She apologized for what had happened and told me she would look into what transpired. I appreciate her for reaching out and I hope this doesn\u2019t happen to someone else in the future", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889cff7363b7569:0xf9bae7d52906c18d"}

The morning of surgery, Dr. Habermacher came into room I ask if he was going to do scan to make sure stone was gone, he replied no, it will be gone today one way or another. I had passed very small pieces of stone but definitely not a 7mm in prior week.When I awoke from procedure I was told there was no stone, after getting home I was very sick from procedure and very sore. I went for my follow-up, I told the girl that checked me in that I was upset that he did not do KUB to make sure the stone was gone also, that I am a nurse and have had enough of kidney stone patients to know how to check for kidney stones and I definitely had not passed a 7mm. She said I will tell him, she immediately came back in room and said this is a nurse visit, he wants you to do 24 hr urine and come back in 2 months. I have no intentions of ever using him again, why would you not do a KUB or scan to make sure it's gone before putting someone through this, it sounds like it's all about money to me.

The person checking me in acted as if I should somehow know what to do and where to go. I had to ask questions about providing a urine specimen which I felt should have been part of their basic instruction to me. The only instruction I received was a hand gesture in a general direction with words stating to go into the bathroom and provide a specimen. I was not provided a specimen cup or told what to do with it. Asked these questions and received the answers. When doctor Wood came in the exam room 45 minutes after my appointment time, he was polite and professional but I felt rushed.  His response was to suggest a procedure based only on a urine sample. After seeing another doctor in another practice a couple of months later, it turns out the procedure recommended here was unnecessary and would have been quite painful.  Subsequent communications with the office were not very helpful, not fully informative, and at times not accurate.  I was directed to use the patient portal but when I inquired about missing information was told that the portal was not always complete or accurate. I was told a prescription would be called in to my pharmacy, only to be told at 4:30 pm the day before it was required for a scheduled procedure that I would have to come pick it up in person, and they close at 5 pm. And this was the result of a phone call I made, not a call from their office as they had ignored my previous messages. When I look at the other reviews I noticed 3 different 5 star reviews from the same individual. This fact combined with the fact that the reviews so far are either all 5 star or 1 star reviews makes me question the validity of the 5 star reviews.  I have since requested and been referred to a urologist in a different practice I am so far happy with. Turns out the painful procedure Dr. Wood wanted to do was unnecessary.  The new Dr. did some lab work and discovered my issue was treatable with a pill and the results have been great.  I also noticed that of the one star reviews this practice only responded to the 2 individuals who are listed as local guides. Apparently those of us who are not categorized as local guides are not important enough to respond to.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862133af32551f9:0x5b071313136561a8"}
