Love the roasted brussel sprouts and the art. Kinda overpriced for what you get. VERY salty. Hostess needs more training, to allow customers in wheelchairs to sit where they need to sit. Many of the square tables have a large chunky round center pedestal, which disallow getting under the table very far, and when I pointed this out, she did not seem too concerned, so I had to ask for another table and I remembered being seated at a certain table previously. I mentioned that. She was reluctant. I nudged. We went in that direction and I pointed out the ideal table. She offered a booth with a post at the end and I pointed out the problem, and declined. I again pointed to the table that would work, and she said that section has been cleaned and I said I see that, but...Would you like me to clear it with a manager? So she offered the table beside it, same section, because it was smaller, for our party of two. The larger table did not have a center round pedestal.

After being there and waiting for about an hour, the 4 hamburgers and 1 kids pizza we ordered finally arrived at our table. The waitress told us the wait was because medium well hamburgers take longer to cook and they had to wait on the fresh fries. I've had steaks cooked to medium well that didn't take anywhere near that amount of time, but whatever. The hamburgers were all cold and one of them had mold on the bread. The waitress got the manager who apologized and made numerous excuses, she gave us a new order of boneless wings, but by that time we had been at this restaurant for almost 2 hours after a 6 hour road trip. The calamari we ordered also didn't have any flavor at all. After this disappointing and disgusting experience,the restaurant still handed us a $37.00 bill. We paid the bill and left hungry and feeling sick to our stomach due to the sight of mold on one of the buns. My son and I had taken a few bits out of our hamburgers, so hopefully we didn't unknowingly eat any moldy bread.

They were closing at 1am and we got there about 2hrs prior to them closing. Because we've never been there before we didn't really know what we wanted so it took us about 15mins to decide in between watching the game highlights. In that time the waiter Brian(Tall guy, will make my point in a min)came back 3 separate times once with my drink and by the third time we were ready. I ordered my meal and had to speak loudly for him to hear me instead of him stooping down to hear me(1st star strike). Instead of addressing my date to what he was ordering he kept looking at me expecting me to rely the order(2nd star strike). So Chicken Alfredo was ordered with a request to add shrimp and pizza. When our order came it was obvious the waiter didn't care to do QC because there was no chicken in the \"Chicken\" Alfredo. I went to hand him the plate to take back and he waved me off saying \"no, he can start eating that and I'll bring the chicken back\" and walked away. Please tell me what's the point of ordering a entree to be prepared a specific way and then eating it made incomplete?... Then he comes back and says it will be 10mins for the chicken. Why did he bring back chopped up chicken in a little sauce dip cup. My date said not to worried about it, but I'm like this isn't worth the price. We end up asking for to go boxes and he dropped the check. When he returned with the boxes a couple mins later, he stated he would take the check now and proceed to stand over me as I looked in my purse. I guess I was taking too long for him because he felt to suggest I sit my purse on the table so I can see. I advised I didn't need any assistance and never felt soo rushed to pay the bill(3rd star strike). No we didn't want dessert, my date didn't even eat his meal, but maybe I was going to order another Topical Island(which was fruit juice with a splash of liquor, nope I'll pass).

My friend's napkin was dirty and had a stain on it. Our waitress messed up our drink orders. She was very slow and unfriendly. Ordered spinach-artichoke dip for appetizer and it barely flavorful and very watery. Food was subpar. Friend ordered steak and it was very dry and slightly burnt. The menu is entirely too big.

(incompetent means-not having or showing the necessary skills to do something successfully) She did not get our order right, she did not do her job successfully the first time...displaying incompetence.\n\n1st waitress ERROR-My food arrived way before everyone else's so I was eating and no one else had food. My beef: She works there and should understand how things work and how long it takes for different foods to be prepared and common sense says that no one wants to sit and watch everyone else eat. I know you might be thinking-what if she was new? Nope she was not knew. She was not asking anyone questions and she was not shadowing another waiter/waitress.\n\nKITCHEN-It took foreeeeever for the remaining food items to come out and they were not busy. It was not slow, but it was not so busy that a person would look around and think it was going to take a while before the food came. There were many empty parking spaces and we were seated immediately.\n\n2nd waitress ERROR-When the remaining food items FINALLY came out one food order was WRONG. She argued with me about what I asked for and although she took the food back she did so in a huff and grudgingly so.\nKitchen-Again we had to wait a loooooong time for the final food item to come out. When she brought the fixed food back the toppings were sparse in comparison to the first one. Time stamps on our receipts prove that it took forever. The time between placing our order (when the order was put in) and receiving our ticket (shortly after receiving the final sparse food item) was 2 1/2 hours.\n\n3rd waitress ERROR-When she brought the check she \"apologized\", but it was terse, gruff, grudgingly done, and quickly mumbled. The biggest thing is the WAY she worded it to make it seem as though it were my fault that SHE got our order wrong. She said \"sorry for your miscommunication\". I was calm and kept my comments to myself. I was not rude and we tipped her well, because we are Christians and that is what we do. In my head and speaking with my husband my thoughts went more like: Really lady! It is your job, your goal, your mission, the REASON you get PAID = to take the customer's order right and get it right...the FIRST time!\n\n4th waitress ERROR-she did NOT repeat the order back. If she was CONFUSED about my request then she should have clarified BEFORE placing the order. Again part of her job and if she can't do her job properly then she needs to find other work.\n\nThe food was mediocre and overpriced, it took FOREVER for our food to arrive, and our waitress was very rude and incompetent (incompetent means-not having or showing the necessary skills to do something successfully).

She continued to give us a small tour of the menu (which is giant) but gives plenty to desire. We proceeded to get the avacado egg rolls (her recommendation) and we absolutely loved them. Following the appetizer we got the ribeye, cooked to perfection, and the Mediterranean tacos (I was torn between those and the mahi tacos.) the manager Chelsea stopped by the bar and spoke to us, she was very nice and professional and asked us how our experience was. We decided to write a review to let the manager know that we thoroughly enjoyed our experience and will be back in to sit with Ashley! We have since been in multiple times with the best experiences.

I'm very excited and hope you enjoy yourself there.\n\n(Okay... open on invite only) so B.J.s is still the same classy bar I knew it as. Mobile. Don't be hesitant on trying a dark beer. BJ's house Porter called BJ's PM Porter (ABV 5.5%) is smooth and decadent in a 16 Oz pour. It's also cost-effective. The BJ'S Tatonka Stout is 8.5% ABV in a 11oz glass is plenty to get to you in the right spot!\n\nTry anything with frys. Believe me they are best. You have never seen a frys like it. It appears to have no seasoning at all but clearly it you're going to ask how they did that. :) You will notice you have not even dipped the frys in ketchup yet and there half gone.

Brown walls, 3 TV\u2019s with no volume, music with very low volume, and nothing to offer to drive in locals college students. Simple changes could be made to make a big difference such as live music or jukebox, food trucks or local food delivery, 2x4 Jenga, trivia, remove wooden picnic tables as the main seating, increase the bar size, hire outgoing staff, post either two menus or a much larger menu, add additional brews or even a home-brewed rootbeer or kambucha, offer flights.\n\nThis is was a visit while in town, and it has potential, but I likely wont go back on my next visit. Both IPA\u2019s tasted a little flat, and not very hoppy. Really disappointed as I was anxious to try this place.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1566336898746, "text": "Bobby,\nWe are so sorry your experience was not what you expected. We have recently done some renovations, including new paint/bar, a second menu, and are working on the number of events to appeal to the local students. Our current brewer is working hard to improve on old beers and diversify our menu (including Root Beer!). Please consider giving us another try next time you're in town!
