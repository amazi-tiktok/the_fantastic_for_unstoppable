I was visiting the area. I had researched for a doctrinally sound congregation. Although many Churches of Christ are in the area Panama Street Church of Christ was recommended. I was told that Brother Frank Chesser was scripturally sound and that the one true Gospel was preached at Panama Street. It was a distinct privilege to meet Brother Chesser and all the other members there. Panama Street is an excellent place to worship and learn God's Word. At Panama Street the brethren do not gather to be entertained. They gather to worship God in Spirit and in Truth.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81ec83ab9669:0xc032ee421b8f5522"}
