Had it tuned up by a Yamaha technician and believed I had a great sounding piano.  I had Ben at Pro Piano refurbish and repair the inner-workings and I am stunned.  I am not lying when I tell you this piano does not sound like the piano I purchased even after it was tuned.  It sounds better than when I bought it and it has been tuned numerous times over the years.  A far more richer and fuller tone quality than it has ever had before.  He will soon be nursing by G-3 Yamaha back to its pristine original quality.  So thankful I landed on PPS.  I am a church musician and in charge of numerous pianos over 30 years and have experienced at least a dozen or more tuners and technicians.  Trust me when I tell you that not every piano tuner is proficient at their craft.   Ben is professional, courteous, and communicates well the needs your piano has to bring it to its best condition.  Every penny you spend is worth it.  He will care for your piano as if it was his own because he understands the emotional attachments we make with these instruments that bring us joy.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x80ec195dfff19ba5:0xe25ea318724d49a"}

Purchasing a piano is a matter of very personal taste and preference...what matters most to David Ellis and his sons is quite simply whatever matters most to you.  My husband recently surprised me by taking me to Ellis to pick out the piano of my dreams.  While they could have pushed me to purchase on the spot, they did exactly the opposite and accommodated me on multiple visits to make certain I went home with the instrument I not only liked....but with which I fell in love (as did my husband).  They went out of their way to educate us about the instruments and encouraged me not to settle.  Not once did I feel pushed to make a purchase.  David and his sons knew this was a very special gift from my husband and they went above and beyond to make sure it was all he wanted for me...and all I wanted as well.  The Ellis family knows pianos, they know the value of a good investment, they know the value of superior customer service, they are approachable and meet every pianist on their level - from the young child just beginning lessons to the most accomplished world-renown performers and everyone in between and they treat them all with the same utmost care and respect.  When you select a piano from Ellis, you receive not only a stellar instrument suited just for you, but also the benefit of a family legacy based on fulfilling musicians\u2019 dreams.  If you\u2019re in the market for a piano, question no further where you should go...Ellis Piano is your answer.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a3544961c1:0x4e608e6bb337b439"}
