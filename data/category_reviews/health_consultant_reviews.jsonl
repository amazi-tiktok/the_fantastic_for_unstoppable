I was impressed with his knowledge and ability in the area of health and fitness. Elliott is all about community. He's played a huge role in helping me establish my non-profit, Scarlett's Closet . He's even a member of my board.\nLast year, after attending one of the fundraisers Live Ready hosts for us annually, I saw pictures of myself at the event and realized I needed to take control of my life and be the healthiest version of Lisa I can be. I started doing workouts in my home and making better food choices. By May of this year, I'd lost 41Lbs, but the scales had stopped moving. I reached out to Elliott and he told me I was most likely in a calorie deficit.  I recall my response; I laughed at him. He encouraged me to sign up for  a \"Love to Eat Challenge\" Through this challenge, I was taught what to eat and how my plate should look. I am happy to report that I won the challenge and to date, I have lost 64lbs. I am wearing the smallest clothes I've ever worn as an adult. I recently had surgery and  Elliott has asked me to start training with him once my Doctor clears me to do so.  In the past, I would have said, \"No way.\" Now, I have the confidence I need to accept the challenge.\nIf you are looking to make positive changes in your life, I urge you to contact Elliott and his team. They are not only the best at what they do, but some of the nicest and most encouraging people you will ever meet. You won't feel pressured or intimidated. I am grateful for all their help and encouragement. I've never felt better. Isn't it time you took the first step to a healthier you? call them today!\nLisa P.

That's $1440 for a year. I think what turned me away was the amount of willingness to work with folks like myself, whom are rarely here due to work. It was pretty clear that $120 was the price and nothing less than military orders would change that. Even then the offer sounded less than ideal. So, that's the business side.\n\nThe workout side of this facility seemed... Alright. The facility was great as were the staff and customer personalities and support. Going back to the money, I definitely don't believe the training I saw warranted the price. I saw more flexion in lower back than I care to see-not just from young/new members. My fear of CrossFit gyms is always seeing atrocious form, and although that wasn't the case here (form wasn't... Terrible...) It still wasn't good enough for the hefty price. I could get a personal coach for the same and get precise, individual training for less money and same or better quality.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1507482201039, "text": "We are so sorry to hear that you do not agree with the price we charge.

We also realize that people\u2019s form are less then perfect but everyone comes in moving different, with different mobility problems and different degrees of fitness and athleticism. Some of those people take years of work to make the smallest change but I assure you that our coaches work tirelessly to do so and our athletes make dramatic improvements in quality of movement and life!

I was sitting next to a friend and her results were completely different form mine. I had been eating a lot of sweets and breads and they told me yeast was coming out of my body. My friend had eaten a lot of fish that week and she was having mercury released out of her body. I was in awe of my results from the foot detox!
