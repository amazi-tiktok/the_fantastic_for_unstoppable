She told me I HAD to go to a branch in person to close my acct.. or I will still be charged a $5 maintenance fee..she also told me I would be charged a $35 fee if there's no money in the acct,on top of the$5.. needless to say when I hung up the phone I was very stressed & displeased..\nI call the BBT on hwy72 in Madison AL.. I didn't need to say much of anything, the lady I spoke to was MORE than happy to help. INFACT, she told me the complete opposite from what this pelham branch told me.. that she could close it over the phone, easy! I just need to take my money out..&, she would keep an eye on my acct for me. THAT'S good customer service!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888924100877e9b9:0x58cac67f4b86b170"}

On the 13th the payment still wasn't pending so I called back and the whoever I spoke with informed me when they switched it they set it up to come out August 12th so we would not have a payment coming out in July because we had been paying over the whole time we have had the car. On July 16th the payment suddenly comes out, overdrafting our account and leaving us with no money to get groceries, gas, ECT. Then when I try to call 30mins before they close they didn't answer. I tried to call for 20mins straight. Finally get in touch with corporate only to find out the information I received on the 13th was all a lie.

He also made sure I knew where the office was (which was a good thing because I had them confused with another place in town).\n\nI went in to the office and the whole process took about 90 minutes from the time I walked in until I had a check. I was disappointed at the amount I was offered but my car is a 2006 model and is not in the best condition so could not really argue, particularly since I REALLY needed the money right away.

Miss a payment and good luck on catching up. 5k turned to 8k in super fast and they could care less about trying to help you. They just tell you to pay full balance and that's only option. Even with all covid things that happening around the world they don't care to help you or try and work with you at all. Maybe a place to get 100 if your in a pinch but other than that they are going to scam you in anyway they possibly can.

I sent my car that was under warranty to Chatom Ford. That was one of my worst mistakes possible. The first week of their service was promising. After that it was all down hill. Shade the \u201cService Manager\u201d was my main point of contact. He would promise me updates and call backs which I would never get a returning call. On October 16th I was PROMISED my car was repaired and ready for pick up. As I had two friends take off work to take me 5.5 hours to Chatom Ford, Shade called me and said \u201cthe car jumped time and is not ready\u201d. The following day I called to get the new date  I could expect my car to be repaired.  Shade then tells me that he had been lying to me and my car was not ready and he does not know why my car is not fixed nor when it could be fixed. During this call he also promised me that the car would be sent to my house in Tennessee. After Shade continued to lie about my car and repairing it, I then moved to speaking with Collin Ward (General Manager)-  I only spoke with him once because he told me \u201c I\u2019m sure what you are saying MAY have happened, but im sure my team has a better way of going about this story\u201d. He also promised I would get a call back from him and I never did. Collin also asked me why I would even send my car here with it being out of state and not send it local (I was on my way back from vacation on the coast when it happened). In my opinion, this should not matter. With no hope, I called asking for the owner, Gene Brown. No one would help me reach him. Then I finally received a call from Kevin O\u2019Brien. He was very promising and reassuring at first as they all were. Kevin worked with my father and I for about two weeks then he stated to not take our calls or call us back as promised. Last, my father began to work with Lara. She was helpful in helping us know what was going on. She is who we worked with for the rest of this mayhem. 99 days later on December 18th Chatom Ford met me in Mississippi to give me my car. This dealership is an ACTUAL JOKE. From day one I asked for nothing but updates and I never once got that. NOT ONE WORKER AT THIS PLACE (I say place because I can not call this a business because this place has no business structure at all.) was truthful in customer service to my father or myself. If anyone at this place has any further questions feel free to contact me as you have my name and number. PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME BY NOT SENDING YOUR CAR HERE. THIS MANAGEMENT IS A JOKE AND ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS IN THEIR PROFESSION.\nThank you for the worst Ford experience I could ever ask for. You really make a name for yourself.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889b2f2fd3de232d:0x35a64c5f4f9d8ae5"}

It's like you almost have to stand in the middle of the floor and yell \" CAN I GET SOME HELP IN HERE PLEASE!!!\". Staff in the service department will just sit behind their little desks and won't even acknowledge that you are in there until you get right in their face and tell them you need service. Maybe they are trained to be that way because customer service is only as good as the people who manage and run the company. Dreadfully, when your vehicle goes to the back to be serviced, be prepared bring breakfast, lunch and dinner with you because you're stuck and at the mercy of Jim Burke service department. I had a staff member to tell me it will take about an hour and a half for an oil change and it turned to three and a half hours. I asked a staff member how long before my vehicle is finished in two hours. The staff member check and he told me it was still on the rack. At the last service appointment, my vehicle sat on the street when they finished with the doors unlocked for I don't know how long after service and I had to hunt down a staff member to get my keys. No one came to the waiting room to let me know my vehicle was ready. And that side of town in Birmingham has vehicles broken into all the time. So let me end this rant by saying there needs to be some checks and balances of the staff at Jim Burke service department because customer service is little to none there.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b8c12068ef7:0x6f980372d2b288cd"}

I had a flat tire on a Friday afternoon so I called Jim Burke right away thinking they could help me. When I called, I asked them if they have the tire in stock and when they could get me in but the guy on the phone kept saying \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u201d, \u201c I might have to order it\u201d \u201cmaybe you could come in...\u201d. I asked him if he could check his inventory because I really needed my car for work Monday. He told me to call back the next morning. I re-explained to him that I really needed to figure this out because I drive for work and needed my car situated by Monday.\nI called Saturday morning - he said they didn\u2019t have the tire in stock and they\u2019d have to order it. Then he asked me repeatedly what tire I had and I told him multiple times what was written on the tire. He called back several more times to confirm what the tire was. Then he said he didn\u2019t know when the tire would be in, maybe Tuesday or Wednesday.\nI called Monday morning to see if they had any update on when the tire would come in but the service department didn\u2019t answer. Then I called someone that I had been in contact with in the leasing department. They tried to get a hold of someone in service. By the end of the day the only thing they could tell me is that they didn\u2019t know when the tire would be in because the guy who helped me Saturday was not in. I emphasized that I really needed my car for work and that I\u2019d been driving on a spare. They said they\u2019d  probably have a loaner car to give me on Tuesday but they\u2019d have to get back with me in the morning.\nTuesday - I heard nothing all day. No updates about my tire. Heard nothing back about the loaner. Finally I called someone in the leasing department again around 3 and they said \u201cno ones called you yet??\u201d\nBy the time the guy finally got back with me he said he hasn\u2019t been able to locate the loaner that it \u201cdisappeared\u201d, he didn\u2019t know why so many people were involved in this, and that the tire was still not in and he didn\u2019t know when it would come.  I told him that I was frustrated and I needed either a tire or a loaner. He said if he would have known this Friday he would have given me a loaner............\n\nWednesday morning I was finally able to pick up a loaner car and then my tire came in and I picked up my car Thursday.\n\nNot sure why I had to chase down this guy. He couldn\u2019t tell me straight whether they carried the tire on the car that I leased from them. And his problem solving skills were just not there. The whole experience was frustrating and now I\u2019m not looking forward to ever getting my car serviced there - especially if I have to work with this guy every time.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1525719215730, "text": "We're extremely sorry to hear of the poor experience that you had with our service department.

They are short handed so, you won't get a status of what's going on, the shuttle service ends at three and if your car is or isn't ready before then- no one calls you. When you call them, you aren't likely to get an answer or a call back. My car sit there for more than 24 hours ready, with nothing more to do to it, but because of miscommunication - I guess no one figured I needed a car within that time period. I don't know the thought processes behind this, no one figured I would need to make plans to get to and from work maybe that's why I couldn't get status on my vehicle.\n\nI was guaranteed my issue was taken care of and I was told it was road tested for the shaking I was experiencing.

As far as people coming in and out either ahead or after you it is difficult to comment as to why because we offer multiple services through multiple auto manufactures that have quick service options like Oil changes, filter replacements, etc. Your vehicle was in for an electrical diagnosis which can take more time. It appears that there was an issue with the wiring harness, which was repaired, also a possibility of another issue with the third brake light that would have resulted from the wiring harness short. When the third brake light was tested at the time of service it tested good, but had symptoms that could result in a possible failure in the future. However, we could not definitively say that it had failed and wouldn\u2019t want to sell anything that is not needed. The estimate that was provided on your receipt was discounted to absorb the labor cost in the event it did fail at a later date keeping you from paying double labor. As far as contacting you when the vehicle was completed it is our practice to stay in constant contact as discussed with the customer and to contact once the vehicle is complete. We do not show the specifics as to when you were contacted but do have that the vehicle was completed around 12:00 p.m. If you were not contacted promptly or at all when the vehicle was completed we will address that directly with the advisor that assisted you. Again we apologize that you received less than an ideal service visit. We hope that you can give us the opportunity to make your future visits much better.\""}, "gmap_id": "0x88891b8c12068ef7:0x6f980372d2b288cd"}

We are not newbies at Jim Burke.  Actually we vowed to never do business with them again due to an experience in the Nissan new car department we had in 2013.  The agent we initially dealt with was not thorough and didn't really seem to be interested in satisfying us, but instead wanted to just sell a car. My husband knew what he was looking for. The only reason we purchased the car was because it was exactly what I wanted.  Leading up to my retirement,  my husband,  Mike wanted to surprise me with my dream car which was an infinity Q50. Just so happened,  he observed the vehicle on the internet. Now from my understanding,  he wasn't looking to get it from them but more so wanted to see how the agents intentions for their customers' would be like. He made communication with Mr. JONT\u00c9 WILLIAMS.  Well apparently Mr. Williams knows how to deal with hard rock minds like my husband.  Mike is a straight up business man who looks for people to hang themselves once he's had bad experiences with them but this was the case. Jont\u00e9 was very professional but also displayed a great people oriented level of customer relation and appreciation.  Mike told me that Jont\u00e9 was not pushy and that he was all about making sure I was happy with my retirement gift. When my husband told me what was going on, I did everything I could to make it known that I didn't want to go over there but when my husband said he was working with Jim Burke again,  I  knew it had to be ok. Well upon actually meeting Mr. Williams, I  observed him to be a very confident man in his spirit.  He is very comfortable with people such as my husband and when I saw them laughing and talking,  I  knew he, Mr. Williams, was trustworthy of giving our time and business to him. Jont\u00e9 relating to me reminded me of a non paternal big brother I have. He kept me laughing but at the same time he took the time to make sure that I was comfortable with the decision to accept the infinity Q50. Dont\u00e9 really took care of us and put our mindset at ease when it came to purchasing future vehicles from Jim Burke. We would defiantly refer others to your business. Thank you Jont\u00e9 for your professionalism,  and I look forward to seeing you again.\n\nTracy McCall and Michael McCall", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1465313515714, "text": "Thank you for sharing your positive experience with us!

People write bad reviews for reason. I saw all of the great reviews here and I figured that this would be a decent place to purchase a vehicle for rebuilding credit. However, I was wrong. All of the bad reviews here are accurate. I've even waited 9 days to post this review because I didn't want to do it out of anger. I wanted to make sure that I am not in my emotions and being fair about what I am saying. I do not take any pleasure in writing this bad review.\n\nI was strung along from this company for 18 days. I needed a vehicle because I had just come in town from across the country. These people claimed that I was going to put down $1200 for a 2006 Escalade. I never said that I was going to put down that much. I also have a call recorder app on my phone that records EVERY CALL. I went back and reviewed those calls and never in any of those audio's did I ever say that I was going to put down that much. As a matter of fact, I asked Jennifer specifically, \"About how much are my payments going to be?\" The only thing that was discussed was that it would be $175 every 2 weeks.\n\nThey went ahead \"processed\" My application. Jennifer came back and let me know that I was approved. However, the vehicle had several different issues that they needed to fix. Jennifer told me that it had to be put in the shop and that they didn't want me to have it in that condition. At the same time other customers, that had already purchased vehicles from this dealership, were bringing cars back because they were having issues with them. This was a major red flag for me. I kept getting put to the back burner because other people were bringing their cars back that they purchased from there, that needed to be fixed. I said that twice y'all. Think about that.\n\nIn the meantime, I didn't have a car and needed to get around. I asked Jennifer for a loaner, and she said they were \"reluctant\" to give me one because I'd be expecting that level of service all the time. But they wanted to get my business, so they provided me with an ugly Kia. It was ugly, but at least I could get to Walmart, ya know?\n\nThey finally got the Escalade fixed and ready by July 10th. Dave called me and let me know that it was ready. I drove the ugly Kia back to them. When I got there, I test drove the Escalade. I didn't like how bad the inside looked, but it's a 2006. There's obviously going to be a lot of wear and tear. Tracy asked me how much I was going to put down? I told her $500. She told me that Jennifer told her that we had already discussed the down payment. I told her no, she did not discuss that with me. The only thing that was discussed was the $175 every 2 weeks.\n\nSo of course they went and called Jennifer. And of course, they came back and told me that she said she discussed that with me. They would not be able to accept anything less than $1000. And then very callously, Tracy told Dave, \"Take her home.\" I said, \"Damn, y'all not even trying to work with me?\" Nope. I didn't argue. I just gave them the key back and Dave drove me home apologizing.\n\nI emailed them the audio proving what was said, and got crickets. They were caught in a lie.\n\nLast week, I needed to get to the VA....I am a disabled veteran. It is important that if I need medical care, I have a way to get there so that I can receive what I need. I did not have a vehicle to get my medical care. I don't think these people even thought of how this was going to affect me. But something that I have learned is that if you are constantly being blocked for something, then spiritually, you are being blocked and protected for reason. And I think that I may have dodged a bullet with these people.\n\nSo everyone, please heed this warning. ALL of these bad reviews that are on here are here for a reason. I'm not bashing these people, I'm just stating the facts.\n\nI hope that this never happens to any of them or their loved ones.\n\nPatronize this business at your own risk.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1595369908253, "text": "At Credit Now Auto Sales our goal is to provide the highest level of customer service experience.

The phrase \u2018used car salesman\u2019 is seldom used as a compliment, but this is the one place that in all my adult years, I never expected to find. They do everything in their power to work with you. From your budget, to the table, they never rushed us for a sale or pushed us for more money, and have always stood behind their word. There truly is no other dealership in the greater Huntsville area, that compares. Call and ask for Mike, he\u2019s a true standup guy! I am happy to call New Car Auto Sales, MY dealership and I hope you will too.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b8248756407:0xecb35d010b2f0fa2"}

They had my truck a little over a week and claim it was not doing anything for them and that it was old codes showing up. Well since I have had my vehicle back it once again started doing the same thing showing up the same codes. I decided to take it to another dealership and to my surprise the codes that they told me was old was not old they just cleared them instead of fixing my truck.

They have gone above and beyond every single time. I'm not a crying person but they've made me cry twice. The good cry. The first time: I assume they saw the toy factory and smashed snacks in the carpet or maybe it was my food covered shirt and crazy hair. Either way, they gave me a note of encouragement that every mom needs sometimes with a gift card for coffee. The second time: I requested a larger loaner vehicle which is apparently hard to come by. Along with my 3 kids, my dad is in a wheelchair and I transport him to/from dialysis and we just all wouldn't fit in the smaller one. They greeted me with a \"one tough cookie\" box with treats and snacks galore.\n\nThey are the nicest people and so accommodating. Add uplifting to that mix. That was this exhausted Mama's gift from heaven.\n\nI can't say enough good things about them. I would buy every vehicle from them a thousand times over just to show my appreciation to their service department.

I told him they could stop and I'll bring in the light myself after buying it cheaper elsewhere. He tells me I will still have to pay $135 for the diagnostic. No problem.

Things didn't go quite as we had planned. Our SUV was cutting out pretty bad on the highway. It was getting worse the closer we got to Mobile. I contacted my friend who's daughter lives in Mobile to see if she might know of a service place. I talked with her daughter and she informed me that her husband, Kyle, worked for Joe Bullard Cadillac. She gave me the number for the service department and said to speak with Haley.  About this time the check engine light came on in our vehicle. It was flashing on and off, then would stay lit.\nWhen I spoke with Haley in the service department she asked about the service engine light. When I told her it had been flashing intermittently she was immediately concerned and said we should get stopped as quickly as we could to avoid internal engine damage.  She then helped us get started with finding a tow service. We were 50 miles aWay and had four people so their usual towing service couldn't do it, but she got the ball rolling for us. She gave me her direct phone number so I could call if I needed anything.\nOnce we got to the dealership Kyle helped us get a loaner car while ours was being repaired. Haley kept us informed as they learned what was wrong. Our technician, Mike, came in on Saturday to work on our vehicle because we needed to leave to head back to Missouri on Sunday.\nTo make a long story short...God used all of these people to help us during a difficult time. They made this experience so much less stressful than it could've been. THEY WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND TO HELP US! And, they did it all with a smile. We appreciate the dealership and all the individuals who helped get us back on the road.

What I didn't like was that the mechanics were excessively rough with my vehicle. I had to have it towed and the towing company left it at the gate. Christian got me a loaner car, which I appreciated very much. When I picked up the loaner there were 2 guys who were trying to get it started to get it up to the shop. I needed to grab a couple things out of my car so I stopped to do that. For some reason they needed to open the back hatch. I was traveling with my animals so I had a large kennel in the back. I watched them put my seats down (rather roughly) and sling my kennel from the back to atop the back seats. It made me cringe but at this point I needed to get going as I had some stops to make and  I thought surely they knew what they were doing, this is a Cadillac dealership afterall and these cars cost a lot. They will surely be careful... When I got my car back, instead of them putting the vehicle back they way they found it, the kennel was still strown across the back. (As a plus though, it was washed! Which I appreciated since I had been on the road and try to take care of my car!) When I went to move the kennel back in place I noticed that there are scrapes across the plastic sides in the back. Greeeeaaaaaat. But, at that point I was leaving to head back to my home state and couldn't worry about it. It was more important to get home safe. They told me in addition to the battery that I needed new air filters, a rear wiper blade, and the throttle body cleaned, all easy enough for me to do myself. So, now I am here doing said maintenance and when I popped the hood I immediately noticed that my positive battery terminal clip has been broken and won't stay shut. Great. I am now back home, 3 states away. I will be back to the area, and am considering moving my family there but if they don't make this right I will find a different dealership to maintenance at.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1517174513045, "text": "Hi Jami,\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave your review and detailed feedback.

The moment my fiance and I pulled up to the dealership we felt welcome. Mustafa Elastal immediately greeted us and made us feel important. He went out of his way to make us feel comfortable as he walked around the lot with us picking out suitable vehicles. This was very important to me considering I had never owned a Cadillac before. His extensive knowledge of the vehicle I wanted (XTS) and the history of Cadillac itself impressed me by far. The hospitality didn't stop with Mustafa. Roosevelt Harris also did a fine job answering all the questions I had about the different cars and prices. He also mentioned a couple of nice restaurants we could try out while visiting Atlanta, GA which we did and absolutely loved. Curtis Williams came by and personally greeted us and also had a nice conversation with my fiance. Last, but definitely not least, Jon McCartney was absolutely amazing (and not just because he actually knows where Winnfield, LA is located lol). He worked very hard to get the financing I needed to get the exact vehicle I wanted. It was a hard sale for me, but he showed us that he wouldn't give up. I really appreciated all the time that each of them took out to make our experience the best car buying experience we have had.

He offered his help and we told him we were in town to Christmas shop not spend all day at a dealership, we just wanted to try the car on for size. he escorted us inside for coffee and cocoa and went to get the car. we test drove it. we loved it but we were not there to spend all day at the dealership. we left our personal information to be reviewed and were going to shop when Darren notified us that we would be using the cadillac for the day via loaner form approval. we really enjoyed using the car. we Christmas shopped all day and when we returned to the dealership we had been approved for the car with our payments within dollars of request. Jon McCartney had to have been the most professional financial manager i have ever encountered. He was a real person who made us feel right at home and comfortable to speak openly. very friendly and personable. then Roosevelt Harris enters the picture. a gem. a diamond in the rough. so charismatic so joyful and helpful and accomodating. I cannot put into words how much Darren helped to familiarize us with the cue and features. he was so knowledgable of the cars systems. he was an absolute treasure. I cant say but one thing about Joe Bullards team, \"you are doing something right\". I got hugs from everyone when i left. i felt like i was part of a family there. I even got a text message from Darren on Christmas morning wishing us a merry Christmas. i literally spent 2 hrs tops at the dealership and received the most beautiful CHristmas gift I could have ever dreamed of. but the most inportant thing was the environment and kindness that we experienced while there. oh and my son loved the lounge with computers and coffee/cocoa which made his time there enjoyable also. we will definitely reccomend Joe Bullard Cadillac to friends and family and we will definitely be repeat customers ourselves. my only hope is that we have the privilege of having the same staff in years to come.

In September 25th I went in to car mart to purchase a vehicle. The salesman \u201cMonica\u201d greeted me and gave me a seat. Monica or Monic. then left me with paperwork to fill out and other reps came in and out of the office to conduct the sale. I arrived about 11 or noon. Finally a manager Darrell I think his name was, came into the office and offered a sales pitch that required several ballon payments throughout the term of contract three of those to be set as the first three payments of $575 after that payments would go to $318 for two months then another balloon payment of over $900 another set for next year for $700. But in between the mom you would be $318. I was okay with those and paid the first two actually before due date. The problem came when the check engine light didn\u2019t go off I took it back and talked to Tim. He advised me that I didn\u2019t have a warranty package plan (something extra you have to pay) but that he would get it into the shop and fix the issue. I drop the truck off about a week after I had it and about the 4th day he said I could come and pick it up. I was given paperwork showing that the 0-2 sensor was out and charged $400 something for repairs but would not have to pay it all at once that another side note of about $30 per month could be added. I drove home thinking the repair was completed. But the check engine light never went off so I called back to car mart and expressed this issue to them. I was told by Tim to take the truck to get another diagnostic test. Upon arrival the diagnosis was shown that the 0-2 sensor was NOT fixed. I asked the guy if he was sure because car mart charged me $400 to fix. He said yes the 0-2 sensor is not fixed. I called back to car mart Tim said he would get the truck back to the shop to fix. So I paid the $575 plus $30 repair side note thinking they would fix, but that never happened. Today is Christmas Eve and still have not gotten it fixed they keep saying they will get it back to the shop but that has not happened. I received several calls about the non payment of the repair side note because I stop paying that side note after I realized they weren\u2019t going to fix it. All of the brakes went out and so did the two back rotors and one caliber. (The brake light was also on when I bought it) I understand that it won\u2019t be perfect it\u2019s used. The truck also recently stopped going in reverse or any gear for that matter it is stuck in my yard. At this point I\u2019m over shoving money into it and dealing with the lies. I\u2019m just going to give it back to them and find a cash paid car.

She honestly asked me why I didn\u2019t call her when I was in surgery?!? I explained that on top of making my arrangements for my son and work, I did not think about calling about my payment which I typically make at Walmart. I explained to her I would like to make the payment, however physically I can not get to Walmart. I even offered to give her my doctor\u2019s information and email my medical release. Long story short, after she interrogated me with very personal questions I felt uncomfortable answering. she tells me to send my ex husband with the payment?!? It was surreal. I understand I have a payment owed. So, now I am dragging my broken foot to get to Walmart on crutches. I\u2019m not suppose to drive as it\u2019s my right foot, hence what you drive with.

If I was told I wouldn't of agreed to 50 dollars just to put a tire on. Because they \"don't cover tires and brakes\" I was left with the bill.\n\nFew months down the road I had a blowout on the tire that the caliper was replaced. Their technician stripped a lug nut so bad that it couldn't be taken off by normal means. I had to have my car towed and the lug nut had to be taken off with a blow torch.  Another $200.00 out of my pocket because of them.  Not to mention that the mechanic who took the flat off told me that the calipers that are on it look as old as the car does, so I'm left wondering what happened to the new calipers that I paid for.\n\nMost of the people there are nice, which I greatly appreciate. However, the rudeness and abrasiveness of the new GM, the issue with my calipers and how it was handled, then having to pay to get towed and a flat took off because of their technicians ignorance,  this vehicle will be my first and last business transaction with them.

They came back with each of us paying half so, we decided to buy the car.\n\nThey told us that they could get us a killer interest rate of less than one percent. When we got back to financing, it was another story entirely. We ended up wit ha 4.99 interest rate because \"less than one percent is only for \"new\" cars\" well when you were trying to negotiate this deal you said it was a new car and now that we are financing you've classified it as a \"used\" car.\n\nAfter we left, we began driving to my dad's house which is probably 100 miles away. The check engine light came on before we got there. We had O'Reily's check the computer and they said it was low oil pressure. We called and they has us call the Mazda tow truck to come pick it up and take it to the nearest Mazda which was in Birmingham. (They told me to get a rental during this time and they would pay me back.) They called for me to come pick it up three or four days later saying it was a computer problem and it was fixed. When we got there, 4 error messages were popping up on the dash. We left the car and called the sales manager at Julio Jones Mazda who never called us back and said he never got our message.\n\nI went in to talk to the Julio Jones Mazda sales manager about this problem on Monday. They had me sit there for a while and eventually said they spoke with the technician at the Birmingham Mazda and they said I must have taken my foot off the brake too early and it caused the car to throw up those error messages. So, they blamed me for the problem.\n\nLater, the technician from Birmingham called us personally and said they had screwed up and not fixed it properly to begin with. So, the sales manager at Julio Jones Mazda was either misinformed or blatantly lied to make me think it was my fault.\n\nWell, we finally got the car back and it has been running fine. No more issues. However, they still haven't paid me back for the rental and it's been almost a month. I called about this and they said they lost my receipt and asked me for the amount again. I still haven't been paid and they haven't bothered to call me back. That was a week ago.\n\nSimultaneously, I took the car in to the Julio Jones service center to get the remote start put in on a Thursday. They told me it would take a day, maybe two, to get this done. The service center is telling me that I owe our half of the remote start that was supposed to be included in the deal. Obviously, they didn't include it in the price like they said they would. Also, they had to give me a rental car because they couldn't get the remote start to work. It's now Monday and I have no clue when I am going to get my car back. I called today and they said they still couldn't get the remote start to work.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't wish this headache on anyone and I wouldn't recommend this dealership to anyone. It has been an absolute nightmare since we signed for this vehicle.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1554413123364, "text": "Hi Dylan, thank you for your feedback.

Go to pick car up , call first ,they tell me I gotta pay 75.00 for service contract plus my car payment which just came due today !

I traded in my Monte Carlo and was only given $700 for it plus I had to put down an extra $300 to get a vehicle. My first vehicle was a jeep grand Cherokee, I had it for 2 weeks and the steering column broke. I had to call and harass them for 3 days before they finally came and picked it up and let me get something different. I got a Ford edge and the battery warning light was came on. I informed them about the issue and was told by the sales associate to bring it back the following Monday because his words \"It's not my job to replace a battery.\" I drove it and the dashboard lights, radio, and headlights were shutting off as I was driving down the road. It ended up breaking down and they wouldn't come pick it up. It ended up getting impounded and I had to pay the inbound lot fee and a tow truck to come hey I and take it to a mechanic for a diagnosis. The alternator and a plug for the oil pan were supposed to be replaced. I was called saying it was ready, when I arrived, the battery light was still on and i informed them and they tested the battery and said it might be a computer issue. I drove it and once again the radio, dashboard lights and headlights are turning on and off again and the dashboard warning lights lit up as well. I had the alternator tested and it wasn't replaced like they said it was. A radiator hose busted and the battery is dead. For anybody looking to buy a vehicle, go elsewhere.\n\nUpdate: I got it back and it broke down again. They didn't fix all of the problems except for the alternator, but they didn't replace the plug and it leaked oil all on the brand new alternator. They picked it up and put a new alternator and fixed the plug. It broke down again in less than a week. All this time, I made my $225 payments every 2 weeks. It spent more time in the shop than in my possession and I had to make the payments on it regardless. I get a call telling me that the water pump is messed up and the engine will soon be messed up. I was told that I could either be traded into a different vehicle using the $1000 I put down or I could get that $1000 back, but the $675 that I paid out for my payments I don't get back. I've talked to the lot manager and the area manager and they're telling me that there's no way for me to get the money that I made my payments with back, only the $1000.

The day after I purchased my Cadillac from them the check engine light came on and water poured into my closed sunroof. I immediately decided to evoke my 3 day return agreement, but the GM was \"out of town\" and she was the only one that could approve this. Upon her return I was told that I'd had the car almost a week and could not bring it back. I felt Trapped, had the car diagnosed and it was the sensors. Time went by and the car sounded horrible. Had to pay to have it diagnosed and it was the timing chain rattling extremely loud, the pieces that hold the timing chain in place had broken off and were in the oil and the catalytic converter was bad. Had it towed to the lot to be repaired per the repair agreement I paid for when the car was purchased. The current GM stated \"my car would be ready in about a week and these engines are known to have this timing chain issue issue\".  As a small business owner (at the time) caretaker for my disabled ill Mother and 5 year old I needed a vehicle but figured we have no choice since they do not offer a loaner. A week went by no car, a few weeks went by and STILL no car 4 weeks went by and NO CAR! It was extremely cold and this is our only vehicle to get to clients homes, work, moms critical dr appointments,  the store, pharmacy ect. I lost clients, Bill's fell behind and almost lost my home due to this. I begged the GM Amy to please just put me in another vehicle I didnt even care if I had to take a loss, but was told that was not an option. Finally got the car back and it ran ok at first, but the check engine light came back on about a week later. A few months go by and the timing chain noise returns and the chain breaks while we were going down the road. I had it diagnosed and towed as the vehicle service contract requires. Car Mart had my vehicle taken to one of the shops they use, ordered a used engine and had it in about 2 weeks later Once again neglected to fix the other issues with my vehicle that are listed on the service contract repair authorization form including a loud thud while placing it in gear. The day I picked up my vehicle I was in a rush to get to work (and was in jeopardy of losing my job due to transportation issues) the car was running rough and CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON! Spoke to Veronica at Car Mart she instructed me to run it by Auto Zone, have them plug it up and tell me what the read out said so I did that after work and now had a used engine with even more issues . The next day the GM Amy said that she will not honor the auto Zone diagnosis and I need to pay to have a shop tell me what's wrong with THE ENGINE THEY JUST PUT IN MY VEHICLE!  So as it stands now my last contact with the office to arrange repairs concerning this issue was a few weeks ago via telephone. I was treated extremely rude, not listened to, treated as if this is my fault and talked over by a member of the Car Mart staff. I have had to resign from a job I loved due to not being able to get the 7 miles to work and my small business is no more. My timing chain is making the bad noise again, the car shakes while driving after they put the engine in, it has a very strong odor of gas, and there is a huge thud everytime it switches gears. I cant get my extremely Ill Mother to her appointments, My Son to functions, find employment and now am suffering health issues of my own due to the stress from this vehicle. All I ever wanted was a good quality used car Americas Car Mart, but I guess that was to much for my family and I to ask of you. I am now feeling defeated and still trying to pay for a defective vehicle that was way over priced to begin with.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1538537680182, "text": "Hi Sara.

This is not my first Hyundai since reinventing itself and blowing our minds. Needless to say I purchased what is now my 5th Hyundai.  However, i'm here to brag on the man who walked my husband and I through this entire process in this humid Alabama weather.  Initially, I came in to take advantage of the $50 GIFT CARD that Hyundai was offering for simply test driving its vehicles, but I also knew that I would potentially be driving off the lot with something new as well. Brandon Blagg was awesome from the gate. He stood and walked over to me, invited me to his desk, and inquired concerning my business. A few questions later, a copy of my license, and \"BAM\" we were test driving a base model Santa Fe.' One would think that this guy designed these vehicle with his level of knowledge concerning them. Recalling that I have own several vehicles in my lifetime, it is feasible to understand that we have dealt with our share of sales consultants. This is by far the first person who not only informed us of what we would potentially enjoy about the vehicle, but patiently explained in detail its benefits, and demonstrated  to us its functionality. He took a base model vehicle and literally painted a picture that lifted it beyond it's level. He hung out with us for over an hour doing comparisons and contrasts. He was honest concerning pro and cons, but never negative.. not one time. For him every vehicle had its benefits, and for every person there was vehicle that fit them. THIS IS WHAT HE DID! He didn't interfere with our choice, but he made sure that we would be satisfied once we left  the lot for good. In the end we ended up purchasing a Santa Fe' SEL 2.4 engine with both the Convenience and Premium Package. He didn't use a hustler tactic to cause us to go for a higher grade, it was simply his transparency and patience that ultimately led to our selection. Recalling that this was in 90 + degree weather, this man didn't stop until the tires shined.  He made me laugh, shared stories, explained who was whom of the CEO vs. COO, and also wasn't shy around me whatsoever. He even blew bubble gum bubbles for our delightful 6 year old who stood amazed at the excellence his gum blowing abilities. Brandon Blagg, job well done. You deserve all that's coming for your hard work and dedication to service. Aside from our direct experience with Brandon, everyone rocked. Their pleasantness was superb, two of the women conversed with me, they offered treats to my babies, and others smiled and waved. There wasn't a rude attitude in the building. The lobby and bathrooms are well designed and clean. As lengthly a process that car buying could be, they have enough going for themselves to make you relax and enjoy your time.\n\nThanks Again, Tae A.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b128e81df3f:0x8980930b2c0cfffb"}

(To say the least) my advice to any one reading this review is to stay away from this place they are liars & wickedly deceive people especially the less fortunate with not so decent credit they already know initially that you are in need of a vehicle and probably tired of purchasing used cars that you have to Fork out money every month for repairs so they sell you a false dream SCAM!! YOU!  there are the Masters of manipulation stay away from Jim Burke Automotive Hyundai", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b128e81df3f:0x8980930b2c0cfffb"}

I test drove the vehicle on a Monday and pointed out a few cosmetic issues that I feel should have been addressed prior to placing the car up for sale (only a few hundred dollars to correct).  That combined with the manager coming outside to talk to me smoking a cigarette, should have clued me in to the professionalism and pride taken at the dealership.\nI was asked that if the problems I pointed out were corrected,  would I purchase the car? I agreed.  The following day I recieved the bill of sale and I noticed that the price shown on the internet was not the price shown on the bill of sale. When I asked the manager, the explanation I recieved was that the car was headed to auction the day I saw it and the price on the internet was the auction price, not the sale price (what does that have to do with me? And the price I came intending to pay is the price that I saw advertised ).  I was then told that they would sell it to me at the internet price but I would have to pay for the repairs which would be $400+.  Since the price was still under book value,  I agreed.  I was then told that the car would be repaired, HAND WAXED and ready for me in a couple days.  I was informed Friday that the car was ready. I drove up Saturday only to find the car just as dirty as it was when I test drove it on Monday(they sprayed the dirt off but there was still hair and dirt on the inside of the car.... wheel wells were dirty, etc). Of all the cars I've bought,  no one has ever tried to delivered me a dirty car! I discussed this with the manager who appeared to care nothing about it.  I left with no intention of buying the car,  but the salesman,\nMr. Willie, called and said that he would take care of it...... he took it to a local shop and had it washed and vacuumed.  As a customer, when money is spent, whether it be $30 or $30,000, you want to feel good about spending it. That's not the feeling I left with.  In the end, I purchased what I feel is a great vehicle.   But the service is what will definitely keep me from being a repeat customer or recommending to anyone else.  Professionalism and putting the customer first is definitely lacking and needs a lot of improvement.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b128e81df3f:0x8980930b2c0cfffb"}

This was the worst car buying experience ever. My original salesman was nice but knew nothing about a car at all. My battery had a dead cell when I first purchased it. I took it back for the battery to be replace and it took four hours to get a new battery. I asked them to take me to the service center to find out what was taking so long and the guy that work in the front said my battery has been there for two hours. And the guys that were supposed to be working were playing and joking around the next time I needed work done was three days later I noticed the bumper on the car was popped out of place, the 12 volt adapters didn't work, the service light had come on, the key tumbler was messed up in the ignition. I went to try and get that fixed and they told me it would be two days well I asked if they would give me a replacement car to get back and forth to work they told me no they don't do that. Ok so I paid for the work myself. A few days later I discovered my account was overdrawn 500 dollars and when I ask the finance manager why my account was charged and I paid 1000  in cash his response was well we wanted 1500 for the car and u couldn't do that. So they took it upon themselves to take the other 500 dollars. Now after they agreed to give my money back.  I waited a week and called and he said I could pick it up across the street so I went across the street from them and the guy over there didn't know what I was talking about so he called Cleveland Moore the guy I've been having problems with to asked him where I needed to go Cleveland didn't know that he was on speaker phone and said \" she so damn stupid\" he really called me stupid and then when I informed him he was on speaker phone he said so. Meaning he didn't care. So I feel disrespected and I was so upset I called a manager who said it will be handled and I will be waiting to find out the results of this because if they are not satisfactory I would like to speak with the owner myself.

This was the worst car buying experience ever. My original salesman was nice but knew nothing about a car at all. My battery had a dead cell when I first purchased it. I took it back for the battery to be replace and it took four hours to get a new battery. I asked them to take me to the service center to find out what was taking so long and the guy that work in the front said my battery has been there for two hours. And the guys that were supposed to be working were playing and joking around the next time I needed work done was three days later I noticed the bumper on the car was popped out of place, the 12 volt adapters didn't work, the service light had come on, the key tumbler was messed up in the ignition. I went to try and get that fixed and they told me it would be two days well I asked if they would give me a replacement car to get back and forth to work they told me no they don't do that. Ok so I paid for the work myself. A few days later I discovered my account was overdrawn 500 dollars and when I ask the finance manager why my account was charged and I paid 1000  in cash his response was well we wanted 1500 for the car and u couldn't do that. So they took it upon themselves to take the other 500 dollars. Now after they agreed to give my money back.  I waited a week and called and he said I could pick it up across the street so I went across the street from them and the guy over there didn't know what I was talking about so he called Cleveland Moore the guy I've been having problems with to asked him where I needed to go Cleveland didn't know that he was on speaker phone and said \" she so damn stupid\" he really called me stupid and then when I informed him he was on speaker phone he said so. Meaning he didn't care. So I feel disrespected and I was so upset I called a manager who said it will be handled and I will be waiting to find out the results of this because if they are not satisfactory I would like to speak with the owner myself. I can't believe people have to go through so much to get a car this is very terrible service and I want to know that my voice and opinion.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b128e81df3f:0x8980930b2c0cfffb"}

They did not tell me it had sold when I called that same morning to verify my appt. & it's still on the internet as \"Available\" the following day. Further more 5 days later, it's still listed on the internet as available. So NOW I'm positive it's to lure customers in. If someone is awaiting approval for financing on this vehicle, the very least Jim Burke Hyundai should do is post a flag on the car saying; \"Sold Pending Approval of Financing\". In my opinion, that would be \" Professional Business Protocol\".\n\nI'm of the opinion that they might possibly do this to get customers to come in when it looks like a certified car is lower priced then average.\n\nI believe they tried to do a \"bait & switch\" maneuver on me by showing me a same priced vehicle that was the same color but a different make and model.\n\nThe sales mgr. also told me he would find me a Pre-certified car in the same price range that same day, however he never followed through or even had the professionalism to call me back one way or the other. I called him later that afternoon, I didn't want the other car I looked at, at another dealership to get sold, & asked if he could call me back by 6pm  to tell me if he had found another car so I could make a decision. He never called.\n\nBottom line... before you make the trip to see a specific car, make absolutely sure it's still for sale.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b128e81df3f:0x8980930b2c0cfffb"}

And if you do, please, make sure you ask them to print and show you any TSB's (Technical Service Bulletin) on the vehicle you are considering. A TSB is not like a safety recall and therefore the dealership is not required to make the repair. Make them prove to you that they have repaired all of the items on each and every TSB. However, I can almost promise you that they will not make the repairs before selling you the vehicle. I purchased a used 2007 Hyundai Entourage van from Jim Burke Hyundai's used car dealership in March this year after having purchased a new Elantra from them last year. I did not make them show me the TSB's because I wasn't aware of them at the time. Unfortunately there are several of them on the van I purchased. One of them had to do with a part that causes called the \"Junction Box Switch\" or Instrument Panel Module that causes the battery to discharge. That means when you go out to your car it simply won't start!! I found the TSB on it and it says in large print that it was issued to all Hyundai General Managers and that the repair should be made before retail sale of the van. Many of us believe that purchasing a used car from what you think is a reputable dealership will protect you from these type issues. Well...this dealership is not reputable and should be put out of business. I have contacted them to give them a change to try and make this right to keep customers happy and try to get return business but they obviously are not intersted in this. I will be taking further action regarding this issue.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b128e81df3f:0x8980930b2c0cfffb"}

After a week, out on a family day with my whole family the van wouldn\u2019t shut off after I took the key out. Started smoking and leaking, had to stop our family say short and pay for a tow truck and no way to get my whole family home.

Also after a look at it from a mechanic I know, there\u2019s also oil in the radiator. So basically I have a van I leased just sitting in my drive way not being used that I\u2019m making payments on.

Pretty cheap right? My payments were set at 135 a week for the 2 years except around tax time I had a few payments over 500 dollars. I never missed my payment and I was never late on a payment, not once. As time went on and things changed for me and my family, I couldn\u2019t afford the car anymore. I was paying 540 dollars a month for a 2008 Honda Civic. I took the car back and told them i just couldn\u2019t afford the car because the payment monthly was more than a house payment per month. Now even though I brought the car back and was an excellent customer with my time with car mart I get a repo on my credit for up to 7 years. Save yourself time and money and do not buy a car through car mart because at the end of the day it is a scam. They only care about money and if you get to the point where you can\u2019t pay regardless of the situation they will stick you with a very negative credit report for the next decade.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1569515034573, "text": "Zachery, We value your feedback and are sorry to hear that you are unhappy.

Anyway, lol, even though I arrived later than desired in order to make it to the bank before they closed JoAnn feverishly got everything in order for me to get to the bank with not a minute to spare. At that moment that was everything to me and it allowed me to make my payment for the electric bill before that following Monday when it would have most likely been disconnected. Things have improved drastically, financially speaking and I'm on my way to the TitleMax office and get my title back before heading down to central FL for work.

The local companies killed my car, so I traded it in. When doing so JEFF practically tried to scam me.

Well we thought we did. The entire time \u201cMojo\u201d showed the truck, we discussed the motor as well as the other features. Then when we sat down and talked numbers, he presented a piece of paper comparing it to all the other 2016 model F-150s within so many miles and my fianc\u00e9 noticed the motor was listed different than every single other listing,\u00a0so he asked \u201cthis may be a dumb question but this truck\u2019s motor is listed differently. Is that just the way you guys typed it up? Is this truck a twin turbo EcoBoost like the rest?\u201d Mojo replied with \u201c yes exactly\u201d. So we moved forward and we bought the truck. That following\u00a0Sunday my fianc\u00e9 went to look under the hood at something and after some research he found out\u00a0it did not have the 3.5L EcoBoost motor. He called the following \u202aMonday morning\u202c and talked to Mojo. He stated said \u201cmojo do you remember us talking about the truck being an EcoBoost and showing me the comparison sheet of the surround F-150s,\u00a0and I asked about the motor being an EcoBoost, even though it didn\u2019t match up to everything else and you told me yes it is?\u201d He said \u201cyea, yea I do\u201d then My Fianc\u00e8 said \u201cwell Mojo it\u2019s not an EcoBoost.

One telling him that he\u2019s still trying to talk to management but they\u2019re busy and the second time was 8 hours later and all they were willing to do was give us an oil change. Both responses were via\u00a0text messages. He would not answer a phone call. So we then called and spoke to a sales manager and he was nice but didn\u2019t have any more to offer. After a couple weeks we were finally able to talk to the sales manager that was working the day we bought the truck. At this point we were over having to deal with them so we settled for a few oil changes and floor mats since the truck didn\u2019t come with any. He stated \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t be cheap mats\u201d. Once they finally came in we went and picked them up from the dealership, and they were universal Riverchase kia mats that no where near fill up any of the back seat floor board. We bought better ones from Walmart than the ones they gave us and he only gave one more oil change than the original one. We find this to be highly unprofessional and unsatisfactory. There are thousands of dollars difference as well as the evident performance differences. I\u2019ve also bought a brand new Kia from them in 2017 and it\u2019s crazy we get treated this way after spending so much money with them. I hope that people read this and choose to take their business else where.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

My lights were flickering on and off in my 2014 KIA Soul and I was scared to drive at night. My warranty was about to expire and I wanted to get my lights checked out. Early August 2018 I drove over to Riverchase KIA early one morning and I told them what was going on with my 2014 KIA. I also needed and oil changed. I waited over an hour for the shuttle to drive me to work, the shuttle drive did not know I needed a ride and HE was super nice!! I called around noon 5 hours later to check on my car, and they had not look at my car yet. I called again at 2pm and they were not done. They told me earlier that the shuttle stops driving at 4pm, I was scared I was going to be stranded at work. I had to ask my co-worker to cover the rest of my shift so that the shuttle could pick my up and take me to my car...again the driver was super nice! When I arrived all my windows were down and they informed me that my car was ready. I asked about my lights and they said the drove it around and the lights did not flicker while they drove it. I asked if someone looked at my light or looked at the electrical wiring on my lights and THEY DID NOT!!! I was charged for my oil change and sent on my way. At this point I did not drive my car at night because I was scare I would crash when my lights would cut-off or flicker. I received a letter from KIA headquarters about a month later stating that the 2014 KIA Soul had a problem with the multi functioning switch and that will cause my lights to flicker while driving with my lights on. The letter stated I should take my KIA to the closest dealership to get the problem fixed since the warranty was extended on that particular part.  I took my KIA to Riverchase KIA in Pelham  since it was closer to my job....the service technician told me to my face that \"The letter was to keep in my car in case I was pulled over by the cops, not to fix the problem. He also said that they don't know how to fix my car). They made me feel so stupid...I should have been more firm with them about fixing my car, but I thought maybe I did not read the warranty extension correctly.  Two weeks later while driving home from work, my lights kept flickering while I'm driving an it scared me! I need an apology from Riverchase KIA for making me feel like and idiot!! So I did  not go back because you guys refused to fix the problem!!  The next day I took my car to Julio Jones in Tuscaloosa, Al and I showed them the letter I received from KIA. they listened to me and told me not to worry that they would fix the problem. I need an oils change and my tires rotated as well and they serviced my KIA soul with no problem.   I'm so thankful I can drive my car and not feel scared that I might crash.

I called around noon 5 hours later to check on my car, and they had not look at my car yet. I called again at 2pm and they were not done. They told me earlier that the shuttle stops driving at 4pm, I was scared I was going to be stranded at work. I had to ask my co-worker to cover the rest of my shift so that the shuttle could pick my up and take me to my car...again the driver was super nice! When I arrived all my windows were down and they informed me that my car was ready. I asked about my lights and they said the drove it around and the lights did not flicker while they drove it. I asked if someone looked at my light or looked at the electrical wiring on my lights and THEY DID NOT!!! I was charged for my oil change and sent on my way. At this point I did not drive my car at night because I was scare I would crash when my lights would cut-off or flicker. I received a letter from KIA headquarters about a month later stating that the 2014 KIA Soul had a problem with the multi functioning switch and that will cause my lights to flicker while driving with my lights on. The letter stated I should take my KIA to the closest dealership to get the problem fixed since the warranty was extended on that particular part.  I took my KIA to Riverchase KIA in Pelham  since it was closer to my job....the service technician told me to my face that \"The letter was to keep in my car in case I was pulled over by the cops, not to fix the problem. He also said that they don't know how to fix my car). They made me feel so stupid...I should have been more firm with them about fixing my car, but I thought maybe I did not read the warranty extension correctly.  Two weeks later while driving home from work, my lights kept flickering while I'm driving an it scared me! I need an apology from Riverchase KIA for making me feel like and idiot!! So I did  not go back because you guys refused to fix the problem!!  The next day I took my car to Julio Jones in Tuscaloosa, Al and I showed them the letter I received from KIA. they listened to me and told me not to worry that they would fix the problem. I need an oils change and my tires rotated as well and they serviced my KIA soul with no problem.   I'm so thankful I can drive my car and not feel scared that I might crash. Thanks Julio Jones KIA for doing your job and making me feel safe!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

He said he was never notified and gave me attitude for not knowing the name of who I spoke to as it \u201cwent through a call center.\u201d He then comes back after I asked if my car was done and said that the oil change and tire patch for the leak had not been done. When I asked why it had not been done after three hours and me having had an appointment he wasn\u2019t able to give me an answer. I left, taking my vehicle with me and no services done. When I signed papers while leaving I noticed a note at the top that said \u201cpick up time 6pm.\u201d However, I was never told this at the beginning.

Wednesday as I\u2019m driving home, oil light comes on and smoke from under the hood. I made it home and found oil leaking from under the car. I call Wednesday to make an appointment to bring my car in on Thursday to be fixed. Thursday I arrive around 8:20 that morning and drop the car off so I could get to work that I was already late for. I called them around 1-2pm the evening to check status of my car. Season stated they hadn\u2019t gotten to it yet and it was being sent somewhere else were it would be checked out in more detail. So they put me in a rental covered by them. They called Friday afternoon and said my car was ready and I asked why was it leaking oil and they said the plug was stripped and that it wasn\u2019t a Kia plug. If the technician knew the plug was stripped why did he put it back on there, regardless of if it was a Kia plug or not. Also, Wednesday when I came to drop the car off, I told them that I would like to get the recalls fixed on it since I already had to drop the car off. I asked the person checking me in did he need the recall papers that I had gotten sent in the mail and he said he could look it up by the VIN. Saturday morning I come in to pick up my car and ask them for diagnostic report on what was done on the car & they tell me about the plug and I asked were the recalls fixed and they said it wasn\u2019t any notes about a recall needing to be fixed. The guy that checked me in Wednesday stated he didn\u2019t remember me saying anything about a recall and he was sorry, Season said they would get it in to be fixed because of the situation but they normally do not do recalls on saturdays. I already knew that because of the previous Saturday I came in for the oil change and asked about the recall. So I guess the pros would be that she did say they would fix the recalls but cons is that I still have to sit and wait on my car on something that they were supposed to had already done. I also spoke with Tim the supervisor about the issues that I was having. I am stuck in a hard place because Riverchase Kia is the only Kia dealership in Birmingham, and I don\u2019t want just any person working on my car and thought I was doing the right thing by bringing to their service center. So I gave them two stars, one for getting the recalls fixed on a Saturday and the other for putting me in a rental while they were getting my vehicle fixed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

He was so sweet (I almost want to put that into satirical marks) while we talked through wait periods. Good family guy who is proud of his kids and was very generous in his compliments to my husband. This was fine. I would have left a 5 star review with just that interaction. He didn't seem to push us into anything particular or expensive because we knew what we wanted and he knew that too. To be honest, my husband knew more about the cars on that lot than most of the salesmen at the store. To be even more honest, we had no intentions of buying a car that day, but we were talked into it. Not a horrible choice, but not my optimum choice at this time. In the end I wanted to make my husband happy and get a hybrid because it is better for the environment and because we commute a lot. I would have waited a year or two before doing this, but that is out the window now. However, all of that isn't the issue. While we were there, everyone was nice. Stayed there for almost 5 hours getting paperwork done and waiting to be approved for a loan. We're young and like to talk, so we didn't mind. We get a fair interest rate, seeing as how my husband just came out of bankruptcy. This is good. We sign all the contracts, my husband haggles about the extra warranty. All of that is good. We hand over the keys to the car we traded in, clean it out and into our new car, etc. All of the contracts are signed, everything is good. We leave HAPPY. Very happy. Extremely proud of our car.\n\nThis is when things start to go bad. I get a call a few days later because they lost my husband's pay stub. No problem. He sends an email with a new one. This apparently isn't \"clear\" enough \"for the banks.\" Alright. So he sends another one, a PDF copy as clear as day. A human mistake happens and he misspelled Stan's email (missed 1 s). A week almost goes by and I haven't gotten any calls, and neither has my husband. We think everything is fine so we forget about it. Not to mention, it is the end of the semester for me, so the only thing I am worried about it getting homework done, studying for exams, and emailing people from my school email. This, however, is where some of the blame falls onto me. I had gotten 3 emails from Stan on the 4th and on the 5th. The email on the 4th was fine. It just wanted a new copy because he couldn't find an attachment (because of the mess up earlier as my husband was at work and had just made a human error). The third and last email is where I am taking away 3 stars and am very upset about. It is added into this review, untouched outside of cutting away unnecessary bits of the screenshot of my computer screen. Seeing as how the place is a business, I find no issue with giving away the details in this email. In my opinion, I find the tone of the email to be very unprofessional, threatening, and rude. He could have called (in my call logs I received no calls from him and neither did my husband). Calling would have resolved the issue immediately because any decent person would have realized the mistake and apologized and immediately resent the email correctly with the attachment. Yet, it is okay to threaten to take away a car. And I get it. The bank is putting on pressure to get the pay stub or else they will back out and that is bad for the dealership. However, WE weren't the ones who lost the original pay stub in the first place. WE weren't contacted in a more timely manner about it via phone call. Instead, my junk email just so happened to get checked by my husband yesterday while he was handling other business on the phone and he sees all of the emails. He resends what needs to be resent, and now we wait to see if any other \"problems\" will arise. Will our signatures be unclear next and somehow void our contract? Will they try to repossess our car because of any other errors on their behalf? Only time will tell.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

On top of all of this I got the car home on Saturday and had to bring it back on Monday morning because of an issue with the sensor on the passenger seat and the seat belt warning, there was also a scratch left by the machine that drilled the holes for the license plate. I expected to be told that I would need to leave the car for a few days (since I had already purchased and why would they need to WOW me at this point right?) But Teddy took one look at the scratch got the dealership manager and the service manager involved, walked back into the waiting area and said, \"We're going to give you a different new car instead.\" Wow!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1472652512613, "text": "We are thrilled that you had such an amazing experience working with us here at Riverchase Kia, Gregg!

Let me provide you a little setup for my situation that this amazing dealership managed to turn around for me. End of 2014 my old Saturn (yes, the car dealer that went under) with its cracked suspension was traded into a dealership that I thought was reputable. Well put you in a new car they said, don't worry about your credit they said, I end up in the most manual of manuals; roll down windows and all Versa Note. Alright, I can turn this around, I tell myself, they said come back in a year and well get you in something nicer. Year rolls by, go back, \"Nope your credit isn't good enough, you got money to put down? Nope, then cant help you, try again next year.\" Alright, so I continue with this car that I am not happy with, upgrade jobs, still upside down in this car years later. Now its December 2017, still upside down in a car I am not happy with. I hear a jingle on my radio, you all know the one, \"We wanna see yea at Riverchase Kia.\" My wife and I talk and decide lets take a chance, what have we got to lose, if we don't like it we can always walk away. I do my research, and go in with an open mind, telling myself I want one of two vehicles. Optima or Forte. I park at the dealership and out walks one of the best, brightest, and positive salespersons I have ever met. Mr. Lionel T. Lee. I had time to stand and stretch on this cold winter day when he greeted, us. I was not set to meet anyone in particular but I am so glad I met this man. He took us to his desk and talked to us a few minutes about our situation and our plans, asked what I wanted and within 15 minutes he came back. He broke down my station for me but did not send me away.\n\nI am a negative person here folks, of course I was thinking everything had gone to hell and I was just wasting mine and his time, but Mr. Lionel was positive, he said, \"I cannot get you an optima, but I am going to get you in a new car. Trust me. I have the perfect one in mind too. How do you feel about a forte.\" My mind went everywhere but I tried to play the shrewd buyer, I said sure I would be happy to consider if the price is right. And off he went again, another fifteen minutes and back he was to grab his scarf, \"Oh you guys are in for a treat, wait here!\" Five minutes later I was asked to walk outside and man was I blown away! The Forte was beautiful, I mean pearl white, leather, backup camera, you name it it was in there. I was speechless, he asked what I thought, take a seat, get a feel for it because man this is going to be your car. I know it. I sat in it and never wanted to leave, going from a manual base to this luxury model, you know I almost drooled a little. He asked, \"What do you think, anything you want to change on it?\" The only thing I could think, \"Got it in Grey or Silver!\" He just grinned and said, \"Yeah, I sure do. Wait here.\" Exact same model, color I want, hasn't even been an hour and I am test driving the car I could not be happier with! Then the standard numbers talk goes by, no one likes this part but I will state for full disclosure that I was in the negative over 6k on my old car, I was expecting that I was going to have it a little rough but you know it was not nearly as bad as I thought. The discounts were amazing, in fact I walked away an hour later one of the most satisfied kia customers, keys and paperwork in hand and taking a picture in front of my new vehicle. Thank you so much Mr. Lionel for putting up with all my negativity and fighting for me to get me in this new vehicle. Hell I sat in it all day yesterday just playing with all the new toys and features, you are an amazing salesperson and even more so just an amazing person to help someone like me. Thank you again! We will be seeing you again next year to get her out of that jeep!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

My car died during the ice storm, and I HAD to buy a car.  Here are the problems I observed:\n\n1. 12 salesmen standing out front, half of them smoking cigarettes... certainly not illegal, but it just automatically makes any business look really bad fast.  Plus, they obviously overhired, maybe to motivate car sales by putting more hungry vultures on the lot.\n\n2. I dealt first with a guy named Adam.  He was nice enough... the sales manager obviously sensed my hesitation, so he swooped in and began his \"Pushy sales guy\" mode.  At one point when I started to get up and leave because I felt uncomfortable, he told me I promised him I would buy a car from him if the numbers were right for a used model.  I wanted a new car.\n\n3. Don't even bother looking at the prices of Kias online -- when you get there, everything is 5 to 6 thousand dollars more.  See, that's when they offer you the $6,000 trade in on any model.  Then, they'll act as if they're such great guys doing you such a favor.  It's ludicrous.\n\nI went directly to another dealership, found a car I liked at a reasonable price, and drove away happy.

Felt we got ripped off a little and found out they tried to get lending from so many places for the incorrect amount and causes unnecessary credit inquiries. That was annoying to find out weeks after the fact and that they hid it from us. But the big issue is their service. It is impossible to make an appointment for your \"free\" oil changes. When you do arrive they push a pkg that's like $65 so you can get a tire rotation and other crap. Then when you pick about charging that much for the \"free\" oil change they say, they'll take the oil change portion of that off the top like they are doing you a favor. Then they claim you need a new filter or something or other, which they changed at the last oil change 5,000 so I ask how often that's needed and they claim it's needed every 10,000-15,000 not knowing we just had it done the time before. So your free oil change is $75 + when you are done.

It was passed time to get her a new ride.  We did a one stop shop.  We knew Riverchase Kia had awesome deals on their new Kias.  However, this was not the market we were looking for purchase from.  We were after a slightly used but still certifiable new to us SUV.  Teddy met with us.  He asked what we were looking for in a purchase today, and said that he would do his best to keep us from going anywhere else.  Teddy did just that.  We were up front with him on the financials that we had and the monthly payment we need to stay around.  My wife was looking for something older with many more miles, but I wanted to have something that had warranty and miles to a minimum.  Teddy brought us a single option, The Right Option.  A very low mileage Sorento with transferable warranty.  The test drive sold it to my wife, and I signed the line.  We got an extremely well kept Sorento, with a detailed one owner record review by Teddy.  He answered the questions we had and some that he knew we should ask but not know to.  He was easy to work with.  He was knowledgeable  and we are a family with a great ride.  The experience was great, our turn around time for paperwork was minimal, our satisfaction was at the maximum.\nThe entire experience was better than I expected.  They treated us very well.

I first went to the Kia Garderndale,Al but they werent very nice and i felt as if I was in a interview to see if I was good enough for the car. But when I came to Riverchase Kia. Lamar Black meant me  at the door with a smiling face. He knew everything about the car I wanted. He made me feel relaxed when test driving the car. I felt so sure about the car I bought it that day. And still to this day I know that it was the perfect car for me. Thank you Lamar the other dearship made me question my choice but you claried ot for me! Thank you.

Even my 3yr old stated mom you I'm sweating lol lol. The air went out Wednesday Oct 6th.

I got the expression from her as whatever going on with your car you would have to pay, didn't give other options, just basically it's on me. I understand she have to tell me the fee etc.. but my car is only 2yrs old, and at that moment I didn't want to hear about money, I just wanted professionalism and just let me know it will be OK. I just said make me an appointment for Friday and I will come back. I went back Friday morning and spoke with a pleasant young woman by the name of Season. I think that was her name, b/c it was a unique name. She told me the SAME thing the other lady stated but in a different tone, and made me feel as though she cared. She even let me know by the car being new it may be covered under warranty. I told her my husband can get a gauge to ck it etc.. And she said if we do all that then it's still not working then it's likely a issue that will be fix with no out of pocket expense. I took my car back home again, and my husband did ck it Sunday, and the gauge showed Freon in the car, but stated to take it to the professionals. I then took off work Monday and brought my car back and Season's was there also.. I was happy b/c at this point I was just tired of going into circles. She let me know it may be a wait and was honest about it, and the fee again. I waited 2hrs, but I didn't care b/c I wanted my air fix, and to top it off it was under warranty. Anytime you are dealing with something that is a touchy subject about your car, b/c that is your way of survival and also getting around.... you want people to be knowledge of what's going on, and the situation.

Keep in mind, this is a buy here pay here and they go off of how you get paid for payments. If you get paid weekly, you pay weekly. For instance, you could pay $100 a week, which is about $400 a month, unless the month has 5 weeks, then it'll be $500 that month. They also have a pretty good warranty policy.
