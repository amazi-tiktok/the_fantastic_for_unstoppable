Not sure if it continues past that point, will have to bring waders and boots next time to see. However, there is no trash can at all in this stretch of the refuge! The result is tons of litter everywhere, along the road, the gravel drive, the parking areas, in the brush by the trail, in the river, everywhere you look.\nI always bring a bag to pick up, but the staff at Joe Wheeler NWR really need to put trash receptacles by the road or at the trail head. The resources and time required to clean up litter would be better spent on prevention and weekly emptying of a couple trash cans. It blows my mind there is not one in the entire area...", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886281a4541cdaed:0x468e0e2f2421eca6"}
