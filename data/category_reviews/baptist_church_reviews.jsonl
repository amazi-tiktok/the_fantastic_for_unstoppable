My daughter attended preschool there from age 2 through K4. Tuition can be pricey & there can be a waiting list from time to time, but my husband & I believe it was worth it. The administration & staff are both knowledgeable & experienced. Admission to the preschool/daycare/after school care is limited. You either have to be buzzed in by staff or you have to have a security code to unlock the door. Children must be both signed in & out. Children are supervised at all times. Meals are nutritious & made on site by some truly wonderful ladies. Children are educated, cared for & loved by administrator & staff. We feel that our daughter's 3 years at FBCHPS has benefitted her educationally, socially & morally. She is 8 years old now & has been away from the preschool since she was 5 & what memories she has of her time there are precious to her. She misses it\u2764\ufe0f\n\nAlthough neither my husband nor I are members of FBCH, we have attended services there several times. We found the congregation & minister to be welcoming & warm. Congregants are kind & generous. There is ample parking for both the disabled & non. The church is wheelchair accessible & congregants are cheerful & helpful. This is a Community Oriented church. By that, I mean that the church & congregation are highly supportive of the Headland community & the schools of the City of Headland. I found the congregation & the staff of the preschool to be open, helpful & compassionate to the needs of members of the community once they were advised of needs.

I loved Reverend Porter and his family. I loved vacation bible svhool and learned so much about the Bible in Sunday school in Mr Walker's class. I actually won that competition he had annually. The Easter speeches and Easter egg hunts were fun as well. We moved away in 88 and I recently came back last summer to visit. I was walking around the grounds feeling nostalgic telling a good friend of mine what a great church it was and how the building hadn't changed. I was  taking pictures when the Reverend walked up and introduced himself. We talked for a minute. Such a nice gentleman. We both talked about Rev Porter for a second. I told him I have watched him preach on YouTube. I enjoyed his word.  I can't wait to visit after everything opens back up.

This we cannot do and could not be further from the truth. In fact, it is the exact opposite of Christ's teaching. Scripture tells us that our good deeds cannot save us (Ephesians 2:8\u20139). Even our best works are as filthy rags when viewed by our holy God (Isaiah 64:6). If we could make ourselves righteous before coming to Christ then His sacrificial, substitutionary death would not have been necessary for our salvation. Christ Himself stated that He came to save sinners (Matthew 9:12\u201313). He ate and drink with sinners (Matthew 9:10). He protected sinners, such as the woman caught in adultery, from the self-righteous Pharisees (John 8:3\u201311). He did not come to save those who in their sinful pride believe themselves to be righteous, but those who know they are not righteous. Jesus calls all who are weary and burdened by their sin to come to Him and find rest for their souls in Him (Matthew 11:28\u201330). He calls not just sinners but the foremost of sinners to come to Him (1 Timothy 1:15\u201316).\n\nSo, does Jesus demands anything from those who would come to Him? Yes, He demands that we be born again spiritually (John 3:1\u20138). It is not enough to make moral improvements, we need new hearts (Ezekiel 36:26), hearts that are repentant and believing. God commands all people to repent and believe in Jesus Christ in order to be saved (Mark 1:15; Acts 19:4; 20:21; Hebrews 6:1). However, even this repentance and faith are not our own doing but are gifts from God through which we receive the salvation that is found in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:8\u20139).\n\nAs a result of being made alive to God and becoming new creations in Christ, our lives begin to change (Colossians 2:13; 2 Corinthians 5:17). Although we do not become sinless after this rebirth, we do have a different mindset toward sin. We desire to depart from sin, we mourn over our remaining sin, we are convicted by the Holy Spirit when we do sin, and we confess our sin to God (2 Timothy 2:19; Romans 7:24; John 16:8; 1 John 1:9). After our spiritual rebirth, we also begin to exhibit the fruit of the Holy Spirit, such as love, joy, and peace (Galatians 5:22\u201323). However, all this is a result of coming to Christ and not a precondition for coming to Him. We come as we are, but we do not remain as we were (Philippians 1:6; Romans 12:1\u20132; 2 Corinthians 3:18).\n\nLet all who are thirsty come and drink from the Living Water, Jesus Christ (John 4:10; 7:38).", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88926efff6198987:0xe09a7f83a2c45c7d"}

We all of course had Native American ideology and DNA famial background history (live off the land w/out government assistance if land and natural resources was made available to do so bc God would and does supply our every need).

I love to sing at church, but this was different. I found it so beautiful that I caught myself just wanting to listen and enjoy the peace it brought to me hear God being praised so amazingly and beautifully. The Sunday School classes that they offer here covers any preference that you can imagine from the children's classes all the way to the various adult classes as well. I was very, very grateful that the lessons covered by their classes teaches the same criteria to children, in their own understanding, as well as it teaches the adults. That is a togetherness unrivaled by my experiences up til now. Like I previously stated, at First Baptist Church everyone is on the same page so to speak. I love learning about God.

I had a chance to talk to the pastor and decons and share with them my testimony of the love that Jesus Christ has for me. I will always be an addict, but I am a delivered addict. Jesus Christ love for me changed my life. God continues to bless me every day. I live by faith and I trust him totally with my life. If you are looking for a good church home please come and visit with us. Our pastor is a old times preacher and he will tell you that Hell is real and that he is on the move in our country. He will also show you the way to rebuke Satan through Jesus Christ. Come and visit with us and feel the presence of the Holy Spirit at work in people's lives. Hope to see you there this Sunday.

Preaching is sound doctrine and full of love. Salvation is through the grace of God. As for the preaching on Sunday April 3rd, I am sorry you, as a visitor, had to hear that message. The preaching was not aimed at the brother in Christ like you thought, it was to those busy bodies that like to spread gossip. Pastor Allison was correct in holding it off for a bit so we have a right as a church to get right with God. The Lord's supper is not something to be taking lightly. Some Corinthians died when they took of the Lord's supper unworthily. Pastor was watching for his flock at the time.\nYes we are free from the law as far as Salvation is concerned however we are still to obey God to have a close walk with Him. God tells us that if we love Him we will obey Him. As for women wearing slacks, we do not stand at the door telling anyone they can't come in because they are wearing pants. However in the new testament it tells women they are to be adorned in modest apparel. It says women are not to wear that which pertaineth to a man. Pants used to be called Britches. The men wore linen britches in the Bible times. Therefore, pants pertain to men not women. Women didn't wear pants until World war 2, when women went to work to help out.\nYes we use the KJV of the Bible. It was the one that was transcribed from the original text. It has no flaws it is God's word for the english language.\nI am sorry that you had a bad experience coming to our church. I support my church and my pastor.\nJust a side note though, let's say you have a child and that child is fixing to run into the street. You see the car coming your child does not.  Do you not warn that child by yelling \"GET OUT OF THE ROAD\"?  Of course you do. Why? Don't you love that child?  Yes you do. You tell your children and punish your child because you love them and you know the dangers that lie ahead. That is what a overseer does.  God gave us at MBC pastor Allison and he is our overseer for our spiritual well being. He is to correct us when we are doing wrong.\nAs far as the brother you were talking about, we as a church are praying for him and his family.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626670e1518675:0x4efab3109e77c746"}

I go to church with her and my nephew Keith Posey faithfully. The past 3 months ( March,April, and May ) I have gone to many churches in my past but I just knew God sent me here cause this is the one where I belong. He knew if any pastor and Sunday school teacher could reach me... It would Chris our senior Sunday school teacher and Pastor Brother Mark Boyd. I am going to share an experience that happened to me one Sunday. Chris was teaching class and as soon as he started talking he caught my full attention that day.... never in many years has that happened to me!! I mean my mind didn't even stray for a second!! Then we were in church for our daily service... boy... can Brother Mark touch a soul...cause that day he really drew me into his God.  We sang a song Lift Up The Cross... oh what a touching heart felt song. Again Brother Mark caught my attention and I wouldn't astray from him. at the end of the sermon as we stood for those to come forward i felt a coldness run through my body as I then felt like I was dizzy,  light headed of course I got scared and started praying dear Lord please make this feeling go away...well it didn't my heart started beating fast due to anxiety built up I was starting to turn to my sister and tell het how I was feeling and needed to step out. But, out of no where a warm sensation went up my stomach through my chest and out of nowhere this most beautiful sensation went through me and I felt such a peacefulness and contentment within me. It wasn't until we left to go for lunch afterwards that started crying cause that was an experience I have never had. I told my sister about it and she said the Lord Jesus came into my soul. Let me tell you something... I will never forget that beautiful moment. For I will take it to the gave with me. This is not a made up story it really happened to me. I  finally talked to Brother Mark about my experience and he was amazing in helping me understand the Holy Spirit touched my soul that Sunday.He took the time to sit down with me and even read some verses from the bible to help me understand. so now I am no longer frightened if what I experienced that wonderful,day.\nThank you Brother Mark and Chris\nI can't wait to visit again to see all of you. My friends, my church, my Godly home. The people there make you feel welcomed and make you feel like you belong. And that's not fake either just love them all to pieces. I want to thank my sister for bringing and introducing me to her Christian family.\nMay God bless all and everyone of you.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88892476c99172e5:0x5d387bc3bc2e8d7f"}

It was a very moving and touching service. The church was overflowing with people and looked very alive.\n\nWe went back a third time and it was the pastor preaching again. He was back to reading a verse and telling stories. This time it was about being tricked into drinking alcohol. He went on to tell how great his old church was. The church didn\u2019t look the same as the previous times. There were fewer people and noticeably the younger people were gone.\n\nWe visited one more time and a few weeks back. Same old preacher but the most surprising thing was nobody was there. I think there was around 20 people there and nobody younger than me.\n\nI don\u2019t know what happened to this church but I can tell you if you visit the pastors old church it\u2019s filled with more life than this one.

There was a reason hoardes of deacons and committee chairs and Sunday school teachers left; there was a reason the church couldn't keep a worship leader, a youth pastor, or a children's pastor. At least two current deacons were warned, as long as five years ago, about specific character concerns and about the way the leadership of the church was being structured, but anyone raising concerns was shamed into silence/out the door. That's what happens when you put bibilically unqualified leaders in charge who care only about being in charge and run off the good leaders. That's how a corrupt pastor builds an army of undyingly loyal yes men and insulates himself from any accountability. It makes me sick the number of good men and women that got railroaded, humiliated, and in some instances slandered, for the sake of a man (two really) who was never working for the church's interests but for his own. That church owes a public apology to a lot of people, but it will never come.

We drove by Thorington Road Baptist Church on our way in and out of our house and decided to give it a try. Additionally, they were hosting a VBS that week as well which caught our attention and we signed our 5 year old up for it.\n\nFirst Impression: This congregation is friendly, welcoming and caring. We felt very welcomed here. We were directed to the kids area to drop off our children before service, and introduced to the childrens leader. Once we arrived in the auditorium, seveal people came up and introduced themselves to us and told us they were glad we were there including Pastor Michael Trull. This church feels very much like a family and you can tell that from the first instance you walk in.\n\nThe service was great, the worship music had a good balance of newer songs and older hymns, the message was relevant and the gospel was clearly presented.\n\nThe VBS lasted from Sunday-Thursday and our 5 year old had a blast. You could tell the church congregation invested a lot of time and energy in preparing for VBS from decorations, to lessons, to crafts, etc. They did an amazing job! Kudos to the volunteers/church members.\n\nIf you are looking for a good bible preaching church in the East Montgomery area make sure to check this one out.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2cecf14256f9:0xb01cb36f645c62bb"}

This means taking hard looks at our opinions and biases and taking everything back to Scripture, where there are many uncomfortable yet necessary truths. We are always found wanting when we compare ourselves to God\u2019s standard, but the Good News is that the grace of Jesus covers us as we are sanctified every day in our relationship with Him.\n\nWe are an intentional church. Here, we get into theology; we ask hard questions; we dive into the nitty-gritty details of life and we apply what we\u2019ve learned about God to our daily lives and relationships. Is it hard? Yes. Is it sometimes uncomfortable? Absolutely. But the point of our faith is not to be comfortable. It is to know the Truth and to lovingly live it out with the help and grace of Jesus Christ. And it is WORTH IT.\n\nIf that\u2019s not what you want, all the best to you in your search. But if you want a family of fellow sinners saved by grace who are all struggling together, held together by our faith and taking everything back to the Cross, then this may be the family for you.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a3c1a273e6d8f:0x546ab0bf6586be95"}
