The workers leave dogs in pee and poop filled kennels for hours before they are cleaned.\nThe dogs don't go outside from 4pm to 7am the next day.\nThey have had 2 cases of kennel cough since spring break, and have still been using the same sponge to clean all of the dog bowls.\nIf your dog is having a health issue while boarding, the workers will not tell you about it if they don't think it's serious. There are dogs who get incredibly sick either from stress or other health problems that result in blood in the vomit and/or stool. The only thing they do is take the dogs food and water away and don't let them outside.\nThe dogs water bowls are only checked at 7am and then again at 4pm. So your dog may be going without water for any number of hours between those times and the workers will ignore it. The bowls are only cleaned once per day, so if your dog is boarding for several days, there's a very good chance that they'll have the same bowl of water over the course of their stay. They have a major rat problem there, so often times there is rat feces in the water bowls.\nThe dogs are left alone all night with the rats, which your dogs could be eating over night, making them very sick and possibly catching diseases.\nThe workers do not have first aid training, so if your dog chokes on the mulch that is outside in the play area, then they are told to \"look up an instructional video\" to help the choking dog.\nThey don't pay attention to what the dogs are doing because they're too busy on their phones to care. So if your dog poops mulch (very bad for his digestive system) then it's because they were eating it from the play area. There are also several dogs who eat poop, so if your dog has that habit, it's probably only getting worse because they think they're allowed to do it while staying there.\nWhen the dogs are playing outside, they are sometimes not given water for several hours due to certain dogs not liking the water hose.\nI have witnessed a coworker giving the wrong dog her medicine. Once that realization was made, still nothing was done about it.\nIf your dog is not good with other dogs, they are set as \"individuals\" where they play by themselves. These dogs are only getting 10 minutes outside to play, and then they get 10 minutes inside to play. They are supposed to have another 10 minutes to play but are usually skipped because the workers want to go home early. So if your dog is boarding over the weekend and they're not good with other dogs, then they're only getting about 20 minutes of outside time every day while the other dogs get over 2 hours.\nThe weekend hours are different, so all of the play groups are shortened and the dogs are left alone for a lot longer than they normally would be.\nTheir medicine is put in pill pockets in their food. If the dog doesn't voluntarily eat the pill pockets, then that dog will not be getting their medicine that day.\nThe dogs only have access to their food for a couple hours a day. So if your dog is a grazer and doesn't eat all of their food at once then they will be eating very little over the course of their stay.\nThe kennels are painted very poorly, paint is always chipping off the walls, usually because dogs are chewing it off.\nWorkers regularly spray dogs in the face with Bitter Apple spray. This spray is supposed to be used for dogs that have problems chewing their fur, and is not meant to be sprayed in the eyes or nose of the dogs, but they are regularly sprayed in the face if they are barking in their kennels.\nIf you request for your dog to be given a bath, they will usually bathe the dogs very early in the day to get it out of the way. Once they're bathed, they are not allowed back outside and their food and water bowls are taken away. So if you dropped your dog off at 8am to be picked up around 5pm, there's a good chance that your dog hasn't been outside or had food or water since about 10am.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1519324162478, "text": "Hi Lori, I wanted to reply here as well since I did not hear back from you regarding this same review you left on Facebook.\nI'm truly sorry this is how you felt about working at CDT.\n\nAs one of the owners, and the person responsible for systems management in the locations I am very upset to hear these things.

I receive daily pictures showing me the days activities and I am always pleased with how happy and comfortable my babies look with the sitters.  This is truly a great service with people who love and care for the well being of your pet.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1546831292721, "text": "Thank you so much!

They take care of the cats and dogs, feed fish in the ponds, fill birdfeeders, watch the water level in the pool, etc.  The sitters have even stayed extra during thunderstorms to comfort the pets until the storm passes. At times my flights have been canceled or delayed and I can contact them and get an extra sit or two to cover the unexpected extra time away. The animals love them and are so happy to be home (rather than at a kennel). RedDog is a very professional and caring service that takes the best care of my babies.

I had been taking them to my office for awhile, but they got too big and rambunctious. They were still too young to be left alone all day. RedDog was a lifesaver. They took care of the boys, plus the other three adult bulldogs we already had. We have never had less than five dogs at once, which always made traveling or overnight trips a hassle. Boarding that many dogs was expensive, not to mention traumatic for them, having to be away from home. RedDog stepped in there as well, providing overnight service for our crew in our own home! The peace of mind this gave us when we were away is beyond words. Over the years, our crew has grown and changed, adding in granddogs as well. Currently, we have 11 dogs in and out of our home!! This includes 4 new French bulldog puppies! Again, these needed extra attention, and RedDog was there, providing twice daily visits for the pups. We also have a special needs bulldog, who wears diapers at all times, as well as special medications. RedDog never balked. They change Lily\u2019s diapers, give her meds, and whatever else is needed. We get photo updates at every visit, as well as special texts if there are any specific concerns. RedDog has even taken one of our dogs to the vet when a scuffle broke out and she was injured.

The owner of this facility and the manager were told on multiple occasions by employees and were aware of the following: Fire extinguishers (they only have 2) being extremely out of date, last checked back in 2015\u2014 also no evacuation plan, or safety drills, air vent maintenance doesn\u2019t take place\u2014 vents/filters not properly maintained can easily catch fire, this company works with LIVE animals, the safety of your dogs are not being considered as you can tell from the images.... everything is layered with years of dog dander and hair.\nWhen the heater gets turned on the smell of burning hair lasts for days and the company uses wax melts up front to mask the smells. They also stuff the vents they don\u2019t clean with smell good beads to mask the smell.\nEven daycare dogs are kenneled. Employees hang around upfront until around 9 when they decide to start putting dogs in daycare\u2014- this means if you\u2019re paying for a full day or even a half day of doggie daycare starting in the morning your furbabies are missing out on 2+ hours of socialization. This facility doesn\u2019t properly clean the daycare room. And weeks worth of hair is noticeable near the drains in the daycare play areas, this is extremely unsafe for your animals/the employees. The smell in this building that\u2019s separate from the building your drop off your dog is horrific. Dogs are left unsupervised in daycare, and the daycare supervision in maintained outside of the daycare rooms- so instead of dogs getting that one-on-one attention they are only monitored when barking has increased. Because of that, rooms aren\u2019t cleaned right away causing burns on paw pads from dogs playing around in urine. Most dogs have to be ran through Grooming to be spot cleaned before leaving. Bored dogs have started eating the walls of this establishment because of the lack of social interaction they receive. This facility illegally mentioned to employees that they can not pay overtime to them when they have worked 40+ hrs. Because of this, I believe the care of the animals that go there are being affected.\nDuring the recent snow storm an employee managed to chase a already nervous dog around the front lobby of this establishment causing him to run out of the front door. This dog was missing for a week and found with his hip shattered, and he had ate an entire toe off of himself.. this establishment paid his vet bill which included the cost of utilization. Clearly the proper training of employees is not being conducted. This facility also does not clean kennels often and when they do they use a dirty mop to wipe out the kennels. This is probably a factor to the outbreak of kennel cough they are currently battling.\nMany times employees just feed  dogs breakfast without even bothering to clean the kennel first or move the dog to a clean kennel.. that means that they were eating breakfast in their own filth and kenneled with it until daycare started up. In It\u2019s hard enough trusting someone, let along finding out an establishment you\u2019re paying LOTS of money to is neglecting your animal. This establishment recently caused the death of a small 4 lb dog, and they are trying to cover it up. By deleting comments and blocking any negativity they receive. I refuse to be silent.

Shaking, limping and handed dirty bedding with no explanation as to how he was injured, why we weren't informed  when it happened plus finding out he'd been very stressed by being kenneled every night in the large room with the large dogs with big dog barks! When I first boarded @ Piper's 2 years ago I requested that he be kenneled at night with only little dogs and was shown a room off the hall on the right where I was told the small dogs stayed. When I asked why he was put in the big room this time with the big dogs she said \"well, you didn't request that he be separated\". If my file had been consulted I'm sure it would reflect my wishes. There was no I'm sorry we didn't contact you about his injury, etc. He literally had to be carried that night and Christmas day every time to potty, to food bowl, etc. While I understand this may not be the norm @ Piper's, ( had never happened to me before) since it happened this time, I'll be making other arrangements next time. Beware. Things are not always as they seem. Ask to see where your dog will be put at night. I was told they  NEVER allow tours! That's shocking! I've ALWAYS toured where I board my dog. Ask what their policy is if your dog becomes injured or sick. I asked when the owner would be there as I wanted to speak in person with them and was told the owner was never at the Anniston location.

He\u2019s running a fever between 103-105.3, lethargic, no appetite, and not drinking. We\u2019ve been to the ER vet for the fever when it got to 105.3.

I was at first very happy with pet suites and their services when they first opened. But they\u2019ve grown so much too fast and without the proper staff to take care of your pet. They are too short staffed and are too overwhelmed, frustrated, and not communicating with one another well. I once left him for day care and asked if they could\nfeed my dog breakfast which they\u2019re response was that it was a $29 fee. They didn\u2019t feed him the entire day and would rather have him not eat for 8 hours over $29. Over the weekend that I boarded him they allowed me to pay the \u201cgold package\u201d when he was already approved for group play. They lied about sending photos as part of the package when I asked about it they said they had to \u201cshift through the photos\u201d before sending them but I never received them. When I went to go finally pick him up after receiving no word about him there was a woman in the group play area walking away from the dogs, shooing them, and yelling them to get away from her. It\u2019s one woman and several dogs so I understand she\u2019s overwhelmed but this is clearly a staffing issue. On a tour of the area before leaving my dog therein on the morning of our trip the cages had not been cleaned out and were dirty. I asked for a refund and they refunded me the price I paid for the gold package. I got my dog back tired and not happy.

Although I should have taken heed, I did not and my dog continued to attend day care regularly. I began noticing that my dog was very timid of the staff. In particular, she was called by one of the managers/trainers and immediately backed up, tail between her legs, and laid down in a submissive position behind me. This time I took note and my dog never returned to the facility. I still have pre-paid day care days that will go unused. When I inquired about my dog\u2019s reaction, it was explained to me by staff that my dog was regularly kept separate in a kennel in the back during the day. AND, that her \u201ctraining\u201d involved being taken into the yard, on a leash, while other dogs were allowed to approach her and she was given commands to obey. THIS RUINED MY DOG. She has dog aggression issues to this day, largely due to her extreme anxiety which I believe was engrained into her at a developmental stage while at JHH.

We enjoyed all the picture and video updates because it showed what a great time he had at the Petz Carlton. That in turn made our vacation all the more pleasant. Zorro is a shelter dog and staying in a home environment with no cages is what he needs. It's not that other boarding places are bad, it's just that he doesn't feel comfortable being caged up. We could tell that he was way more relaxed with Kya, Lily and all the other dogs around. He got to snuggle on the couch and in the bed just like he would at home. We are so glad that we found Petz Carlton. This was the best decision that we could have made for him, and for the first time in 2 years we have been able to go on a trip guilt free. Thank you so much Melissa and Mike for going above and beyond for all your furry clients and their owners and treating them like members of your family. Petz Carlton provides a great service for dog owners and Zorro can\u2019t wait to come back and see his new friend Kya and his favorite girlfriend Lily.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1485180792474, "text": "Thank you guys for the great review.

I blame myself because I waited until the last minute to make a boarding appointment at my usually facility, which is Golden Animal Hospital in Pike Road(great service and care everytime!). We boarded our 18 month old golden doodle for 10 days. He was supposed to be groomed the last day he was there. We keep his hair long so he was only supposed to be washed and trimmed.\n\nWhen I dropped him off, the receptionist was nice enough but the place smelled very bad. I've used several dog care facilities since we're new to Montgomery and the Bakery was by far the worst in cleanliness.  The dogs and the administration area are all in one. This created a very unorganized check-in since the receptionist was moving, picking up and pushing dogs off the counter the entire check-in. I looked over this because we were literally flying out of town the same day.\n\n10 days later, I called to the Barkery know I was headed to pick my dog up. They told me that they had to cut his hair down low because he had a few matted areas on his legs. I didn't like that but its understandable. I arrive to the counter and the owner hands me a bag of hair to \"prove\" how bad the matts were! They brought my dog out and he was literally shaved down to skin\ud83d\ude25 It was so sad! They didn't even grind or clip his nails. It was clear that they had no clue what they were doing. They couldn't find his collar and leash. They said that I must have taken it with me. I usually take them with me at my normal grooming place but I thought I remembered leaving them. I didn't take the time to debate the point because I was almost numb at the sight of my dog. I just kept telling myself, \"This is your fault for waiting too long to make an appointment and taking him to the ONLY place that had an opening\" Now I know why they had an opening. For the life of me, I can not figure out how people are giving this place good reviews.\n\nWhen I get home and the family and I console each other, lol.....I find my dogs collar and flea collar buried in his door food that I had left with the Barkery. My dog also wouldn't eat for days after we got him back and he was sick for at least a week. He sneezing and vomiting. Btw, he smelled horrible. I was trying to figure out what they used to wash him and if they actually bathed him the day before I picked him up.\n\nThis was the worst experience ever and I would learn to groom my own dog if this was the only place open. On top of all of this, the receptionist and owner never apologized for the haircut. They basically blamed me because I let him get matts.\n\nWorst experience ever!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81ba3e5eea13:0x87de1146e68cc888"}

On July 2, I dropped my dog Midnight off at The Barkery, we planned to go out of town, so we let the staff member know that we would want to do daycare and boarding, because we planned to go out of town and would be back late. We ended up not going out of town, so my sister called The Barkery  at 5:35 to inform them that we would not be boarding and we were coming to pick midnight up, she said okay, everything seemed normal. My sister got to The Barkery 6 minutes later and call and through tears told me that the Barkery allowed my dog to get out of their gate, around 5:00pm,  THIRTY MINUTES AGO. Apparently Haley the staff worker, did not want to upset her and tell her over the phone. Mind you, they thought we were boarding, and at no point did they reach out to either Emergency contact listed on the paperwork, had my sister not unexpectedly showed up, it looks like they had no plan to reach out. We were told that Haley was in one room(making mop water), and Kimberly the owner was in another room(cleaning) while the dogs were outside, and unattended. They heard a loud noise, and a customer who was coming to pick up their dog came in and informed them that a black dog with a blue collar had gotten out. They had no idea because they weren't watching. One Hour later, me and my siblings were out looking for my dog with NO ASSISTANCE from The Barkery.  No one called either of Midnight's listed emergency contacts,  reached out to establish a perimeter, or even apologize and explain what happened. I had to reach out to Kimberly and request that she call me via text. When she did call, she did not apologize, she simply blamed us because he jumped the fence, all while not looking for my dog that she lost. My dog has been coming to the barkery since they were on Woodley rd, and he's never jumped. Around 7 I went back to Barkery, and Kimberly and her significant other, Jake arrived( how she had time to go get her boyfriend while she claimed she was looking for my dog, not sure). Kimberly ran inside the building, never spoke, never apologized and sent Jake, who is not an owner of The Barkery,  to \"deal\" with us. Apparently, Kimberly had lied to Jake and told him that she was threatened by myself on the phone and was called a b****h, which was untrue, I was actually quite pleasant all considered. When Kimberly finally came outside, I asked her was she ever threaten or called any obscenity and she said no that never happened. Jake went off to smoke his KOOL cigarette, because the whole reason he came was because of her lie.Why Kimberly would make herself to be the victim when she lost my dog is beyond me. Kimberly yelled us, blamed us,  cursed, and never once apologized. I understand that things happen, but if you're a dog sitter and you lose the dog, you need to take some form of responsibility and at least be sorry and try to help. Instead of being concerned,  Kimberly(owner) and her daughter, and another staff member keep screaming about their \"Livelihood\".  Thankfully, me and my family were able to go out looking at 6:00 am and posting lost posters and found Midnight near Huntingdon College. The staff members saw us looking for our dog, offered no help, and still no apology.  Today is July 9, and The Barkery has never followed up, or showed any concern for their negligence. My dog refuses to leave me or my sisters side since this event, so I'd advise you to find another place to drop off your four legged family member.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81ba3e5eea13:0x87de1146e68cc888"}

The entire staff allowed my sister's dog, Midnight, to walk away from the facility due to the staff not regularly monitoring the outside activities of the animals.

They become emotional attached to your dogs and become your friend.  Kim, Steve, and Sydni are all so very sweet.  If your dog is not the playful type, then they may not like this place.  The Barkery has a very dog friendly natural playful atmosphere where all of the dogs get to be dogs!  They get to play and socialize with one another and get treats and loved on by the staff.  Every dog owner is particular in their own way and that's understanding.  But despite them being our fur children, they are still dogs and want to play with one another and run around.  If you want your dog to have fun and be loved and for you to feel secure knowing that they are safe, then the Barkery is the place to go!!  I'll never go elsewhere.  My dog instantly gets excited the moment we pull up and is eager to run inside.  That lets me know that they too love going there.

I debated on not going back after that but decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. A few weeks later, my puppy contracts Kennel Cough from there which ultimately developed into pneumonia. As any other pet parent, I was angry because every dog is supposed to be fully vaccinated in order to attend there. $250 later, thankfully, he made a full recovery. I didn\u2019t take him back for weeks because I was paranoid. However, I moved closer to the area and decided to give it another shot. Took him back on a Friday. A few days later, I notice he isn\u2019t feeling well & end up having to take him to the emergency vet at 2:30 am. What have you know, Kennel Cough AGAIN.

Our COVID Care protocols have definitely made it much more difficult for our staff to interact with our clients with conversations.  We have really missed these interactions too!  We do feel strongly that our curbside dropoff/pickup services as well as our staff wearing full PPE is in the best interest of our community, our clients, and our staff - but it has definitely left us missing those close interactions and relationship building with our clients.  I'm sorry you missed that too.  We are definitely learning how to best create relationships with our clients in the climate of COVID safety.  Your feedback will be very helpful as we continue to grow and change with these new and ever changing restrictions.\n\nI'm also sorry to hear your pup got cough while he was participating in our services.  This particular strain of cough this year has actually made several national news stories as it has shown up all over the country.  It's been a nasty strain.  We worked very closely with our veterinary advisory team to be sure we were utilizing the absolute best practices in cleanliness and disinfectant protocols throughout our facility.  We also did our best to inform all clients honestly and openly about the outbreak.  We feel very fortunate that we were able to get it under control so quickly because of our amazing veterinary advisory team.  Just like childcare, dog daycare does pose a slightly higher risk of dogs getting upper respiratory infections and sometimes GI upset in group play.  We do our very best to inform our clients of this by having it clearly stated in several places on our General Client Agreement all clients receive and sign before their first day of daycare with us.  While we sincerely wish the bordatella vaccine required by our facility was able to protect against all cough, just like the human flu vaccine, it does not.\n\nAgain, we appreciate your feedback and wish you and your dog well and that you are able to find another facility that suits your needs.  Please let us know if we can help you with any pet care needs in the future."}, "gmap_id": "0x888923bd8bf81a99:0xf88dcba01a8213d"}

However, I found the classes to be ridiculously unprofessional. They charge the going rate, $20 per 1 hour class session for 4 sessions. However, the classes never start on time, the instructor is rarely prepared with her materials, generally she is looking at her phone several times per lesson and disappearing into another room, and 2 of 4 classes ended early. The instructor clearly knows how to train a dog, however this place has a business model based on you dropping your dog off for several weeks and a thousand or more dollars later they train the dog for you. I have no doubt she is exceptionally effective in that environment, but these classes where you learn to train your dog yourself are over complicated, incoherent, and lack any kind of structure. I feel like mostly they are used to get you to admit you need to drop your dog off with them, because that is the only way the dog will get trained. I've had better experiences with a big box store training, and that isn't saying much. There are significantly better training places for the same money with a whole lot less agenda. Hint: look for a non-profit dog obedience and training club.<P>\n\nResponse to the owner:\nFirst off, it's labelled a rolling class. You don't need to offer \"a missed class at no extra charge\", that's part of it being rolling. You show up for 4 classes, whether they are consecutive or not, and I checked ahead of time to make sure that was the case. Second, in 3 of the 4 classes there was no socialization time unless you count the period of time we all waited in the office while the instructor was running late. Ending the class early twice ensured no socialization time. You offer 14 days of board and train for $1100 and 28 days for $2100. Both of those cost more than the thousand dollars I put in my review. So yes, you offer both cheaper and more expensive options, personally I think I hit the middle pretty well with my review. I put in my review you charge the going rate. I don't dispute that. I also said the trainer knows how to train dogs, the trainer simply didn't do much to help people learn to train their own dogs in this one class.

I am the owner of Roverchase and you have not contacted us in your 4 week training so, until this review, I was unaware of your unhappiness.  I have called the other puppies in your class period and they have all been exceptionally pleased and have all signed up for additional group classes for continuing education, so I am a bit confused.  I would be more than happy to talk with you about your experience.  I do know that your dog missed a week of Puppy Kindergarten and we were very happy to accommodate your schedule and allow you to makeup your missed class at no additional charge.     Puppy Kindergarten is a socialization and basic manners class and not a true \"training skills\" course.  This is very clear in the description of our class on our website as well as the materials given in each class period.  As mentioned previously, I would be more than happy to speak with you about your experience, please feel free to call the front office at 205-332-0203 and ask for Abigail.  Also, as a note, our day-training program is our most popular program but it is hardly \"thousands of dollars.\"  Most of our clients spend between $250-450 for four weeks of all day training where they drop their dog of several times a week each week.  This is hardly \"thousands of dollars\" and is, in fact, some of the best prices is town.  Our Puppy Kindergarten class is also priced competitively with \"the big box store\" but you are taking this class from one of the most highly experienced and certified canine behavioral consultants in the city.  As an additional note, our prices are less expensive then the Obedience Club in our town, which is not non-profit.

Aidan did a great job and took time to work on things that I specifically was having trouble with when there was not a big class. I took my dog to daycare and the owner, Abigail, stated that he was having trouble and recommended a behaviorist that comes to Roverchase every Thursday and Saturday. The price was $400 dollars which I was happy to pay because I really wanted the best for Blue (my dog). We talked with the behaviorist for about an hour and that was the end of the session. The behaviorist did not really teach or show me anything that I did not already know. The behaviorist did not even see the behavior that I was having trouble with but yet she was quick to write out a treatment plan. The behaviorist did say that I would need to do private lessons with Abigail which is not included in the cost. So for $400 dollars I talked to a lady for an hour. This is a big scam and I am really troubled that Roverchase would be a part of it.\n\nMy appointment lasted 1 hour. We left right after 5 and the appointment started at 4. So go back and check your cameras again. Yes, I was happy to pay the $400 dollars which I stated previously. But I was under the impression that I would get useful information and more than just talking to a \"Behaviorist\" for an hour. Again, how can she, the behaviorist, tell me what is the cause and real problem without even seeing the behavior. I even emailed the behaviorist trying to get a refund because that was not what I was expecting. Not even wanting a full refund because I understand that she did take time out of her day to meet with me. But I think she can keep the $80 dollars deposit and refund the $320 since I do not need her \"expertise\" any longer. But she has not responded to my email which she specifically stated was the best/fastest way to communicate with her. And as far as reviews need to be left honestly and in good faith...I did that. You decided to lie on your response by saying that you checked the cameras and that I was there for a little under 2 hours. Your cameras times are off or you lied. I told you that I actually loved Roverchase. I even recommended people go to y'all which only one of them did but one is better than none. But I do still think that I was scammed.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1525838804535, "text": "Dear Mr. Auer,\nI\u2019m so surprised to read your review regarding your experience with Blue and Dr. Beihunko, Roverchase, and the chain of events you described.  I appreciate you giving me the opportunity on this public platform to respond.\nFirstly, I\u2019m so glad you were pleased with your group classes at Roverchase with our trainer Aidan.  He\u2019s so talented and our clients just adore him.  I\u2019ll be sure to pass on your praise.  Thank you.\nTo address your concerns regarding your experience with Dr. Biehunko, I will do my best to address them in an organized fashion.\n-  I recommended Blue see Dr. Biehunko when Blue presented to daycare last week after a 5 month absence from Roverchase.  Prior to Blue\u2019s absence, we had discussed at length Blue\u2019s increase reactivity and dog related aggression and you indicated you did not want to address it with us at that time but wanted to work with it on your own.  We advised against it.  When you presented last week, Blue came for a day of daycare and was significantly worse in all behaviors.  I recommended a consultation with Alabama\u2019s only Veterinary Behaviorist, Dr. Biehunko.  I thoroughly explained how Dr. Beihunko\u2019s consultations worked, that they were $400 and for that price you received a 1.5-2hr consultation with her expertise and she would make a diagnosis, a treatment plan, and then have 6 months of medical management and follow up.  I was very clear with you that there was no doubt that Blue would need additional lessons with me and that it would be at additional cost.  You remarked that you felt this price was fair for her experience and expertise and made your appointment for later in the week\n- I do rounds with Dr. Biehunko each day for our shared clients.  She had already been thoroughly briefed on Blue\u2019s behavior at Roverchase the day he returned as well as my notes from his behavior in December when we last saw him.\n- Your consultation with Dr. Biehunko was just barely under 2hrs.  I checked the time stamp on our cameras\n- In your consultation with Dr. Biehunko we were all very surprised to hear that you insisted that Blue has received no training outside of his training at Roverchase.  In fact, you insisted this was true even when specifically questioned about this by Dr. Biehunko and the Roverchase trainers who sat in on the session with you.  As I\u2019m sure you know, it\u2019s extremely difficult for any doctor to communicate effectively and efficiently with a client when that client willfully withholds pertinent information from that doctor that impedes the treatment plan.  As you can see from the attached screen shots, not only has Blue been in training with another trainer, but it was for the very issue he was presenting for.\n- Finally, since your consultation was just over 72 hours ago, and we are very clear that treatment plans can take 2-4 weeks to become effective, it\u2019s hard to understand how you can already be so unhappy with your results.\nI certainly believe that pet owners are allowed to train and handle their pets as they see fit and that there are many fits available for many different preferences.  However, I hope we can both agree that reviews need to be left honestly and in good faith and this one has some glaring issues.  I hope, in light of this, and in light of you many months of happiness with Roverchase, you will consider removing it.  We certainly wish you and Blue only the very best and much success in all of your endeavors.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nAbigail Witthauer\nRoverchase\n\nEDIT::  attachment will not post.\nDescription of photo attachment:  Blue the dog on a trainers business page looking at the screen wl a clearly visible electronic training collar, caption from the trainer, \u201cBlue the Australian Cattle Dog rocked his first lesson.
