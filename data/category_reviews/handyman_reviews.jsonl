I was given Kevin's name and when I researched his website, I was impressed. I will have to admit, I am not easily impressed. I thought, 'very impressive website,' but now let's meet the man. He came out to give me an estimate, on time. He was very professional, and I was again impressed. He responded in a very timely manner (again impressed), and had his quote detailed and moderately priced. He began work on the day he promised, and finished when he promised. He does good quality work, is reliable, is very intelligent, has suggestions to offer, and is respectful. If you have work to be done, he will give you a free estimate, arrive on time, give you a detailed estimate, follow up, etc., because he is ORGANIZED beyond words! He came out and completed my tasks just as he said. He will not only be respectful of you, he will respect your home as well. He will wear shoe covers when he enters your home and clean up and take the trash with him when he leaves! He replaced a door, installed extra shelving in my pantry, replaced by hot water dispenser, installed cabinets over my washer and dryer, and hung my big screen TV on the wall. You may be able to find someone less expensive, but they will also be less professional, less reliable, less experienced, and less respectful of your home.

They were quick to respond in the most professional manner to my complaint. Seth made this matter his top concern, which every customer would want. This just goes to show the quality of customer service this group has. Seth was very apologetic (which he did not need to be) and did a fantastic job on installing my french patio doors. Seth was such a pleasure to be around. Not only was he professional, but he took time to get to know me and my family, which went beyond my expectations. His work and craftsmanship were very impressive. He definitely knows his work and set the bar very high. I could write this review all day on how pleased we were to have him in our home and his work product. I feel like I have finally found a company that I can trust to do an Honest, and PROFESSIONAL job at an unbeatable price.
