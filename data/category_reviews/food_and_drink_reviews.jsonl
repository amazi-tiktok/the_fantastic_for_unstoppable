Breakfast was good but the service was horrible until the end when another waiter started helping with our table. We had a table of 4 and 2 of us had food while the rest of us were still waiting for drinks. The original waitress threw a menu down in front of me and immediately asked if I knew what i wanted without even giving me a chance to look. It took forever to even get our drinks. We decided maybe it was because several people came in at the same time and tried to give it another chance for dinner. We ordered a starter, my husband order a steak and potato, and I just ordered a potato. They came out with just the potatoes. We waited about 20 minutes for the rest of the food which never came. We tried to get our waiters attention but he kept walking. My husband finally got another gentleman's attention for the check. He brought it promptly and we discovered that none of the other food had even been ordered. Would not recommend to anyone. I have been a server 10 years of my life and worked catering and fine dining events for 2 years. I am very understanding and pateint but this was outrageous. If I could give 0 stars, it has definitely earned it.\n\nApril Jackson", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626c174c5aaaab:0x49b4e494aa130f06"}

Bread brought out before the meal was a plate of cheesy cornbread muffins and dinner rolls. Both were cold and no plates were given. The cornbread muffins were very dry and the rolls were meh but tasted better when you didn't want to eat the food ordered. The NY strip (cost $32) came out rare instead of medium well. It was really fatty so I could only eat a little bit. The knife brought with the steak had dish detergent caked all over it. The brussel sprouts were delicious and I would recommend those. The caesar salad ($8) was small, tasted ok, and the croutons were an overly buttery, crunchless mess. A friend of ours ordered the filet mignon medium (cost $34) and it came out mooing with a giant frozen block of garlic butter on top. She said the parm fries were ok and a small portion.  Another friend ordered the Farmers Market mushroom spinach risotto (?$?) which was ok after she seasoned it. We did not have a reservation so we waited for 30 mins.  It took 2 hours for us to order, eat and pay once we sat at the table. I waited for an Apple Jack cocktail for 30 minutes so you can imagine how long everything else took.
