We can tell a difference in taking a shower at our house vs someone else's house. Also, I was upset before about our water system purchase and had left a review and someone called me to attempt to make it right.\nNow for the bad: There were so many false claims during the sales pitch. They are great scammers, so I beg you - please do not trust these people when they come into your house and force you to make a decision about their product that day! Ask as many questions as you can and take the time to read through all the paperwork! It's a good water system, but it is definitely not worth $8000 plus the extra costs they don't tell you about! Here are some lies we were told:\n1. During the sales pitch we were assured we would get the Pure Selects products for life. It was part of the salesman's pitch to show us how much money we'd save because we'd no longer have to buy shampoo, detergent, soap, etc. It was never explained to us that we'd only get 4 vouchers of free product and then after that you have to pay $99 a year for only 10 products from Pure Selects. This was a huge selling point for us, because we thought we were saving some money from the huge purchase. Also, the salesman exaggerated on the quality of the products and water working together. You need more product than what they tell you, and they don't work as good as the claims.\n2. We were never told that we have to get filters replaced every year and some replaced every 2 years, and these filters would cost over $100 each time.\n3. We were told we didn't owe a payment for the first month or so. However, within a few weeks of our purchase we received our first bill that was due within the time frame they said we wouldn't have to pay, and was already accruing interest. They don't talk about the interest rate to you! - Ask about this!!  They say your monthly payment is like $70 or so (can't remember the exact number) that's false. The minimum payment for ours was $96 a month. They avoid talking about interest at all, do not let them get away with that! The financing company charges a daily interest rate, so that adds up!\n4. Our salesman said he'd be back within 30 days of installation to retest our water and make sure we were satisfied with our purchase. False - we never heard from him again. I talked about this in my last review and someone called me and said they would send him out to our house, that never happened either.\nBottom line: Don't trust this company. They lack integrity and will do anything for your money.\n\nUpdate: they give you a Health way air purifier and don't communicate that the filters for that cost $238 yearly.\nAlso, I saw the comment back to this from the company. We gave them the opportunity to correct the issue in the past and they did nothing, they just want to monitor these bad reviews.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1603218320943, "text": "thank you amber for your 2 star review.your opinion does count.i tried to look up your account but its not under amber love. if you will call our office and provide the name the account is under i will certainly try to address your concerns.rainsoft of huntsville has been in huntsville 25 years,we have not been here this long trying to scam people. the product is real and were real people too.i assure you i will do everything in my power to help you.i look forward to hearing from you"}, "gmap_id": "0x88626b904c6ccfd3:0x5e8eb5ae05b0c887"}

Very satisfying and refreshing, heck that was the whole reason we even had them come out. Responsive team and quick installation. Second, I have an issue with the honesty of the house water filtering systems. During the sales pitch it was stated that the slimy feeling on the skins was the oils not being washed off from the \u201charsh\u201d water since it is now filtered. Fine sounds great love it. So we bought and start using it and I couldn\u2019t stand the slimy feeling in the shower, might as well pour a bottle of conditioner over me... no thanks. So I call Rainsoft and tell them I\u2019m not satisfied with that and would like to negotiate a deal. The sales rep deferred to the owner. He could care less about making a deal so he says no problem I\u2019ll have a tech come out and move the \u201cconditioner\u201d to the front of the carbon filtering system. Since he wouldn\u2019t even slightly consider making a deal on the purchase, I accepted to try it out. Slimy feeling gone. I\u2019m satisfied... then my wheels start spinning and I start wondering why if the filtering of \u201charsh\u201d water is why the oils of my skin make my hands/body feel slimy, then why when the conditioner was moved did the slimy feeling go away? If the system is \u201csupposed\u201d to ALWAYS be filtering the harshness then why does the conditioner even matter? But apparently I\u2019m wrong and I\u2019m the only person out of ten years to complain about the \u201cslimy\u201d feeling based off my sales rep. Here is my conclusion that it is \u201cfalse advertising\u201c and the whole oil pitch is a hoax and the conditioner is a added fluff. I will get to the bottom of this either by losing or winning I don\u2019t care it\u2019s worth my effort. So if your happy with your slimy feeling system great keep enjoying! If this makes you question the integrity of the system please call and arise your concern to Mr. Williams the owner. I believe it is super wrong to make false claims. There were many other false claims made during the sales deal also... extremely disappointing and $8k... maybe $6k (not sure the drinking water price) wasted.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1596749018911, "text": "Sorry for your trouble my Harris . I didn\u2019t make that up about the skin . If you think about that\u2019s why the oils doesn\u2019t seem to rinse off is because it\u2019s the oils of your skin. Chlorine & hard water is what affects your skin and maybe you have been use to that and just not adjusting  to the soft water.

However if you make the minimum payment that they pitch to you, it will likely take 11 years to pay off. Also, you will pay double with interest.\nC. You will need more salt for the system to clean itself than initially stated.\nD. The only way to fill the reverse osmosis 5 gallon tank is to literally run good water down your drain. Be prepared to essentially pay for a water leak. I cannot believe that this was the only way to engineer the system.\n\nSo if you can live with the things above, you will like the system.

We are so excited for our great new water and the health benefits for our family.\n\n*Update: After 2 weeks\n\nWe are still loving the water system. However we have noticed a few things that weren\u2019t exactly clear before we bought that you might want to know:\n\nA. The soap offered by the sales person was a big selling point. However, the soap is not the best and you will likely have to buy your own anyways.\nB. They tell you that you can make payments for five years and pay it off. However if you make the minimum payment that they pitch to you, it will likely take 11 years to pay off. Also, you will pay double with interest.\nC. You will need more salt for the system to clean itself than initially stated.\nD. The only way to fill the reverse osmosis 5 gallon tank is to literally run good water down your drain. Be prepared to essentially pay for a water leak. I cannot believe that this was the only way to engineer the system.\n\nSo if you can live with the things above, you will like the system.

Very satisfying and refreshing, heck that was the whole reason we even had them come out. Responsive team and quick installation. Second, I have an issue with the honesty of the house water filtering systems. During the sales pitch it was stated that the slimy feeling on the skins was the oils not being washed off from the \u201charsh\u201d water since it is now filtered. Fine sounds great love it. So we bought and start using it and I couldn\u2019t stand the slimy feeling in the shower, might as well pour a bottle of conditioner over me... no thanks. So I call Rainsoft and tell them I\u2019m not satisfied with that and would like to negotiate a deal. The sales rep deferred to the owner. He could care less about making a deal so he says no problem I\u2019ll have a tech come out and move the \u201cconditioner\u201d to the front of the carbon filtering system. Since he wouldn\u2019t even slightly consider making a deal on the purchase, I accepted to try it out. Slimy feeling gone. I\u2019m satisfied... then my wheels start spinning and I start wondering why if the filtering of \u201charsh\u201d water is why the oils of my skin make my hands/body feel slimy, then why when the conditioner was moved did the slimy feeling go away? If the system is \u201csupposed\u201d to ALWAYS be filtering the harshness then why does the conditioner even matter? But apparently I\u2019m wrong and I\u2019m the only person out of ten years to complain about the \u201cslimy\u201d feeling based off my sales rep. Here is my conclusion that it is \u201cfalse advertising\u201c and the whole oil pitch is a hoax and the conditioner is a added fluff. I will get to the bottom of this either by losing or winning I don\u2019t care it\u2019s worth my effort. So if your happy with your slimy feeling system great keep enjoying! If this makes you question the integrity of the system please call and arise your concern to Mr. Williams the owner. I believe it is super wrong to make false claims. There were many other false claims made during the sales deal also... extremely disappointing and $8k... maybe $6k (not sure the drinking water price) wasted.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1596749018911, "text": "Sorry for your trouble my Harris . I didn\u2019t make that up about the skin . If you think about that\u2019s why the oils doesn\u2019t seem to rinse off is because it\u2019s the oils of your skin. Chlorine & hard water is what affects your skin and maybe you have been use to that and just not adjusting  to the soft water. I\u2019m glad you enjoy the other benefits ."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626b904c6ccfd3:0x5e8eb5ae05b0c887"}

We can tell a difference in taking a shower at our house vs someone else's house. Also, I was upset before about our water system purchase and had left a review and someone called me to attempt to make it right.\nNow for the bad: There were so many false claims during the sales pitch. They are great scammers, so I beg you - please do not trust these people when they come into your house and force you to make a decision about their product that day! Ask as many questions as you can and take the time to read through all the paperwork! It's a good water system, but it is definitely not worth $8000 plus the extra costs they don't tell you about! Here are some lies we were told:\n1. During the sales pitch we were assured we would get the Pure Selects products for life. It was part of the salesman's pitch to show us how much money we'd save because we'd no longer have to buy shampoo, detergent, soap, etc. It was never explained to us that we'd only get 4 vouchers of free product and then after that you have to pay $99 a year for only 10 products from Pure Selects. This was a huge selling point for us, because we thought we were saving some money from the huge purchase. Also, the salesman exaggerated on the quality of the products and water working together. You need more product than what they tell you, and they don't work as good as the claims.\n2. We were never told that we have to get filters replaced every year and some replaced every 2 years, and these filters would cost over $100 each time.\n3. We were told we didn't owe a payment for the first month or so. However, within a few weeks of our purchase we received our first bill that was due within the time frame they said we wouldn't have to pay, and was already accruing interest. They don't talk about the interest rate to you! - Ask about this!!  They say your monthly payment is like $70 or so (can't remember the exact number) that's false. The minimum payment for ours was $96 a month. They avoid talking about interest at all, do not let them get away with that! The financing company charges a daily interest rate, so that adds up!\n4. Our salesman said he'd be back within 30 days of installation to retest our water and make sure we were satisfied with our purchase. False - we never heard from him again. I talked about this in my last review and someone called me and said they would send him out to our house, that never happened either.\nBottom line: Don't trust this company. They lack integrity and will do anything for your money.\n\nUpdate: they give you a Health way air purifier and don't communicate that the filters for that cost $238 yearly.\nAlso, I saw the comment back to this from the company. We gave them the opportunity to correct the issue in the past and they did nothing, they just want to monitor these bad reviews.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1603218320943, "text": "thank you amber for your 2 star review.your opinion does count.i tried to look up your account but its not under amber love. if you will call our office and provide the name the account is under i will certainly try to address your concerns.rainsoft of huntsville has been in huntsville 25 years,we have not been here this long trying to scam people. the product is real and were real people too.i assure you i will do everything in my power to help you.i look forward to hearing from you"}, "gmap_id": "0x88626b904c6ccfd3:0x5e8eb5ae05b0c887"}

To start it off, I thought it was a little rude for the lady to call me and tell me it was going to be a 15 minute test and it was not going to be a sales pitch, just for it to last over 2 hours and it was in fact a sales pitch. However, I looked past it because I was genuinely interested in how bad my water was and also that my neighbor at my old house had the system and told me all about it. So, to say the least, I wasn\u2019t that shocked about how dirty my water was because I was expecting it. Our sales rep, I guess you would call him, was Dan Griffin and he is probably one of the most respectful guys you could ask for to come into your home and I don\u2019t have one complaint on him. Dan, keep doing it the way you're doing it! So my wife and I decided to buy it and we honestly couldn\u2019t be happier with it. Richard Burgess and William Skidmore installed our system and was also the most respectful people you could ask for. I don\u2019t know where they find these people but they are very skilled and made it look very professional!\n\nI feel like it\u2019s a great investment for your health and for your families health. We love the way our water tastes, we feel better after showers, our dishes look cleaner, and our food taste better! For all of those interested in these things and can afford it, I would say do it. For the ones asking theirselves if they can afford a $6k system, let me give you the rundown. It\u2019s a 9.9% interest rate which is high but is better than a banks personal loan interest rate which is about 10% at the time I bought it. Its about a $72 monthly payment. If you pay the minimum payment It\u2019ll take you 13 years to pay it off and you will end up paying $10,600 for it and if you pay $194 monthly payment then you will pay it off in 3 years and end up paying $6,980 for it. Which is not bad because like I said it\u2019s $6k to begin with. Another reason I didn\u2019t have a problem paying this much for it is because it\u2019s for life! They will come and move it for you for free one time if you was to buy another house and then they charge you for any move after that, which is reasonable.\n\nOne of the great benefits to this deal is the soaps they supply you with. They supply you with ~about~ 5 year supply of every soap, detergent and cleaner that is in your house so you won\u2019t be buying none of that stuff for the time your paying off the loan. Might I add, the soaps and cleaners are all natural and pure ingredients. When you think about it, you spend quite a bit on shampoo, conditioner, dish soap, dish washer detergent, laundry detergent, body wash, and glass cleaner a month and you won\u2019t have that expense anymore as long as you like it...and we love it so far.\n\nSo to sum it up, we love our system so far and I already recommend it to people. Since we have had it, we have found out a couple people also have it and one has had it for 8 years and still loves it. No doubt it\u2019s a good system and they are not trying to pull one over on you.\n\nHope it helped all that was worried about what I was worried about and made a difference.

They will sell you $8,000 worth of soaps for in the neighborhood of $350. I do not spend $800 a year on soap, let alone $8000. I doubt I spend $350, we are only two people.

He did not have any literature to leave us except for the \"SOAP SURVEY\", which I thought was odd and suspicious.

They just try to tell you the monthly payments which seem reasonable until you do the math. I'm sure the product is good, though WAY overpriced. It just really bothers me that they give you no literature to try and make a decision later and they call you and talk you into them coming for a 30 minute water test.

I did, and after a brief talk, he agreed to stand by what the salesperson had originally told us, and move the softener for free. The two gentlemen that came out to disconnect and reconnect the system, Doug and his assistant, were very polite and knowledgeable. I sincerely appreciate that Randy stood by the salesperson's word (who I will add is also no longer with the company), because I know that businesses can't just go by what customers claim.\nI think my husband and I have learned a lesson out of this to ALWAYS get promises in writing. Thank you Randy, and the team at Rainsoft for fixing this.\n\nOriginal post:\nAs a longtime customer (5 years now I think?) to one of their \"top of the line\" softeners, they tried to upsell us a newer version when we had a little valve go out on ours. Luckily we got the valve replaced and saved thousands of dollars by resisting an unnecessary sell.\nNow that it's time to move, I called the Huntsville distributor the other day requesting a move and they said it'll be $699 for \"disconnection\"...I told the lady that the man that sold us our softener years ago told us that the product comes with a FREE move that does NOT expire. The rep apparently pulled up our contract on the phone and said that that's not even mentioned in our contract, and even if it were, they only honor one year out moves.\nI messaged this very page a few days ago one more question (if we disconnected the softener ourselves, would the move and reconnection be less since the rep specifically said the fee is for disconnection.\nIt has been a few days and still no answer.\n\nTo sum it up, this company LIES, they are *extremely* pushy sales people and also try to sell unnecessarily to the customer, and their CS on social media is non-existent in my experience.
