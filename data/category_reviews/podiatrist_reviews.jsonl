The procedure went well, he was very happy with the results and other than some stiffness (which he tells me to just wiggle my toe and all will be well - true), I felt relatively NO PAIN.  I used the medications that were given to me and I also supplemented with some Turmeric for the swelling.

Our daughter is a competitive Open Champ Irish Dancer, dancing 8 hours a week in Nashville and practicing on her own many more hours. The dance is extremely hard on the feet, and sadly, she suffered a Jones Fracture while practicing. It\u2019s a somewhat common injury for dancers/athletes and doesn\u2019t always heal well due to low blood flow to this particular area of the foot.\n\nDr. Kyle is super attentive; we never felt rushed during the appointments! He actually pulled up a video of Irish Dancing to see what stress is put on the feet, and based on the high level of stress she puts her feet through, he recommended to have a surgical screw put into the bone to ensure faster healing and to greatly decrease the chance of reinjury to this weakened area.  His nursing staff was very responsive to my many questions left on voice mail, getting back to me right away. ( yes, I was that patient\u2019s mom, LOL) We hope never to have to see the good folks at TOC again, obviously!, but if in need, we wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend Dr. Kyle. Oh!

The dance is extremely hard on the feet, and sadly, she suffered a Jones Fracture while practicing. It\u2019s a somewhat common injury for dancers/athletes and doesn\u2019t always heal well due to low blood flow to this particular area of the foot.\n\nDr. Kyle is super attentive; we never felt rushed during the appointments! He actually pulled up a video of Irish Dancing to see what stress is put on the feet, and based on the high level of stress she puts her feet through, he recommended to have a surgical screw put into the bone to ensure faster healing and to greatly decrease the chance of reinjury to this weakened area.  His nursing staff was very responsive to my many questions left on voice mail, getting back to me right away.

The dance is extremely hard on the feet, and sadly, she suffered a Jones Fracture while practicing. It\u2019s a somewhat common injury for dancers/athletes and doesn\u2019t always heal well due to low blood flow to this particular area of the foot.\n\nDr. Kyle is super attentive; we never felt rushed during the appointments! He actually pulled up a video of Irish Dancing to see what stress is put on the feet, and based on the high level of stress she puts her feet through, he recommended to have a surgical screw put into the bone to ensure faster healing and to greatly decrease the chance of reinjury to this weakened area.  His nursing staff was very responsive to my many questions left on voice mail, getting back to me right away. ( yes, I was that patient\u2019s mom, LOL) We hope never to have to see the good folks at TOC again, obviously!, but if in need, we wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend Dr. Kyle. Oh!

The dance is extremely hard on the feet, and sadly, she suffered a Jones Fracture while practicing. It\u2019s a somewhat common injury for dancers/athletes and doesn\u2019t always heal well due to low blood flow to this particular area of the foot.\n\nDr. Kyle is super attentive; we never felt rushed during the appointments! He actually pulled up a video of Irish Dancing to see what stress is put on the feet, and based on the high level of stress she puts her feet through, he recommended to have a surgical screw put into the bone to ensure faster healing and to greatly decrease the chance of reinjury to this weakened area.  His nursing staff was very responsive to my many questions left on voice mail, getting back to me right away.

We last saw Meredith in April 2020 when our state was under the \u201cStay At Home\u201d order. At the time, masks were not required but were only recommended. While I did enter the room without a mask, Meredith rudely asked why I didn\u2019t have one. I responded because they were not required; however, if it made her more comfortable I would be happy to wear one. There was no refusal to wear a mask. I would have happily worn one and now do everyday. She replied by saying that it was fine and she didn\u2019t want to argue. I agreed that I wasn\u2019t interested in arguing and only wanted to help with her inserts. After the adjustments of her device were made, I returned into the room where Meredith had apologized for her rudeness. I am shocked to have received notification of this review because she left in such a good mood. During her visit, we had safety measures in place, but masks were not one of them. In April and May, our office had anyone scheduled to notify us via phone once they had arrived. We would call them back via phone when a room was available for them to come in. As the effects of this virus increased, our office began asking everyone to wear masks during there visit. We did not make this mandatory and left the decision up to each individual. However, as of July 16, 2020 the state amended the \u201cSafer At Home\u201d order to require everyone to wear masks. As of now, we do not allow anyone in our office without a mask until this order has expired. Once expired our office will continue wearing masks but only recommend that our customers/patients wear one. We also began checking everyone\u2019s temperature by using an infrared thermometer before signing in to be seen. I\u2019m sorry that you are unhappy with how our business has attempted to operate during this unparalleled time. Hope your feet are happy!\n\nSteven Ford, C.Ped"}, "gmap_id": "0x888918a303322c55:0xbfff2036c7d6d734"}

He came in and was scheduled for exploratory surgery to fix SHODDY WORK DONE BY DR CHANDLER during a sinus polyp surgery and my step son began to pour blood from his Sphenopalatine Artery and the office was more worried about getting another three hundred dollar copay out of us than helping my son.  My wife had to scream for help in the office to get nurses and a doctor to get my son and help him.  We were treated shabbily during the whole ordeal.  My step son was bleeding to death and they did not even have the ability to  give him blood at this facility.  They almost killed him!  IT WAS HORRIBLE!  A HORRIBLE ORDEAL!!!!  I should post photos of all the blood.  The clinic manager was not friendly, everyone acted as if they did not know what was going on or what to do.  They had to take my son by ambulance over the the hospital and then the nightmare continued.  The ER doctor threw my son out of the hospital room that he was scheduled to be in.  It was like they tried to kill my son and then they were trying to sweep us under the carpet or out the door.  TO HIDE US AND THE HORRIBLE THINGS THEY DID AND THE WAY THEY ALMOST KILLED MY SON!!!   It was a nightmare!  They were going to give my son a blood transfusion in the ER and sweep us out the door.  MY WIFE HAD TO ENLIST THE HELP OF THE AMBULANCE DRIVERS Who could see that our son was in agony and practically DEAD AT THEIR HANDS!  The ambulance drivers GOD BLESS THEM talked the angry, crazy doctor into keeping our son and putting us in a room for the night.  This was the worst thing that has ever happened to our family.  I would not allow this clinic to operate on a PET COCKROACH if I had one!

Karen was great on the phone in setting up my appointment and answering all of my questions.  Check in was easy, and staff was great (Anethia and Kristina).  I came mainly to get a new pair of orthotics but wanted to see Dr. Campbell.  He was great, very thorough and I know his treatment plan will help me.  I am a local physician and am happy to know the group to refer patients!  Thanks so much for a great experience!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889197bc2c34b8b:0x5c7e7d837154ac43"}
