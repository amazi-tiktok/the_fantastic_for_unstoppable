I was satisfied with the fact that I felt that I got what I paid for. I have used other law firms in the past for things unrelated to a bankruptcy, so I knew in advance what to expect from a competent, experienced and knowledgeable group of attorneys. They have always handled my legal concerns in a timely, professional and competent manner. They even went above and beyond, on more than one occasion, to assist me and did things for me that I really did feel were outside the scope of what I had paid them to do and I even expected to be charged more for their services and would have been happy to pay additionally for the services they provided to me. That is enough to warrant an excellent referral to the point I would be more than happy to recommend them to all of my friends and family, but that's not where their professional services ended. Truthfully what I am more impressed with and what has meant so much to me personally is the fact they have a \"heart\". When you get a letter in the mail that you don't understand and need help deciphering the \"legalese\" you can call and speak to someone like \"Morgan\". She's not just someone answering their phone. You helped me understand what it was that I got in the mail and set up an appointment to speak to attorney the next day. That all wonderful, but what meant the most was that she listened to me, the struggle I have had since the pandemic and how my financial circumstances have worsened. She helped me relax she offered an ear to listen to me and a heart to respond to me, not as just a client of their law firm, but as a human. She gave me kind hearted conversation that's given me the strength to relax until I speak to the attorney tomorrow. That is priceless! I don't know how you can assign a dollar figure for something like that, but it reinforces the opinion that I sought out the best law firm I could find to help me with this matter and \"Morgan\" cemented the opinion to me that I made the right decision. If you need a lawyer to handle your legal affairs, that watches out for your best interest, doesn't charge you again to assist you you when you have additional needs that arise out of your bankruptcy and most importantly to me, has your back and cares about how this is impacting your life and you emotionally, call Brock and Stout. They will take care of you professionally, legally and in my case emotionally when I absolutely needed it the most; you won't regret your decision. I never leave reviews for companies because I am usually so busy. Today \"Morgan\" just went so far out of her way, not just to answer the phone, not just to help interpret the letter I received in the mail, not even to set up a much needed appointment with the attorney; she helped me moby listening and having a heart so I can continue to make it through this very stressful time in my life. In the midst of all my financial struggles and hardship God has a plan and I know that calling Brock and Stout was part of that plan.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1589423145362, "text": "It has been our pleasure to help you.

I'm 48 yrs old and I felt that my case was going to be a difficult one to prove. There were 2 reasons why I thought the judge's decision would be unfavorable; my age and my disability weren't supported by any medical documentation, such as X-ray's, CT-scans, Ultrasounds. Plus, the treatment for my condition was the cause of my condition. I was suffering from other conditions that had been documented over the years by several physicians in various disciplines. Atty Cox wanted to focus primarily on Abdominal & Pelvic Adhesive Disease as the culprit, and casually mention the other conditions. Yes, I was concerned with her thought process due to the fact this condition had the least amount of supporting medical documentation. In that moment I agreed, she was the professional and because she had worked for the  Social Security Administration in the administrative law division.  It was called the Office of Hearings and Appeals at the time.  She had received extensive legal training on the Social Security Act and the Code of Federal Regulations. Also, she had received medical training to learn medical terminology, as well as about injuries and disease processes that can interfere with a person's ability to hold a job. We filed my appeal July 2016 and my hearing Sept 2018. During the hearing with ADJ the ruling was favorable. I haven't seen a dime yet but I know it's coming. Attorney Cox's and her team knows their stuff, trust them and they will get it done for you. Anytime I felt unsure I would call or email, they always replied timely. Also, you as a client have to be thorough in making sure that the physician has noted your conditions in your medical file and request a copy of medical notes, lab reports and any tests that are taken for your personal file and make copy for attorney.

She was very thorough, precise, and caring in her work.

I have an illness that is very difficult to prove an inability to work. I contacted many attorneys who for that reason refused to take my case. One of them recommended Kevin Green. I was really losing hope of getting the help I needed by the time I contacted him. He met with me personally within a week of contacting him, evaluated my case and agreed to help me. I was very impressed with his knowledge of the way the system works.He got me a an expedited hearing (you must meet qualifications) and when my doctor's office wouldn't send record copies to Social Security, Mr. Green went above and beyond to get what we needed. He came into court prepared and determined. I met him feeling I had little hope of getting the help that I needed, but he took on the challenge when others wouldn't and won the case for me. If it weren't for him, I would still be dealing with my illness without insurance or proper medical care. I have a lot of gratitude and respect for him.

When I was faced with mine in 2019, I was referred to Dani Bone through a coworker and friend that I trusted. I initially hired Dani because I heard he was the very best and he would fight for me. I called and even though they were extremely busy, they saw me right away. After hearing my situation, Dani was honest with me and said, \"You need Sam. \" My case was very complicated having both personal and business issues, assets and properties to divide, custody and other court issues . Sam took it as a challenge. He stayed with me and guided me through the whole divorce process. It was not easy, it was extremely tough but Sam knew how to handle every situation that came up. When going through a 2 yr battle, you need to know and  feel confident that your attorney has your back and has your best interest at heart. I emotionally fell apart many times and he helped me to learn to stand up for myself and it made me a stronger person through this process. All I wanted was what was fair- he got me exactly what I asked for! I was extremly pleased with services of Sam, Dani and their dedicated and caring staff. Amanda, Fredrick and Osha were just wonderful to work with. The whole staff made me feel comfortable and at ease through a very uncomfortable life circumstance.  While the other party had 5 attorneys through the process , I had one.  I only needed the one team- I had The Best with Sam & Dani Bone. Sam was honest, upfront, bold and encouraging. He never had to be ugly or raise his voice in court or trial and never once belittled anyone. I recall him saying, \"It doesn't have to be ugly\". Being a Christian, a professional, a self employed woman, a Realtor and a mother of 2, this was imperative to me. Sam treated both parties with total RESPECT always . That was very important to me.  I did my part and provided the true facts, evidence and proof- he did his part and presented my case with true professionalism , Integrity and no one was disrespected in the process. I would \ud83d\udcaf percent recommend Sam & Dani Bone if you want to be represented by someone who will always have your back and is not afraid to fight for your best interest.

In the end he recommended a different lawyer he felt would do a great job on our particular case.\n\nMr Bone could have talked us into hiring him but instead actually gave up business to tell us our particular situation and location could be best served by another lawyer who he gave us her contact info. We have since hired his recommended lawyer.\n\nI would recommend Mr Bone as he seems to be an honest hard working guy.  In my experience a guy who will say that in a specific case that there is a better option and is willing to give away income is a stand up person.  I hope this review helps others as hiring a lawyer is a big deal. We have hired bad ones but Mr Bone appears to be a very good lawyer with good ethics.

Sam instantly went to work and it took a little time but he didn't give up until I was able to walk out of the courtroom with a misdemeanor charge. That doesn't happen just anywhere.

He will go out of his way to help and set up a payment arrangement for you.  I could not have had a better Gadsden criminal lawyer.  Sam knows the laws.  Everytime I see him he tells me he is proud for me to see how well I am doing.  I am going for my degree in psychology and further to a doctrine.

Just today, our order was issued. Once again, his hard work and character and one of a kind skill prevailed. I still have sole custody and I am assured a meaningful relationship with the most important thing in my life. I can never repay Jim for his decade long dedication to making sure we're protected.

I had worked for over 40 years and trying to adjust to being home all day and learning to manage severe pain was almost more than I could handle. Fortunately, I have a great family and church support system for all of that. However, dealing with arranging and establishing my long term income was a stress factor I had no idea how to handle especially not knowing what was required. Even when my long term disability insurance company recommended that I use the Friedman Law Firm, I was concerned with how much it would cost me and how much interaction it would take to get them all the information they would need. I was so pleased and relieved with the whole process. Friedman was very sympathetic and understanding of how much pain I was dealing with. They only asked of me what they absolutely needed to. They made contacts with doctors and therapists directly as needed to put my case together.

I first looked for a local attorney around my area and was told that they would not take my case for one reason or another. My disability was very focused, at first, on 1 main thing. Long term side effects from a medical treatment i had gone through and never came back from! I did NUMEROUS searches for attorneys that specialize or are knowledgeable in my particular case/medical conditions. I first hired a firm from up north that will take about any case, but you never get a straight answer. they could not even tell me why after my original denial, I wasn't getting a \"reconsideration\" phase before my hearing..which i never had to attend BTW ( we won my case without a hearing and by records alone and dr \"testimony\").The moment the legal \"team\" could not answer that question, i went back on a mission. I came across Friedman Law Firm.  It never mattered to me that my attorneys were in state or out of state. with technology today,most everything can be done through a phone call, conference call, or via email and internet. The days of going in and sitting down with your attorney face to face is still common,but absolutely not necessary. Believe me when i say that I feel like I know my paralegal and Jessica Friedman personally, but we have never met! Going back a minute, I ended up calling and speaking to a paralegal from Friedman Firm who answered my question about the reconsideration phase in the first 5 minutes!!The other firm hadn't called me back with an answer in days! After that, She got a lot of info from me, went and spoke with Miss Jessica about my case. She had more questions. I answered. the poor paralegal went back and forth a few times that day, but at the end of the day I had fired the previous firm and KNEW I WAS IN THE RIGHT HANDS NOW. Even with the long distance between our cities.\nI have NEVER EVER, NEVER not gotten a return response by my legal team- either called back or emailed! I was a nervous wreck through my whole case, but they were as cool as cucumbers!! It didn't click until I won my case JUST HOW GOOD, ARTICULATE, AND CONFIDENT THEY REALLY ARE!!! NO NONSENSE. THEY HAVE GREAT INTEGRITY IN THE OFFICE AS WELL!!!!!\nCompetent, knowledgeable, on top of things (even when you might not think so haha), great great legal teams, personable interactions with clients, will ALWAYS answer any questions you may have.\nI could go on and on about this firm and how i give them so much of the credit for changing my life forever! yes, im the disabled one. im also only 42 years old. they had to prove to a Judge that it was/is a legitimate claim, esp with my age being so young.. without them i could have never gotten my disability at all!!!\nI don't believe anyway!\nIF YOU WANT A FIRM THAT WORKS HARD FOR THEIR CLIENTS AND KEEPS IN CONTACT ALONG THE WAY.. THIS IS THE FIRM FOR YOU!!!\nDON'T LET THE DISTANCE BE A FACTOR. THEY CAN TRAVEL TOO YA KNOW (WHEN NECESSARY.). ;) THANKS JESSICA AND ALL THE STAFF THERE AT THE FIRM!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1562338419057, "text": "Ms. Jones, thank you for your kind words.
