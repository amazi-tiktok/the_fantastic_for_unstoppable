After taking down all the info, we had a detailed quote, with various coverage options, e-mailed to us within minutes. While talking with her the following day about these options, she patiently answered all our questions and clearly conveyed information. Because she was so professional, upbeat, and intelligent, we decided that this is exactly the type of person we wanted to work with. So, besides the car insurance, we decided to move ALL our insurance (Car, Home, and Wind) over to her at Allstate.

After a recent automobile wreck, Coastal Insurance informed me of Diminished Value......I have been driving for more than 30 years and have had 3 or 4 claims during that time.   Not once has any other Insurance Agency ever informed  me of Diminished Value ---- After a claim, most Insurance Companies do in fact pay the claim, but your car is now worth less than it was prior to the accident, even after repairs;  this is obvious to most people.  What is Not obvious or well known, is that Reputable Carriers will also pay you an amount of money, based on a particular formula, in addition to paying for the cost of the repairs.  This additional money covers the reduced value of your car --- but your Insurance Company will not tell you about this.....Reggie, with Coastal Insurance, not only told me about this, but his website even has a calculator for customers to determine the approximate amount of additional money you may be entitled to receive.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1516286989105, "text": "Your words mean the world to us.

I have been a customer of this agency (policies including homeowner\u2019s, multiple autos, and a boat) for approximately 5 years.  I had a claim due to a flash flood damaging a vehicle.  The claim process was a nightmare, mostly due to working with virtual/out-of-state adjusters (something Bryan\u2019s agency was apparently unaware of).\n\nIt took over a month to get the claim settled - currently on day 34 and the claim is still open.  The car was eventually totaled on day 22, but later Allstate decided they would rescind that decision and repair it (after I had purchased a replacement).  Later, they changed again and totaled it.\n\nOn day 13, I emailed the office manager and asked that Bryan call me.  I understand the agency does not directly deal with claims, but they can assist and advise where necessary, especially when the process is a bad experience for their customers.  Instead, his office manager called me, provided no assistance, and seemed surprised that Allstate does not have auto adjusters in Birmingham (where this agency is selling auto policies).\n\nAccording to the multiple solicitation emails I receive weekly, customer service is very important to this agency.  I have emailed Bryan three times and asked that he call me as stated above.  As of today (day 34), Bryan has not called nor contacted me outside of solicitation emails trying to sell me additional products and services.\n\nI eventually had to file a formal Department of Insurance complaint against the company and the agency.  If you make the mistake of choosing Allstate as your insurer, I would highly recommend finding a different agent.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88892256c31aeb37:0xe56ce9c7ece18c08"}

It was so helpful to have the process started for me.  First Baldwin Insurance's team of Valerie Miller and Michelle Thomas were extremely helpful and always provided excellent customer service in addressing my questions and concerns - THANK YOU BOTH!  Not only did they help with this claim, they provided valuable insight for my renewal to even be better protected should a similar event occur.\n\nI worked with both Michelle and Valerie on my initial insurance policy and based upon the results of my coverage, I am extremely pleased with the advice and coverage my policy provided me.  THANK YOU BOTH AGAIN!\n\nThe Adjuster, Chris Van Wert of Harbor Claims, was nothing short of phenomenal as well.  After an initial call explaining my situation, I sent Chris details for my claim.  My claim was immediately approved and within days, I received a check.  Chris explained to me how my policy applied to my claim.  When calling Chris, he dropped everything he was doing to assist me. He is extremely customer service focused and very professional.\n\nWhile having to deal with an insurance claim and the related damages is not pleasant, I wanted to share that my claim experience with Michelle, Valerie and Chris, has been nothing short of phenomenal!

He never called me back, I had to call him a few days later.  Once again he said he would call me back, but I had to call him back again. He then informed me that because of a zero-payment claim and another minor claim that I can't verify, the only coverage I could get was going to be twice as much as I had been paying with my previous Liberty Mutual policy .

It's like the credit union version of insurance (I think! I'm still new to the concept). I know not everyone will get the lower price, but if you haven't tried, seriously give these ladies a call.\n\nOLD review: I'll be honest - I haven't met the agent, and I haven't spoken to anyone in the office at length. But to me, this simply speaks of the efficiency this office is working at. If I have an issue, boom, done by the front desk. Taken care of. Five minutes or less. Need to make an extra payment?

We were solid paying customers and paid 6 months in advance the entire time we had the policy. My wife and I just merged bank accounts...so we contacted our agent and had the account switched to the merged account since we were planning to close the other one out... Allstate told us it was taken care of. Not True! - So we realized something was wrong when we got a notice (which was the 1st notice we had received) stating that our policy coverage had been terminated because of failure to make payment. We called the agent office and informed them that we had received the notice and apparently the amount of time it takes for the bank account changes to take place didn't kick it into effect until they had already tried to auto draft the payment from the wrong account and therefore instead of calling us to let us know, they just sent us a letter after the policy was terminated. So at this point I called to discuss with an agent on the Friday when we found out to see what could be done  because we were supposed to be going out of town and currently had no insurance coverage... I spoke with a very polite office admin in which I asked her to see if there was anything that could be done.... in which she obliged but she informed us that she would need to call the underwriter and make sure they were going to reinstate the policy, which we didn't think would be an issue because we had not had any accidents/accident claims while we had been under the related policy. So we get a call back about 2 hours later that the underwriter was not going to reinstate the policy because during the term of the coverage, my wife had made a claim to have a cracked windshield replaced in which she asked the agent before making the claim and was told that it would not go against us in regards to our policy or premium because it was part of what was covered under the policy that we were paying for. We asked them to see if there was a manager or agency owner that could do anything to correct the situation but apparently our local office manager was on vacation and the other branch managers that were supposedly contacted either weren't really contacted or didn't care because we were never contacted again and ended up having to find a new insurance coverage through a different agency. This was probably the worst I have ever been treated from a customer service standpoint in consideration that we are always good prompt paying customers and the fact that our bill not getting auto-drafted was attributed to Allstate's screw-up and then we weren't notified until our policy had already been cancelled and then they used the most petty excuse to not re-instate our policy.

They have this amazing lady name Katrina Prince, in the Anniston, Alabama location. When I very first signed up, she helped me make sure I was getting the coverage that I needed. Each year, when its time to renew, I call, but each time I encounter someone other than Mrs. Prince, it always ends up a problem, and me about to cancel and go to another company. Then, I end up either asking for or emailing her, who in turns always corrects the problem, and get me signed right on up. So, I have just decided that, I will contact her when its time to renew each year. Each of my friends with Direct also agree. She actually treat you like a close friend or family member. I have never felt rushed or forced to accept something I did not want. I have had cheaper rates offered, but I think the level of care Mrs. Prince shows to the customers keeps us there. I believe if she left, we would also.  I DON'T THINK THEY GET ANY BETTER THAN MRS. KATINA PRINCE.

This was the same in this case. We bought a beachhouse in Gulf Shores and our normal insurance company back home wasn\u2019t able to insure the home being so far away. We were recommended to a whitehaven by our realtor for their service and pricing. Honestly the pricing was good but I can not say the same for the service. 9 months ago we had to file a claim for our tile roof that was leaking from a large storm that came through and tore off some of the tiles. 9 months later I\u2019m still trying to get the insurance holder to finish the claim their own adjuster has suggested to fully replace the roof due to the inability to match the tiles. Normally I\u2019d have it fixed myself but no one has been able to find suitable replacements that would even fit. Whitehaven has never once called to check on the claim nor offer any advice nor assistance with getting this completed. So we still have a beautiful beachhouse with a roof that has patchwork to prevent the leaks and reasonable cost insurance that\u2019s absolutely no good. Be careful what insurance you go with ... you just might need it one day. Also be careful who is your insurance broker. Whitehaven is quick to give you a quote and setup the insurance but absolutely no assistance when you really need them. I looked at their reviews before using them initially and wish someone had placed this review so that I would\u2019ve avoided using them to begin with.

I did try to get the claim office on the phone immediately at the scene, via the 24/7 \"call and report immediately\" number on the back of my insurance card.\n\nI have the audio on my dashcam for that where I kept trying, and they gave  me the runaround. Everyone I have talked to locally about this seem to not understand why, and honestly I have no idea why either. Once I got to my local branch, we got a claim number. Easy peasy. Apparently I'm the only person who has ever been told \"we're just roadside.\"\n\nI just hope... that now that I have someone's email and direct number, that we can get through this....\n\nNow, on a previous claim, they had NO issue doing a claim when it was something against me.\n\nI also wanted to ask a simple question, but unfortunately, the person answering the phone acted like a full-stop barrier. They kept on focusing on a different claim, and would not even let me speak about this one.... that I FINALLY got started/a claim number for.\n\nI had to waste more time, drive down there to the office, to ask my question. My question had a short simple answer when I got there. It didn't have to be that complicated.\n\nVicki (sp?) always treated me right (within AAA's policy at least), but as a whole, AAA's insurance product just plain stinks compared to other policies I had in the past. Vicki is why I give AAA 2 stars instead of 1. I think she was trying her best.\n\nState Farm, who I came from, even though they accused me of false odometer every year (I work from home), they at least gave me a claim number when I called, and they ultimately covered things in the end, like glass, which AAA doesn't cover at all.  I keep learning of things with AAA that are not covered, or just under-insured...\n\nThe ultimate irony is, the Missouri AAA was sitting there accusing me of the false odometer thing too... the very reason why I left State Farm. I even ended up going down to the Acton Rd office to drag someone out to the car, so they can look  for themselves. On a modern car, you can't fake the odometer reading like you can on an older car... this is a 2017.\n\nSeems like every time I need AAA for something, even if it is simply to update phone numbers, it's unnecessarily difficult.\n\nTrust is important, and I need to be able to trust that my insurance company will handle things without argument, in the policy, and that the policy is sufficient for incidents like this current one.\n\nI'm frustrated, stressed out, and didn't need all that added on to the fact that a potentially uninsured motorist just rear ended me....", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888dc22ad272885:0x2371f9313aac4f4"}

Now after a month of proving I never lapsed I get a letter again stating I haven't had auto for over 2 months and they are charging me back charges due to Allstate: Cody Coffey in Centre telling them with multiple letters that my insurance was cancelled and there was no current insurance. Now I am having to write a letter, send in by email, mail, fax, online proof along with my current provider doing the same thing and proving I had this as of day of cancellation. Then to top it off they stated they cancelled me in the letters when I clearly have all proof also that I cancelled. They make it extremely difficult if you leave. I never again will go with these people I don't care how much money I can save. Very HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! They sucker you in on price with homeowners then jack it up where its more than anyone.
