You also forgot to mention when you were cursing at me all I said to you was sir please leave the store. Not that it\u2019s your business but I chose 3rd shift.

The employee that was working tonight/morning was one of the most rude people I've ever encountered. I greeted him with \"Good morning, how are you sir?\".

When he eventually sauntered over instead of helping me move the items to the correct one, he just pointed and approached it and staired at me while I moved everything. I didn't mind having to move my stuff but, in my eyes, proper customer service would dictate the employee assist in moving everything because I had no idea I was at the incorrect register when I sat the things down. He also was not wearing a mask, even though there is a sign on the doors saying \"masks required inside this facility\".\n\nAnyway, maybe I'm just being petty, but it just irked me the wrong way, him with his superior attitude and all. In the grand scheme of things im sure my contributions won't be missed, but treating people in the manner he did me will eventually lead to more people never returning.
