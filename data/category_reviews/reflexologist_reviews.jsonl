Not only is Sand a great masseuse, but she is an RN who has taken her medical knowledge, and healing qualities to another level.  Opening Restoration Mind Body and Sole was the best decision she ever made, allowing her to completely immerse her mind and soul into treating and creating life changing treatment options for the patients that walk through  her doors.\n\nYesterday she did a lymphatic massage followed by a foot detox to rid my body of all the toxins hat have accumulated for years .  She did this same detox last week and I was overwhelmed and amazed at the results of that initial treatment and the toxins that were extracted from my body.  I simply couldn\u2019t believe what I saw.  That prompted me booking the massage and another foot detox yesterday.\n\nOne thing I immediately noticed when the detox was through was less pain in my joints, hands, and feet.   I especially noticed less tightness in my hands.  One thing she explained to me is that detox draws out all the toxins and inflammations from throughout the body - especially liver and joints .  Inflammation is the culprit of swelling and pain in arthritis.  I felt so much better all week.\n\nYesterday\u2019s appointment   left me more relaxed and destressed than I\u2019ve been in months.  No tension , aches or stress.  Totally peaceful. These two visits have shown me enough about my body and the things we absorb to make me more conscious of taking care of it and treating it better.   I\u2019m certainly not getting any younger .  I am so impressed with these results, that Ive decided to have the colonic cleanse to completely clean out my system and take better control of my health.\n\nThis is a wonderful place, owned by a wonderful person who clearly loves her patients and what she does to help them stay healthy.   The fact that she is an RN is an extra bonus bc she knows the body so well.\n\nPlease give them a call and book your appointment now!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c93124a2470d1:0x1fde73139a3a9402"}

Was a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews but thought would give it a try.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised.  I called.to make a appt for a other day as it was late.  They said they had a table open so I went on in.  The place is in a small strip mall but most of them here in Huntsville are.  Once you get inside looks like most small massage places.  I have included a few pictures from their website as they are accurate of what you actually see.\n\nThe lady was very nice and very professional.  She gave me a very relaxing massage.  I would have like a little more work on my neck but I did say anything as I wanted to just see what was their normal.  Only other improvement I can think of is she did not do the front of my legs at all.  Since I do alot of lifting and crawling around that is always a sore spot.  But over all I left feeling very relaxed.\n\nI did opt for the shower table as some recommended to get the oil off.  Again very professional and make sure \"everything\" that needed to be covered stayed covered.  Thought it might be awkward but the way she did it made it feel very professional so really did not even think about it.\n\nThe only real negative I can say is the same as of other peoples reviews.  They leave the door slightly open so anyone walking by can see in.  I understand from a security view but the walls are paper thin (like most every other place you get a massage) so you can hear everything so I do not really see that the pros outway the cons for doing this.  I could not really relax and although I really like this place it was the reason for 4 stars vs 5 stars.  It also would be the one thing that made me look somewhere else \u2639.\n\nAlso one note since it came up in some of the other reviews.  No one pressured or even asked me for a tip.  I did give her one as she did a good job but she never asked.  The only thing they asked was if I would like a 4 hand massage (I only booked a 60 min) and when I said not tonight that was that.\n\nOver all a great place and so far I recommend it for a great relaxing massage if you dont mind everyone that walks by your door seeing in \ud83e\uddd0.\n\nWill update if I go back.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOA1FbHtCamDoFPPdQMGkYztFVFx2ThZNK83lYB=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzJSml9LE8V6WWeNTZyOMMsnBursNL_BGv5fqt=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNHV4HZpfhPDmPBQ9S1sMAcpQGLrFHWfO65-f7=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1590289416354, "text": "Hello, Terrell.

I had an appointment this evening at 5pm, but woke up experiencing illness so wanted to reschedule my appointment, especially in light of the Covid-19 climate we are still in. I called their office first thing (8am) and explained my illness to Debra and informed her I would like to reschedule. She gave me several run-arounds concerning why even though I was sick I could not reschedule. Even so much as stating the owners are the reason why if a patron feels ill they still have to be serviced. She then said half of my Massage Envy points banked for today\u2019s service would be expensed because of the same day reschedule. I asked what concessions are made for feverish patrons. She said they are still required to show up and Massage Envy would take their temperature. I told her I would be going to the doctor\u2019s office today and could provide an excuse. She said a manager would get back with me today, but no one ever contacted me. After having my suspicions proven that I had been lied to and no one would contact me, I called back to ask about what was the current status of my appointment/points. I was then informed the appointment was taken off the records and all of my points for today\u2019s session had been expensed. I am extremely frustrated with their \u201ccustomer care\u201d. I feel lied to and with their \u201cCovid protocols\u201d that were exhibited today first-hand to me, I will NEVER feel comfortable patronizing them again. There is no telling how many patrons who have been ill (with or without fevers) have received service and unintentionally spread it to others with the help of this location\u2019s policies.

The bed warmer was either not on or not working.... Bummer. Also, the light in the room was on the whole time... I like it dark and relaxing. Rooms need to be vacuumed.\ud83d\ude1e\n\n2. My MT was clearly sick with something respiratory going on. Being that close and breathing over me sick was a major deterrent on a return visit. Not sure if he kept stopping the massage to wipe his nose or what but I've never had so many pauses in a massage. \ud83d\ude37I'm used to smooth continuous pressure/ touch during a massage except for when its time to turn. Also, no hot towels this time!!!\ud83d\ude29\n\n3. I feel like this particular chain is on the downhill... The past few times I've gone, you can never get the same therapist twice. It appears there is a lot of turnover here. It is noisy in the hallway out side of the room. I made sure to use all of my gift card so my friends and family can start giving me new gift cards to use somewhere new.\ud83d\ude10\n\n4.

The services are great, the environment peaceful and clean, the therapist thorough. This place is busy,  so they will leave the room to answer the phone etc, but will usually compensate the service time.\nSecondly,  you should be very clear about the services you want because I think I just got hustled.\nI asked for the \"60 minute herbal...\", and  couldn't finish my sentence because she said \"yes\". There's only 1 service with Herbal in the title. She led me to a massage room instead of reflxology, so I asked again for the herbal. I couldn't finish my sentence because she said yes.\nWent to pay at the end, she charged me for the massage (more $). She was able to fluently negotiate the price, although it's not what I intended on spending.\nI also asked for Nicole and was again told \"yes\", but that didn't happen.  I still would have went if she wasn't available,  whatever.\nI didn't get this chic's name but great massage and hell of a hustle! \ud83d\ude04 I will definitely be back, but will be clearer about the service I want.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d8378741073:0xfd037bdf17979e3d"}
