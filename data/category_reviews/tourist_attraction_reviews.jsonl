Morgan, AL and want to have a great experience and get your money\u2019s worth, this is your charter! Our experience was worth this extended review.\n\nPrior to this week, I had been deep sea fishing only once and that was on a \u201cparty boat\u201d of sorts. It was an overall bad experience being on a boat with 30 or more people, lines all tangled up, people getting sea sick, etc.\n\nMy wife and I had a totally opposite experience with Captain Black. As a matter of fact, we booked and fished three separate charters with three separate companies during our week at the beach. While each experience was pleasurable, for the most part (come on \u2013 it\u2019s fishing!), our charter with Reel Attractions was by far THE BEST overall charter experience. The customer service was second to none. From our initial phone call to discuss and schedule the charter, to the phone calls in the days and hours before the charter to discuss weather (Hurricane Nate), Captain Black was prompt, courteous, and patient with all our questions. He was at the dock waiting for us when we arrived (early). The boat was a perfect size with all the necessary amenities. He took time to explain everything to us. We didn\u2019t want for anything. Captain Black was very attentive to our every need, he is very, very personable, he made every effort to make sure we were catching a variety of fish (and we did), he operated safely, and he did a great job cleaning our fish. Captain Black is a consummate professional and my wife and I highly recommend him and Reel Attraction charters.\n\nOn a side note, you don\u2019t have to just take my word for it. Not only was our experience with him a stand out of the three experiences we had this week, but it was later validated when we took our haul to a local restaurant who will cook your catch for you. The restaurant staff was asking us about our experience and complimenting the variety of fish we had. Without us even saying his name, the waitress asked, \u201cwho did you go fishing with, Captain Ronnie Black?\u201d You might have chosen a reputable charter when the locals attribute a successful catch to certain charters!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1508070130020, "text": "Thank you for an awesome review!"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a260b09a9133d:0xeaa2bd6d182d9a68"}

There is a good bit of space between the back-in sites, and they are all relatively level and paved. The pull through sites are all gravel, close to the road, and somewhat rutted from the rain. The water and electric hookups looked new, or at least, very recently undated. The bathhouses looked updated, too. There was more construction going on in the area of the dock. There are two hiking trails (though we didn't take either due to the rain). The campground is heavily wooded. Now, that is  not a problem for at leasts our 38 foot motorhome, and we appreciate the shade on hot Alabama days. The down side is, if you have satellite TV you may have problems getting a clear shot at the sky. The biggest problem for us is, the only cell phone service that worked in the park was Verizon. Since we didn't have Verizon, we couldn't even use the phone, much less do email or surf the web.

Paul arrived in 5 minutes, told us not to do anything but tell him how we want things done. He and Donnie took down our tent, packed our things, put our coolers and dry food in their truck. They drove our things to the cabin and brought everything in for us. In 90+ degree heat, and not even being asked.

On Hwy 69 in Fairview, drive west toward Cullman to the second yellow light at Fairview town limits. Turn left (south) on County Road 1662 (at  sign for Antioch Missionary Baptist). Go 1.5 miles, dog leg Left-Right at Antioch Church. You are now on Co. Rd. 1660, and it dead ends in 2 miles. Park and it's a short walk down the hill and through the wooden gate.

Pass the white fences on the right with the sign to the cowboy church at the edge of the fence. Take a right Co Rd 1651 (not the road with the small junk yard, the next road opposite a sign for Duck River Baptist). When the road widens, you will come to the new handicapped accessible pier on the left. Park and this is the other end of the trail (as of 9/2017).\n\n4. Follow directions #3 from Holly Pond but keep  going past the pier. A couple of miles farther, the road will end at the main trailhead.

You can setup the room however you'd like with tables, chairs, microphone, speakers etc. There's also kitchen space and easily accessible restrooms to take advantage of.\n\nOn this same side of the building where parties can be hosted, there's also a little bit of interactive museum stuff... fun!!

There was a shallow grass ditch that ran thru the middle and went out on Oak St. The grass was very nice and kept. However we never saw any city workers, ever. There was a couple of large bushes and a shade tree... We looked for 4 leaf clovers in the grass...There was actually 4 ways to enter the park....Bart Starr and family lived on National Ave. near that entrance....Everybody hung out in the park with their dogs and bicycles.....I got to ride my first motorcycle in the park...I was 13...Jerry Palmer let me ride his Harley 165... Gatewood Walden also rode his 165 to the park sometime. There was never any rules against anything and it all went great...no problems. Usually there would only be a handful of kids in the park.... No crowds...Never saw any grownups... Hope maybe some older folks comment on their early years in Ridgecrest,,,,I enjoyed my time living there...

We live in Ohio and are back in Sweet Home Alabama visiting family. We searched online for a fireworks display and our search led us to The American Village. We went a little early and enjoyed seeing the campus and tasting the delights of the food trucks:). Our family of 6 thought it awesome that there were seats if you didn\u2019t bring one or a blanket, picnics are allowed, and staff and volunteers were not only friendly but smiling and seemingly loving their roles!  This isn\u2019t your ordinary history museum and the fireworks display was definitely not typical. My husband is a retired Army Captain with 22 years in service. We have visited many places and viewed many fireworks displays including ones on military posts. None have even come close to what we experienced last night!  My favorite parts, the parts that gave me chills and made tears flow, was seeing the colors presented correctly, the heartfelt gratitude of The American Village staff towards Those who serve, and the accurate depiction of our historical relevance. Thank you American Village for making our Independence Day Celebration not only the best yet, but also helping us to reflect on just how wonderful it is to be an American!  \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\u2764\ufe0f", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88892951889d4a0d:0xd5b51426974ef905"}

Pack lunch or eat on the way because they don't serve food here but you can bring picnic lunch, and be sure to check the hours as well because they are not always open on every Saturday, but it is great when they are. Going on Presidents Day was a fantastic experience as well, nothing like getting to eat cupcakes with George Washington!!!

But, there seems to be a negative corrolation with the more elegant a locale it becomes, the more hostile they turn on the people.

Here are some answers: Montgomery is a steam-powered sternwheel-propelled snagboat built in 1925 by the Charleston Dry Dock and Machine Company of Charleston, South Carolina, and operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Montgomery cleared snags and obstructions from the Coosa, Alabama, Apalachicola, Chattahoochee, Flint, Black Warrior, and Tombigbee Rivers until her retirement from the Corps of Engineers on November 8, 1982. She was restored in 1984 and again in 2004, declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989. Montgomery now operates as a museum ship at the Tom Bevill Lock and Dam Visitor Center in Pickensville, Alabama.\n\nMy experience with the Monty was pleasant . . . for historical reasons and for architectural reasons and for engineering reasons.

This trail is down hill on the way to the water hole. On the way back you are going up hill so make sure you are prepared.\n\nMy dog and I hiked this trail during mid July and It was miserably hot with no wind chill so getting to the water hole was very rewarding. If you hike trail first thing in the morning you will make it to the trail by the evening. So if you plan on hitting the water hole before the sun sets make sure you start early.\n\nIf you use a Garmin GPS there are a few check points and marked points for sites of interest (You're Welcome).\n\nThe trail was a bit confusing at some points due to missing signs.  Good ole American flags someone else planted before me helped guide the way during confusing intersecting points. I took note of this for future hikes and I will always carry markers with me and for others in the future.\n\nI hope to hike this trail in the Fall one day so I can see all the creeks filled with water instead of a dried up creeks...

But at the end, you're rewarded with two really nice waterfalls. To reach them you have to know they're there. The first one is easiest to get to. After about 3.5 miles from the trailhead you'll start down a steep descent. The trail will level off briefly at a small campsite. Turn around and take a few steps back the way you came and you'll see a fork that you probably walked right by without noticing. Take that fork to the left. In less than 5 minutes you'll be at a very nice waterfall in the wet season (early to mid spring, or after a significant rainfall)\n\nThe second waterfall is much harder to get to, but worth the effort. Go back to the campsite and continue going the way you were originally going. The trail gets much steeper. Yes, I said much steeper...so be careful and watch your footing. You'll soon come to a trail crossing. Take a left and follow that for a couple minutes. You'll come to a small creek that feeds into the larger Sipsey river on your right. Turn left at that creek. There's a trail there that is well defined in spots, and hard to follow in other spots. Just keep going with that creek on your right.

After visiting several times I've noticed that many of the studios appear to be locked up with no artists in sight, even on a Saturday when most people are able to spend time enjoying the art. Thus, it lacked the bustling art community/marketplace feel that you would expect visiting such a large fine arts venue. Where are the artists? That however is not the fault of Lowe Mill. It's the fault of the artists who must not be starving, lol. The atmosphere doesn't feel friendly, even the woman sitting in the office is unapproachable. Why do people think art and snobbery are interchangeable? Anyway, the main reason I gave it only 4 stars is because the stairwell in the Flying Monkey had such a bad urine smell. It's extremely off putting and screamed trashy for that section of the mill. My 10 year old asked what the smell was.
