When I inquired as to how the service tech then managed to break TWO covers and not mention it, I was told they would need to get back to me. When they called me back, I was told the the part had never actually been ordered and that they would order it and ship it to my house so I could replace it myself.

They were all open and currently being mopped by the staff. Before I have a chance to throw the car in park, there is a young man walking my way. With the car now in park, I step out of the car and he greets me with a warm smile and a \"Good Morning to ya, what can we help with?\", but before I have a chance to open my mouth he whistles in shock at the sight of my tire. When I turn around to see the damage, there it is, staring me in the face like a angry mother-in-law when you make an inappropriate joke at the dinner table, a screw.\nNow there's two men attending to my car. Courtney, the first-responder, and Lamar, the muscle. The elect to change out the tire and find what they have in stock. 2 good conversation and half a cup of cheap coffee later I've got keys in my hand and ready to start my day.

Since my initial visit to the McGee rd service facility back in December,  which did an excellent job, I have had 2 bad experiences.  1st bad experience was with my wife's car. She had the oil changed at the eastern blvd facility.  Approximately 1 week later her car's check engine light came on and the fault was for dirty oil. She had the oil checked at a local change facility and it was a quart low. They did another oil change, and I have the filter from that change and it is not as clean a filter as you think from 1 week previous. I had also gotten my oil changed in my truck a few days after she did at the eastern Blvd facility.  So I decided to take a look at my oil and filter. The filter on my truck had an install date written on it from the McGee Rd facility of 12/9/19. The date I first got Express to change it. They supposedly changed my oil and filter on 2/7/20 at McGee rd. I will also attach a pic of the filter . Needless to say this is a very bad way to run a business.  Engine damage from dirty oil is very significant possibility from these action.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO43eqZAxl6i36R5mIsoxQpWPbaVCPg79nGVXA2=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1582925050257, "text": "Hi there, Ernest.

They were over priced compared to other dealers, and the service department is terrible. For instance, I had my oil changed and they did an inspection that is routine. They gave me the sheet showing everything they had checked, to include the tread on my tires. A couple of weeks after this inspection and maintenance my tire almost blew out. It was in terrible condition for some unknown reason with no blame attributed to them because yeah it happens. They told me they could have me a new tire in 24 hrs. So, I agreed. They also added that it would be in my best interest to replace all four tires because the rest of them were in such terrible condition as well. Now, why would they have checked the tread on my tires less than two weeks prior and marked them good if they were in terrible condition?? So, I obliged and told them I would just order four new tires. But, I also told them I wanted to keep the old ones just in case I needed a spare. When I came back to pick up my car it did have new tires. I asked where I could pick up the old ones because my fiance at the time told me to keep them, and they assured me that I didn't want them. One guy, I'm guessing the supervisor, even included that his wife wouldn't be driving around on tires in that bad of shape. So, lesson learned: they will try and take advantage of you in any way they can when it comes to getting the most money out of you. I left without my old tires and to top it all off they even charged me a recycling fee for them after I told them I wanted to keep them. I went back not too long ago and the service was just the same. My AC had went out on this same car. Long story short, they charged me a diagnostic fee and couldn't even tell me exactly what was wrong, but worse case scenario I was looking at $2000 worth of repairs. So, after the tire incident I went elsewhere and got a second opinion. They took less time and narrowed the issue down to a relay problem. But, told me worse case scenario $1500. So, again they are over priced. I ended up trading my car in at a dealership in Bay minette and I couldn't be happier. I purchased the extended warranty on the rogue with them, and it served no purpose. It ran out at 100,000 miles and every issue i had either wasn't covered  or started at 104,000 miles. Another lesson learned. I will not shop with them again, or use their service department for anything to include routine maintenance. I don't recommend them to anyone. Of course this is just my opinion of them from what I experienced.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889aca479d1fc0cd:0x50e17575c246f828"}

They called down to another Express Oil Change 10 miles away who had one for us. Instead of putting our young family on a spare tire in an area we didn\u2019t know, they drove down and got the tire for us and changed it there. They had us back on the road in about an hour and half.

Wyatt and Sam actually drove to where I was, helped me put my spare tire on, and assisted me safely to the shop. They were busy, and still took incredible care of me.

I brought my car back and then they said the tires were  separating on the inside, so I paid 367 for four brand new tires. Replacing the tires only helped the car drive smoother but the problem was now worse! So I brought my car back today and now there saying that the back tires are the cause of the front tires shifting and that wasn't something they could fix, I would have to take it to the dealership. The guy said he could try to align the front to see if that would help but it made the issue even worse then when I had initially brought the car in. I am now sitting here after closing hours so they can set my alignment back to were it was.

As we stayed in our vehicle over night, we wondered how the next morning would go and hoped this shop would be able to take care of us so we could be back on the road. Well 6:45am rolled around and we were honored to meet the owner Doug. This shop doesn\u2019t open until 7:30, and at 6:45, he welcomed us in as he got there early to open shop. Instead of morning opening routines, he got right to our issue instead. He opened the waiting room and bathroom so my wife could freshen up and be comfortable after our joyous night in the vehicle. Doug and one of his workmates took the tire off and had it fixed within 15-20 minutes. They made sure all our tires were aired and ready to roll again. There was even a scheduled costumer there that we kind of got ahead of, and he seemed so nice and not put out that we needed help quickly, and I could tell the owner even treated him like family.  I am beyond impressed with the service and this business. As a fellow business owner, I understand costumer service, and this place has it right.

I went with the discount tires, because the last set I got from a Mavis ( trussville AL) lasted a decent amount of time mileage wise.\nHere is my list of grievances\n1. About two weeks later, I noticed one of the lug nuts was almost falling off. One round and it would have been off on the ground .This infuriates me even more, because I specifically instructed the technician to make sure I could get the lugs off with a regular lug wrench, as I do my own tire rotation and oil change every 5-7.5k. Three of the lugs were so tight I had to stand on the hands. Again, one was falling off, three were almost impossible to remove.\n2. of course I got talked into the 89$ alignment\n3. Its not my vehicle ( wife ), so it took me a couple of weeks to notice the bad vibration at 70mph, so back to the shop to get tires re balanced, which I already pay 75$ for. I did not go back to the Mavis because I don't trust them. They couldn't even tighten my lugs\n4. When I get to the new tire place, I find out that all of my tires are set to 41 psi. 41!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Now the tires are cupping, which means they will need to be replaced soon.\n5. One of the tires was out of balance\n\nThey were super quick to get an alignment and do it, but they couldn't even get my lugs on and get the tire pressure right?\nThis place is an embarrassment.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1591476660676, "text": "We apologize, Phillip, We at Mavis believe you deserve nothing short of the best.

I ordered the 3rd set of tires down the list that were recommended for my vehicle (2017 Ford Transit 250), Michelin Defender T+H. I work 6-7 days a week as a contractor so Sunday was really my only option to get tires on my work vehicle. I arrived early for my appointment, confirmed my appointment, and confirmed the tires with the employee behind the sales counter. I confirmed that the tires I ordered will be the best fit for my vehicle with the employee and he said they will be great for it. So my wife picked me up and we went about our day. I received a phone call at 11:18 informing me the tires are installed on my vehicle but they\u2019re not going to work then proceeded to tell me they can order the correct tires for it but they won\u2019t be here till Tuesday July 21st. I explained I can\u2019t just leave my vehicle up there not working for 2 days, and asked if they can just put my old tires back on the van. The employee responded with yes but we will have to charge you for mount and balance, my only request was to install the tires with the best tread on the rear which he agreed to. I received a second call at 4:10 stating my vehicle was ready but that they close at 5 and needed to be there before 5 to pick it up. I arrived paid the clerk $75.96, received my keys, walked out to my truck to find my tires low, tire light on and the rear tires (almost bald) on the passenger side and the front tires (still had a good amount of tread on them) on the drivers side which was not what I asked. I asked if they could add some air to my tires and get my tire light to turn off. They did add air to my tires but when I asked about the tire light the manager had to stop putting Alabama stickers on his truck brought a computer tpms sensor out and showed me very quickly the tire pressure was fine and told me this would be expected with used tires... My tire light never went off like he said it would. Today is July 29th and I have yet to receive a phone call stating my tires have arrived or a update. I emailed Mavis corporate on July 23rd and have not received a response or anything. Never once did anyone apologize for the inconvenience that this mishap caused me that was clearly Mavis Tires fault and caused me to pay for their mistake. I at no point complained or expressed any frustration to the employees there because I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. I don\u2019t ever leave bad reviews for businesses because I know what that can do to a business, but I did want to take a minute and send you a email about my experience. I ended up purchasing a set of tires from Discount Tires on Hwy 280 and it was a great experience. I called them in the morning they called me as soon as the tires arrived, and installed them the same day in less then 1 hour after leaving my vehicle with them. Upon arrival there was no tire light on and the tires had the proper amount of air in them. I hope this email helps in one way or form, I\u2019m not complaining but just find it hard to understand why Mavis Discount tire would charge a customer any amount of money for a issue/mistake on their end.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1596119205061, "text": "We're sorry, Nick Lions. we apologize your appointment time was not honored.

They were very friendly and honest and the vehicle was just as described except for one minor issue.  I had been told it had a new battery, but during inspection we discovered that the battery was not new. It was just a mix-up and they were happy to install a new battery while we were finishing up the financial side of the deal.  Would have loved to have gotten the car at a bit lower price (who wouldn't?) but this was an exceptional low-mileage one-owner specimen, and they did work with me on the price.  I've shopped Miatas for quite some time and lately Carvana seems to have almost cornered the market on clean low-mileage Miatas and have jacked the prices up really high.  But I was able to buy this Miata well below what Carvana would have priced it at, and I feel that I got a good deal considering the current market and the premium condition of this vehicle  (and lots of buyers have had very bad experiences with Carvana, so I'm glad I didn't have to deal with them).

I was told to come back that Saturday; May 2nd so that a mechanic can look at it. I went that Saturday and had the lights repaired. That same Saturday night my entire driver side taillight went out. I knew they were closed Sunday but I called just in case I could leave a voicemail to give them a heads up about me coming in on Monday; May 4th regarding the taillight. May 4th they tried to repair the issue however ALL of my lights started malfunctioning. They tell me to come back that Wednesday; May 6th so that their mechanic can look at it. They gave me a work order stating that they are working on diagnosing the problem in case I got pulled over for no brake lights, reverse lights, headlights or turn signal. They proceeded to pull my vehicle through the shop and when I got inside it I noticed an airbag sensor that was not there before. I asked John if he could have it cleared out and he said that he would have the mechanic do it on Wednesday and that it should be no problem. I then attempted to turn my AC on (which was on while they were working on it but John said that he had turned it off) but the AC wouldn't come on. I get out of my vehicle and ask John if he could have the code cleared because I felt that it was messing with the operation of my AC and it's been 90\u00b0 lately. John then tells another employee named Skyler to come clear the code however the code does not clear. During this time the owner comes and introduces himself and asked me and another customer if we were being tended to, the other customer stated that he was already tended to then I stated that I was being tended to and pointed to my vehicle. The owner then leaves to never return again. They then proceeded to turn the vehicle off in hopes of resetting it however at that point the vehicle would no longer start. John then told me that I needed to leave and that I could return Wednesday to have their mechanic look at it but at this point, I had no dash lights, interior lights, exterior lights, no AC, no radio, no power steering, and sensors going off. The vehicle would no longer start up. I started to get upset, John claims I brought my vehicle in like that which is 100% untrue, I drove it in with no issues other than the driver taillight but I was unable to drive it away. I defended myself and vehicle over that statement then John pulled their doors closed while several employees including a manager/ assistant manager watched. I ended up having to call the police (because I had no clue what else I could or should do). The shop then claimed that I had a bad battery and that was the result of all of this however when they put a brand new battery in there it did NOT fix all the problems, the vehicle did start up and it did have headlights but that was it. After me refusing to tow my vehicle away and almost 2 hours later Mitch (I believe the manager or assistant manager) then offered to let the vehicle stay and have their mechanic look at it on Wednesday May 6th. May 6th, I went to go pick up my vehicle and John was working the front desk, they tried to hand me my keys in the lot hoping I would just leave immediately but when I asked for a full detail work order on what all had been done to my vehicle, I received attitude and was told that I should be happy that they fixed it for free and that they don't document all the work that's done on vehicles. I sat up there until I received a work order (over 30mins later) but when I received the \"work order\" it stated, \"gave customer a battery and replaced 10 fuse\". I told the mechanic that that was not a detailed work order but I was told that was all I was going to get. I do not believe that they would have fixed the damages their employee, John, caused to my vehicle if I did not have 4years of documentation from the one and only other mechanic I've been to, video footage from my own vehicle and computer readings from my Vivint smart security proving the condition of my vehicle.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e9b414671032d:0x29e4a24dd6f16484"}

NOT TODAY!!! So I did a Google search and came across HESCO, the reviews were great, I spoke with Joe Molina and he arranged to have it tower to HESCO \"DESPITE being in the middle of changing locations\", they got it in checked it out, started it up, \"No white smoke from the tail pipe\", turned out to be the water pump, THAT's ALL. I can't recommend Joe Molina and the guys at HESCO Automotive highly enough, they are highly professional, extremely efficient, keep you informed at every juncture of the process, and very reasonable.

I was highly disappointed that every decision made about my car was made without my input or knowledge. And that my request for them to stop the repairs was completely ignored. This business is very unprofessional and lacks the ability to communicate with their customers. I also feel that I was taken advantage of because I am a woman. Not to mention the repairs done to my car were done wrong. I ended up having to have all the transmission fluid drained and replaced bc they used a brand that is not recommended for German cars.

He asked multiple times if it was ready, was told only 20 more mins, then 30...well 2 hours after the said time he left. We had plans at 11am, so those didn't happen WHICH could have been planned for-like loading up my kids (one being a newborn) in the car and picking him up. No apologies for the extra wait time and never honest about how long it was going to take.\nCome that following week, SURPRISE, there was an oil leak on the garage floor AND the check engine light was back on. So we took it back once again. He was told that it was just old oil coming out and it was fine and that some other piece needed to be replaced for the check engine light. Like why wasn't this fixed the first time!? Unless we got super unlucky and something went wrong within the 3/4 day time.\n\nWell now it's about 4 months later and there's still oil spots on the floor!\nSo we called today, I got a so-so person on the phone and was told to bring it back in, no \"oh my goodness! That's not what we like to hear..please bring it back in!\" It was just \"bring it back\".\n\n1st, can we make the comparison on the comment from Ashton Morgan below?? This was the SAME day, the SAME time and my husband remembers talking and waiting with Ashton.\nWe aren't very knowledgable on car repairs and we should've gotten a 2nd opinion(the Garage in Pelham is literally walking distance and everyone always has great things to say about them, but this was just for a cheap oil change-never again!) ..but we just had a baby and didn't have much spare time or sleep to decide these things with a clear mind.\n\nI just reccomend going somewhere else for piece of mind EVEN for an oil change, even if this was just a random bad day (which look at the rating-use your brains people! We didn't and now we're paying for it with our time and now a nasty driveway and garage floor) for the people working on cars, there has yet to be a verbal apology-and now if we get one it will just seem forced.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1463972408579, "text": "Dear Jennifer,\nMy name is Rick and I am the owner of Precision Tune Auto Care of Pelham.

They have gone above and beyond every single time. I'm not a crying person but they've made me cry twice. The good cry. The first time: I assume they saw the toy factory and smashed snacks in the carpet or maybe it was my food covered shirt and crazy hair. Either way, they gave me a note of encouragement that every mom needs sometimes with a gift card for coffee. The second time: I requested a larger loaner vehicle which is apparently hard to come by. Along with my 3 kids, my dad is in a wheelchair and I transport him to/from dialysis and we just all wouldn't fit in the smaller one. They greeted me with a \"one tough cookie\" box with treats and snacks galore.\n\nThey are the nicest people and so accommodating. Add uplifting to that mix.

We all hate that whenever it comes time to shop for a car- and they do NOT do that at this dealership! Furthermore, Troy was patient in answering my questions, and always a perfect gentleman!

I told him they could stop and I'll bring in the light myself after buying it cheaper elsewhere. He tells me I will still have to pay $135 for the diagnostic. No problem. He comes back and tells me it's already in. I ask well where is my car? He says they're finishing up. 45 minutes later he comes back and tells me that they put a new light in and it didnt work. Must be a wiring issue he said. So I said: \"So that $135 diagnostic u tried to charge me for wasn't even accurate? Because the diagnostic claimed I needed a new light.\" He never did answer.

Things didn't go quite as we had planned. Our SUV was cutting out pretty bad on the highway. It was getting worse the closer we got to Mobile. I contacted my friend who's daughter lives in Mobile to see if she might know of a service place. I talked with her daughter and she informed me that her husband, Kyle, worked for Joe Bullard Cadillac. She gave me the number for the service department and said to speak with Haley.  About this time the check engine light came on in our vehicle. It was flashing on and off, then would stay lit.\nWhen I spoke with Haley in the service department she asked about the service engine light. When I told her it had been flashing intermittently she was immediately concerned and said we should get stopped as quickly as we could to avoid internal engine damage.  She then helped us get started with finding a tow service. We were 50 miles aWay and had four people so their usual towing service couldn't do it, but she got the ball rolling for us. She gave me her direct phone number so I could call if I needed anything.\nOnce we got to the dealership Kyle helped us get a loaner car while ours was being repaired. Haley kept us informed as they learned what was wrong. Our technician, Mike, came in on Saturday to work on our vehicle because we needed to leave to head back to Missouri on Sunday.\nTo make a long story short...God used all of these people to help us during a difficult time. They made this experience so much less stressful than it could've been. THEY WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND TO HELP US! And, they did it all with a smile.

What I didn't like was that the mechanics were excessively rough with my vehicle. I had to have it towed and the towing company left it at the gate. Christian got me a loaner car, which I appreciated very much. When I picked up the loaner there were 2 guys who were trying to get it started to get it up to the shop. I needed to grab a couple things out of my car so I stopped to do that. For some reason they needed to open the back hatch. I was traveling with my animals so I had a large kennel in the back. I watched them put my seats down (rather roughly) and sling my kennel from the back to atop the back seats. It made me cringe but at this point I needed to get going as I had some stops to make and  I thought surely they knew what they were doing, this is a Cadillac dealership afterall and these cars cost a lot. They will surely be careful... When I got my car back, instead of them putting the vehicle back they way they found it, the kennel was still strown across the back. (As a plus though, it was washed! Which I appreciated since I had been on the road and try to take care of my car!) When I went to move the kennel back in place I noticed that there are scrapes across the plastic sides in the back. Greeeeaaaaaat. But, at that point I was leaving to head back to my home state and couldn't worry about it. It was more important to get home safe. They told me in addition to the battery that I needed new air filters, a rear wiper blade, and the throttle body cleaned, all easy enough for me to do myself. So, now I am here doing said maintenance and when I popped the hood I immediately noticed that my positive battery terminal clip has been broken and won't stay shut. Great. I am now back home, 3 states away. I will be back to the area, and am considering moving my family there but if they don't make this right I will find a different dealership to maintenance at.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1517174513045, "text": "Hi Jami,\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave your review and detailed feedback.

The problem today was a broken window regulator on the rear driver's side.  My wife has been the sole driver of this car.  We have no children in then home.  My conservative guess is that this window has been lowered and raised no more than 10 times in its aborted lifetime.  My wife was told a plastic roller had broken.  A plastic roller in a $50,000 (2004) Cadillac?!  My bill:  $517.23!  I can go back through my invoices and find similar instances of shoddy work and padded bills.  During the second year we owned the car the driver side dash assembly fell off the dash while my wife was driving.  At around the 4-5 year of ownership your service supervisor convinced my wife that she needed to replace all four tires (around 10,000 miles) because they had \"dry-rotted.\" ($800)  I've owned two Cadillac De Ville's prior to this, and have never experienced what has to be either poor construction, low-quality parts, or untruthful service managers.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da8e0caaef5:0xa8eb3c2a1737d68b"}

He offered his help and we told him we were in town to Christmas shop not spend all day at a dealership, we just wanted to try the car on for size. he escorted us inside for coffee and cocoa and went to get the car. we test drove it. we loved it but we were not there to spend all day at the dealership. we left our personal information to be reviewed and were going to shop when Darren notified us that we would be using the cadillac for the day via loaner form approval. we really enjoyed using the car. we Christmas shopped all day and when we returned to the dealership we had been approved for the car with our payments within dollars of request. Jon McCartney had to have been the most professional financial manager i have ever encountered. He was a real person who made us feel right at home and comfortable to speak openly. very friendly and personable. then Roosevelt Harris enters the picture. a gem. a diamond in the rough. so charismatic so joyful and helpful and accomodating. I cannot put into words how much Darren helped to familiarize us with the cue and features. he was so knowledgable of the cars systems. he was an absolute treasure. I cant say but one thing about Joe Bullards team, \"you are doing something right\". I got hugs from everyone when i left. i felt like i was part of a family there. I even got a text message from Darren on Christmas morning wishing us a merry Christmas. i literally spent 2 hrs tops at the dealership and received the most beautiful CHristmas gift I could have ever dreamed of. but the most inportant thing was the environment and kindness that we experienced while there. oh and my son loved the lounge with computers and coffee/cocoa which made his time there enjoyable also. we will definitely reccomend Joe Bullard Cadillac to friends and family and we will definitely be repeat customers ourselves. my only hope is that we have the privilege of having the same staff in years to come. Thank you so very much.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da8e0caaef5:0xa8eb3c2a1737d68b"}

It was a very welcomed change from the experience I'd had at another local shop I'd been referred to (but later warned about from several other past customers) where I repeatedly had to endure rudeness from the know-it-all mechanic, immediate breakdowns from same issue I'd just paid to have repaired, & ignored voicemails asking to speak to the owner. Guthrie's owner followed-up the very next day to make sure everything was going well with the work on my car. I would much rather pay for a job well done the first time than a little less and keep breaking down, having my car towed, finding another way to work at the last minute to keep my job, and then constantly being talked down to in person & over the phone (while the owner justifies it as him \"being from New York\",... to which I reminded them both that he's now n ALABAMA, & that cocky attitude won't do here, especially with me!!... 3 different types of repairs... never fixed after being told they were!).

The Manager indicated they provided those services and I made a 7:30 am appointment for a few days later. Appointment day I arrive at the appointed time to locked doors and wait 15 minutes for someone to show up, while I was waiting I noticed trash from the previous days services and appointments all in the service bays. With the late open and the trashy appearance I should have left as these are signs of poor management. They took custody of my vehicle for the remainder of the day, of which I had to call them at closing time to see if there was an update, they were unaware of the status and had to call me back. When I heard back from them they said it was done and we agreed I would pick up the following morning, when I arrived they indicated half of the things I asked to be done weren't done and they can not do them (rear dif & and tire service). I was not charged for the items but now I need to make another service appointment elsewhere.\n\nSeparately, one of the Technicians blocked my wife and kids in while they were dropping me off. I went out to ask him to move of which he replied \"she can get by\", I followed up and asked him to please move, she is driving a larger unfamiliar vehicle (my truck) and would appreciate some extra space.

The rear tires were still around 35 lbs per tire. I ended up having to buy a new tire to replace it. This set of tires still had plenty of tread remaining and could have been used for another year before replacement.\nWhy was this done? You should let the work crew know this. Although the crew was nice, they always try to get that last dollar from you by offering the extra flush or services, and only because I feel that someone neglegently overfilled the front tires to an unheard of 45 to 46 pounds, which ultimately caused me to buy new tires, I won't be back.

The fact that some key parts needed are unavailable for this particular vehicle is no fault of his or ourselves or speak to the skill and talent of our technician, nor the honesty of our business. 4) After we communicated to your son we could not source parts needed, we agreed to remove the parts we had already installed and did not charge his any labor for this authorized work.\n\nWe are disappointed to find a review not based on your own experience with us a customer.  Negative reviews with no merit harm our business and our hard-working employees and their families.  Had you been involved in each piece of communication, you would find our recommendations were in the best interests of your son, were clear, and in the end \u2013 your son did not pay for parts or any of the hours of work our technician performed.

This is not my first Hyundai since reinventing itself and blowing our minds. Needless to say I purchased what is now my 5th Hyundai.  However, i'm here to brag on the man who walked my husband and I through this entire process in this humid Alabama weather.  Initially, I came in to take advantage of the $50 GIFT CARD that Hyundai was offering for simply test driving its vehicles, but I also knew that I would potentially be driving off the lot with something new as well. Brandon Blagg was awesome from the gate. He stood and walked over to me, invited me to his desk, and inquired concerning my business. A few questions later, a copy of my license, and \"BAM\" we were test driving a base model Santa Fe.' One would think that this guy designed these vehicle with his level of knowledge concerning them. Recalling that I have own several vehicles in my lifetime, it is feasible to understand that we have dealt with our share of sales consultants. This is by far the first person who not only informed us of what we would potentially enjoy about the vehicle, but patiently explained in detail its benefits, and demonstrated  to us its functionality. He took a base model vehicle and literally painted a picture that lifted it beyond it's level. He hung out with us for over an hour doing comparisons and contrasts. He was honest concerning pro and cons, but never negative.. not one time. For him every vehicle had its benefits, and for every person there was vehicle that fit them. THIS IS WHAT HE DID! He didn't interfere with our choice, but he made sure that we would be satisfied once we left  the lot for good. In the end we ended up purchasing a Santa Fe' SEL 2.4 engine with both the Convenience and Premium Package. He didn't use a hustler tactic to cause us to go for a higher grade, it was simply his transparency and patience that ultimately led to our selection. Recalling that this was in 90 + degree weather, this man didn't stop until the tires shined.  He made me laugh, shared stories, explained who was whom of the CEO vs. COO, and also wasn't shy around me whatsoever. He even blew bubble gum bubbles for our delightful 6 year old who stood amazed at the excellence his gum blowing abilities. Brandon Blagg, job well done. You deserve all that's coming for your hard work and dedication to service. Aside from our direct experience with Brandon, everyone rocked. Their pleasantness was superb, two of the women conversed with me, they offered treats to my babies, and others smiled and waved. There wasn't a rude attitude in the building. The lobby and bathrooms are well designed and clean. As lengthly a process that car buying could be, they have enough going for themselves to make you relax and enjoy your time.\n\nThanks Again, Tae A.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b128e81df3f:0x8980930b2c0cfffb"}

I test drove the vehicle on a Monday and pointed out a few cosmetic issues that I feel should have been addressed prior to placing the car up for sale (only a few hundred dollars to correct).  That combined with the manager coming outside to talk to me smoking a cigarette, should have clued me in to the professionalism and pride taken at the dealership.\nI was asked that if the problems I pointed out were corrected,  would I purchase the car? I agreed.  The following day I recieved the bill of sale and I noticed that the price shown on the internet was not the price shown on the bill of sale. When I asked the manager, the explanation I recieved was that the car was headed to auction the day I saw it and the price on the internet was the auction price, not the sale price (what does that have to do with me? And the price I came intending to pay is the price that I saw advertised ).  I was then told that they would sell it to me at the internet price but I would have to pay for the repairs which would be $400+.  Since the price was still under book value,  I agreed.  I was then told that the car would be repaired, HAND WAXED and ready for me in a couple days.  I was informed Friday that the car was ready. I drove up Saturday only to find the car just as dirty as it was when I test drove it on Monday(they sprayed the dirt off but there was still hair and dirt on the inside of the car.... wheel wells were dirty, etc). Of all the cars I've bought,  no one has ever tried to delivered me a dirty car! I discussed this with the manager who appeared to care nothing about it.  I left with no intention of buying the car,  but the salesman,\nMr. Willie, called and said that he would take care of it...... he took it to a local shop and had it washed and vacuumed.  As a customer, when money is spent, whether it be $30 or $30,000, you want to feel good about spending it. That's not the feeling I left with.  In the end, I purchased what I feel is a great vehicle.   But the service is what will definitely keep me from being a repeat customer or recommending to anyone else.  Professionalism and putting the customer first is definitely lacking and needs a lot of improvement.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b128e81df3f:0x8980930b2c0cfffb"}

This was the worst car buying experience ever. My original salesman was nice but knew nothing about a car at all. My battery had a dead cell when I first purchased it. I took it back for the battery to be replace and it took four hours to get a new battery. I asked them to take me to the service center to find out what was taking so long and the guy that work in the front said my battery has been there for two hours. And the guys that were supposed to be working were playing and joking around the next time I needed work done was three days later I noticed the bumper on the car was popped out of place, the 12 volt adapters didn't work, the service light had come on, the key tumbler was messed up in the ignition. I went to try and get that fixed and they told me it would be two days well I asked if they would give me a replacement car to get back and forth to work they told me no they don't do that. Ok so I paid for the work myself. A few days later I discovered my account was overdrawn 500 dollars and when I ask the finance manager why my account was charged and I paid 1000  in cash his response was well we wanted 1500 for the car and u couldn't do that. So they took it upon themselves to take the other 500 dollars. Now after they agreed to give my money back.  I waited a week and called and he said I could pick it up across the street so I went across the street from them and the guy over there didn't know what I was talking about so he called Cleveland Moore the guy I've been having problems with to asked him where I needed to go Cleveland didn't know that he was on speaker phone and said \" she so damn stupid\" he really called me stupid and then when I informed him he was on speaker phone he said so. Meaning he didn't care. So I feel disrespected and I was so upset I called a manager who said it will be handled and I will be waiting to find out the results of this because if they are not satisfactory I would like to speak with the owner myself.

This was the worst car buying experience ever. My original salesman was nice but knew nothing about a car at all. My battery had a dead cell when I first purchased it. I took it back for the battery to be replace and it took four hours to get a new battery. I asked them to take me to the service center to find out what was taking so long and the guy that work in the front said my battery has been there for two hours. And the guys that were supposed to be working were playing and joking around the next time I needed work done was three days later I noticed the bumper on the car was popped out of place, the 12 volt adapters didn't work, the service light had come on, the key tumbler was messed up in the ignition. I went to try and get that fixed and they told me it would be two days well I asked if they would give me a replacement car to get back and forth to work they told me no they don't do that. Ok so I paid for the work myself. A few days later I discovered my account was overdrawn 500 dollars and when I ask the finance manager why my account was charged and I paid 1000  in cash his response was well we wanted 1500 for the car and u couldn't do that. So they took it upon themselves to take the other 500 dollars. Now after they agreed to give my money back.  I waited a week and called and he said I could pick it up across the street so I went across the street from them and the guy over there didn't know what I was talking about so he called Cleveland Moore the guy I've been having problems with to asked him where I needed to go Cleveland didn't know that he was on speaker phone and said \" she so damn stupid\" he really called me stupid and then when I informed him he was on speaker phone he said so. Meaning he didn't care. So I feel disrespected and I was so upset I called a manager who said it will be handled and I will be waiting to find out the results of this because if they are not satisfactory I would like to speak with the owner myself. I can't believe people have to go through so much to get a car this is very terrible service and I want to know that my voice and opinion.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b128e81df3f:0x8980930b2c0cfffb"}

And if you do, please, make sure you ask them to print and show you any TSB's (Technical Service Bulletin) on the vehicle you are considering. A TSB is not like a safety recall and therefore the dealership is not required to make the repair. Make them prove to you that they have repaired all of the items on each and every TSB. However, I can almost promise you that they will not make the repairs before selling you the vehicle. I purchased a used 2007 Hyundai Entourage van from Jim Burke Hyundai's used car dealership in March this year after having purchased a new Elantra from them last year. I did not make them show me the TSB's because I wasn't aware of them at the time. Unfortunately there are several of them on the van I purchased. One of them had to do with a part that causes called the \"Junction Box Switch\" or Instrument Panel Module that causes the battery to discharge. That means when you go out to your car it simply won't start!! I found the TSB on it and it says in large print that it was issued to all Hyundai General Managers and that the repair should be made before retail sale of the van. Many of us believe that purchasing a used car from what you think is a reputable dealership will protect you from these type issues. Well...this dealership is not reputable and should be put out of business. I have contacted them to give them a change to try and make this right to keep customers happy and try to get return business but they obviously are not intersted in this. I will be taking further action regarding this issue.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b128e81df3f:0x8980930b2c0cfffb"}

Every single person that came in(very busy day) treated the staff and other waiting customers like long time best friends. That, I believe starts with their first experience and how this particular store takes you in as family, wants the best for you, and the atmosphere is contagious.

I normally avoid chain stores like Firestone because I know they try to scam people, but it was my last option to get my car examined.  I was helped by a woman I think was named Sabrina, and she fed me the biggest scam I've heard with my car, I don't think she realized I knew more about cars than she probably did.  She told me the tires were done and needed to be replaced NOW, the air filters needed replaced NOW, the battery was dead and needs replaced NOW, and the radiator needed to be flushed - and they'd conveniently do all of this for me at a hefty premium.  I was silently laughing at myself because two of my tires had 20K miles left on them (yes the other two need replacing soon), my air filters were replaced 8 months ago, my battery was brand new (I took it to auto zone AND advanced auto parts and they showed me the readings and the charge was fantastic, they laughed at Firestone for trying to pull one over on me), my radiator was also flushed within the last year.  I finally called her out on the battery and she looked me right in the eye and had the immoral audacity to say the battery was still worthless.  These are common things places like Firestone try to trick people into having repaired, because most people don't have the knowledge to know any better.  It was funny because they didn't even identify the things that were wrong with my car that I knew about.  They checked off that both headlights were working great, even though I knew and verified that one of the front headlights was dead... did they really even look my car over or just pretend to then hand me an appraisal for all the \"broken\" items I needed to have them fix now?  If you do not know much about cars, do not trust Firestone, they will sense your naivete and pull a fast one on you.  Always get a second opinion from a more reputable garage shop (I prefer privately owned places that rely on their honesty for business).  This just reaffirms the longstanding distrust I've had for places like Firestone, avoid them if you care about your money and your vehicle's longevity.  This visit was a total scam and employees like the one I dealt with do not belong in a customer service position.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889164cb1f7e4bf:0x4ed3bd94504e471a"}

Wish I could give them no stars. I called and asked for 2 tires for my car, they gave me the total price for both being installed for $155.16 before taxes. I told them let's do it and to order the tires. They called me back a few hours later telling me the tires were in. I drove 30 minutes down 280 for the tires. I pulled up and they told me they would get me right in and taken cared of. I went inside for a few minutes and saw my car was up on the lift, I waited for about 15-20 minutes and noticed my car was out of the shop, so I asked them if it was finished, and waited and waited and waited, and after talking to three different people it turned out they didn't do anything to the car at all. They just pulled it into the shop lifted it up, and then lowered it and pulled it out, and never relayed the information about why they did this. When I finally got someone to talk to the guys, they said that they didn't have the tires I ordered, and I told them that they had called me and told me they did and that I have a voicemail from them stating that they did, and I played the voicemail for them, and then talked to the guy directly that left me the voicemail. So, they go and look and turns out they do have the tires after all. They pull my car back in and put the tires on, then ring me up for $211.00, and I'm like, \"I'm not paying that\", then I have to talk to the manager that's \"running\" the shop, and finally after 3 hours I get the price they told me, thank goodness I had the voicemail from them for proof, and I got out. Never. Going. Back. Maybe the most unprofessional atmosphere and experience I've ever had with a business. Truly disappointing in every way. They were also very rude to the other customers that were waiting patiently as well. They would blatantly ignore you when you'd approach them with a question about your vehicle or the situation they were putting you in. Just straight up walk past you and not say a word to you or look you in the eyes. If and when they finally did talk to you, they just mumbled their words and you couldn't understand a thing they were saying. They need to clean house, get rid of the manager and all. If not that, then just do the entire state of Alabama a favor and close up shop completely, because you're not doing any good for anyone. Like, you're not even doing your jobs, like at all. Since I left, I've actually been wondering \"what's even the point of this shop\"? The guys are all just hanging out. Finally the guy that did put the tires on my car was just some dude, that wasn't even in a uniform like the rest of the automotive crew was. He was just in some shirt and ball cap with sun glasses, so I'd at least like to thank the random guy that probably doesn't even work there that actually did the work. Maybe he was an angel or something....? If it turns out he is an actual angel and it's some kind of real miracle, it's still not worth going back for.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889166b0910fbb5:0x6f7e7664c9e1abdf"}

He also was willing to drive to Atlanta while my car was having mechanic issues but thankfully, I was able to drive home with his help. I'm not sure what I can say to make you understand that all the amazing guys who work here genuinely care about you. The best part about this place that I frequently visit is that they love my 78 lb dog Waffle and are great about him visiting when the car needs work. They often ask about him if he is not with me.

Well after being hurried along in signing paperwork so the vehicle could be mine I was very happy with my purchase. However, less than a month later, and still well within my \"warranty\" coverage period I got a Christmas tree of lights on my dashboard. I was told to take it to its dealership and from there I could then make the claim. When I called to make the claim, Auto Nation's warranty service said there was no vehicle with my VIN in the system. I then called the manager there who told me, \"I never signed any contract stating I had a warranty and it doesn't matter what I was told because it isn't in writing.\" I realized the manager was right about this however, I was being told one thing then they intentionally rushed me through signing paperwork so that I wouldn't catch that I never signed anything for my \"warranty\". The deceptive methods of these people shows that they are talented at one thing and, one thing only and, that is lying to people.

The service rep who took care of me made the scheduling and check-in nice and easy and arranged for the shuttle service to take me home. I was disappointed that the AutoNation website didn't allow me to schedule an appointment for repairs online (only maintenance services could be done online). I got a diagnosis and repair quote within a day, but word that it would take a week to get the part in. It turned out to be an additional day for the part to arrive, and I was told the car would be done the following day, but  it took two more days for it to get done. We came from the Houston area where we were used to parts being accessible more quickly, so this wait time may be normal for the Mobile area. The pickup experience was a bit frustrating. I picked up on a Saturday and waited 1 hour 15 minutes to get checked out (was told the car was ready but paperwork had to be done). The service rep kept getting pulled away by walk-ins, phone calls, and I'm not sure what else, but it seemed I kept getting bumped to the back of the line. There may have been more legitimate reasons for the long wait time, but those weren't shared with me.

I have pulled over twice this week to see if I see any issues and have noticed smoke coming from my brake pad area. I will never use this place again.

Come to find out I was mislead and instead of paying $1038.00 through monthly payments. I have to pay a total of $2500 through weekly payments.

I went in back in April because I needed new brake pads and rotors. After waiting about 5 hours for them to install, it was finally done. About a month or 2 later, my vehicle starts to squeal anytime I apply my brakes. I took it into Goodyear at the beginning of October as the sound was getting unbearable. They checked my brakes and said that the rotors were cheap and needed to be fixed. They suggested me to take my vehicle back to fix the shorty work Mavis did to get warranty work as Mavis said I had a \u201cwarranty\u201d. The next day October 3 I took it into Mavis. Sure enough after looking at my car for 30 minutes my calipers were hanging down. I waited another 4 hours for them to put 2 calipers on. Why I paid them another 400 dollars is beyond me. As I was leaving there parking lot my vehicle was squealing when I applied the brakes but it seemed to be better. About a week ago, I noticed my vehicle started to shake and when I backed up it sounded like I had a flat tire. At this point I know I was intentionally being conned out of over 800 dollars from Mavis tire. I take my vehicle to pep boys on Sunday.\n\nMy calipers were loose again. They didn\u2019t tighten the damn bolts on the calipers. One caliper bolt was gone. The other one was about to be gone. Could have caused a huge accident. This is a terrible place of business. Eugene has no integrity in my opinion. I want to get my money back.\n\nI called customer service today talked to an answering service. Customer service never called me back. Please avoid this place at every cost.\n\nI have tried to send the picture of the receipt to the gentleman's phone. He asked me to take a picture and text him...

We dropped our car off to get 2 new rear tires. We picked it up when they called and said it was ready and one of the new tires was already flat, so then we had to wait for them to fill it back up and replace the valve. We left and the tire pressure sensor was still on so we brought it back and waited 30 mins for them to try to fix it and they said it was fixed and would go off after we drove it 10 miles. We waited 2 days and it never went off so we took it back and had to wait for them to go get new sensors and install them. We wasted so much time for them to try to figure out what they were doing.

The keys and vehicle were delivered one night early. They decided to hold off until 1:30 pm to start anything and then provided extreme estimates 3x what we talked about before I dropped it off. I only allowed them to change the oil and rotate the tires after the cheat attempt. Beware, brake estimate = $30!\n\nThe tires were not rotated because they forgot. The front desk guy simply told me they don\u2019t need rotated as they put tires in a position to maximize rear traction on a 60:40 split front:rear AWD vehicle. He offered to show me a video.

Learned I needed the outer tie rod ends done, among a couple of other things. So I shopped around for cheaper prices and came across Midas in Hoover, AL. Took my vehicle to have the radiator and outer tie rod ends replaced/repaired and an alignment done on January 29, 2015. A week ago or so I noticed something was off with the ride of my vehicle. It would pull and had a slipping feel when turning and braking and just driving in general. It worsened and I felt I shouldn\u2019t be driving it. I started thinking I needed to take it back to Midas because something wasn\u2019t right with the steering and suspension (which they\u2019d \u201crepaired\u201d). On February 23, 2015, I cranked the car up to leave work and the steering wheel loosened and turned far right on its own. Called AAA to have my baby towed. The AAA guy instantly diagnosed it and said the tie rod wasn\u2019t done right. The pin wasn\u2019t inserted in the tie rod end. We found the bolt that came off in the parking lot.\n\nAll three AAA guys diagnosed the problem and confirmed about Midas improperly installing the outer tie rod ends. One even said that could be a lawsuit and Midas would eat the cost. Had I drove home, that could have been my life on the road. My baby was towed home on a flatbed and then towed straight to Midas the next morning on February 24, 2015. I was not confident in Midas working on my CRV again. Especially since they didn\u2019t do the job right the first time and it had to be done again. And on top of that, the same technician from the first time ended up working on my car this time around. They apologized and claimed the part was defective. I seriously doubt that. This was completely their fault. Point blank.\n\nAnd to top it all off, that same technician (initials TT, according to my invoice, I believe) that worked on my car both times and drove it out afterwards, stole $20 from my ashtray compartment. He reached down and picked something up off the floor and got out of my car while putting something in his pocket. We caught it before leaving and went back to confront the guy, a short white male that looked to be in his 30s maybe; thick southern drawl. They compensated my stolen possession\u2026with the exact money he stole from my vehicle -- minutes before. We made a little scene about it. It\u2019s the principle of the matter. I usually take my stuff out of my car when having it worked on or having it in the care of someone else. But I failed to completely take all my significant possessions out\u2026like my frikin\u2019 gas money left in the ashtray. Another technician informed us that that wasn\u2019t the first time something like that happened around there and that \u2018we didn\u2019t hear that from him\u2019.\n\nSo not only does Midas not properly repair parts on a car, they also search it and steal possessions. I\u2019m not confident in the repairing of their wrongdoing. I\u2019m wondering if something else might go wrong. Their credibility is shot with me. I actually feel I should be refunded the cost for labor, if not the whole amount. And since it was a \"defective part,\" they should refund me the cost for parts since the problem had to be fixed (and hopefully it actually is, this time and nothing else goes wrong from them working on it). I will be going to the home office about this. I will reach out to corporate about this. I will review the hell out of this Midas location. A situation like mine was potentially life-threatening and a definite lawsuit waiting to happen.

I usually get depressed when my car gets sick because RARELY do I walk away without spending a grand. But this visit was very pleasant. The customer service man asked me what was wrong with my vehicle, then asked me for the key. He went out and took my car for a test drive, then onto the rack. I waited in the lobby waiting area for a very brief time and then he came back. He told me I had a couple of options. Option one included replacing brake rotors and option two, pads only. I took the less expensive option two because money was tight. My total bill was HALF of what I assumed it would be. At JacMac, the difference is simple. They don't seem to want to drain your checking account like other places around Tuscaloosa who want to bill you no less than 1000 dollars every time you walk in the door. And I really like that he OFFERED me the different options. Most places dont do that. They make you ASK for less expensive options then say, welllllll, but, if you do that then this will happen, etc.\nI think I just found \"my mechanic.\"", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1600105344536, "text": "We're glad we were able to offer you the service you needed, Brooks!

We almost made the deal twice. After making our down payment and payment requirements very clear, the sales persons involved went to get approval. When they returned, the vehicle had been discounted, but they added a \"fee.\" That's the only thing he would say, \"a fee.\" They were trying to deliberately be vauge and, in our opinion, dishonest. After discussing their \"fee,\" we never actually achieved full disclosure. We were told the vehicle was at a different dealership within our city and we could go there to finalize the deal. They said that they would call ahead and we should just go over there. Our credit had already been run multiple times, and we had received approval from the credit company. With this in mind, we went to the other dealership location. As we arrived at the other location, they hadn't been given all the details as we had been led to believe. So the process began again, running in circles of double talk and running our credit again... We left at closing time and expected a phone call the next day to complete the deal... That has yet to happen days later. I used to have great respect for Greenway Automotive. It appears that Greenway has only taken over these dealerships at face value, and the same crooks that were already in place are still running things just like they always have. Avoid Greenway Honda in Florence, AL, and Greenway Chevy in Muscle Shoals, AL, if you are planning to make a deal on a used car.

I did receive an email, and then called the number specified (4/20/2021). I recounted my story to the customer service agent and was told I would receive a call from the person over our area within 24 to 48 hours. I\u2019m still waiting. I haven\u2019t heard another thing by phone or email from management. I don\u2019t really expect to at this point. Just wanted to update so others would not think all of these issues were resolved.\n\nI have used this location for more than 10 years to service my cars and buy tires.  They bought my loyalty by fixing a flat before I was a customer. Today, they have lost me as a customer. One of my daughters took her car in for the managers special oil change which includes a tire rotation. They did not do this service. This is the second car in a month that they did not rotate the tires when getting the oil changed. The tires for both were purchased at this store. Last month, sending my oldest daughter to get her oil changed, not only did they not rotate the tires, they tried to charge her for the high mileage synthetic oil change when she ordered the managers special when setting the appointment in the app. She only gave her information. When she picked up her car, the charge was over $60 for the upgraded service. When her father questioned why so much, they said the app doesn\u2019t tell them which oil to use and they just have to make a judgment call. When he told them that I usually take care of this and to put in my information, they came back and apologized, issued a credit for the price difference, and gave us a free oil change. After what happened today, I no longer trust them to service my cars. I feel my daughter\u2019s were taken advantage of and have warned them that this is what they face as young women. Also, as this is a corporate owned store, I will no longer recommend Pep Boys or trust any Pep Boys location with my vehicles.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1617918643223, "text": "We\u2019re sorry you had less than a 5 star experience.

Maybe I\u2019m just used to the awesome service I\u2019ve received the past 15 years from the fantastic guys in Crisshaven Drive at Express. Unfortunately my husband has been driving my car lately and he didn\u2019t get by there. However, I did receive my car as promised within the hour. I did feel really bad for a lady and her daughter that was told it would be an hour for two tires to be put on and she stated she had already been there longer than an hour when we arrived. I recommended she remind the manager that her car was still in the parking lot and Leland did go get her car and take it into one of the empty bays. I stood at the window and watched as my oil was being changed. I\u2019m not sure the guy that changed my oil was very knowledgeable with tools. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll know soon if he was or not. There was a lot of cell phone action going on with employees and one employee actually let the phone continue to ring up front as he went and found a charger (in the back) for his phone. I will definitely return to my safe place in Birmingham that is fast, efficient, honest and clean. I gave a four star review because Leland said it would take an hour when we arrived and we were out within an hour. But seriously you should be informed of this online when making an appointment. One thing I noticed as did the other lady and we both did not like... I have a 2019 car and when they finally came outside with my paperwork they WROTE (using a ball point pen) on the HOOD of my car. If my paint is scratched I\u2019m going to be one mad lady! I guess I was raised that you don\u2019t mess with other people\u2019s property like that especially if it can damage.

Once I went to pick up the car he showed me a piece of paper that had 3 codes on it, and that's it. The same exact 3 codes I got from Oreillys the day before for free. So I asked him did you look for the leak or did he check my fuel injectors he said no, he just stopped looking for stuff once he saw those codes because that's almost $1600.00. So my problem is this, I paid you to tell me what's wrong with my car, not to determine if you think it's worth fixing. I wanted a full inspection of my engine that's why I paid $90.

Attempted to start the car but it wouldn\u2019t crank we proceed back into the office to advise the Manager that the car wouldn\u2019t start. He had one of his mechanics to take a handheld battery charger to the car to start it. While charging the battery he says try to crank the car and when my fianc\u00e9 turned the key there was a spark and it blew the radio, charged it a little more and the car cranked. As he traveled home the car was having issues with ABS and other warning lights, he made it home and the following morning on his way to work the same issues happened and he barely made it to work when it shut down and wouldn\u2019t start, that evening had it towed to Pepboys and they determined that the computer was not working. Now they says that he must have had someone jump the car off, yes you guys jumped it off was his response but they said they knew better than to do that.

Two days later my alternator goes out! Maybe a coincidence, but it seems like everyone I put my trust in the professionals, things start going wrong with my car. Don't trust mechanics, lawyers, maintenance individuals, had one of them tell me, \"if we fix it too well, we'll be out of a job, always have to leave something for another day.\" There's no real honest people in this area, not anymore. Bureaucrats have got their fingers into everything. Law suits are the \"American Way!\" So you can't really blame them to avoid taking responsibility for their actions. I know what my part costs, they were going to charge me nearly $500 in labor to loosen and tighten bout 6 bolts? A little extreme, they did an estimate but I never got to see it, I asked to see the defective part, but was given the excuse we would have to put it back on the lift. Since it wasn't on the lift, they had no plans to fix it!\n\nAllen from Phenix Firestone called, his only concern was why I was so critical of him. I thought that was clear, but this was the second time I took this vehicle there for the same issue, the first time I was told nothing was wrong with it. In any case in order to resolve the problem Allen stated, \"we're not working in your cars anymore!\" I guess I hurt his feelings?\n\nI used to love taking a vehicle to Phenix Firestone, always felt like they were looking out for me, always trusted them!

One of the store managers has manhood issues and thinks that all should bow down into him when he's nothing but pie. His name is Chris and have been employed by Precision multiple times...he has been known to steal cash from the register and also, had a bad drug habit as well. I'd strongly advise that you take your vehicle elsewhere. The owner of this Precision also has other locations around town and he doe not care about truth concerning how his business is ran but rather gotten money hungry at the expense of his employees and the customers.  Nor is their word any good for they tell you what you wanna hear but not man enough to deliver. All Precision Tune locations need to be under new management or close their doors for good.\nI speak this in truth for I was once employed with this establishment. I'm an ASE Master Certified Diesel & Gas Technician...yet was treated with disrespect and was lied to about the pay scale. I've seen firsthand the deceit & trickery of staff. Nor do they abide by standards placed before them in order to maintain a respectable business. Of course there's more to the story but enough has been said to bring the customers awareness up..for it is my duty & obligation to expose such when at the customers expenses.\nIt speaks volumes when you bring things to their attention yet they fail to acknowledge you or allow an explanation....so I chose to terminate my employment and since then...I've been trying to contact those in charge so that I may retrieve my other toolbox at the Pelham location but have yet been able to. Goes to show the level of care when they lose a highly trained technician because the so called service manager has no real knowledge of automobiles but is allowed to make decisions above his experience...but I'm being hindered in accessing all my tools since i can't the owners to meet me there to get my belongings. The Pelham store momentarily closed due to lack of business but yet they don't see as to why when it's self evident.\nPlease take your business elsewhere...even if it's to one like Hellen Keller...you'd have a better chance of getting professional lasting repairs.\n\nAttention to management: I need my tools from the Pelham location and have notified Chris and txt Rick only to receive absolutely no reply.

There I was told that it would be at least three hours to change my tire.  They referred me to this location--8873 Highway 72, Huntsville--several miles away.\n\nUpon entering I was greeted by the General Manager, Tyler Thurmond, who assessed the tire, and notified me that they did not have my tire in stock.  (They did have it in stock at the first place, but they had never checked.)  Tyler told me that it would take an hour and a half to get the tire there, but that once they had it, it could be put on very quickly.\n\nTyler had the delivery of the tire expedited for us, because we mentioned that we had to get up north by a set time.  The entire visit took about 45 minutes, including the delivery of the tire.\n\nThank you so much, Tyler Thurmond, for your exceptional customer service.

Here is what happened.  Called got a verbal quote of $139-189 per axle for a brake job with rotor's turned which is fair they are just below the dealer which was $200 per axle.  Went the next day to have services done to my car.  Before they began work they inspected it and determine I needed pads all the way and rotor's on the rear and a brake fluid exchange.  Estimate price was over $700.  I declined the brake fluid exchange and they offered some \"competitive\" discounts brought my total down to about $580.  Still more than it should be.  Asked for a printed estimate when I saw the estimate I knew something was up.  They had part numbers and prices on the estimate.  Quick Google search confirmed the part numbers and prices from a local part supply store that they would be getting the parts from.  They are marking up parts pricing 100+%.  Industry standard is between 10-25%.  Then they told me that the estimate was nearly at cost and if he went any lower he would lose his job.  Nothing but scam and scare tactics were used with me and I didn't take the bait.  Tried to email the address on the general managers card it wouldn't ever go through.  Called the corporate office gave them the info and the pictures I have attached here and they said a regional manager would get back with me still have not heard from that person either.

I didn't know for sure exactly where or what was causing it, didn't want to spend my only free evening of the week with my wife and kid trying to figure it out, but also didn't want to leave a leak overnight so I took off work early to go get it fixed.  My vehicle needed an oil change as well anyway so I took it in and explained it was likely the filter or one of the lines that needed replaced.\n\nSure they changed my oil no problem, but the guy came around and said he wouldn't fix the leak, that it was a \"missing o-ring that they didn't carry in stock\" and I'd need to take it back to whoever put the existing filter on and have them do the repair.  Now, I replace my filters every 40,000 miles or so and I've moved a couple of times since then.  I have no idea where I was exactly when I replaced my filter last, because it's a small fix.  I got there at 4:30 pm, close of business at 6, so it wasn't like I pulled up at quitting time.  I had to take more time off work the next morning to disconnect everything myself and find it was simply a hairline crack in the filter.  The mechanic that I talked to didn't even verify anything, except what I already knew that yep there's a fuel leak there.  He just spewed some bs that he thought sounded good because he didn't feel like doing his job...

I went in to get oil change and a get a quote on new master cylinder for my son's car. My son had a free oil change card that his mother gave him.  This his first oil change of his first car I bought him last year. He's had the card for over a year and it has no expiration date on it. The service tech \"manager\" said he didn't think the card was still good. Again, it had no expiration date on it. He said well it should've been signed by manager, though there's no place for it to be signed by a manager. The \"manage\" said well anyone could've just picked it up and put the date on it and brought it back.  I said I didn't do that nor did my son or his mother. I told him I didn't appreciate being accused of stealing a free oil change card. He said two other people did that yesterday. I said that is not my fault nor an excuse to accuse me of doing the same thing. He could not understand what he had done over a $34.95 oil change. He called the owner and the owner said the card fine, of course. He did not apologize for accusing me of stealing the free oil change card. He said he had to make sure it was ok or it would come out of his paycheck. Again, no reason to ever utter someone could have just picked one up and brought it in unsigned. All he had to say is he had to call his owner to see how to process the card not accuse me of possibly stealing it. With that lack of ability to understand the damage to the customer for your handling of this made me question giving someone like that the responsibility to work on the brakes on my son's car. So, I took my free oil change card from his fingertips and told the inexperienced \"manager\" that I'd take my business elsewhere. As I left he said the free oil change card was \"null and void\". He just had to be right. He would not listen to the customer who was getting ready to pay $559 for work plus and extra $36 for the full synthetic oil change. Hint empathy people. I only do business with people I like period and though I just met this guy he gave me reason not to like him in under 10 minutes. I had never been in a Meineke in my life until today and will never do so again. Thanks to this manager at the South Huntsville shop. I wonder if this is the intent of the Meineke representative who gave this card to my son's mother?", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1622217384048, "text": "Hi Tom, this should never be the impression we leave.

They were able to replace that at no cost to me. Secondly, screws were missing and clips weren't reinstalled. The manager assured me they would be replaced, and they were. Lastly the radiator was mounted improperly (very wobbly, almost hitting the engine). This was initially resolved with plastic zip ties and told by the manager that it was repaired and I was good to go. Obviously this was unacceptable at an initial service fee of $105/hr.

I just told them to but the best premium synthetic oil and the best oil filter they would sell me on it (and assumed they would put the correct oil to the engine). The next day, my new engine was knocking and they almost blew up my new engine from putting ridiculously thin oil in something that needs 10W30 or 10W40 oiland they put the cheapest oil filter on it you can buy. My father took his truck up there a week before to get transmission treatment and oil change. The next day the transmission fell out of the truck and he had to buy a new transmission. They also put way too small of an oil filter on his truck.\n\nBasically, they use the cheapest stuff and charge you a premium price. They do terrible work, and they do not care what happens to your property. They are very pushy salesmen when it comes to the useless (or harmful) and overpriced additives that they want you to buy. I took my Mustang back to them and asked them to replace the oil with what it needs. They refused. I ended up being on the phone with the management and all I got offered was $20.00 off another oil change. The oil change they just have me with flushing out my coolant and oil and replacing coolent and the wrong oil was just over $200.00.  Needless to say, I change my own oil now and use Royal Purple oil (the best) and K&N oil filters. If you do it yourself, you know it is done right with the best parts and is cheaper.

I came in to test drive a car they had that was the only one around that was similar to the one I wanted, with the intention of having them order what I wanted if I liked it. I was very clear about that from the beginning.

They spent most of the time trying to convince me to settle for the one they had, which was the wrong color (not a huge deal) and a Limited where I was looking for an Ultimate and didn't have any of the specific features I'd picked the Ultimate for (a bigger deal). When they finally agreed that they could order the car I wanted, they tried to convince me to buy it faster, claiming that in the few weeks I was planning to wait until some new payoffs reported on my credit, qualifying me for a 0% interest rate, my trade would decline in value and that I didn't want a 0% interest rate anyway. They kept me another 20 minutes after I said I needed to leave for an appointment, and even had the sales manager come out asking us, \"Why do you hate my car\", to try to convince us to buy the wrong one again. They didn't even pretend to care if I got the car I wanted (even though I'd have been spending more money), they just wanted me to buy whatever they could push off on me right that second. Overall, a terrible experience, and I felt more like a hostage negotiating for my release than a customer.\n\nAfter it was all said and done, I bought somewhere else, got exactly the car I wanted, in exactly the time frame I wanted.

She was SO friendly, pleasant, easy going and helpful!\nShe helped me set up a time to come in and look at the cars available.\nWhen we got to the Hyundai dealership at noon, we met with Kevin Dailey.\nMy son and I felt so at ease with him. Kevin was AWESOME!!!\nHe was very friendly, respectful, attentive and knowledgeable.\nHe gave us a great introduction of the Hyundai Elantra SE we wanted. Despite the torrential downpour and flash food warning sirens and crazy scary lightning that day, we enjoyed the test drive with him.\nThe car drove like a dream through all that terrible weather. Kevin did a great job of working to get my monthly car payment rate at a price I felt comfortable with. He also guided me on how to coordinate with my AAA car insurance agent while waiting on financing dept, then he introduced us to Chayse. Chayse also did an exceptional job of getting all my financing paperwork together.He generously provided copies of documents I needed to get my new car\u2019s tag and registration done at the DMV.\nI had no real expectations that day other than to test drive a car.\nMy son and I researched a lot and compared the Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic and Hyundai Elantra SE. The excellent warranty, and better safety features, more cabin room, and other specs sold us on the Hyundai Elantra SE. Our prior vehicle broke down in February. It has been a tough 3 +months without the ability to go anywhere.\nFrom start to finish we had an incredibly positive experience with everyone at Tameron Hyundai.\nFor us, it\u2019s not just about a car. It\u2019s about our freedom to get out and live life. We are TRULY GRATEFUL for our entire experience!\nKevin also scheduled our first maintenance appointment for November before we even drove off the lot!\nWe were thrilled to hear the warranty is doubled and our maintenance is will be handled at Tameron as well! AMAZING!!!\nAfter driving in our last vehicle for 20 years, I\u2019m SO GLAD we decided to trust our instincts and research about our new Gorgeous Hyundai Elantra and the Tameron Hyundai dealership!

Her service advisor, Brian informed her that the oil leak was coming from the o-ring for the drain plug due to it being cracked. Brian said this is considered a \u201cwear and tear item\u201d and that she should probably get her oil changed since she was due for another one in around another 1k miles.\n\nThis is where my issue begins, I call Brian to get more information and he is immediately defensive when I ask him for the information about what is going on. I asked him why the O ring isn\u2019t just a parts warranty issue, they pull the plug, put a new seal in it, fill it back up with oil and quote a filter IF she wants to put one in since it is close, he mumbled and tried to get his thoughts together and said i may not understand how warranty works. I\u2019ve been a technician for a different brand for 8 years we use the same computer systems as them and parts warranties generally don\u2019t only last a month, regardless Brian was beyond unprofessional in our coversation and within our 20 minute conversation he tells me:\n\n- o rings are a wear and tear item, which if it was replaced during the service, a month ago.. it shouldn\u2019t be \u201cworn\u201d.\n-She didn\u2019t make an appoitment for two weeks prior(we have the paper work that says she did, that they printed out for her today) and so there is no way that his technician could have left it loose or over torqued the plug because it would have been noticed sooner than a month(it was).\n- for all he knows I did this to attempt at getting a free oil change\n- this may be something I (me) would do to a customer but they would never not take the blame if it was their fault.\n- she should start checking her 2018 vehicle for oil leaks every morning just like he does so that next time there is a \u201cfaulty o-ring, that is also a wear and tear item\u201d is noticed within a month.\n- he doesn\u2019t have to speak with me because the car isn\u2019t in my name.\n- there is ZERO management in the building including service manager/director and general manager for me to speak with other than him.\n- and finally he said the oil change had all ready been performed all he did was have his technician do what was approved on the service recommendations which\nHad zero approved items\n\nOver all, the man was beyond unprofessional had a snarky attitude from the beginning and essentially tried to shift blame onto me instead of just making the situation right.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a1067f2749:0xf08fc8940d9b4549"}

Arrived to the dealership, took a test drive, checked the dealership website while on the test drive, same price  of $4994 with the red line marked through it.  Sat in the dealership waiting to get a price to pay cash, waited almost as long as I would have if I were financing it for the young man to come back with an \"out the door price\" of $7900. Sir what happened to the price of $4994 that is on your website????  Now would you look at this, the car is no longer on the website yet it was there 30 minutes ago on the test drive. Is that why I sat there so long? So that you could remove the vehicle from the website and come back with an inflated bs price. Sounds like shady business to me.

Choose wisely consumers********\n\nFound a vehicle at this dealership on Cargurus for $4994, checked the dealership website before making the trip, car listed there for the same price with a red line marked through it saying \"don't pay list price\". Arrived to the dealership, took a test drive, checked the dealership website while on the test drive, same price  of $4994 with the red line marked through it.  Sat in the dealership waiting to get a price to pay cash, waited almost as long as I would have if I were financing it for the young man to come back with an \"out the door price\" of $7900. Sir what happened to the price of $4994 that is on your website????  Now would you look at this, the car is no longer on the website yet it was there 30 minutes ago on the test drive. Is that why I sat there so long? So that you could remove the vehicle from the website and come back with an inflated bs price. Sounds like shady business to me. I WILL NEVER patronize Tameron Hyundai but who there cares, no one. It was only a $5000.00 sale anyway. But you DEFINITELY get 5 stars for being unprofessional, unethical and full of it! I gave the dealership one star to be able to write the review.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1571068113714, "text": "Angela, we more than understand your frustration and we have reached out to you multiple times to apologize for the complete error in communication on our part. In short, one of our team members messed up. We wouldn't be able to function or stay in business if we posted the wrong prices online- we know car buyers are smart, informed, and probably shopping other lots while sitting in our dealership. The car was for sale at $4994, and we have now lowered that price to $3994. Again, we're incredibly sorry for the mishap, we hope we can turn this around and give you the car buying experience you deserve."}, "gmap_id": "0x888918a1067f2749:0xf08fc8940d9b4549"}

I did everything he asked me to do to get the refund, but it was not sent.  I trusted that they would follow through on their commitment to me, so I posted the 5 star review on them.

I called before making the 45 minute trip to Birmingham and voiced my concerns to Shannon, the manager, about how I am a young woman who has experienced mechanics and sales people taking advantage of me before. I had been researching a Hyundai Accent and wanted to look at them. I ended up working with a man (his name starts with a J) who took me to the used accents. When test driving the car he only let me go around the block, I mean the car didn't even get over 40mph. He did not show me that the car was certified, no car fax, and the price was 2-3 thousand dollars than every website I have looked at about this car. In fact, a brand new Hyundai Accent was listed only a few hundred dollars more than the used 2013 one I was looking at. When bringing this up he told me they were not willing to work with me on the price and when I was going to leave he mentioned that \"Were not the type of people who will call you later and lower the price.\" So I left, then I went down the street and bought a Honda Accord that was a year older, had more miles on it and paid $1,000 more than the price J told me he wouldn't budge on the Accent. Why? Because Billy at Tameron Honda treated me as a serious buyer who was paying cash and needed a car instead of a 20 year old college girl who J hurried out the door thinking I wasn't ready to buy. It pays to be nice to people.....", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a1067f2749:0xf08fc8940d9b4549"}

I was concerned about the safety, and I called corporate Hundyai. They advised me to go to a dealership that afternoon. It was getting very late in the day. However, I did find  Tameron Hyundai that allowed me to come in, and they checked my car.\nI first was met by Joe Bajalia, Service Manager, who was Great! I told Joe I was concerned about my safety, and I had a 4 Hour drive back home. He called in his National Award Winning technician, Chris Cochran. Chris took my IONIQ for a test drive, and also checked out the car with his device that identified Car trouble.\nAfter Chris\u2019s Evaluation, he educated me on what I was experiencing in the steering , and how the car is designed to work on the interstate . I felt very comfortable in his confidence and his explanation.\nThe Previous dealership where I had my car serviced in South Alabama did not put enough air of equal portions in the tires, and Joe got a very polite professional technician to make sure the tires work properly inflated. There was one other man that assisted me when I arrived . This man wrote up the paperwork. He too was also very professional and polite!\nI certainly did appreciate Tameron Hyundai taking my concerns seriously , especially when I was concerned about my safety! I had never been to this dealership.  However,  as a woman I am used to being talked down and sometimes not being taken seriously but this was NOT the case at Tameron Hyundai Service department.\nAlthough I live 4 hours away from this dealership, if I lived closer,  they would be my #1 choice in Service!!!\nWhat a positive, efficient, effective, professional and polite service team! As one tech told me, \u201cwe have very little turnover here and we are all like family\u201d.\nThank you for your help, and treating this woman with respect and professionalism.\nJane Meadows, M.S.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a1067f2749:0xf08fc8940d9b4549"}

I\"ll be up front, I made every stupid decision you could buying a used car. The Yukon my wife wanted had a little difficulty starting (that was my first warning sign I failed to heed). When I asked the salesman he just brushed it off as it hadn't been turned on that day (my second warning sign).\n\nWhen we got into the room for negotiations I told him upfront what my requirements were. He then (what I later learned is a typical salesman trick) went to \"argue\" with his boss about giving me the deal I wanted. After a few hours he finally invited me back to his \"bosses\" office to sign the deal.\n\nWhen I sat down to sign, he handed me a stack of papers that I spent some time reviewing. I honestly could not make sense of the numbers. When I started asking him about them he responded, \"I thought we were here to buy a car!\" (my final warning sign I failed to heed). I caved to this high pressure sales tactic and just wanted to get out of there as quick as possible as it had already been 4+ hours. When I finally got my vehicles they said it took so long because they had to \"clean\" them. Worst cleaning job ever.\n\nThe NEXT day the Yukon I bought died in a parking lot. I should have taken it back and got my Expedition back I traded in but I felt like I had to make do with what I bought (besides, I bought the warranty!) Took it to a local repair shop and sure enough the fuel pump needed to be replaced. Lucky for me, I only had to pay the $100 deductible!\n\nLess than a year into owning the vehicle, the transmission went out. Fortunately for me I again ONLY had to pay the $100 deductible to replace the transmission. Little did I know, transmissions tend to go bad again after they go out the first time. About a year later, the transmission went out a second time! That was the final straw, so I traded it in at Driver's Way where I had a MUCH better experience.\n\nNow, my second car I mentioned I bought that same time along with the Yukon ended up having a broken motor mount and the A/C compressor went out less than a year after purchase. Both vehicles were only 3-5 years used and less than 75k miles on them. Maybe I just had terrible luck from Tameron Hyundai but I can't help but feel they knew about these issues and just passed them on to me based on their sales practices.\n\nTameron Hyundai lives by the moto \"Caveat emptor\"...

Shannon answered all of my questions and for the very first time in my over 40 plus yrs. as a licensed driver and vehice owner,  had someone go over every detail explaining it's function bumper to bumper.\n\nThank you Shannon and Tameron Hyundai for making my purchase and selection such a delightful experience.

However, Jason and David suggested other things before changing the sensor - which may not be bad. In the tune up it looked as if an ignition coil was bad, which they changed. It did not solve the problem, so they took everything apart and replaced my coil - saying we will not charge you for what you do not need - nor charge you for the additional labor. They found a cracked sparkplug which caused the problem. My estimated bill of 526 ended up being 326. I expressed to them my gratitude for their integrity, along with their quality work.

They are very professional, kind, and pleasant to work with.\n\nI had a blow out, on Friday, September 7th on I-459 while driving South @ 5:45 pm. I hit SIRI on my phone and located the closest tire store to my location and I sure am glad she steered me towards Darrin Gilliam and his team. I slowly limped my way to the store and got out at 5:55pm on Friday afternoon and Mr. Gilliam asked how he could help me. I told him I needed a tire that I just had a blow out and was traveling to Hale County and needed to get home. He checked his inventory, but did not have the tire size I needed, but went well above and beyond to find one for me. He had two other guys and himself on phones calling all around to different stores trying to locate one and I was worried about them closing the doors at 6 pm, but he stated they do not close the doors until all customers are taken care of and would not leave me stranded.\n\nAfter locating a tire and having it brought there, Darrin Gilliam, Jasson Trammell and Matt Ramirez installed the tire and rim and helped me get back on the road. I have never ever been to ANY BUSINESS 5 minutes before closing time and especially on a Friday afternoon to receive great customer service like this. These gentleman stayed over with smiles on their faces just to make sure I was taken care of, regardless of the time.  While I was waiting, I did notice this location was very well organized and everyone there worked together as a team. This store definitely has their ducks in a row.\n\nThe management and workforce in this store is \"bar none\" the best I have ever seen. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t live close enough to do business with this store, but I will recommend anyone in this area to make this your \u201cgo to place\u201d for all of your automotive needs. I will check out the store in Tuscaloosa and see if their standards are as good as this store on 5036 Bond Blvd. Thanks again guys for all your professional and kind help on a short notice at quitting time on a late Friday afternoon.

When your vehicle originally came to our center it would jerk and not even move, after diagnosing the obvious transmission issue we discussed a low mile used transmission was the best option for your budget and overall goal of repair.. The original repair was done in April and has been fine until now.  You came back to center for an issue that I agreed is there however the codes being set were manufacturer codes that could not be read by our computer. My recommendation was to have a dealer scan to diag said codes to determine if in fact it was in transmission at which point it would be taken care of under your warranty.. I take a lot of pride in what we do here and would never not repair a vehicle under warranty. In fact in your case with it being a used transmission from a supplier I wouldn't be out anything to repair your transmission if that's the issue. The supplier of your transmission under the warranty would have to provide a replacement unit and compensate our shop for the issue because of there transmission falling prematurely . Again I completely understand your frustration but there is a reason for the instructions given and it certainly wasn't to not honor a warranty. It was simply to gain more information to submit a warranty claim to the supplier to replace the transmission if again it was found to be faulty..

In March of 2018 my transmission gave up in my truck. My family had been using Aamco Trussville since the doors opened, so obviously I would trust them with mine. In July my truck started making noise one morning, next thing I know it had locked up tight before I could even react. Could not even turn the crank with a socket and all the spark plugs out. I called Aamco in Trussvile just to make sure it couldn't be the trans they had just \"rebuilt\" . I was assured that there was no way a transmission failure could cause an engine to seize like that and they would be happy to price me some engine work. Being in the auto industry myself, I decided I woukd price and engine and install it myself eventually since I had another form of transportation to get me by. Well here I am in Jan. of 19, still in warranty. I have pulled my motor and behold, the transmission is locked up tight, WILL NOT TURN. Motor turns fine now that it is disconnected and has great compression on all cylinders. I contacted Aamco Trussville to tell them my situation and was fully expecting them to be gentlemen and fess up to their mistake. As soon as I mentioned it was out of the truck and I could bring it down for them to see, I was told it would not be under warranty because I pulled it. The only reason I pulled it is because we were all under the assumption (including Aamco) my motor was locked up. They are now saying they are under new management with new staff and can't take my word for someone else that was in the previous staff telling me what they did. Well, Aamco of Trussville is Aamco of Trussville.I just want my truck back. My wife is a stay at home mom and Ive been driving her only form of transportation lately. This is a strange position for both of us to be in, I understand that. But whats right is whats right. I work hard and am an honest man. I feel like I am being taken advantage of and thrown away because they have all the customers they need. I know places like this, cant stand by the product, rotate staff.
