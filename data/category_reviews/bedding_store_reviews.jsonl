Because not only do they have THE best Sleep Consultants, but they also have 5 Advantages that really show why they are THE #1 Sleep Store in the country:\n\n1)  The Low Price Guarantee (If you find a better price somewhere else, get it written down and they will beat it by 10% or the mattress is free.)\n\n2) Red Carpet Delivery Service (even SAME DAY Delivery in most areas),\n\n3) they have THE Largest Selection of beds (the company's buying power allows them to pass THE best Savings and Selection on to you)\n\n4) they are involved in our Local Community (currently accepting ANY donations for Foster Kids - clothing, toys, monetary, etc.  Even if you don't need a new Sleep System, if you want to help the Birmingham Community by giving to local Foster Kids, then just simply stop by ANY of the 18 greater Birmingham locations and place your donation in the bin located inside the store.)\n\n5) and MOST importantly:  the Sleep Happy Guarantee - this is my favorite.  It allows you to pick a new mattress, try it out for 120 nights, and if you don't sleep happy within those 120 nights, (for a small processing fee) you can do a one time return or exchange!  (Go back into ANY MattressFIRM and pick out another mattress if you think your mattress wasn't perfect the first time!)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889164cb1f7fb01:0xa5b1a21a2ea275c7"}

I felt that this was something I wanted to share with everyone who is looking to buy a mattress.\nWhen I buy a mattress it\u2019s like buying a car, my wife and I went to 4 stores, one of them had aggressive sales pitch tactics, this may be why they have the word \u201cFIRM\u201d in their name.\nAnyways, I was talking with the guys at the fire station and they started to rave about the mattresses they had slept on at another fire station. They said they would do business with The sleep center when it came time to buy for there home. So since this owner took care of my friends I decided I would check them out. When we walked in the door the manager met us with a hello from the back of the store, he saw that we had two kids and asked if we cared if they played in a children\u2019s area (Automatically we were less stressed) so while the kids played he asked the standard questions and then directed us to three types to choose from but then something amazing happened.... he left us alone! Lol, me an my wife were able to lay on each bed and were able to be honest with ourselves  about the comfort and the cost. At one point we were worried because we didn\u2019t hear our kids yelling like usually, well that\u2019s because the manager was keeping them entertained. The whole process took about 1 hour which is mainly because we couldn\u2019t decide which bed to buy. They were able to give us the best offer we have found out of all four stores and then even added some incentives! Do yourself a favor!! GO HERE FIRST, I promise you, you are wasting your time if you go anywhere else.\nP.S.

Our apartments are in Saraland, which is free, and our unit is on the 3rd floor. The delivery guys carried it up with no issues and were very friendly and helpful.\n\nOverall I would say that our experience has been amazing with every Sleep Center we have worked with.

Everything they carry is nothing but highly quality name brand product.  The store manager, Michael, is one of the friendliest, and probably one of the most honest persons, you will ever meet.\n\nAfter losing all my belongings in a fire, I decided to replace my Sofa Bed with a Futon, but knew nothing about them except for what I could find on the Internet, and had lots of questions.  I searched the Internet for places to buy, and right away noticed the Sleep Center with 30 Five-Star reviews, so off I went with over a dozen question in my head.\n\nWhen I entered the store, Michael was speaking with a customer on his cell, and upon seeing me asked the customer if he could greet me.  After we shook hands I told him to go back to his earlier customer, as I often deal with customers.  Once he was finished with his earlier customer I explained my predicament \u2014 he even remembered hearing about the fire.\n\nI told him what I had read online about Futons, and told every question I had, one at a time, which he answered, explained, showed and demonstrated one by one.  He never mentioned the word \"sell\", \"buy\" or \"purchase\" once.  The more questions I asked, the more he answered, explained, showed and demonstrated, as cheerful as when we fist said hello.  When I asked about the \"anti-slip pad\" that all internet articles said was a must for the mattress, he told me that it's true, but that they are nothing more than urethane foam anti-slip drawer liners available anywhere.  When I asked if he was serious, he lifted every Futon mattress they have on display to show me that that is all they use themselves.\n\nBeing an avid Geocacher, I asked Michael if he was.  He said he never heard of it, but could I explain it.  I always do one better by showing how the app works (and even the quickie online YouTube video), and point out nearby Geocaches on the app's map.  Mobile may now have new \"Cacher\" in the game.\n\nBack on track.  I bought my Futon right there on the spot.  When it was the day of delivery, their truck driver called me up exactly when they said he would, told me he was nearly loaded, and would be over in 20 minutes.  18 minutes later they were knocking on my door, two minutes ahead of the promised time from earlier in the week. 15 minutes minutes later, maybe less, I had a fully assembled Futon in my living room., without a scrap of paper or cardboard anywhere.  A perfectly professional and quality operation, from start to finish.\n\nI now need to replace my master bedroom bed, and I will be going straight back here.   I have no need to even visit anyplace else.\n\nThe bottom of all this:  if you need to buy a Bed, Futon, Mattress, or the like, or simply have questions about such, this is the place to go first.  You will be patronizing local, and patronizing family owned, and you'll never have to give it a second thought.  (If you're also a Geocacher, ask Michael if he has a game name yet.)", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1516760301546, "text": "We very much appreciate you allowing us to care for you, Jay!"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d7350d88ab9:0x2ca38cf06b581b9e"}

Melissa Triplett Berger and I purchased an expensive Sleep Number Bed with all of the bells and whistles.  It was delivered last Saturday.  There is a $200 delivery and set up charge.  The person who delivered the bed could not get our phone apps to work (we did also order controllers).  I told him I would work on it after he left (and I was successful).  That night when Melissa set her sleep number and then I set mine with the controllers, neither side of the bed seemed to do anything even though we could hear the compressor pumping air and deflating each side separately (and yes, we know that you can only do one side at a time).   In addition, whatever number we were on, the best was just uncomfortable for us. Finally, neither of our individual sides of the bed seemed level.  We decided we just didn't want the bed.  We called customer service on the following Monday (after a poor night's sleep) and after waiting 15 minutes, I told the representative my story.   He reminded me that I needed to keep the bed for 30 days before I could return it.  I asked him if he really wanted me to sleep on a bed that didn't do what it was supposed to do for another 28 days (and yes, we tried resetting the bed)?  He said that it sounded like the bed was defective.  He said, he would waive the 30 day requirement but would still have to charge me the $200 return pickup fee that was in the contract.  I then said, so, you're going to charge me $200 to return a bed that even you think is defective.  He said he could send another bed but it might be \"a few days\".  I said a) So, you're not going to discount the delivery and setup fee for a bed that is defective, nor the return fee, and b) I don't want the bed anymore.  He said we would then have to pay both the $200 delivery fee and $200 return fee.   I decided to arrange the return and called the store.  The person we bought the mattress from said what customer service is doing is ridiculous.  At the very least they should waive the return fee because it sounded to him like the bed was defective.  He wrote an email to customer service to ask them to waive the return fee.  They called and we missed the call.  After calling back and waiting 19 minutes, they said they will not waive the fee.  So, we are spending $400 for a bed we slept on one night.

What made it 5 star worthy was the overall experience.  We came in looking for a hybrid mattress due to all the rave reviews we had seen and heard.  Alex started us off on what I would consider mid grade mattresses.  He took us over to the TempurPedics next.  I know what you're thinking because we thought the same thing.  While the TempurPedic was nice, so was it's price tag.  I compliment Alex, he definitely did his best to try and sell us on that particular mattress.  When we would try others in the store, he wouldn't talk bad about them per say, but he also wasn't singing their praises as loud.  However, once we told him our financial situation he was a complete gentleman about it and began telling us the great things about the mattresses we were testing.  When we found the one we purchased Alex was super complimentary about it and raved about our choice.\n\nShopping for large purchases can be so stressful and overwhelming. I kind of equate mattress stores with furniture stores and car lots.  I don't like being rushed or hassled the entire time, but I do like attention when I have questions or want opinions.  If we had to do it all over again, I can guarantee you we would return to Mattress Firm and ask for Alex.  He assisted when needed, gave exceptional customer service and made the process smooth and worry free.\n\nIf you go to this location you are in good hands and won't regret it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88892218e9cd6499:0xd630aaa9cefc29a3"}

Our sales associate, Jack Tidwell, was very helpful and knowledgeable. He asked us some questions about what we were sleeping on now and what we were looking towards. He showed us several beds, and explained the features and benefits if each one. He demonstrated each bed and how the remote feature worked with the mattresses.

Andrew was very knowledgeable and asked questions that helped him determine which ones best suited me. He was great and not the type of guy to push you into the most expensive one on the showroom floor. After looking at several different options, he discussed the current specials they had going on. Long story short, we got to talking about us needing another mattress set and that we would be back later because we were so please. I ended up leaving the store with two mattress sets with adjustable bases for a price no other store could even touch. If you need a new set, he is the man to make a deal with.\n\nThe only negative thing I can say is that, I was a little put off by the delivery guys. The adjustable bases we tried in the store were a decent height off the ground. When they set ours up during delivery, they were extremely low to the ground. I questioned them about this and asked does the whole bed let up, because I remember them being higher off the ground. The height was so low to the ground it left a 6 inch gap between the top of the mattress and the bottom of the headboard. Their answer was no they do not make them like that and to just go buy some taller legs at a hardware store or some bed risers from walmart. After they left, low and be hold, I look in the boxes they left and what do I fine? The extensions to the legs they could have been put on when I asked about this issue. So then, I had to go next door and ask my neighbor to help me lift the frame up to attach the extenders. Glad I went ahead and did this, because I noticed they also did not put on the seventh leg at the top. The instruction book stated that this should be put on for king size beds. So now I have one bed with the extenders on correct and one that I still have to get fixed. These frames are too heavy for just one person to do by themselves. Also, I hate that they just left trash under our beds that I had to dig out. Whenever the zip ties and twist ties landed, is where they left them. They did at least take with them the plastic and boxes that the frames and mattress came in.\n\nOverall, I am pleased with our purchase just a little disappointed with the delivery service. Had the delivery gone better, I would have given 5/5 stars. I would definitely buy from them again and recommend them to everyone else.

If you happen to be unlucky enough to work for bedzzz express in Rainbow City, they will: not properly train you on working in the warehouse. They will not take any time to explain anything. One person knows where each mattress and box springs are located and it is a guarded secret. So when you are there trying to help you have to wait to be told where things are. Then of course you are told that you are to slow by a manager who has been photographed asleep at his desk more then once. Customers who buy from this store sometimes want there old mattress and box springs hauled away for them. These mattresses are then taken to the dump. Except for the ones that the manager wants to take home. He will allow the hired help to take home one, if needed. But then he accuses you of \"selling beds\". Of course the generous, just above minimum wage pay makes it completely unnecessary to sell the trash collected from customers. Unless you are the manager, then its ok to sell the trash. You can also count on hearing every person that works there talk about every body else that works there behind there back, especially when it comes to talking about the manager. I don't believe I can even write some of the things that were said about this man on a daily basis. I don't believe I can write what was said about the customers behind there backs either. This was probably the most miserable place I have ever worked. Every person from the temps to management, hated having to come to work every day. For the most part I simply listened and didn't say to much. I knew if I did happen to speak about someone negatively, the other people working there would run to tell what was said. So I simply didn't join in on the behind the back talking. My honest opinion about this place is that only if you are truly desperate for a job should you work there. The entire environment there is toxic and filled with deep depression, anger, hypocritical management,  back stabbing and misery. Of course they may respond to this review and say I am simply an ex-employee who is trashing the place I worked at because I am mad about being let go so that another ex-employee who quit 4 or 5 times could come back. But no, I am not mad at all, just wanted to let people know how things really are there.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a395a5444dcf9:0x498a784f29fb8c63"}

Mr. Paffumi handled the exchange and scheduled a pick-up of the damaged mattress and set a delivery date for the exchange.  The manufacturer (company headquarters/people in charge) still need to place more importance on Customer Service.  I really appreciated the concern that Mr. Paffumi demonstrated in helping us get this matter resolved.  The management of Mattress Firm would do well to take some lessons on Customer Service from Mr. Paffumi.  My original rated of one (1) star has been changed to three (3) stars.

She had the door locked during normal business hours, open sign was on and all the lights were on in the store. After myself and three other customers kept knocking on the doors and windows and she would not come to the door, we became concerned for her safety. We all called the store repeatedly and no one would answer. We finally called another store to see if they could get in touch with her and she would not answer for them either. That store manager finally called their district manager who called the store and she finally answered. About 10 minutes later she finally came out of the back room appearing like she had just woken up. She immediately opened the door with an attitude and stated \"someone is trying to get me in trouble calling my district manager, I was here by myself and in the back room\". We attempted to tell her given the area and the fact that all the lights were on, open sign was on and that we noticed a car parked there that we were concerned for her safety. She continued with the attitude. I told her that there were 3 other customers there who had left and she replied \"well that's their problem, they can go somewhere else\". We told her 5 times what we were looking for and she repeatedly asked what we needed. We finally left, only to be chased out the door by her stating \"ya'll see I was here....my car is parked right there. There was no reason to call my boss and tell him I wasn't here\".  I again told her that we were just concerned for her safety and she continued to run her mouth at us outside the store. Well, to me if you were there then you should have had the door unlocked and certainly shouldn't have had the attitude you did with me about the other customers leaving. I personally would appreciate someone being concerned about my safety if I did not come to the door after repeated calls and knocks on the doors and windows when we clearly read that the store was supposed to be open. I  did get a call back from the District Manager, Bruce, who was very nice, and thanked us for being concerned about her safety even when she was not appreciative of that to us. I took my money elsewhere. I see other people have good reviews about the store, and maybe this was just a fluke, but it was a very odd situation to say the least.  I was also told by the District Manager that she has caller ID in the store, and that is likely why she answered his call and not anyone else's. I am only giving one star for the fact that the District Manager called me back and was very professional, apologetic and appreciative of my concerns.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a3ec7efea06c3:0x11e4dd951231ecfa"}

Well they failed to address before I even got the mattress about their return policy.  You have to wait 30 days before returning it and they charge you a 150 fee for pick up and cleaning. They can't take it back unless they pick it up!!  Even thought mine was a twin size.\n\nIn the end God was good, because we ended up donating it and let the Rescue mission know to give it a good clean :)  Praise God he can make a bad situation good.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892920d6008c045:0x370e3597bd408df5"}

During the sale the salesman said many time if we find a better price else ware, let them know and they will refund the difference.  I went home, went on the MattressFirm web site and realized I paid over $70 more than the web purchase.  The salesman said he would refund the difference (which they did 3 weeks later).  I then went to a local competitor and found the same mattresses for over $300 cheaper.  I went back to the salesman and he told me they were not the same mattresses.  He said the memory gel was \"better\" on his model.  A little background here, Serta make mattresses and different retailers put different names on the SAME mattress.  This is the case here.  MattressFirm named the Serta Mattress \"Kozma\" where other places named it \"Kellerman\".  It is the SAME Mattress.  I even called Serta Corporate and they confirmed.  I commented to the salesman that it would be more advantages for me to give MattressFirm the $79 to come and get their mattresses and then purchase them at the other retailer.  The sales guy called me \"an extortionist\" and I politely said it was about getting the best price on the SAME mattress.  Once I mentioned (in email traffic) that I would be contacting Serta Corporate to see if the were the SAME Mattress, the salesman said they would refund me $300 more on the sale (which they did 3 weeks later).  Here is what MattressFirm WON'T tell you.  They will only match ADVERTISED  prices of their competitors.  They will not honor quotes.  The ONLY advantage to purchasing a mattress from MattressFirm is that you can give them $79 to come and get the mattress if you absolutely hate it.  Here is my advice.  DO YOUR HOME WORK.  Compare the specs of the mattress you want and then shop around.  On a good note (hence the 2 Stars), we LOVE the mattress.  Very comfortable and this is a customer that was sleeping on a Tempurpedic.  4 Stars for the Mattress.  1 Star for my sales experience averages to 2 Stars.

There\u2019s eight different models with various thickness and materials and they let you try out every single on of them but the first setup was our ultimate choice. It was really amazing to watch the screen above your head. You see your pressure points in real time and can see literally see your optimum sleep number. If your considering a new mattress don\u2019t let the prices scare you away from Atleast experiencing it first hand.

We discussed the issues I originally posted below.  He listened intently and worked to rectify the situation to retain our business.  As such he took action to truly \"make it right\" per his reply.  Unfortunate that the situation occurred however we are now in a much better place.  Thanks to Austin for following through on his word.\n\nBad experience.  We recently purchased a Tempurpedic set and was originally told it would be delivered within 10 days.  We were also told that the store would keep us apprised of the status.  Well, no calls were received after a few days so I called.  I was told by a \"floating\" manager it would actually be 4 to 8 weeks.  At that point we perceived that we recieved bad information from the salesman who sold us the set. Frankly, I feel as if he told us 10 days to prevent us from taking our business elsewhere.  I informed the \"floating\" manager to call by 1000 the next day and if they weren't going to honor their original timeline to refund our money.  Note that they cashed and deposited our check for the full amount.  I never recieved a call the next day.  So I called the store and spoke to Brad- our original salesman.  He then stated that mattress would be at the warehouse on the 10th day but deliver later in the week.  Unacceptable.  I was going to be ok with it until Brad spoke to me very aggressively during our conversation. Even at one point trying to use \"I am a Christian angle...\" which had nothing to do with thr situation.   I had enough and told him to refund me.  He was supposed to call back and let me know when the full refund would be returned- never did.  Moral of the story is buyer beware.  Also, if you decide to go in and Brad is there be prepared for him to talk your ear off about random matters that have nothing to do with your reason to be there.  Recommend taking your business elsewhere where you have a better chance of not dealing with a used car salesman.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1612147842712, "text": "Hi Josh, we are sorry you had a poor experience with us but we would like to fix it if we can.

The staff was very helpful even to the point of when  we arrived one of their employees came out to help her climb up the stairs. At that time the employee didn't even know if she would be a customer at their store. They just came out to be helpful and offer assistance. Once in the store they were very helpful, knowledgeable, and took a lot of time with her. After her purchase the delivery crew was very professional as well.\nI bought my adjustable bed frame from the South Parkway Store. My in-store experience was mush the same as I described. The delivery crew was also friendly both times...the first time they came they didn't have the hardware to attach my headboard.
