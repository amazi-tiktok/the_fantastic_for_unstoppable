My child has horrible shot anxiety and she didn't even acted like she cared. Kept putting off during the visit to give shot making mh 5 year old anticipate it even more. Didn't get any info about what shots she gave my children. Wasn't clear about anything. Was more considered about when my children has shots last after I told her over and over. Said shot records aren't updated but when I checked and compared old record, they had the exact same ones except the new one had new shots from that day of course. Didnt get prescriptions for medication as she said she was going to do, she didnt write anything down, probably why she kept askong the same questions over and over every time she reentered the toom. Absolute horrible experience. Not to mention was there almost 3 hours for shots.  She is very unprofessional. Parents, do not take your children there. An actual doctor never spoke with me either. Which I've been to health departments prior, my kids have gotten all there shots at one, but this one do not attempt!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889baebdcf7f5375:0x12801076f221225f"}
