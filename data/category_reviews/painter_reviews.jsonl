I wanted him to quote a deck build and privacy fence. I was looking for options on building the deck and he was visibly frustrated that I just didn't have a set design for him to quote. As an engineer and a business owner I understood that, but thats often part of the process. Then he mentioned he would reuse the existing rotted ledger board on the house. I kept my mouth shut but I was definitely on guard after he said that. Next I wanted him to quote a wooden privacy fence around a pool. We came to an area that required a metal section of fence across my driveway.  He told me it wasn't an option to use anchor bolts on concrete for the posts.  As someone he has a fair amount of experience about anchoring I flat out told him it was if he did it correctly.  Once again he got very irate. Then he told me it would take $7000 to cover the 60' section of driveway.  I pointed out that the metal section across the driveway is the same width as the 20' wide pool I wanted to fence off - it does not require anywhere near 60' of fence to go across a 2-car wide driveway. He got mad again when I told him this - but, I mean it's just so obvious.  He stormed off, saying he and I weren't going to get along and I could find someone else. A frustrating waste of time and certainly did not inspire confidence in me that this contractor was competent. He may in fact be competent, but with people skills like that you might never know for sure.

However after a few minutes looking in the attic and walking the roof, it was determined that during construction of my home some 25 years ago, a handful of framing nails used to secure the plywood roof deck had missed the rafter below, and after all these years had begun to back out of the plywood deck, pushing up the roof shingle just enough to let water pass underneath. The roofer walked the entire roof looking for nails that were backing out (not just in the area of the water stains below, but the whole roof), removing all that he found, sealing the hole and making sure the roof shingle lay flat. Two days after the repairs we had a lot of rain, and no water leaks inside the house.\n\nOnce again, Pickett Construction has made my wife and I very happy, and I will not hesitate to call them in the future.

I signed contract and they showed up when they said they would, completed the work when they said they would, job looked great, did a good job cleaning up and all this done in a respectful and empathetic fashion to meet my need of completion of job prior to closing date on house.\nI've moved to the Gulf Coast but still have rental property in Jefferson County.  Insurance company review dictated the need of handrails for front steps. I had one month to get then installed or they would drop my coverage on the house. The Rental Management Company for that property got some quotes but I called Pickett Construction on my own. I gave them the contract knowing I would get quality work done on time. What I really gave them besides the contract was my trust. That's something that's hard to do these days. Again, they didn't let me down!\nMy third experience with them was to get a quote on electrical work at that rental property. They looked at the job, told me what needed to be done but couldn't do it do it because they were covered up at the time. So, they referred me to an electrician who was half the price of other quotes and also did a great job.\nI highly recommend Pickett Construction.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888928b42506b8af:0xcb8d4f70d1041df1"}

Josh did a great job with my wife letting her see and select the tile, flooring and paint, etc.\n\nDo you want to know if Pickett is versatile or can get the job done fast? Pickett did the following items in 17 days ... 350 feet of new privacy fence and gates, paint entire house exterior, re-roof covered deck, remove turbines and patch roof areas, repair rotted roof decking around chimney stack, re-flashed and re-roofed the area, installed new LED motion detecting security lights, installed new outdoor lighting over front door,replaced all windows with new double hung, double pane vinyl windows, installed new laminate/engineered word floors on the entire main level of the house, laid tile in both foyers, kitchen and den/study, replaced every interior door and all hardware, installed new ceiling fans in each bedroom and main foyer, removed wrought iron raining in foyer and replaced with wood and balusters, primed and painted all interior trim, scraped popcorn/acoustic ceiling from kitchen, repaired drywall issues in bedrooms and kitchen, textured and painted kitchen walls.\n\nAny \"extra\" I asked about was repsonded with a written proposal so that there could be no confusion or disaggrement.\n\nTo get these things done in the time frame of 17 days ... including holidays ... shows excellent planning and execution. I was kept informed as to what was scheduled for the day, who would be there and what to expect. They arranged for the construction dumpster delivery and pick up. Pickett did a nice job on the site clean up as well.\n\nPunch list items were few and far between and resolved promptly.\n\nThe only thing that would be close to a concern or a negative was the sub-contracting tile guy who was going through a diviorce while he did the job. He did not do a bad job but his distraction resulted in a couple of small punch list things that Josh had Tripp take care of. I was assured that they would not be using this tile guy in the future.\n\nWould I recommend Pickett Construction to you? Absolutely. Want to see pics of the renovation? I have them. Will I use them again in the future? Absolutely. As a matter of fact, my daughter used them on a foreclosure she purchased in Calera.

{"user_id": "108852040032783306603", "name": "Tim Calhoun", "time": 1396761930047, "rating": 4.0, "text": "Pricing:\nWe contracted with Pickett to complete some work on our house to prepare it for sale. We were looking for some typical wood rot to be replaced and exterior paint. We also requested an interior paint quote. I think the quote was a bit high for the exterior work, but not so bad that I didn't go with their services. The quote for the interior painting was outrageous, so we opted for another painter. The other painter's quote was nearly $3000 less than the quote from Pickett. We were also having some plywood put in the ceiling of the carport, because the builder used interior drywall in our neighborhood. Pickett gave us a \"complimentary upgrade\" to beadboard instead of plain plywood. This really added a nice touch to the carport ceiling, and was an appreciated upgrade. They only requested 1/2-down to start the work, which we felt was certainly reasonable. They also honored their coupon they regularly have (often in the Alabaster Newsletter, or ValPack). We printed ours from the ValPack website.\n\nWorkmanship:\nThe quality of the exterior work was pretty good. There were a few spots where the painting got a bit \"sloppy,\" but was overall good work. The beadboard in the carport made a great upgrade to our carport, and added a touch of \"class\" to an otherwise mundane area of the house. Unfortunately, due to our unusually cold winter, the holidays, and several bouts with rain, our work was regularly delayed. It took a bit longer than expected to complete, but didn't delay our schedule of listing the house. The little interaction I had with the crew was polite and courteous, though at times the project manager came across as mildly arrogant. Communicating with the PM via email was the best medium, although he sometimes took a bit longer than expected to return messages.\n\nPost Work Follow-up:\nAgain, the delays in returning messages made for a challenge in clearing our post-work \"punch list,\" but this was also around the holidays, so we conceded a bit.  Had there been more clear communication about workday expectations (e.g. workers will/will not be onsite today) this would have made for better overall feeling about the length of the job.\nDuring our home buyer's inspection, they found more wood rot that was inadvertently overlooked by the crew. While I don't expect the painters to look over every square inch of the house (heck, neither did I!), it ended up being a significant portion of the chimney that had rotted out the edge of our masonite siding. One would expect that at least part of that might have been discovered and either repaired or at least alerted me to the potential change in an estimate so it could be repaired. When we approached our PM about correcting it, he gave us a price quote. After paying over $6000 for the original work, this was certainly unexpected, especially with their \"1 year warranty.\" I spoke with Josh, the owner's son who is also in management with the company. He immediately started working with me to find a reasonable solution. I ended up having to pay a bit more, but we did come to an acceptable compromise on the final cost of the supplemental work. In the end, Josh personally stopped by the house to deliver the revised agreement and took pictures of the missed work. It turned out that the rot was more severe than even he expected. He opted to continue to honor that revised estimate and didn't charge anymore. Josh really worked hard to make a relatively displeasing situation wok out well in the end. Josh was absolutely committed to service and ensuring my end satisfaction. He even reached out after the supplemental work was completed to check in on my satisfaction, and knowing there was a bit of a sour taste, still wanted this Google Review. Josh knows what it takes to listen to customer concerns and immediately find a reasonable solution that works in the best interest of all parties. Had it not been for Josh's actions, my 4-star rating would have been a high 2-star, or low 3-star.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888928b42506b8af:0xcb8d4f70d1041df1"}

The project involved demo of some existing kitchen cabinets, replacement of a cook top and stove with a range, replacement of a vent hood, installing new kitchen lighting, laying tile, painting cabinets and bookshelves, painting trim, and painting walls.  All of this was handled by David's crew without having to sub out any work. The quality of the work done was really top-tier.  We used David's decorating consultant, Lindy, to help pick out colors, and the result has significantly brightened and beautified the two rooms where we spend most of our waking hours.\n\nWhen you undertake a project that takes this much time, you quickly realize that you have invited some strangers into your home for a lengthy stay.   Well, the guys David sent did not stay strangers for very long.  They were cheerful, friendly, and helpful to us.  They added, without cost, some features to the project at our request, even though these features were not in the original contract-- for example, installing a dimmer switch in the kitchen, replacing flood lights in our dinette area so they would match the color put out by our new kitchen lighting, cutting out the trim along one wall of our living room so our bookcase could lay flat against the wall, and installing wall outlets in our bookcase.  They cleaned up after themselves every day and hauled away their own trash.  When they moved furniture around to do some painting, they always put it back where it had been.  It got to where we enjoyed having the company at our house.  At the end of the job, we were glad it was completed, but we were sorry to see the guys leave.\n\nAll the work was done with great attention to detail.  They found and installed tile to match our existing kitchen backsplash tile.  They worked on our project every weekday for three weeks.  On some days, they worked on our cabinet doors and bookcase at their shop, but on the days when they did not come, David always called us to let us know they would not be there and what they would be doing that day.\n\nWe will certainly call on Lisenby Construction if we undertake new remodeling projects.

The next dat, I went out to start putting things back where they belonged. I had one piece of furniture that I planned on relocating to a different oart of the garage and when I went to move it, I realized that they never moved it to begin and only painted around it.\n\nI called on Wednesday and was assured someone would return my call that afternoon to come back and return the call. No one did. I called again this morning and Dana said the team claimed they moved everything and questioned me about the validity of my report. I told her what they didn't move and she said Britney would call me later to schedule. No one called. They did happily have time to cash my check though.\n\nYou would think a company with as good of a reputation that Pro1 Painter's has, they would be embarrassed by the oversight and send someone back immediately. Nope. They're really just a company that cashes a check then runs.\n\nIt really is a shame that the quality customer service Pro1 Painter's used to have no longer exists.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWRWorbOrsqgJ3BRA8E1UE6GfUxALVpV6w3Vyy=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1621958880792, "text": "Mrs. Carlson, thank you for bringing this issue to our attention on Wednesday May 19th.

They started the following Monday and three painters worked for 7 full days. They were always on time and they worked hard all day. And they finished on time, as promised, although it was a big job (3100 sf house) and two rooms required a third coat to hid the previous wall color. They were very responsive to any requests and concerns we had and kept us updated as to what they would be working on each day. Everything was covered properly and drapery rod brackets, faceplates, etc removed. The results were beautiful. It was a high quality job from start to finish. We are planning on getting them back in the future to do some cabinets.\n\nThis is an update as we had more painting done by Pro1 in March, 2020.\nWe had another great experience, they did another fabulous job.  We had the brick exterior walls of a screened porch painted white.  It looks so good and the coverage is excellent.

What a COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT!  Bryant Darby came for the initial consultation and was very thorough and detail oriented, so I could only assume the painters would follow suit. Long story short, the painters were absolutely terrible! The crew dripped paint EVERYWHERE.  Inside and outside of my house were covered in drips of white paint.  **UPDATE:  The paint drips were on a brand new deck (less than 2 years old); a new rug (less than 2 years old) and newly installed flowerbeds/rocks less than a month before the paint job.  THIS WAS NOT FROM A PREVIOUS PAINT JOB!!!!   Every time they returned to fix something, they'd leave their mark on something else.  It finally got to the point that I didn't even want them on my property any longer.  The lame attempt they made to clean up after themselves was laughable and I was ready to cut my losses** The house wasn't prepped correctly and I have fresh paint peeling already!   They broke bulbs on my string lights and not only didn't tell me, but didn't bother to clean it up!   This crew was completely lazy and careless.

The painters did come back to the house to clean off any drips and as we discussed with you onsite many of the drips were from the previous times the house was painted and could not be cleaned.  To my knowledge any drips or spills we were responsible for were cleaned from the house.  If you do have peeling paint from the current job we did for you please remember you have a 3 year warranty that covers any peeling, flaking, or fading. Likely this is not a product of incorrect prep but the conditions in which the paint was applied.  If any moisture gets trapped between the paint and the wood it will peel no matter how well the house was prepped.  This is why we offer the warranty we do.  Please feel free to contact us to schedule any necessary warranty work.  We are happy to fix anything we are responsible for."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889166f758133e3:0xb2e24817cff76e0b"}

After 20+ years and doing touch up painting as needed, we had to do more and that involved changing colors in about 70% of the house.\n\nWe did our due diligence and got three estimates from reputable painters.  The first came in roughly $4000 over our budget and we began to consider just painting the main level.  The second (who we had used in the past) was only $200 over budget, had done good work for us in the past and we were now in a comfortable price range.  The Painting Company was the last we called and came highly recommended by several friends and neighbors.\n\nWhen Peter and I completed our walk through, he handed me a nice glossy folder containing references, insurance information, standard practices and the like.  We had also discussed upgrading from a contractor grade paint to something better (especially since we are known to only paint when its an absolute necessity).  Peter was courteous and professional and as he drove off, I knew we could never afford what we had discussed.\n\nThe bid from the Painting Co came in the next day and was $1600 under budget ($1800 under the next closest bid and $5600 under the high bid).  I read through the detailed list of inclusions and exclusions, the color choices in the different rooms, the type and manufacturer of paint to be used and found it all to be exactly as discussed the day earlier.  We had found ourselves a painter.\n\nWe called and set up a date to start, game them a 25% deposit to cover material and began taking down pictures and putting away breakables.\n\nA little over a week later, two painters showed up at the house as scheduled.  They may have been 10 or 15 minutes late.  But, that was all.  The date was correct and they had all their gear and were ready to go.  We walked through the house marking which rooms were to be painted which colors to avoid any confusion or misunderstanding and they began moving furniture, taping the trim and covering everything (and I mean everything.  our house looked like a drop cloth bomb had exploded in it).\n\nThat day and part of the next were ceiling days and they began some of the upstairs walls.  The next day the upstairs was complete and they brought the show to the main level.  Three and a half days after beginning, they were cleaning up the house, we did a final walk through, some light touch up and they replaced the furniture before leaving.\n\nThey had estimated four to five days and finished in three and a half and the product was nothing short of excellent.  I was contacted promptly when they had the one question that required a minimal amount of homeowner guidance.\n\nIt's been a week now and every time we walk into a room we are still amazed by the quality of work and the difference that it makes.  I guess it's time to start planning the painting of the outside again.  The Painting Company will get the job.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1620411002108, "text": "Thank you so much for the incredibly detailed 5-Star Review, Jimmy!"}, "gmap_id": "0x88893d2530b97bb5:0x3d2e1ac8c6984d89"}
