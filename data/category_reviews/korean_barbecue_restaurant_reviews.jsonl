Seoul BBQ is no anomaly, maybe just a little more expensive than usual, but there are some decent lunch specials.\n\nTo the food: I got kimchi jjigae (spelled \"kimchi chigae\" at Seoul BBQ probably for pronunciation ease), a spicy stew of cabbage, beef, tofu, and noodles. It was spicy and hearty, great for the 30 degree weather tonight. The banchan (side dishes served with all the main dishes) was delicious. If it looks weird and you haven't tried it, try it.\n\nMake sure to ask for the barley tea along with whatever else you have to drink. It comes with your food, just like water, and really complements the Korean flavors.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMToN2_Ofz6qdGhTzwRvk1FQuJTBKQskEAo5A=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrHasapOamDzUPP4wl_8_VnZmyQ_cHBpdBtA=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf31cfef3fec7:0xf812f4fb966c1773"}
