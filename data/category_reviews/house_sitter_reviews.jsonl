They take care of the cats and dogs, feed fish in the ponds, fill birdfeeders, watch the water level in the pool, etc.  The sitters have even stayed extra during thunderstorms to comfort the pets until the storm passes. At times my flights have been canceled or delayed and I can contact them and get an extra sit or two to cover the unexpected extra time away. The animals love them and are so happy to be home (rather than at a kennel). RedDog is a very professional and caring service that takes the best care of my babies.

I had been taking them to my office for awhile, but they got too big and rambunctious. They were still too young to be left alone all day. RedDog was a lifesaver. They took care of the boys, plus the other three adult bulldogs we already had. We have never had less than five dogs at once, which always made traveling or overnight trips a hassle. Boarding that many dogs was expensive, not to mention traumatic for them, having to be away from home. RedDog stepped in there as well, providing overnight service for our crew in our own home! The peace of mind this gave us when we were away is beyond words. Over the years, our crew has grown and changed, adding in granddogs as well. Currently, we have 11 dogs in and out of our home!! This includes 4 new French bulldog puppies! Again, these needed extra attention, and RedDog was there, providing twice daily visits for the pups. We also have a special needs bulldog, who wears diapers at all times, as well as special medications. RedDog never balked. They change Lily\u2019s diapers, give her meds, and whatever else is needed. We get photo updates at every visit, as well as special texts if there are any specific concerns. RedDog has even taken one of our dogs to the vet when a scuffle broke out and she was injured. We cannot say enough about, nor recommend RedDog more highly.
