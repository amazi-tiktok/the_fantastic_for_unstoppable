I also had to bring my glasses back as the lens were cracked and when I got them back, they were not the same as the first ones.  I had paid extra for the top of the line with all of the add ons and when I got the \"fixed ones\" back, these were not added to the lenses.  Very disappointed also that if you call close to 5pm, they never answer the phone.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889badbf94081c6b:0x4f3c6da5ce8f1c70"}

Unfortunately the dentist doesn't seem like he should be working with children.

The first visit (for a pulled tooth) the dentist eventually stopped and gave him another shot, after which he was fine. This 2nd time, we were told we were the ONLY patients in the office, but the dentist seemed inconvenienced to even come in the room,  didn't say 2 words to me and acted in a rush to leave. He started a filling and my son raised his hand and made noises to let him know he could feel it, but the dr kept going and told the nurses \"He's fine.\" Then when my son finally jumped & grabbed his hand, he got aggravated and said to refer us to a pediatric dentist to be sedated. Very rudely made a point to say he wasn't even touching his teeth when he jumped. He didn't even offer to give him another shot or try to comfort him/talk to him about what he was feeling. My son is 11, knows what he can feel & has never had this problem with other dentists. :( I am very disappointed that an office so heavily geared towards children & close to home, has such an impatient & unkind dentist.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889badbf94081c6b:0x4f3c6da5ce8f1c70"}

He have a very professional staff and they are always ready to say or do something to make you comfortable. I was in the office about two weeks ago to get a permanent crown on a tooth that I had gotten a crown on about three years ago. Dr. Hankinson replaced that crown because he said that he felt that it should have last longer than that. I did not go in to received a free crown, I thought he could cement the old crown in considering that it was still pretty, but he insist on doing another one free of charge. You really don't see that kind of act of kindness today. He is a remarkable young man and he is very attentive with every patients. I have recommended many people to him and I will continue to do so, and he is VERY SMART. Please check out that SEMMES LOCATIO lt is beautiful.

However, she no longer owns TFM and it seems like the greedy corporation take over has ruin what was once a great doctor's office.\n\nI showed to an appointment recently that was badly needed, as I had some concerns about me health including new issues. I had no prior contact with the office in any way before my appointment or was told nothing at previous visits. But money is what they wanted. I had no idea I had a bill, but the first thing they told me was \"you can't be seen today\" and then go on to tell me about the bill, which I offered to pay on, but I didn't have my cc with me at the time and offered to pay when I came back in a few days to get blood work results.\n\nThey gave their spiel about how doctors need to get paid too, and would I work without expecting to get paid, and blah blah blah. I' believe people deserve to get paid for good services. After all, I had been coming there for over 10 years and paid ever single bill prior, so why would anyone think I wouldn't pay this one. I've my own business before, I know it's important to get paid.  But shouldn't human decency and kindness be the first form of communication one starts with instead of the \"I want my money first\" attitude?\n\nFor me, I felt abandon by a doctor's office that I had been coming to for years. That I trusted my children with. I was given zero notice before being told I couldn't be seen. I was over due for certain treatments that I have to see the doctor or nurse to receive. I had concerns about my blood pressure and other issues that were important to prevent increased medical problems. I didn't want to hear their spew about \"working for free\" or we have to be paid to continue services, I wanted to hear. \"Ok, what can we do to help you out? We're here for you.\" Treat people like this first I guarantee you will always get paid.\n\nOr at the least I wanted the bare treatment until I had enough time to find another doctor for treatment, but I wasn't even given that. Yes, they offered to see me again, but made it clear I was going to have to jump through some hoops and pay, always with an emphasis on getting paid, never about what I thought doctors first priority was supposed to be: to do no harm an give their patients the best medical care they can ( not for free of course), but a good doctor put's people first. Dr. Burdette always did this, but this new corporation or whomever owns Taylorville Family Medicine now, IS ALL ABOUT THE MONEY AND COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT YOU.

Today I had an appointment scheduled with her that I had been waiting months for, my appointment was at 3:15pm at 3:00pm I received a text that said they were running behind and my new appointment time would be at 3:31pm and that they would text me again before my appointment to confirm. At 3:30pm I received the same text. I went ahead to the appointment because I needed to be seen and I would just wait in my car. When I went in and checked with the receptionist she told me that I was 45 minutes late and that they would have to reschedule my appointment. I showed her the texts and she said that they only sent the one text that was generated when I did not show up for my appointment at 3:15pm. THIS IS COMPLETELY UNTRUE!!!!  I was very upset, she told me that it would throw them completely behind to try and see me and that she talked to the owner and he said that I would have to reschedule. There was absolutely no one in the waiting room. While telling me this a woman walked in and said are you still open? She said yes and checked her in for bloodwork. But they can\u2019t admit their mistakes when it comes to texts that cause problems and let me be seen. They then sent one of the medical assistants out to talk to me. He was VERY RUDE AND CONDESCENDING, after telling me that I should have come and checked in at my appointment time he went on to tell me that he was always at least 15 minutes early for ever appointment he has ever scheduled. When I told him that was foolish for me to come and sit in a reception area for an undetermined amount of time in the middle of a pandemic-he told me I could have waited in my car. When I told him that I was working and felt that was ridiculous he told me that he was a single parent to 2 children whose mother had died and that he had to be both parents to his children and still keep his appointments and go to work everyday to support them. This all in a raised voice that apparently carried. When he finally stopped his tirade, or I could have possibly interrupted him to tell him that my husband passed away in 2012 and that I also have 2 children that I have had to raise myself while working and keeping appointments and yes I raised my voice too. At that point, the nursing staff came out and told me to leave and that the owner would call me. That I was upsetting the patients in the office. Really??? I have always been at my appointments, I have watched this office deteriorate over the last couple of years, I like Dr Burdette but it is clear from all the things that have happened and from the way they have treated me (and others if you read the google reviews and not all the five star reviews they have on there site which I am positive they solicit and approve) that Dr Burdette has absolutely no control over what happens with her patients. I am certain that the owner will never call me and if he does it will probably be to tell me not to come back. Which he doesn\u2019t need to do because I will not be treated like that and will find another doctor. One that actually cares about the needs of their patients and does not treat them like they treated me today. I am extremely disappointed in Dr Burdette, I feel like after 10 years she should have at the very least - have talked to me herself, but she did not, I feel very sad that she cared so little for me as her patient but I guess I just misjudged her as well. This is not the first problem I have had with them but it will be the last. The NP\u2019s there miss a lot of things and you almost never see Dr Burdette unless you specifically ask to and then things like this happen. I expect them to not release my records without a fight also. Please think before you make an appointment here and please don\u2019t put yourself in risk if you feel that you are not getting the care you need and deserve at this or any of their clinics.

He seems to think all my health problems come from smoking. I smoke about a pack of day by the way. I have restless leg syndrome, a jaw condition called TMJ, diabetes and a good bit of joint pain. it doesn't matter what health condition I want to talk about, he blames all my health problems on smoking. My dad was diabetic and smoked 3 to 4 packs a day. He did not have all these aches and pains that I have. My boss is in his sixties, smokes cigarettes and is diabetic. He does not complain of aches and pains at all. I understand smoking may irritate a pre-existing condition. But the key word here is pre-existing condition. There must be something else going on. I was hit by a car and knocked down when I was little. I have had problems with my hip since. Dr Lowe refuses to look at it because I haven't quit smoking cigarettes yet. All of my aches and pains come from smoking cigarettes and I'm diabetic. I  complained about a lot of pain in my right leg on my last visit. He refused to look at it because I still smoke. So I went to doctors care across from walmart  who found that I had a torn muscle and soft tissue damage. But he actually looked at it. I will be replacing doctor lowe as soon as other doctors are allowing new patients. I wish doctors care accepted my insurance. I am sick and tired of getting blown off because he is against smoking. If somebody comes in and complains about something ,it should be looked at. He acts like I have the plague because I smoke. My husband is dying to have a word with him. But I do my best to keep my husband away because my husband will bite his freaking head off. He is very protective of me. I wonder if I can find a veterinarian to take care of me. I'm sure they would do a better job than doctor lowe does. And they probably wouldn't talk to me like a dog as as badly dr. Lowe does.

Meanwhile, our existing patients periodically get married or have children and ask for their new family member(s) to be a part of the practice, we allow them to be referred in through the process you read about. Regarding insurances, there are many insurances that we are not credentialed with or \"in-network\" for and we cannot accept those insurances.

For example, they wanted us to pay a monthly fee to just for the privilege of have them as our doctor. Sixty dollars a year for each of us isn\u2019t for us. Neither is the billing. Neither of us could ever get a receipt (after we would beg) that matched any of our insurance bills. That may be because they listed us as missing appointments (we have never missed an appointment) or as not even having them!  I had a list of my past two years of appointments and they didn\u2019t have but two of them on their books. Also, one cannot get a response on their portal in five or six days, sometimes not at all. You can\u2019t get them by phone at all so you have to go through the portal for all things. Not a problem unless the staff is as non-responsive as they seem to be.

So frustrating, I may as well have been talking to a robot. You have to pay $60 dollars a year for an online service (that you don\u2019t have to use, because you can still just call if you prefer) and if you opt out of the unnecessary online service then they charge you $10 for every piece of mail they would send you. Ridiculous and unnecessary. I suspect they have too many clients because they don\u2019t do a good job of making new clients feel welcome and taken care of. The CRNP I saw was good, but there are too many layers of unnecessary headache between the client and her. I chose this place because it came highly recommended to me by family, but apparently that was years ago before the new onboarding and client management process, and when I asked why this new process was so terrible, she said it didn\u2019t use to be that way. I was told that my family member was probably \u201cgrandfathered\u201d in to the old system. If the new client management system was truly better, easier, more intuitive, and actually added value for older customers, then why would they not institute it with all their clients?

We are always working for continual improvement at Innova and it is encouraging to hear that you share our frustration with the widespread dependence on unreliable communication methods like fax machines and telephone calls to transfer critical patient information between medical facilities in our community. We strive to avoid paper orders and utilizing faxes, but because so few clinics and hospital facilities locally utilize modern communication methods, we are still forced to send 86% of our communications with other clinics by \"electronic fax.\" This just means that we don't use paper to send the fax, but it's still a picture of a document sent over a phone line as opposed to electronic communication with structured data in a standardized format that increases accuracy and safety.

The have automated a lot of their administrative processes and use technology to their advantage (e.g. having a patient web portal where you can communicate with them, see test results, schedule appointments, etc). The result is that it frees the providers up to focus on the patient rather than paperwork. And their appointment times run like clockwork. Like a 9am appointment is really 9am, and if they are 10 minutes late, they are apologizing profusely.\n\nEvery provider I have dealt with at Innova also gets an \"A\" for bedside manner. Sometimes medical issues aren't easy to discuss, even with medical professionals. However, Innova providers really have a warm interpersonal, friendly demeanor that takes that edge off.\n\nThey also focus on general wellness and health as much as medicine, that is they don't just throw pills at you. They actually have a full time dietician/nutritionist and a wellness program you can enroll in. So if you are looking to lose weight or just not be a generally average unhealthy Alabamian, it's better to do it under medical supervision from people who know what they are doing.\n\nAlso, they take my insurance (Aetna), and their rates/discounts are reasonable, so that's nice too.

I was offered a new patient appointment the next day\u00a0with the service so they must have had openings. But when I declined my appointment was pushed out 3 months. When I was instead offered \u201cpaper communications\u201d where they will mail you things but charge you for each thing but don\u2019t really tell you how often\u00a0that is.

This is why we were able to offer you a \u201cSick Visit\u201d immediately, but we couldn\u2019t schedule you for your \u201cNew Patient Encounter\u201d for several months. Typically, the wait wouldn\u2019t be so long even for a \u201cNew Patient Encounter,\u201d but we experienced higher than expected new patient registrations when we resumed accepting and as a result we have since stopped accepting new patients.\n\nAs you mentioned, we do have an option for our patients to message their providers and access their medical records online through the portal app for their phone. Many people feel that this convenience and ease of communication with their Primary Care Clinic is valuable, but we also understand that we are not a good fit for everyone.\n\nWe strive to effectively serve our community and we regret that we were unable to establish a relationship with you.

These are my reasons behind that. I don\u2019t like coming into a doctor\u2019s office and not be greeted by a friendly face. Instead you\u2019re greeted by a keyosk (however you spell it) walking you through steps to sign in and pay. Next when you are seen, the visits are rushed and I feel that I\u2019m just a number patient on the list,  instead of a person who they are taking their time with to answer any questions or concerns I may have. I have left several times knowing that I did not get the opportunity to address all of my concerns. While I know this is a business, and money has to be exchanged for services, If you are behind on a payment of $10 or whatever, I don\u2019t appreciate being called by a \u201cmafia like\u201d voice message indicating I have 24 hours to pay you, and that I cannot be seen until that is resolved. Lastly, my father was recently scheduled for a procedure. However,  his blood pressure was too high. Stroke level to be exact. Innova was called and they refused to see him at their office even when the nurse where he was called them, hoping that would make a difference.  They claimed there is a balance on his account, which there isn\u2019t. This is very poor judgement on a so called health care professional. Copies of the canceled checks have been shown indicating he was up to date, but they just dropped him as a patient.  I along with the rest family have \u201cDROPPED \u201c Innova as our primary health care facility. Anyone looking for a general practitioner, should never go here. Thanks.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1532654563903, "text": "Diedre, We hope you are able to establish with a new provider with which you have a trusting provider-patient relationship. While we cannot discuss patient cases on a public form as you have brought up, I have certainly enjoyed talking to your father myself several times over the past few weeks and was happy to take care of his medical needs. We look forward to seeing him again soon. Medical billing can be a frustrating and confusing issue especially in this time of increasing deductibles.  We deal with this on behalf of our patients frequently and are happy to discuss these questions or concerns with our patients to get them resolved.\n\nOur current practices at Innova include being open on Saturdays for sick visits and for those who work during the week as a convenience to them.  We do not fully staff the office on Saturdays so you will not see one of my team sitting at the guest reception desk in the lobby. My team needs their weekends too! Otherwise, Christine or one of my other team members is at the guest reception desk to greet you.  I regret you have not felt heard at your office visits.  This is one of our highest priorities at Innova.  We sometimes find that we cannot adequately address all of a patient\u2019s concerns within one office visit and in those instances we will ask you to continue to follow up with us until all has been addressed. Lastly, our billing company will begin calling patients after three statements have been sent out without payment to collect that payment for medical services already rendered. We are always willing to set up a payment plan for any amount. Unfortunately some patients do expect to be able to remain current patients and receive medical services without payment thus we use resources such as the AMA and the AAFP Practice Management recommendations to assist us with how best to address these issues.\n\nAgain, we wish you all the best."}, "gmap_id": "0x8862132e04d8184d:0xb0d4fc8e9fba4586"}

I didn't get the message, as I never dreamed they wouldn't be in direct contact with me. So, nearly a week later, I get a same day appointment at Innova.  I walk in with a cane. They proceed to tell me they cannot do anything for me. I barely made it there and it's late in the day. I insist there must be sonething to do since I couldn't perform basic hygiene or walk.  So they sent in another and another staff member, as I explained myself over and over I became more agitated and more explicit about what I couldn't do as a result of the blindibg pain. They finally arranged a MRI that afternoon at close of day. I went.\nI hear back next day that my hip is shot and that I need  hip replacement.The orthopaedic surgeon said the year plus old xrays were clearly indicative of hip replacement some time ago  One heels of this news,  then I find Innova has deemed me innapropriate to be their patient. They sent person after person to witness my behavior and to justify their getting rid of me, not as I thought, to find someone on their staff who understood me.\nSo, If you are in excruciating pain, or have pressing health issues for a primary care doctor to manage, I would not recommend Innova. They had been my doctor for months at the time of the incident. They had not consulted with specialists who were caring for me. Then at my most vulnerable, they threw me out. I'm  certain I would have been better off at the ER with some random tramua doctor than to go there and be treated / not treated as I was by them.\nThey rely on their portal, messaging, voicemails emails and texts. A bit hands off for me anyway, that was a contributor to my missed communication and frustration, and prolonged pain.

Back when Dr. Uptagrafft was in with Gleneagles. What I love most about this place is that if you have any concerns, they address them right away. For instance I was worried about my thyroid. When Dr. Uptagrafft asked if I had anything I would like her to check out, she didn't hesitate to check into it. She ran tests and did an ultrasound and, sure enough my thyroid was enlarged and, my levels were off. I eventually had to have my thyroid removed. I've heard many people have gone years with undiagnosed thyroid issues because, their doctors were so quick to dismiss the issue as something else without testing the levels or doing an ultrasound to rule it out. At innova they listen to your concerns and, they do what they can to get to the bottom of any issues you may have. They're kind, and they take time to answer any questions you may have without making you feel like you're wasting their time.

Because of their error, I was billed $200 extra. After long waits on the phone with BCBS, I found out the story above.\n\nAt 9:30 am today I called Stopwatch to ask about how we could have been charged if we confirmed at the front desk that we were covered. They told me they would contact billing and return my call. When I didn't hear back from them in 30 min, I stopped by the office to ask in person about the error. After waiting for 20 minutes in the waiting room, I ended up calling the billing office myself and actually having to pass my phone to the receptionist to get their error fixed. After all that, they admitted fault and adjusted my bill.\n\nMy kid was sick when I went in to talk about billing, so I thought I might as well have him seen now that the billing issue was worked out.\n\nWe waited a reasonable 20 min, they did a flu test, and released us with an RX called in to CVS.\n\nI had to call twice, but they finally said they were resenting my RX. I assumed it'd be ready in an hour.\n\nWrong again. After trusting them to call in my prescription twice now, I went to Walgreens around 12:30, only to have them tell me that it hadn't been called in. So I had to call the office a FOURTH time now, and get them to actually call my prescription in.\n\nStopwatch forgot to cancel the RX at CVS, so I had to call CVS for them and ask them to cancel that prescription so that my finally called in RX could be filled at Walgreens. I got my kid's medicine at 1:30, after sitting in Walgreens for an hour for a prescription that was supposed to be called in and picked up. My sick kid fell asleep sitting up because of how long we had to wait.\n\nDragging my sick kid all over town and having to wait multiple hours because of Stopwatch's errors makes me positive that I'll never use this Urgent Care again.
