In closing, it took 19 days to do two hours worth of work.  I was never notified nor updated.  When I picked up my lawnmower the only greeting I was met with was your total was $284.80.

They were getting a shipment at that exact time.\nNormally a business will get the product on the shelf before they consider it in stock. These guys sent someone to get on the truck and find as many options for me as possible. They had every blade I could use. This was the first set of blades I had ever purchased. Instead of trying to \"sell up\", they taught me what each set was for. They wanted to make sure I was well informed on my blades. I asked them why and they said \"Knowledge about your purchase will make you a better owner, and you will take better care of it because you now have skin in the game or so they say.\"\nIf you want the full  old timey correct customer experience, Fredricks is your place.

They said that they would have someone come out to pick it up and that they would call the day before they were supposed to pick it up (scheduled for today 4 Oct) and give me a time. They were also supposed to call the day of pick up to let me know they were on the way.\n\nStill haven't received a phone call and it it currently 4:21 pm. They close at 5 pm.

I would be happy to sit down with you and go over what was replaced and what warranty options you have.  Of course this would require this to be a legitimate review that has actually done business with us. Having only 3 reviews all of them one star and hundreds if not thousands of miles apart seems suspicious.
