Went in for something super simple and can put with an even bigger problem. I purchased a windshield wiper arm. It was confirmed that the arm was for the year and make of my car. I asked if I could pay extra for him to put it on and he agreed. He wasn't able to put it on claiming that it was becuase I needed a nut. I noticed that the wipers were no longer working after he tried putting it on. He claimed the wiper motor was not working. The wiper motor was working completely fine prior to him touching my car. I took it to my trusted mechanic and it was confirmed that not only did the wiper arm Hammett sold me was NOT for my year and make car, but he also tore my wiper transmission when he ripped the arm off of it. Prior to me even going to Hammett, I took it by my mechanic to confirm what was needed. It was confirmed that I only needed the arm as the wiper motor and wiper transmission were perfectly fine in great condition, I had also driven the car in the rain the day before and the wiper worked just fine. I called and text  the guy who damaged the car and sent photos and I have yet to receive a response. Do not only did i pay $40 for an arm that doesn't fit my car (Oriellys Auto Parts confirmed that the Hammett arm was likely for a 2003 not a 2008), but I also had to pay $75 for the part Hammett broke as well as $75 for a brand new arm from The dealership. This was a $40 fix that ended up costing me $190! This is a real review. I would not suggest taking your car or buying any parts from this company. The honest thing to do would have been to at the very LEAST reimburse me for the arm that didn't fit the car. I gave them that opportunity by calling and texting prior to this review and I didn't receive any response back.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPpTCHuu-CePVv-YXiLx8J980jtxWAtSiqVGX6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a24f244bcf02b:0x42810f229b40e283"}

With vehicles whizzing past so closely that our car would rock and the battery so dead that the hazard lights stopped flashing, we decided to google tow trucks near us and Mims popped up with a 5-star rating and very close. Even though it was Sunday, the owner, Scott, answered our prayers and arrived in less than 15 minutes to haul us somewhere safe. One of his drivers volunteered to work on Sunday to tow us home. Thank you, Derrick. I should also mention that Mims price was $120 cheaper than what the insurance company charged. We HIGHLY recommend Mims Wrecker Service! Very Professional! Very Courteous! Possibly saved our lives and definitely saved our wallets!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ec779516503a7:0xff4d33531f49382a"}

The tow truck the police called out to pick my truck were nice and quick, But when they asked where I wanted them to take it to, they seemed a little bit annoyed that I wanted it to go to my home, as I wanted to talk with my insurance agent first. I suppose they prefer taking them to their place or a body shop.\nWhen they unloaded my truck, a good bit of the plastic from the headlight and grill fell out on the tow truck, And the driver just brushed it off into my yard where my truck was sitting. I didn't think much of it, I'd just clean it up in the morning when I went out to take pictures to start working with my insurance.\nI talked to my insurance, They told me because it's a newer model truck,  That they would have someone from their salvage provider come pick it up, I believe it was 3 days later when I got a call from a lady from IIA or IAA, saying that she was about to be giving a driver the information to come pickup my truck and verified my address and the damages with me.\nNot too terrible long after I spoke with her and said ok to having another tow truck company come out, Joey actually called me when he was roughly 30 minutes away from my home to verify my address and that everything was ready to go. He showed up just as he said and came to the door and got me to explain why he was there, And actually gave me the rundown on the process of what would happen if progressive did or did not total my truck. I handed off my keys to him, He went and got  his truck from the street and backed it in to where he'd be able to load it up. Before he backed up into the location, he did ask me if I had septic in the area (I I didn't)  He said he always asks when he has to enter a yard,  Said he's never had a problem with accidentally finding a tank but really didn't want to have to make phone calls explaining a problem!  LOL!\nHe got down under my truck and did his work with some chains, Put it in neutral to wind it up his truck and chain it down. Now, this is where I became surprised,  He picked up every piece of plastic and debris that had come from my truck and put them in the bed. I never asked him to!\nI asked why he did and he said he wanted it to be just as if he and my injured truck were never there. I'm still amazed that there a people that have that mindset.\nWe talked for a few more minutes as he finished loading and chained my truck down, I asked where they were out of and he gave me a business card with everything on it. I'm in Chilton county, So it's not feasible for me to call a company that's an hour plus away,  But he told me that you have trucks all over the place at any given time, And to call if I needed help, That you might be right down the street!\nAs I said early on, I never thought that my best experience in this headache would have been the guy that picked up my truck and towed from my home to Progressive's auction yard. It ended up being totaled,  But I'm loving my new blue f150!\nThank you to Joey and Hank's!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1580148883770, "text": "That is so amazing to hear, Brian!

They told him they would be there in no more than 45 minutes. 1 hour later, no word. He calls them back, they say they took another job and would get him as soon as they finished. 3 HOURS LATER, my husband is still stranded and calls them for the third time. They end up telling him he may be better off calling another company. God forbid what would have happened or how long my husband would have waited if leaving it up to them to follow up on a service they accepted to begin with. Y'all are clearly in the wrong business, and people can be seriously hurt or have personal things in their life that an be SEVERELY affected by your negligence and lack of consideration. Thank God they weren't on their way to work or something pressing that required a timely arrival. Lesson learned. I will be sure to let AAA know to never assign this business to my tow jobs again, and I would recommend the same to all of you, unless you want yourself and loved one's to be stuck out in the middle of the night with no help or in the blistering Alabama heat. Spread the word, Hank's is not a reliable service and should not be in the business they are!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bd05ac4e36e53:0x8633b0c9de398db7"}

I had never heard of a release so I called the claims department and they said they have never heard of that. I called Till's and spoke with a lady who was extremely rude.

We went back and forth for a while and she finally said they will have the car there by either the end of the day or first thing in the morning.  I told her we need it done today because that is what they said they would do. With an attitude she hung up. I called back and asked her what was her name and she asked why do I need to know that? I said because I want to talk to someone about how you just talked to me. She said with a little laughter.. I'm the manager it doesn't get any higher than me. I said there is an owner right. She said yes but he is not in and that goes through me too. I said well I will keep calling up there until I speak to him because he needs to know how you talk to customers. Shortly after Ken calls and states the same thing. They never got instructions and I told him that was not true. He said they need a release and I said ok send me the form and we will get it sent over. He said we just need her to call us and tell us where to take it. If he had said that this morning she could have called earlier.

I was never called by anybody this whole time. I initiated every call and was on hold nite than i can tell you. My partner, who drove 1.5 to come get me googled tow services near us and R&R came up. She called while I was just hanging up from the useless supervisor with AAA. It was now 6:30. Rayson said he would be able to pick it up the next morning at 8:00.\nAfter the experience I had with AAA, I was a little skeptical. He said he would call at 7:30 the next morning.

He called at 7:27.\nIt\u2019s about a 1.5 hour drive so I got there at 7:50\nHe got there at 7:55.\nHe was kind, professional, concerned, on time and VERY reasonable.

He went above and beyond to help me figure out what was wrong with my car instead of just towing me to a repair place.  He helped troubleshoot and found that my battery was weak and jump started the car to make it driveable. He told me what diagnostic tests to ask for at an auto parts store in order to determine if the battery was truly the issue and then offered to follow me to the nearest automotive parts provider. He did this and actually walked into the store with me and spoke to the gentleman behind the desk to make sure they had the battery type I might need in stock, then waited and went with the store employee and me to see how the tests came out (it was a bad battery)before he left.  He was compassionate without being condescending. A most excellent person.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1570064343228, "text": "WOW...Thank you Ms Holley!

After getting the motor in it was knocking called and talked to a lady who said owner wasn\u2019t in and he\u2019ll give me a call back, he never called me back. I called a couple days later and he answered I let him know what was going on and he said you only have a 30 day warranty, when in fact my paperwork states I had 60. Thank god I had kept the receipt. He told me I had to fill out the warranty paperwork and present receipts. Ok no problem but on the warranty form it states that the timing belt needs to be replaced, this engine has a chain. He informed me that regardless belt or chain it\u2019s all the same. Well I got some news from you buddy there not, a chain shouldn\u2019t have to be serviced under normal conditions, a belt yes I agree it does. But if the motor is knocking that has nothing to do with it. This is a fair warning for anyone purchasing from here he will not refund your money and will think of any way possible not too, and he uses the square app which makes things much harder to get a refund through your credit card. But I am happy to say after over 8 months I have received my refund and hope this guy flies out of business and really feels it.

When I got there and tell them the problem they took the tire off and said my valve stem was bad and charged me $20 to replace the valve stem. I thought all was good, woke up Tuesday morning it was flat again. I called & spoke to Chris who told me that it was more than likely a cracked rim and there was nothing he could do about it. Today...FRIDAY, I took off work to take my car to Fortners. They first told me that the tire was the wrong size. Then when they got it off the rim they showed me 4 plugs where the tire had been repaired 4 times, previously. For $30 I got an almost perfect Firestone tire, that was the right size with alot of tread.

There were only two employees working at the time an I guess they got overwhelmed because more people were in need of service; mind you I was the first customer an they should have been working on my car, but the guy kept stopping to help other people that had pulled up. So finally I had enough an asked the guy to please finish with my car, because I had to go rest before getting on the road (at that time I had been there close to 2 hours). So he did, an I was on my way. We made it through Montgomery without any problems, an then I was awaken by a loud noise, screeching tire sounds, and the sight of my front driver tire rolling away parallel to my truck, heading towards the grassy median. By the grace of God we were not hurt. The inside of the rim was shredded, the bolts were gone, the studs ate up. All this was caused by the a negligent employee that didn't properly tighten the bolts to secure the tire. I spoke with the owner about getting help, but none was offered, an he even tried placing the blame somewhere else.

I chose D and D Automotive at random because I was in the middle of nowhere and had zero clue about my surroundings. I am so glad I did.\n\nAfter my insurance company got me safely to their shop via tow truck, both Mr. Gary and Joe helped diagnose the issue (it was in fact the alternator), explained the repair to me, checked on me several times (mind you, I was in their shop for close to 6 hours with no where to go), and were incredibly knowledgeable about their trade.\n\nI grew up around cars and can tell pretty quickly when people are in this business to rip off those in need and I can say, without-a-doubt, this shop genuinely cares about their patrons and those they serve. They could have *easily* waited to work on my car the next day but they were immediate in their desire to help and get me back on the road.\n\nI could not be more thankful for their help and cannot recommend them enough.

She said that both of the tow drivers were busy at the moment, but that she'd call to let me know when one was on the way.\n\nA short time later (about 10 minutes or so), one of said drivers called me directly and let me know that he was about 15 minutes away, but that he was on the way. He arrived just as he said he would and got me loaded. While driving to my destination, he gave me an estimate that was surprisingly lower than the first company. He and I talked the entire way. When we reached my destination, he did some calculating and his original estimate was spot on. After lowering the car onto the driveway, he even helped me back the car into the carport. I wasn't able to compensate him for going above and beyond, but the least I could do is keep my word and write a review.\n\nFrom start to finish, my experience with Tony's Towing Inc was great.\n\nEllis, if you're reading this, I enjoyed our conversation as well and appreciated the advice.

There were no signs when I parked my car and where I parked that morning. I never left the office until I got off at 5:30 my car was towed. I walked to the tow lot which was in some backyard of a home and had to pay $125 for them to move my car a block (from the corner of the art center to behind soul bowls). I explained my situation and it landed on deaf ears. I work just like they do. To make a living for the holidays to provide for my loved ones, just like they do. But they exploit a contract with the city and told me that either the city would have to pay for it or I would. They in no way care who you are what your situation is or have any epthany. I reluctantly paid but will be taking my case to the City of Fairhope. Regardless I will have a better chance with the city than I will at Tony\u2019s Towing. They do not care about you. I\u2019ve had another experiece with them after I totaled my truck and while I was shaken up the police office on the scene called to have it towed for me. Tony\u2019s showed up loaded up my truck and I asked how much it would be he said insurance has it covered. My insurance is liability only and did not cover the towing as he assumed. For them to tow the truck 1.6 miles it cost me $200. I had other options but when I explained this to them again they don\u2019t care. If it\u2019s ever a choice do not use them.  It\u2019s December, it\u2019s the holidays. Have some empathy for people.

I have just gotten the Google account working again.\nParade towing is something Tony\u2019s Towing, Inc. has no control over.  The city makes all signage, they tell us which vehicles to tow individually, and through the city ordinance, they even tell us how much we can charge (which is actually less than it would be for a private property tow).  I understand your frustration, but the police had your vehicle towed, not us.  We are simply a tool exercised by the city.  The reason for the holding yard \u201cin some backyard\u201d is to provide a convenient place for you to pick up your vehicle.  Our main towing yard in across town, which would have cost you a taxi ride and made the experience even less desirable.\nWe are a very empathetic business and have been for nearly 30 years, but unfortunately if we did not charge every person that illegally parked because they have an excuse, we would be working for free.\nOnce again, I\u2019m sorry for the predicament you were placed in, but Tony\u2019s Towing, Inc. did not create, nor exploit your situation in anyway.  We simply did our job."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4076cafdd3b9:0xc5a1101fba675ceb"}

First off its our vehicle and I\u2019ll call all I need to about it especially when instructed to do so by my insurance company. I was belittled and talked to rudely. Our company will not use them again. We also requested our truck be dropped off at home 3 miles from the accident. He said oh no let me take it to my lot so the insurance company will come out faster. Which we let him do and it cost us $2800.00 because they didn\u2019t come out faster and it sat there from 6/26-8/21. I\u2019ll say the lady in the office was always nice when I spoke with her but Jason who I believe is the owner has no customer service skills.

Someone had called an hour after AAA did wanting to know when we were coming to tow their camper. Went through the spiel with them that I didn't have the equipment to haul their camper. I told them a name and phone number of a towing company in town that have a landoll trailer that should have been able to help them. Then another male called me at 1am (i am guessing the one who left the review) asking when we were going to be able to come out during the day to help him with his camper. I went through the spiel again. He kept pressuring me to send him out a truck first thing in the morning to tow his camper. In the end I told him I do not have the equipment to help you and that I was sorry. His reply was I guess you got 8 or 10 calls lined up for all your trucks tomorrow. I said no, I do not have the equipment to haul a camper that size. I don't know what else to tell you. This cold night he speaks of was 65 degrees in a closed down resututant parking lot. And I am not sure what help his son gave him because AAA called back the next day to get it towed. I still didn't have the equipment needed so I guess they got him some other provider to help. I really hate this gentleman is upset but AAA should have found him somebody else to tow it or they should have called somebody with the equipment.

I WILL SUPPLY PHOTOS AND AUDIO OF OUR CONVERSATIONS( from when I picked it up) TO PROVE EVERYTHING STATED HERE IS TRUE! I found Trey(the owner) via Facebook, I always do my research. I saw these reviews, and decided to give him a call, it was a week before memorial day weekend. I can provide all call logs, I told him I have an RV that has a lighting issue that I need checked. Considering I am a first time owner he said it may be a simple fix. I said great when may I drop it by? He said he is backed up and it would really help him out a lot if I could bring it by that Tuesday, I told him that sounds great. He asked that I send him my address and the issues via text before hand. I did. I had to work late and had my cousin drop it off. Please see the photos of our texts. I told him a million times DO NOT BUY ANYTHING for the RV I ONLY want a diagnosis. He took a week, and ended up purchasing: -LP for the RV, Checking the outside, HE BROKE the generator and told me that it stopped working. He even said on audio, it was working when you dropped it off. HE broke the battery disconnect again which was working when I dropped it off. When I went to pick it up he kept repeating how he put me in front of other projects and he needs more time. I explained how he told  me to bring it in on that day because he was behind the previous week. He said well ,.... this that...ect Please see the itemized bill of the charges and work he tried to charge me for that I specifically asked him not to do. I have no doubt he is good at working on more commercial projects,but to try and take advantage of  smaller projects is just not good business. I found another company I would recommend to anyone else who is looking for help, If you drive to him he will diagnose for free and walk the entire vehicle with you! It's Deitz Mobile RV. He does have a few different businesses so his response may be slow, but at least he is honest and up front about everything!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88f541dfde9e7129:0xe6a0cb3d6d31693d"}

We had severe thunderstorms so she made an appointment to come out yesterday (5/5/21).\n1. The tire that was flat occurred because a stump likely nudged the tire slightly off the rim and caused it to deflate. Derrick aired up the tire and it's still inflated after ~24hours.\n2. Derrick and Monique also took my car to fix the fender that was pulled away from the tire and now it looks as good as new.\n3. As we were talking we mentioned our dog recently got into a fight with another dog that came on to our property and it's ears was bleeding and caused a lot of flies to irritate my dog. Monique offered a suggestion as a possible solution to prevent the flies from bothering my dog. We thought we had the product she mentioned on hand, but we didn't. When Monique and Derrick took my car to fix the fender, she brought back the product she had mentioned at no charge. We later put it on our dog and it seemed to help reduce the flies irritating our dog. THANKS!\n\nAnyways, I hope I spelt their name correctly :P\n\nDue to the urgency they wanted to correct the error that occurred as well as help our dog. I highly recommend them.\n\nOriginal Review:\n- i was moving from one house to another so i paid him on pickup and let him towed the vehicle to my other house. When i got home after  i finished getting things from the house I was moving from. I noticed the car he moved had damage near the front passenger tire.  The rear passenger tire was also popped.

Took them days to get back to me after I spoke to another supervisor who said she would call back and guess what\u2026 no call back. Finally, they said the had a new driver and it would cost $1400 with $150 already paid so I would have to pay the driver $1250. After my son already signed a contract for $850. When I asked for a discount for my trouble and extra cost to rent my rental car for another week they told me no. I do not know how this company has such a high rating with the BBB when they obviously extorted $400 dollars from me to get my car to Trenton TX and another $700 for the extra week of my car rental.

Will recommend to everyone.\nLong story short:\n-he helped us with a car which he was given wrong info with\n-he gave us a ride along to the end destination even after he had to drop the car mid way\n- he spoke to the agents to rectify the matter when things got too technical and made them understand the issue.\n- he even connected with the rental to get me a car setup to continue with my journey.\n\nI would have still been stuck in an unknown place without Jimmy.\n\nDetails:\nMy car rental company goofed up and had not returned the key fob of my running car to me. After driving over 100 miles when we reached a rest stop at a Cracker barrel we realized the mistake. Roadside assistance connected me with Jimmy.\n\nI read the review of the company and was a bit weary but this guy is fantastic. I dont usually wriete reviews but this needs a shout out.\n\nJimmy was prompt, gave me a call, took my address and told me that I was second in line and gave me an ETA of 2 hours. Looking up Google, i saw he was around 1.15 away from me and since he already had a job ahead of me, this was fine.\n\nHe even contacted me again after he finished his prior appointment and told me he is on his way with a new ETA.\n\nWhen he reached the car, Roadside assistance had given him incorrect information and my car was a 4wd and not a 2wd.\n\nNote: We still had to head out another 1.5 hours as that was the next nearest rental we had to go to.\n\nHe still tried testing a lot as i was already waiting for 2 hours, and he finally managed to take the car in the car lift. as i had the newer version, and there was no manual, he gave us his 100% to get us on our way.\n\nHe even said, if it was someone else from his team, he would have not even asked them to drive and asked them to head back. I guess seeing our plight, and our situation he gave his everything to make this as good as it could be.\n\nThis was a ride along as well, and suddenly after 10-15 minutes on our way, he realised something was wrong (his instinct was so good, my wife and I did not feel anything on the truck) but he said something is wrong, and as soon as he opened the door, i could smell something was off. (like over heating)\n\nThe 4wd was giving issues. He had to park the car in the side as we could not go any further. he even got connected with another tow truck to help get the car to the location and told us he would take care of it.\n\nHe still got us to the car rental service and connected with the people so that they could give us a new car when this one was not with us.\n\nAll in all, in this horrid experience Jimmy and Absolute Towing were a godsend.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1592241425840, "text": "Thank you so very much for your incredibly kind words.

I did try to get the claim office on the phone immediately at the scene, via the 24/7 \"call and report immediately\" number on the back of my insurance card.\n\nI have the audio on my dashcam for that where I kept trying, and they gave  me the runaround. Everyone I have talked to locally about this seem to not understand why, and honestly I have no idea why either. Once I got to my local branch, we got a claim number. Easy peasy. Apparently I'm the only person who has ever been told \"we're just roadside.\"\n\nI just hope... that now that I have someone's email and direct number, that we can get through this....\n\nNow, on a previous claim, they had NO issue doing a claim when it was something against me.\n\nI also wanted to ask a simple question, but unfortunately, the person answering the phone acted like a full-stop barrier. They kept on focusing on a different claim, and would not even let me speak about this one.... that I FINALLY got started/a claim number for.\n\nI had to waste more time, drive down there to the office, to ask my question. My question had a short simple answer when I got there. It didn't have to be that complicated.\n\nVicki (sp?) always treated me right (within AAA's policy at least), but as a whole, AAA's insurance product just plain stinks compared to other policies I had in the past. Vicki is why I give AAA 2 stars instead of 1. I think she was trying her best.\n\nState Farm, who I came from, even though they accused me of false odometer every year (I work from home), they at least gave me a claim number when I called, and they ultimately covered things in the end, like glass, which AAA doesn't cover at all.  I keep learning of things with AAA that are not covered, or just under-insured...\n\nThe ultimate irony is, the Missouri AAA was sitting there accusing me of the false odometer thing too... the very reason why I left State Farm. I even ended up going down to the Acton Rd office to drag someone out to the car, so they can look  for themselves. On a modern car, you can't fake the odometer reading like you can on an older car... this is a 2017.\n\nSeems like every time I need AAA for something, even if it is simply to update phone numbers, it's unnecessarily difficult.\n\nTrust is important, and I need to be able to trust that my insurance company will handle things without argument, in the policy, and that the policy is sufficient for incidents like this current one.\n\nI'm frustrated, stressed out, and didn't need all that added on to the fact that a potentially uninsured motorist just rear ended me....", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888dc22ad272885:0x2371f9313aac4f4"}

Both days the weather was absolute garbage yet both guys had excellent service. They made a priority getting to me in less than 40 mins on a busy/rainy New Years Eve. Another thing I would like to mention, before i arrived at the shop a person recommended, the wrecker quickly mentioned 'it wouldn't be wise to let them work on the car.' He told me their experience since he knew i had an European import with no dealership local. I ignored his recommendation and through the week i just passed everyday watching it sit in their lot. To make matters worse the shop attempted to pull my leg on a fix they NEVER even completed. Luckily I was knowledgeable enough about the needed repair and called them out to where my money was refunded. Had I listened the first time I would have more money in my pocket in towing expense, however, the second go around it ended up at the right mechanic and Wimmer's towed me out to the distant location without charging me an arm and leg.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccdd7e6b1fec9:0x13f550f98b8676ed"}

His wife was nice and apologized about the whole situation and said we needed to leave before he got home. We removed his light from under the hood and snapped the fuse box back in place and left.

I asked  Kirk the guy working if he could express to the owner the importance of having ALL of their drivers on the same page, and he in turned would not! Three weeks ago the company left a sticker on my car to say the tag WAS visible but needed to be hanging or he would tow the car the next time .  As I told Kirk, the reason it was LAYING on the dash two weeks ago was because it falls down (as it did yesterday) and having it on the dash was the best thing to do. Per Kirk,  if one driver patrols he is ok keith them on the dash but if the other one rides he will tow the car! So my question was to establish that IF THE SIGN FALLS AGAIN since I CAN'T hang it AND I CAN'T lay it on the dash of my car would my car be towed and I charged $250 ONCE AGAIN!!! Her Kirk gets smart and say a well get another tag. It's not that simple as I explained I didnt renew my tag again until next year and I am not going to pay for another tag now and again then.

I did receive an email, and then called the number specified (4/20/2021). I recounted my story to the customer service agent and was told I would receive a call from the person over our area within 24 to 48 hours. I\u2019m still waiting. I haven\u2019t heard another thing by phone or email from management. I don\u2019t really expect to at this point. Just wanted to update so others would not think all of these issues were resolved.\n\nI have used this location for more than 10 years to service my cars and buy tires.  They bought my loyalty by fixing a flat before I was a customer. Today, they have lost me as a customer. One of my daughters took her car in for the managers special oil change which includes a tire rotation. They did not do this service. This is the second car in a month that they did not rotate the tires when getting the oil changed. The tires for both were purchased at this store. Last month, sending my oldest daughter to get her oil changed, not only did they not rotate the tires, they tried to charge her for the high mileage synthetic oil change when she ordered the managers special when setting the appointment in the app. She only gave her information. When she picked up her car, the charge was over $60 for the upgraded service. When her father questioned why so much, they said the app doesn\u2019t tell them which oil to use and they just have to make a judgment call. When he told them that I usually take care of this and to put in my information, they came back and apologized, issued a credit for the price difference, and gave us a free oil change. After what happened today, I no longer trust them to service my cars. I feel my daughter\u2019s were taken advantage of and have warned them that this is what they face as young women. Also, as this is a corporate owned store, I will no longer recommend Pep Boys or trust any Pep Boys location with my vehicles.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1617918643223, "text": "We\u2019re sorry you had less than a 5 star experience.

Maybe I\u2019m just used to the awesome service I\u2019ve received the past 15 years from the fantastic guys in Crisshaven Drive at Express. Unfortunately my husband has been driving my car lately and he didn\u2019t get by there. However, I did receive my car as promised within the hour. I did feel really bad for a lady and her daughter that was told it would be an hour for two tires to be put on and she stated she had already been there longer than an hour when we arrived. I recommended she remind the manager that her car was still in the parking lot and Leland did go get her car and take it into one of the empty bays. I stood at the window and watched as my oil was being changed. I\u2019m not sure the guy that changed my oil was very knowledgeable with tools. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll know soon if he was or not. There was a lot of cell phone action going on with employees and one employee actually let the phone continue to ring up front as he went and found a charger (in the back) for his phone. I will definitely return to my safe place in Birmingham that is fast, efficient, honest and clean. I gave a four star review because Leland said it would take an hour when we arrived and we were out within an hour. But seriously you should be informed of this online when making an appointment. One thing I noticed as did the other lady and we both did not like... I have a 2019 car and when they finally came outside with my paperwork they WROTE (using a ball point pen) on the HOOD of my car. If my paint is scratched I\u2019m going to be one mad lady! I guess I was raised that you don\u2019t mess with other people\u2019s property like that especially if it can damage. Noticed the guys in the back did the same thing (on the other side of my hood) when they were done. Ugh. Not ok with this new car owner.

Even more so on weekends, as they are only there for limited hours on Saturday and Sunday, and then only on the third weekend of every month. They assess a full day storage fee of $25 regardless of them being present at their impound lot to release a vehicle. They also state that it is their right to charge a full day of storage if they bring your vehicle to their lot before 12 am on any day. So if they tow it at 10 pm and get to the lot at 11:00 pm, it is their right to charge your tow fee and a full day of storage for that evening, as well as a full day of storage for the next day, even if you are there the second they open. So for example, if they tow your property 6.8 miles on a Friday evening, you can expect a $150 tow fee and multiple days of storage fees, when you can't even get it on most Saturdays or Sundays. Even if they are there on a Saturday or Sunday, sometimes they don't inform their answering service. This situation happened to me, though they only charged me for 2 days of storage. They informed me of this information and these policies while indicating I was lucky, because they could have made it worse. Just understand their tow policies before you hire them to recover your vehicle. In my situation, they towed my stolen motorcycle after a thief wrecked it, subsequent to a police pursuit. This is not a scathing review, and they to the best of my knowledge did a great job towing.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d482ffe9a4e85:0x29f0f5cf329aa52"}

I spoke with you to let you know that I could not get the problem to show itself and that you could pick up your vehicle.  I am sorry that I was not there when you arrived to get your vehicle. I told you to bring it back by the shop when it was giving you the problem and I would be more than happy to drive it again without charge as sometimes the problem will not show itself.  I was trying to help you and not take advantage of you as had I charged you more and serviced a transmission that is already having problems it would not fix the problem and could possibly make it worse for you.  I did charge you a diagnostic fee for the time I took to test drive your car and to scan it for problems. I am sorry that you feel your car was not moved.  I can assure you that in fact it was moved. As in the email my wife sent you we do value our customers and would have liked an opportunity to have made this right or talked further with you.  We did speak to our employee for not making the ticket note that a diagnostic fee was what you paid $75 for. Sorry for the delay in response as we usually are not checking online reviews. This was brought to our attention by Google. Again, our deepest apologies.\n\nMike"}, "gmap_id": "0x88926ef73ff8ed89:0xb716e49d4f6fffb8"}
