The cost is $5 and the tour is about an hour long. I found it to be a fascinating glimpse into not only Weeden's life and art, but also the early history of Huntsville and North Alabama. Like many private museums, Weeden house has had to branch out to make ends meet so they rent the place out as an event venue as well. This means that Lynn, their lone employee is stretched rather thin as tour guide, event coordinator, curator and hostess so you should make an appointment for the guided tour.
