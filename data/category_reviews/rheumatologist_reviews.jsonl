A lady by the name of Jordan was, this ladies name was Gloria! When I confronted her and told her NO MA'AM you were not in the room Jordan the dr and myself were the only 3 people in there that day, she put le on hold and later came back to the phone with a different attitude, but informed me that my Dr was out of town and guess what HE HAD NO FILL INS..

I was referred by my oncologist which is not in Dothan, AL. They ran basic test and blood work on me and I got a call saying nothing wrong with me, and they pretty much dismissed me. I was left with no answers at all, yet my oncologist still felt I had an autoimmune disorder of some sorts that kept getting looked over. I pretty much gave up . Then an issue came up and I had to go see an ENT Dr. In Enterprise. He tried hard to help me but it wasn't something he speicalized in, my issue was with my salvia glands.So the ENT Dr. Did the next best thing because he knew there was an issue but out of his scope of what he specializes in, so he sent a referral to UAB in Birmingham,  AL. So I went and within the first 20 minutes they pretty much told me what they thought was the issue, an autoimmune disorder . So he sent me to their lab for blood test and he didnt stop at the basic test which all did come out negative as he figured they would he kept running more and more and just that easy he found the issue and a special blood test that most do not ever run came back showing my issue. I was seeing a good neurologist here in Dothan after a horrible auto accident and he looked at my labs from UAB from my patient portal and he DX me on the spot and sent a referral back to Dr. LaCours office for them to tell my neurologist that they had seen me and I tested not having anything and unless there was labwork saying different they had no reason to see me. Before they are willing to see me they want to see the lab work from UAB.  I am sorry but no thankyou, I don't wanna see a doctor that I have to try to prove over and over to whats wrong with me, not my fault you couldnt find it when another did. So after 2 different doctors refrring me to Dr. LaCour they still need me to prove them different.  Nope no thank you whatsoever I am still under the care of the ENT specialist at UAB and I will just let them refer me to one of the rheumatologist there at UAB and I  will keep driving to get good healthcare from doctors who seem to care. I only rated this Dr here Dr. LaCour with 2 stars because the Dr. himself was kind and did listen but his staff are the ones who has said I needed to prove it. I will not beg for them to accept me as a patient when I finially am getting answers that they obviously couldnt provide themselves earlier this year. Good luck Dr. LaCour because I have heard amazing things about you yourself from years and years ago,  but your staff needs to be conpletely replaced. So that you can become the Dr. you once were.\n. Thanks for Nothing..and BTW  yes I do have an autoimmune disorder that has been proven now with UAB and my neurologist,  its called Sjogrens syndrome,  and I am unsure yet if I have Lupus  which Sjogren's most the time comes with either or Lupus or RA. I am awaiting UAB to do a biopsy and get those results as well to inform me about the possibility of Lupus, since a test did come back showing possible Lupus and I have had Dr.s thinking for the better half of 20 years that I had Lupus!!! So AGAIN as a Dr. that specializes in autoimmune disorders your office failed me BIG TIME!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892937b3efb1f17:0xc436c6fdfc2d309f"}
