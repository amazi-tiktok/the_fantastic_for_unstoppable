From the beginning, the women that work there were very short and snooty with us, especially a young girl that worked at the front at the desk with short brown hair. Her nose was so far in the air, I don't even know if she knew what earth looked like. I got the vibe of \"I'm better than you\". No one is better than anyone no matter how much money you make, or what you wear, or what you do for a living. We haven't really had that many issues except a few. First of all, we own a dog. A well trained amazing dog. When we saw the house at first, the carpet was terrible. There was a huge black stain on the carpet in the living room and it was coming up at the seams in some places. You could tell the carpet was cheap and old and quite frankly plain nasty. They (owners/tom west) refused to replace the carpet because we had a dog. Also, the kitchen tile was terrible and in some places of the house, you could tell needed to be replaced. Second, We called Tom West a couple months back about a bed bug infestation. When we moved in, we had noticed little bugs a few places, but in the lease agreement, it stated we were to take care of pest control, not realizing they were bed bugs. We did not have bed bugs at our apartment and had verification from the previous landlord. We never called until about a year later when we couldn't get rid of them and they refused to pay to get them removed after we had tried just about everything. Its laughable now because we are moving out and they are still going to have to pay to remove them. Also, in the moving out procedures, you have to pay to get the carpet cleaned. They want me to have that cheap, stained carpet to get professionally clean knowing they are probably going to remove it anyways. We brought our newborn into this home thinking this could be our home for a bit, and now we are moving out 7 months later because it's just what's best. Over all, I would say the company is ok, but pick them last if you have to. When I rent again, they will be last on my list of companies to go through just mainly because of customer service and not taking care of their customers the way it should be and maybe it has a lot to do with the owners of the property as well in which case they need to be realistic as well.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892927d935f424d:0x3aa0af9aa07a070d"}

The project involved demo of some existing kitchen cabinets, replacement of a cook top and stove with a range, replacement of a vent hood, installing new kitchen lighting, laying tile, painting cabinets and bookshelves, painting trim, and painting walls.  All of this was handled by David's crew without having to sub out any work. The quality of the work done was really top-tier.  We used David's decorating consultant, Lindy, to help pick out colors, and the result has significantly brightened and beautified the two rooms where we spend most of our waking hours.\n\nWhen you undertake a project that takes this much time, you quickly realize that you have invited some strangers into your home for a lengthy stay.   Well, the guys David sent did not stay strangers for very long.  They were cheerful, friendly, and helpful to us.  They added, without cost, some features to the project at our request, even though these features were not in the original contract-- for example, installing a dimmer switch in the kitchen, replacing flood lights in our dinette area so they would match the color put out by our new kitchen lighting, cutting out the trim along one wall of our living room so our bookcase could lay flat against the wall, and installing wall outlets in our bookcase.  They cleaned up after themselves every day and hauled away their own trash.  When they moved furniture around to do some painting, they always put it back where it had been.  It got to where we enjoyed having the company at our house.  At the end of the job, we were glad it was completed, but we were sorry to see the guys leave.\n\nAll the work was done with great attention to detail.  They found and installed tile to match our existing kitchen backsplash tile.  They worked on our project every weekday for three weeks.  On some days, they worked on our cabinet doors and bookcase at their shop, but on the days when they did not come, David always called us to let us know they would not be there and what they would be doing that day.\n\nWe will certainly call on Lisenby Construction if we undertake new remodeling projects.

As we were very particular about many of the items wanted and design, Ken helped a lot and was very patient in getting those plans on paper. We made many modifications, making this quite a challenge, i.e. room dimension changes, enlarged porch, special outlets placements, door placement, gas line placements and house position on the lot in order to have the view we wanted. At times this became perplexing when, initially, there was confusion about initial design and follow through with change orders (plan changes made prior to construction).  As Clay came on midway through our project, he was great in getting all the changes incorporated into the house and reviewing/explaining how other items we wondered about could be better done, and, at the same time save money.  Clay did not just stop in and review, he spent multiple on site visits to accommodate us, our schedule, and many of these meetings involved hours, not minutes. As a result, we got what we wanted and feel good with the follow up provided by Americas Home Place and Clay's on site management.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c949818401a3b:0x71f3e22fe8c6f04c"}

We began working with building consultant Ken Jackson at the Opelika office and signed our contract in December 2019, rearranging those house plans to meet our needs to build on Lake Martin. Ken was knowledgeable and helped us tremendously, quick to answer any question we had or make changes we desired. Paula Avery, Sales Assistant was most helpful in our colors selection. On February 27, we signed our Final Design Plans. We had no idea what delays we would meet when the pandemic hit in mid-March but we were assured by Sam Mitchell our Project Manager, \"you can expect some minor delays but overall we will still complete your home in a very timely manner.\" Then a straight-line storm hit and trees were down all around our subdivision which caused a delay until power could be restored and roads could be cleared. Lots of unforeseen delays, delays that were frustrating, but Sam did a great job of clearing the lot and building the foundation during a pandemic. Communication during the foundation process was less than we expected. When the foundation was completed at the end of May, construction was turned over to builder Clay Chason. From that time, we began to \"see\" the progress, lots of progress. Clay was quick to answered every question and checked in with us almost daily. We quickly learned that his decisions were inline with ours. We feel AHP used quality materials and workers. The subs seemed to arrive promptly. Some of our favorite people working on our house were Noe Reyes and his crews, as well as Matt Pickering and his crew. They were very friendly and respectful of our home and property. Some of our least favorite subs were the sheet rock crew and the electricians, we feel they were disrespectful by littering and tracking/leaving mud everywhere. Clay made sure the messes were cleaned up quickly and all work was completed in a timely manner. Clay Chason made the building experience very easy for us and he kept a close eye on our budget, we actually came in under budget. Would we build with America's Home Place again? Definitely! Especially if Clay Chason was our builder!

Ken and Kara were very helpful allowing my wife and I to customize any of AHP's standard floor plans and picking out colors, fixtures, flooring, etc. to make this new home the way we wanted it.  We were very pleased with the pricing Ken worked up compared to other quotes and estimates we had from other local custom home builders.\n\nBeing an engineer and raised in a family that worked in construction, I had many, MANY questions during the build process and I am sure I was a very challenging customer.  Chris Barrett was a GREAT Project Manager and oversaw the entire build of the home.  Throughout the build, he always was quick to return calls or emails, send pictures and kept me up to date on what was going on; as I was out of state during this build of our vacation home.  AHP broke ground mid September and the completed the build and handed us the keys to our new home by the end of December.  We were VERY impressed with the 3.5 month build time when we heard many horror stories of custom home builders in the area taking over a year to build a home with weeks going by of nothing happening; often struggling to find subcontractors available to complete their parts.  AHP builds enough homes every year that most their \"Sub's\" do a lot of work for them regularly and will even travel to the job site from quite some distance to keep the higher volume of work AHP offers them.\n\nConsidering the price AHP charged, the overall quality of the home they built and the time it took them to complete the home, we are VERY satisfied.  I am sure we could have found a custom builder to build a more expensive home, with more expensive components over a much longer period of time, but for what we wanted for a vacation home, I think AHP was the perfect choice of a home builder for my wife and I.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFdcMeWJP_Nxrbz_hhvhS3_-be_mCZ_vC8Ou0=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1FriJXIvwCEzh3BZMazEfL8U-z_OCHXPI0s4=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO48Ho5UhPzgjya0EWjkyNZy0zh9E9fHaDKQIg=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKQ8XAiCvPwcbQjCSzgkLSJ5hEHosD6CSpf_8=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDU0ONq8DG54tasRVe_w7On2fYfG7HdfEYIcQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaEXkEPx3SPMw_k7eSCvzML6IQ759snFduCgo=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNFrArHAThlKJrj0aCFjk-YZLhLWlU_Vz15Iw=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c949818401a3b:0x71f3e22fe8c6f04c"}

We visited and spoke with home builders all across our area and none of them could match the service and support we received from AHP and their staff.\nWe started our process with Ken Jackson who worked extremely hard and diligently to meet or talk us through each step of our home buying process. He gave us numerous options and helped us stay within our budget. At no point did we feel pressured or coerced to make any decision and we were given all the time needed to make any adjustments before our home started being built. Ken was an excellent avenue and provided support and suggestions which lead us to making our dream home a real possibility.\nOnce the home was being built, we were fortunate enough to work with Sam as our site manager. Sam has been the most prompt with responses and there has not been a single time gone by where our phone calls have either been unanswered or unreturned.

Everything started out OK, working with Ken and Kara picking out the house, colors, fixtures and everything, but then things came to a screeching halt. They took a large down payment and sat on it for 5 months while I was paying interest before they even broke ground. I went through 3 project managers before Sam and had to be on the job site at least 3 -4 times a week to make sure things were being done right, I should have been put on the payroll as the project manager. The Subs that were hired to do the work were very good, the issue was getting the correct and the correct amount of material on the job site, thus holding back subs and adding to the time to complete things. Finally Sam showed up and things started happening, we worked well together and were able to get the house completed. By the end of the project the quality and house overall exceeded my expectations, just wish it had gone a little smoother in the beginning. I would do this again if I could work with Sam, he is customer driven, honest, dependable and a pleasure to work with. A note to AHP, you should take lessons from Sam on how to build houses and treat customers as well as involve the project manager in the beginning to insure questions about the build can be answered timely and accurately to eliminate misunderstandings of what's being  sold vs what's being delivered.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c949818401a3b:0x71f3e22fe8c6f04c"}

They helped with understanding the process, customizing our floor plan and getting things going.  Knowing that we would be living in our camper with a newborn, I was anxious!!  We got the approval for the loan and started clearing the land.  Our builder, Bill Addison, knew our situation and was more than helpful.  Doing all that he could our house was built in record time (a month).  I was on maternity leave so I had the pleasure of being able to visit the job site daily.  He answered my questions and was here daily to ensure everything went well.  We have been pleased with the house with minimal issues (GFI outlets going out).  There has not been a time that we haven't been able to call AHP/Bill and they've been able to assist.  We are faced again, with selling our beloved home.  The house is almost 4 years old and the inspector said to us \"this is one of the most well-built houses I've seen in a while).  With the few things he noted, we were again able to enlist the assistance of AHP to rectify.  We have no idea where our road will take us, but we are definitely going to be building with AHP again.  Through it all, we've become great friends with Bill.  We admire his dedication to his work and the detail of building homes.

I've have tried calling their sales office, I was told to call corporate, I called corporate and got voicemail.\n\nMy house is about 4 years old.  Well out of warranty.  But, most of the poor workmanship appears after the warranty period has ended.  My master bath and entrance to our master bedroom has severe structural problems.  The cracks you see have been re-plastered and painted more than once.  Forget about doors closing properly.  The doors have been trimmed to such an extent that a new door will be required for the bedroom.  The framing issues you may have will not be covered by your warranty and will not appear until a few years after you own your home.  Once they do, you will find yourself spending a lot of money to repair.\n\nIf framing were the only issue, I probably would not write the review.  I never do this kind of thing.  But the electrical was done so poorly that it nearly burned the house down.  The left exposes copper to aluminum high voltage line exposed in a junction box.  The result was blowing out the double oven's control panel.  This resulted in an expensive repair to the ovens, but could have easily resulted in a fire.   Again-- the kind of thing that happens well after your warranty period has expired.\n\nThe problem I have with Woodland, is that their \"quality\" is only skin deep.  They have a great marketing staff, but once your in your house and a year has passed you are on your own to deal with the poor workmanship that lies just below the surface.  No builder is perfect.

The sub-contractors don\u2019t keep up with their warranty repairs and Woodland doesn\u2019t follow-up with you after closing unless you are constantly in contact with them. Check my review of Custom Interior Trim to see just how their subs act and treat customers.\n\nTheir warranty team is an absolute joke. They don\u2019t follow-up, they don\u2019t coordinate, and if you aren\u2019t keeping them in line, they just let your items slide off the radar.\n\nThey have shown a complete lack of professionalism ever since we closed. I will admit, we love the house itself. It\u2019s good quality, the design process was fun, and we felt like the options they had to choose from were exactly in line with what we wanted, but the worst mistake I ever made was trusting that they would continue their great service after having closed on the house. If you don\u2019t listen to anything else, just hear me when I say do NOT let them close on your house until they finish everything. It has truly been bad enough that I regret ever choosing them as a builder, no matter how much we do like the house itself.\n\nAnd again, if I\u2019m being completely honest, the staff that they have are nice people. I mean I have legitimately enjoyed dealing with most of their staff, but I\u2019ve also had to do their job for them. I have to do all of the follow-up to make sure people are showing up to do their warranty repairs. I\u2019ve had to coordinate with the warranty department and the subs to make sure they had all of the correction items listed.\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting dealing with Woodland and their lack of support for Warranty customers. I\u2019ve told them this multiple times, but if they would put just as much care into how they treat and deal with Warranty customers as they do with new customers still in the building process, they would be a nearly flawless business. Until then, they deserve this negative review and more. I\u2019ve spoken with multiple people in my neighborhood who can corroborate this story and would say the same thing themselves. We have warned people we know away from Woodland specifically because of this and away from some of the specific sub contractors they use. Horrible customer service, dismal professionalism, and a demeanor that says \u201cyou as a customer don\u2019t matter to us as much as the new build customers.\u201d", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1617991364735, "text": "Blake,\n\nThank you for the kind words regarding your home building experience with Woodland Homes. We are happy to hear that you had a fun experience and enjoyed our process of building. Next, we would like to say that we understand your frustrations with warranty. We are in fact struggling with time lines and subcontractors. At this time North Alabama and surrounding areas are experiencing a housing boom. This combined with the struggles of building a product in the midst\u2019s of a global pandemic have made it difficult to obtain products for some of our customers warranty requests.\n\nIt is also difficult to keep subs motivated when they have so much work to choose from in front of them. This is just the honest truth, and the reality of the world we are living in.  That said we understand it is frustrating to wait on your items to be completed. While it may take us a little longer to complete a warranty item we are getting to all of our customers and completing their warranty requests. In fact, we have even extended specific warrantable items past the agreed upon 1 year term in order to ensure our customers are happy, and have their items completed .\n\nSince we don\u2019t know your full name there is no way to reach out directly. We would encourage you to call your onsite sales person and get them involved to assist you, or even call our corporate office and ask for the president of the company. He will be happy to work directly with you."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626897a1fd8d25:0x85114f992ebfd966"}

The personnel in the home office were welcoming and professional. During the build I hired a home inspector who found major errors with the home. This information was relayed to the site manager and many of the errors were overlooked and I\u2019m still dealing with them. Upon walking through my home I found basic issues with the craftsmanship that should\u2019ve been addressed by the site manager, if he had completed a walk thru of the home. Once the home was complete a final walk thru was scheduled. I found the same issues as the last walk thru. At this point, if you don\u2019t address the problem it\u2019s often overlooked. I refused to sign for the keys. As a buyer I felt rushed to sign for the keys to the home, that wasn\u2019t ready. I was promised the issues would be addressed in a timely manner, \u201cI\u2019M STILL WAITING\u201d. I still have a page of outstanding issues with my home. As a premier builder I expected more. The subcontractors provided poor quality of work. No disrespect, but the attention to detail lacked, for my home. I hope no one has to go through what I did. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s due to the number of homes Woodland is trying to build or is this the standard issue with Woodland across the board. I didn\u2019t want to come off as a complainer, so I asked around my neighborhood and many of us shared the same problems. This is not to bash Woodland. The homes, cosmetically looks great, I think more effort needs to be made to build a better quality home for the price and oversight of the subcontractors is a must. If this doesn\u2019t happen hold the site manager accountable. The warranty department shouldn\u2019t make people feel like they are the problem. The subcontractors need to do their job and provide a quality product. If I had to do it all again I would definitely ask around the neighborhood where I\u2019m buying and meet one on one with the builder.

It actually defies logic that I could desire so much to live there, be impressed with what I saw, and have the experiences I have had. Maybe it is coincidence but I don\u2019t think so. I will simply state what happened and let the reader decide. I have seriously looked at Woodland homes 4 times. The first experience was positive but I was afraid of the road in and out of the area so I decided not to buy. The last 3 times I had resolved that fear and wanted to purchase a house from Woodland homes. The first of these three, I spoke with an associate. He showed me a lot and gave me a price for a home on the lot. He said we had to see his boss. I did so and she literally panicked. She said he gave me the wrong price. I said ok and left. The second of these 3 times, Woodland homes sent me an email with an advertisement for a house already built. It was priced in the range we were looking for. We made an appointment with the aforementioned realtor and spent 30 minutes looking at the home. It had one feature we did not like but we were about to make an offer when she said oh no, this house has been sold. She added, but we can build you one like it on another lot. We spent a couple of hours looking at lots and found 3 we liked. She said she would send us the prices on all three. The result was that the lot we wanted was not available for the house we wanted to build on it and the other two had prices that were 40 to 50 thousand dollars more than the one we looked at. Not exactly the same price...The last time my wife met with a different realtor and got prices for several models one of which was built and the other almost completed. You have probably guessed what happened. I showed up with the checkbook only to find that all of the homes with quoted prices were much higher than documented on the plans provided to my wife. The one we really wanted was about $70,000 more. The other home already built was about 40,000 dollars more than documented on the plans.We left and will not return. The neighborhood looks great and maybe our experience is some kind of odd anomaly. Just wanted to share it.

However, if you are looking for top quality and attention to detail, you would be better off with another builder. They build homes quickly - maybe too quickly as evidenced by some of the problems we have experienced.  After living in our home for two years, a light switch in our dining room which was not in use at the time suddenly sparked and popped and caused a breaker to blow.  I called an electrician who discovered that the wiring was barely connected which caused arcing and sparking.  He then checked a few more light switches and outlets to find that about half of them were loose and sloppily constructed.  I ended up paying for the electrician to inspect every light switch and electrical plug in my home. I have also had to replace wiring in the electrical box because of a humming noise.\nWhen you build a home with Woodland, they schedule you for a one day marathon of dealing with the contract staff and their design team.  You must be prepared to make ALL decisions in one day.  Their design center has a limited number of choices and you have no time to research products. Don't assume that they offer quality products, either.  Price Pfister products were their plumbing choice at the time I built my home. Huge mistake.  If I had known how crappy this brand was, I would have insisted on Delta products. That goes for wood floors also.  I chose a \"premium\" product for an additional cost only to find after it started denting and scratching immediately that it was made out of a soft eucalyptus based engineered wood.  I have already replaced half of it with a nice Hickory engineered wood that has held up beautifully- even in high traffic.\nI was not happy with either their ceramic tile selection or carpet choices but had no option other than to pick what I disliked the least.  Apparently, most of my neighbors did the same because we all have the same back splash.  I have already replaced carpeting in my bedroom because of poor wear.\nThis is not the first home that I have had built so it is not like I was expecting perfection.

After being in our house for 2 1/2 years my floors are pulling apart (all of the down stairs I can put quarters between the cracks), I have a leak around my chimney(all the silicone is cracked), our HOA is now going to be responsible for a 400K loan which was used to build a pool and clubhouse (sold as part of the amenity package), the back half of the neighborhood is now front entry garage all because Woodland can and will do these things to make a buck and does not care once you have purchased the house.\n\nAfter speaking with someone at Woodland about the leak in my Chimney I was told to contact the people they use to install these but Woodland would not pay for it. At this I asked why and was told \"if we fix yours and word gets out we will have to fix everyone's\". I now have damage in one bedroom and all my insulation is wet.\n\nAs for the floors the only response I get is Wolde put those in and from Wolde I get Woodland rushes us to put them in before they can acclimate to the house.
