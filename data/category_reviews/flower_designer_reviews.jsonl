Now picture this that baby is a  still born. Did your heart just break? Ours did in so many ways! I would NEVER do a bad review because I also am a business owner. Rules change when a business just flat out doesn't care and I believe it is time to take action. As a business owner in the fashion world I deal with brides a lot. If my staff makes a mistake and sends out a bride the wrong shoes, I personally will take action to fix it. A wedding is a very crucial time for a woman and if that means I have to come out of my pocket to next day those shoes, I will! if that means I have to go out in the hot warehouse and pull those shoes, I will! I will move heaven and earth so I make sure that bride has a special day! The reason is that day is planned and can't be moved.  Now, you are in the flower business! A mother has a still born baby! A whole family is crushed! You would think that a business owner would also move heaven and earth when a mistake is made. This is another crucial day that can't be changed! This business acted like it was NO BIG DEAL that this banner wasn't made in time for this baby's funeral. It was also said that they couldn't deliver the banner to the funeral side. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? As a business owner I would of driven it out there myself! I would of been so sincere on the phone, and made the banner myself! I would of called other customers and explained that their flowers may be late due to a heartbreaking situation. I would of hired on extra staff or stayed up all night to make this banner. Each time my friend called the owner was RUDE to her as if she was bothering her! I am sorry but this is so unprofessional on so many levels! To own a business is to own up to mistakes and FIX them ASAP! After many phone calls we finally got a banner and it is TACKY and UGLY and honestly I could of done better myself! Shame Shame on this business owner! If you are going to take on the responsibilities of a business you should always put customer service FIRST! So I would suggest any bride or anyone who may have a special day to think twice before putting your special day plans in this business owners hands. Maybe this owner needs to take some classes on how to run a business professionally. To learn customer service and how to treat people who are sensitive to make their day easier not harder.

I asked for a $40.00 item. $40.00 was my budget, not 44.\nI was a Winn Dixie around the corner just minutes before and saw flowers there for under $15.00 with better quality but they didn't have something what I wanted, so I went with this florist (I'd been there before with a friend, so I felt I would get something nice).\nI never gave this sorry excuse for a $40.00 bouquet to the birthday recipient, I was ashamed to! Normally florists put their stickers on bouquets etc. - there was no such on this thing, and no wonder - I'd be ashamed to pass these out to the public, too! I kept it to show my referring friend this disaster. I took pictures when I got home.

I, along with my parents and even my grandparents, have used them for a number of occasions over the years. We often used them in Student Council at DHS as well. However, I won\u2019t be using them again going fruther.\n\nI currently live in a different city, but I recently called Simpson\u2019s to inquire about having flowers sent to my mother for Mother\u2019s Day and had an encounter with a employee by the name of Anne that left me dissatisfied. While she might have appeared quite polite by her tone, she came across fairly condescending when I asked if they might be delivereing on the day of the holiday this year. I consider it extremely poor customer service to make any customer feel as if their questions are unwarranted, especially if they\u2019re legitimate. Many florists do deliver on Mother\u2019s Day even if they are normally closed on Sunday because it\u2019s a popular holiday for flowers. She even infomred me they themselves did previously deliver the day of Mother\u2019s Day, but no longer do. So it couldn\u2019t have been that absurd of a question.\n\nPreviously, I had no particular preference for either Simpson\u2019s or their other main competitor in town, but going forward I will be doing all of my business with their competitor. It\u2019s not only important to sound polite when interacting with customers, but also it\u2019s just as important to connect and be personable when engaging with customers.

I feel that I should be able to pick out  a picture of the flowers and container that I would like to purchase, pay for it, and have it delivered. When I order an item, let's say a new chair,  I can see a photo of the  chair and know what I am paying for ,and when it arrives it should be the chair I ordered. I don't like paying for something that is NOT what I ordered. While I understand fresh flowers may need to be substituted the arrangement should resemble the photo. Flowers should be similar and the container should be exact.  A container should not be in a photo on the website if it is not \" in stock\". This is false advertising. Each individual florist probably doesn't have what is pictured on the Teleflora websites.\nI called the florist and expressed my concern and followed up with an email with pictures of what I ordered and what was delivered.  I ordered a beautiful sturdy white wicker basket with flowers and what I got was a cheap multicolored Easter egg basket. They substituted the basket and after I complained they were willing to offer me a credit of $2.50. What a joke!  I will not use this florist in the future for any reason and will never use a site that is managed by Teleflora. My thoughts are that the Teleflora company has way too many florist and they do not know what each flower shop has in stock. So when you order from a site like this one, you NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO GET. BEWARE. I wish I could put a photo on this commentary. I paid $45.73 for something that was NOT what I ordered.  Here is the response from the florist:\n\nThank you for your recent order. We pride ourselves on delivering the best, most fresh and most similar arrangements that we can for our customers and we have been doing so for over 38 year in the Shoals area! I am very glad you were pleased with the flowers that we provided for you and your mother.\n\nIn response to your recent request for a 50% refund here is our answer:\nThe basket chosen was unavailable and a similar value was substitute per our substitution policy.\nWe were also instructed to call and leave on the front porch if no one was available. Which we did. Our standard policy is to call and if there is no response, and no one is home, we leave a message as to where the flowers are. Since we were instructed, by you, to leave them, they were; only after a phone call was made. Had you not told us to leave the arrangement, and weather was not good for our arrangement, we would have left a message detailing where the arrangement could be picked up.\nAlso, you did not order from a 3rd party person. You placed your order on our website, which is managed and updated by Teleflora. They are our wire service and website managing team. They have thousands of florists that they service and we all obviously have different items in stock. They do a generic picture, and when a picture is chosen we try to fill the order as best we can with the flowers we have on hand at that particular time. Flowers are very seasonal and have a high turnover because of spoilage. Next time, a  call directly to the florist could save you a substitution since you would know immediately what they had available at that time.\n\nAs far as using another florist, they would offer the same substitution policy as us, so I don't know that you would've been happier.\n\nSince you were happy with the flowers provided in the arrangement and they were Pretty and Fresh I can NOT offer you a 1/2 refund of the product, being as though you were please with it. I will however refund you the \"basket\" charge since you were not pleased with the substitution chosen. I will be adding a refund of the Full container charge of $2.50 to your card. I hope this helps.\nThank you for your business.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d4eb6ed4ce74d:0xf4773df3daae3fbb"}

This made things much simpler and smooth on our planning end. The moment we walked into our reception hall, both of us were in complete shock of how beautiful things were. My husband and I did absolutely nothing at our wedding reception, other than to enjoy the moment and actually get the chance to mingle with our friends and family. We even got to enjoy our dinner with family, and have cake! We are so grateful for that and will forever cherish these moments! Corrie did a fantastic job, and took this event under her arms as a true professional that she is in this line of career.

We did not receive what we feel we paid for at all and believe there was some time mismanagement which led to many things not being done properly.

Jerry at Bishop's Flowers is the Expert when it comes to anything related to flowers and plants. When you need anything from a corsage to planning the arrangements for a wedding you really need to go to Bishops Flowers and talk to Jerry. His years of experience in the industry is evident in everything he creates. He has a keen way of listening to what you want and delivering something that is so much better than you could have hoped for. Maybe you are looking for something unique and special for Valentines Day, or you are planning a wedding and have a vision of what the bouquet will look like and what arrangements you want for the ceremony. Don't trust just anyone to make that vision a reality, trust the Experts. Jerry will listen and take your ideas and deliver something that will blow you away. How about service after the sale. Bring your bouquet back to Jerry and let him heirloom it for you and turn it into something you will have forever to remember that special day. Bishop's is not your ordinary florist, they don't just sell you something and move on to the next client. Jerry will also educate you on the best way to care for your new creation so it lasts longer than you would ever think possible. He will make sure you know what your flower arrangement needs to stay as beautiful as it is when you pick it up for the longest amount of time.

I walked into this shop looking for some flowers and hoping for a delivery. I even offered to pay more than asking price for a delivery. The delivery really wasn't so much of a concern as it was getting an arrangement that I was happy with and would be meaningful for the person that I was sending them to.\n\nFrom the moment I walked in I was made very aware that they were about to close. Since I knew the flowers I wanted and they had them that made quick work of that portion. Being that I'm not a florist and I am a male I don't know all the things that make up a floral design, but I do know what looks pretty.  I was asked if I had a budget,  To which I replied not necessarily I just want something that looks pretty. The owner said how about a $100.00 and I said OK fine.\n\nWhile he was putting together the arrangement I asked if perhaps they gave any discounts to military service members to which he replied no. I continued to ask if they gave discounts to various other organizations that I belong to such as the Chamber of Commerce and others to which he replied in emphatically \"NO\". Now, at this point I was really just trying to make friendly conversation so I made a couple of friendly jokes about not having discounts, on which he became irate and said he was about to refund me my money and take back the arrangement.\n\nI just find it appalling that people can be so rude and have no sense of friendliness or humor whatsoever, especially in the time and day we live in where businesses are hurting to make money and I'm spending my hard earned money there.\n\nHe even went so far as to ask if I gave discounts in my business. I told him that in fact yes I do, all of the time. I wasn't really looking for a whole lot, 10% or something close to match an online competitors price which happened to be about $20 less. I don't know why it was unreasonable to ask for a small discount to show a little appreciation to any local organizations I belong to, much less for service to this country. I was appalled by his short and rude tone, especially after he told me he was the head of North Alabama BNI. You would think someone in this position would know how to run a business with not only some poise but also some friendly customer service. As long as I am a resident here I will never spend another dollar in this establishment and I'm not telling anyone not to do so, but I will say that if you spend money there, no appreciation is given for it and I might encourage you to find some other businesses that may appreciate it a little bit more.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b4a33bc76c7:0x31492a699a9db552"}

The free tossing bouquet I should have received for signing a contract within two weeks of the initial consultation was not delivered.

I was sold immediately on their product! I\u2019ve since ordered from them several times. I buy their whipped shea butter mostly - it\u2019s creamy without being greasy and a little goes a long way! I\u2019ve also purchased their products for gifts - needless to say, my mom and grandmother are now hooked! While this review/comment is based on my experiences with this company on a whole, my most recent experience, specifically, is what encouraged me to form a review for the public. I recently placed an order for two of their gift boxes and a couple of single items. The order contained Mother\u2019s Day gifts for my mom and grandmother. The order was received, processed and delivered PROMPTLY - like within two business days (I didn\u2019t pay extra for expedited shipping). I received a text alert when the product was delivered - around noon, yday. It was quite warm outside and I still had hours before I\u2019d get home from work. I was a bit worried about the product sitting in the heat/sun. As soon as I got home, I unpacked the box. The way it was packed so carefully and with consideration was a plus, BUT I also noticed that there was a Koolit refrigerant pack placed in the bottom of my carefully packed order...packed in anticipation of a warm day and no one being home to receive the package once it arrived. This may seem like a small thing. This may seem like \u201ccommon\u201d sense and good business practices, but as someone who does a LOT of online shopping, I can assure you that many businesses don\u2019t put even a fraction of thought and consideration into packing their product for delivery. 1818 Farms has a lifetime customer!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88627d3f82d38f73:0x9815b0297e8927dc"}
