I do hope she is doing ok from the interaction with the man.\n\nAnd I am sorry to put it so plainly, and I don't mean to be unkind, but how are you even sure that you know who I am and what exactly is the issue I needed to address?\n\nHow are you sure that you were in the building at the same time I was - because a man who comes in 2 or 3 times a day happen to be there?\n\nI don't believe our interactions are the same because you just informed me you wouldn't give him any coffee, but when I walked in he did have coffee, which led to the series of events that brought me here.\n\nHowever, if you were there at the same time I was, as you assume, then you already know my complaint because you witnessed it happen, and perhaps do not believe it is warranted, and that really is all I need to know.\n\n(When responding to the next Guest's concerns, please let them tell you what it is before assuming you know what the problem may be and volunteering a response -- once again, I truly am not trying to be rude - which is what delayed this response to find the kindest way to put it, because I have no desire in arguing with someone over the internet. I only reached out this way because it seemed the most professional and I work in the same industry and thought you as a owner of a new business would want to know.

What you missed about the incident was that the man started getting angry, yelling, and lunged at my wife in a violent manner.  My wife was simply talking to him.  I ran there to stop him from becoming more violent and I was about to call the police but he calmed down after I spoke strongly to him.  After he calmed down he asked us for free coffee, we always give him free coffee when he stops by (sometimes he stops by two or three times a day).  I said no coffee because he was angry and mean and told him to leave.
