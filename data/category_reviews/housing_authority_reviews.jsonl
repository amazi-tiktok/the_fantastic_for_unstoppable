We aren't allowed to have a bedroom lock nor bathroom lock, which means my toddler can walk in on us having sex. They never give you dates in advance on when things are going to be done. They rushed around last year in a frenzy to make things look \"good\" for the HUD inspection, but if they would had kept up with their maintenance all year then they wouldn't be having to rush and do their job and inconvenience the tenants. I caught a maintenance man in my purse one morning when he came to change my filter. I called him out on it even and he lied even though I seen him with my own eyes! I also have had several pieces of lingerie missing and so has my neighbor. No use of complaining about that because it's my word against theirs. The mowers have also put 2 chips in the windshield of my car and they are refusing to pay to have it fixed because the mowers are \"under a contract\". I have a career with and know all about gov't contracting and this place is breaking many rules.
