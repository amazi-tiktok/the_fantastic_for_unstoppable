I called this place because I just heard of it, it actually sounded cool honestly hearing that they answer ANY questions you may have. But that was not the case. I called the place waiting for someone to pick up and then after a couple of seconds this one lady (who is actaully very rude) answered. She wanted to know my question and I told her the question that I had. Then she hung up. Afterwards it became a call hangup battle, it was very weird. after that she answered. I told her \"why are you hanging up on me\" and she said \"you probally aren't asking an appropriate question\" And I told her \"But I heard this place answers any questions\" and she said that they don't do that and hung up on me again. And then I tried to call again and it took awhile but then she picked up again I told her that \"If you don't answer questions how come Matt Lauer the host of The Today Show ask a question live on air and asked \"What is Barbie's full name?\" why is that?\" and then she hung up AGAIN! It doesn't make sense! This place is a shame this place does NOT answer questions and it's a lie. Like I said I dont recommend calling, all it is is rudeness and lies. It's not worth it.
