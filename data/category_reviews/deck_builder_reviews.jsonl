They did a drainage project for me where I explicitly described the design I wanted and it incorporated solid PVC pipe.  On the day of the job, the workers showed up with corrugated pipe.  When I called the owner, he stated that PVC would be $800 more, so feeling like I didn't want to start over with another contractor, I told him to go ahead.  Then I found out that a portion of the water to be drained to the street running from the downspout  was going through perforated corrugated pipe (pipe with holes).  They assured me that the water would be moving and would not leak out into already saturated ground (yeah, right).  Then I came home to find that the grate to catch water coming off the sidewalk was about 1 and a half to 2 inches away from the sidewalk, requiring the water to run over dirt before entering the grate.  The owner tried to tell me that it would be no problem and the bare dirt would not erode despite water constantly running over it.  I insisted that concrete be put between the sidewalk and grate to keep the water from washing out the dirt.  When I came home, I found they had used a type of caulk between the grate and the sidewalk, and had done a messy job of it, I don't know if that much caulk will ever cure.  After two days it is still soft.  Additionally, where they cut through the curb, the re-concreting was extremely poorly done.  It looked like they didn't even use a trowel, much less a curbing tool.  It looked like they basically packed the concrete on with their fingers and left it.  Part of the contract called for doing a brick border along the sidewalk.  After I paid them for the portion of the contract for the drainage, they informed me that they were waking away from the contract and that I needed to find someone else to do the edging.  The pity is, the subcontractor they had lined up to do the masonry work actually sounded very competent.  Bottom line, this is a company that, in my opinion, cut corners at every opportunity, poorly designed the project, provided shoddy workmanship, and then walked away with nearly half of the contracted work unperformed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626519de7ef85b:0x4b6cae1b92594858"}

I contracted with them to do drainage work, a sprinkler system and landscape lighting.\n\nI was told this would take 3 weeks to complete, with each phase occurring on consecutive weeks. The project as a whole took almost 12 weeks to complete, and this was only because I hounded them with calls multiple times per week.\n\nThe drainage work was the first part, it seemed to be fine, though the French drain was not placed the complete length that was discussed originally. Also the fingers of river rich were put in to stop erosion, but almost no grass seed was put in afterwards, so nothing but weeds grew in between the river rock.\n\nThe second piece was the sprinkler system. This was put in during a day, but the ground was not backfilled properly and they needed to come back out to fix it. We were told that they would put down grass seed after the lighting job was completed. The lighting work was not completed for another 8 weeks, and there wasn\u2019t any seed put down afterwards. They were also supposed to aerate and oversees the lawn, but since they could not get their mower into our backyard, they told us they would come back with a smaller mower to pull the aerator later. This never happened.\n\nI had to call them 2-3 times a week for 8 weeks to get them to complete the lighting. Part of it was landscape lighting, the other portion was putting in a fan and spotlight in/on our screened patio. The wiring was placed so shallow, that it came out of the ground within a week and they had to come back to fix. The light and fan was supposed to be put in by an electrician, but was just put in by the owner and his friend. They put a cheap conduit over the electrical wire that didn\u2019t even cover the wire.  They sent an electrician out to fix the wiring, but he just rigged another kind of conduit on the bare wire to cover it up.  The uplighting for the trees was sold to us at $65 a light. I just found the lights online for $45 for a 4-pack of lights.\n\nWe just gave up with this company and figured we would just be stuck with this work. Over the last year, I kept burying and covering up the wire as it came out of the ground and have been trying to repair the grass in the area where they did sprinkler and drainage work. We are still fighting massive weeds from the lack of follow through on planting grass after their work was completed.\n\nI am writing this review today after I just finished replacing 3 lights that stopped working and half of the wiring that was put in for the landscape lights. Turns out they believe that wire nuts are not necessary and you only need to tape wires together with electrical tape before putting it in the ground.\n\nIf you are looking for a company to do landscaping work for you, stay very far away from this company. You will only be sorry if you choose them.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1533529694432, "text": "Thank you for bringing all of this to our attention.  Unfortunately scheduling can be a challenge when dealing with different elements and sometimes issues arise.

The ceiling fan was installed by a certified electrician, as was the wiring for the fan, flood lights and outdoor switch.  We would be more than happy to provide the name of the electricians that provided these services.   The contract states that there is a year warranty covering defects in workmanship and materials.   Is regrettable that we did not have the opportunity to fix the issues that you were having with your lights, thus alleviating some of your frustration.

So after we disposed of the \"fly-by-night\" guys (is there some unwritten rule that they all have to wear blue tooth head sets?) I asked around, got bids from 3 contractors and decided on Thompson - professional, price competitive, responsive - all the things I was looking for.  Immediately upon signing, I was given the nam of our  Project Manager and he held our hand guiding us throughout the lead-up and then the actual installation day.  I have never seen a crew so large yet so professional in my life and was impressed to say the least. 07h30 they were at the door and by 16h30 we had a beautiful new roof, the site was carefully \"policed\" for stray nails and other detritus and they were gone.  The next day Keith (our PM) came back to make sure things were done as he expected followed by our original \"salesman\" (that term is so inadequate) Kyle coming out the following day to walk the roof and the grounds and write up a final \"punch list\".  And within 24 hours we had been visited once again this time by a small set of the original crew who knocked out the punch list items in under and hour and then were gone again.  We are extremely pleased and would gladly recommend Thompson's to anyone else looking to replace a roof - large or small.

I went outside and saw what appeared to be a couple shingles missing.  I searched for contractors and was impressed by the reviews Thompson Roofing had received.  I put in a request for contact.  Thompson Roofing was professional from start to finish!  Scott came out to inspect the area and provide the estimate.  He did a thorough inspection including providing pictures and video so I could see the issue 1st hand.  It was quite a bit more serious than a couple shingles missing.  He also patched the roof so it would not leak anymore!  He followed up with a detailed estimate spelling out exactly what they would be doing!  I accepted the estimate and a few days later two great young men - Sammy and Jamie - came out and took care of the job!  From what I could see they did an excellent job  I figured I would receive the bill and pay, and I would be happy with that.  It was much better than that.  I received a follow-up call to see if I was satisfied.  On top of that Scott called and scheduled a walkthrough.  He came out, climbed back up on the roof and took pictures of the final job and provided them to me so I could inspect the job.

I was informed the entire job would take 3 days.  Equipment issue occurred, and work stopped.  Day 2 (6/19)  Remainder of fence taken down, then the next problem.  It was originally agreed existing posts would be extracted and new posts installed to avoid damages to sprinkler system.  Their removal system was not working, so I agreed to let them saw existing posts to ground level.   Day 3 (6/20) Remaining posts set and cross beams are up.  Work to begin installing pickets but no pickets available.  How can you have a job scheduled, know lumber needed,  and not have purchased in advance?  The company had received half payment for job.  Day 4 (6/22)  Pickets have been purchased,  Sprinkler system has been damaged and needs repaired.  Company paid repair.  The gentleman sawing the posts to the same height of the top of fence was not as tall as the 6\u2019 fence.  This resulted in posts being sawed off at an angle, and numerous adjacent boards were marred because of the chain saw.  In addition, boards were split, some boards sawed into, and others were installed without using a level.  I had 2 gates installed and neither were up to the standards that I expected.  Day 5 (6/23) Finally the finish line.  My wife noticed a couple of small things that needed attention.  The supervisor was not very receptive to her concerns and seemed agitated she would question the workmanship.  We felt they were rushing to get to the next job.  I could not stand over each employee to see that the work was being done properly.  This falls under responsibility of the job supervisor.   I raised these issues with the rep.   On June 25th, rep came out and inspected  issues in question and agreed our issues were not to their company standards.   On a text dated July 7th, I was assured these \u201ctouch ups\u201d would be taken care of and owner had approved necessary repairs.  Almost two weeks later, the crew came out to make  repairs.  They should have known materials needed for this appointment, but once again, the needed materials were not in their possession.  I told them \u201cno problem\u201d, get the lumber and come back in a couple of days.    I texted the rep after they had gone to inform him of the problem, and  was told it would be rescheduled in a few days.  After several texts to reschedule, I finally heard back on July 31st.  I was then informed the \u201ctouch ups\u201d were NOT warranted, and no further action from the company.  So, for 24 days I was misled regarding the repairs.\nWould I recommend Helena Fence and Deck?  NO.\n1.\tYou do not know if they will be on the job early enough to finish on time because they must get supplies for the day\u2019s work.  If the stores do not have the needed materials, then your job will be on hold until store is resupplied.\n2.\tYou would need to inspect all the work as it is being done, because  lack of follow-up to repair any issues that are discovered after they have gone.\n3.\tOne of the supervisors on job is not receptive to suggestions, therefore making it difficult to communicate while the work is being performed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888926dcf8bf1f31:0xc1ffcc421e2949be"}

I first met with Craig Blair on April.  He gave me a quote that same day.  He was very patient and was definitely not in a hurry to leave, even though it was late in the day.  He answered all of my questions.  After I thought about it for a while he came back another afternoon to answer more questions and show the demo window unit to my wife.  Again, very patient and in no hurry to be anywhere.\n\nMade down payment in April.  He said they would install in early June.  That is exactly what happened.  The install took only three days.  They started on a Wednesday and finished on a Friday.  The install crew consisted of three guys.  They were extremely polite and cleaned up their mess each day.\n\nThere was only one major issue.  There were streaks and smudges on every window.  It looked like some kind of sealant that was not cleaned off during the manufacturing process.  I met with the lead installer on Friday morning and pointed this out to him and asked that he clean the windows.  He was very condescending and obviously did not want to clean the windows.  He said he would but I knew he would not.  I went back to work (my wife was home but said she would not enforce the window cleaning)\n\nThe project was finished when I got home Friday afternoon.  The windows looked great but . . . You guessed it.  There were still streaks and smudges on all the windows.  Not wanting to be a pain, I tried cleaning the windows myself.  The sealant was very difficult to remove.  It would not come off with glass cleaner alone.  I decided this should definitely be Blair\u2019s responsibility.\n\nI asked for a meeting with Criag Blair.  We met the following week.  He was very polite and patient.  He agreed to have the windows cleaned and address a few other minor issues.\n\nIt took a while, and to be fair, I was out of town for a week but we finally coordinated on having the windows cleaned.  The crew that did the installation came back out.  They came while I was at work.  My wife was home but declined to be the inspector.  They finished cleaning about 3 PM.  They waited for me to get home at 4:30.  We walked around and inspected all 26 windows.  There were a few touch ups but for the most part they did a good job.\n\nIn summary, I was very pleased and satisfied with the entire process.  I will definitely use Blair Remodeling in for any future projects.  Craig Blair is the best.  I totally trust him and I know that he will do whatever is necessary to make sure I am satisfied.  Hopefully, Blair will add cleaning the windows to their standard installation procedure.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1567607282328, "text": "Thanks James!"}, "gmap_id": "0x8889163057be33df:0x9d5df5b1f942ec2f"}

It rained that morning but was going to clear later in the day but he canceled.  Said he'd be out the next day or two.  Four-five days later I write and ask \"where you at?\" so he says that he had \"other appointments to take care of after I cancelled.\"  I CANCELLED??  It RAINED.  Ok, says he's coming out again... 10 AM.  At 4:30 he finally gets around to emailing me and says that he's \"running behind\" and not going to make it.

The fence was to help provide a nice private backyard space for us and to give our dogs a nice place to run around.\n\nI started doing some research to see who might be best for tackling this job. I had previously done business with Lowe's and their fencing contractors and was quite pleased with their work. So, they were naturally in the running. About the same time I was talking to Lowe's to bid this out I found a close family friend that highly recommended Reidar and his crew at All Around Fence Company.Within a couple of weeks I had pricing from several contractors but only had my eyes set on Lowe's and All Around Fence. All Around Fence was 2x as high as Lowe's but after speaking with Reidar I thought that they would have a superior product. We agreed on a price of almost $8000 for this and within a few weeks we had a wonderful fence. That's about where the positive comments end.\n\nWithin a couple of months I had boards warping so bad I you could see straight through them. Some of the gates started warping etc. I was starting to question this wood was even pressure treated lumber. I am still not 100% sure on this today. More on that later. Anyways as soon as I started noticing problems I called Reidar and texted him multiple times. After several months I was able to get him out here to replace a few of the boards even though he showed up without my knowledge and then when I questioned whether he had been out here or not he just texted me that it was fixed. Well, some of them were but not all by any means. However, I let that go at the time because I figured I had a two year warranty and I would just wait to see if any more started turning and warping. And sure enough, we had more, lots more and the gates were still never looked at from the previous time. Fast forward to today and almost a year later I am still trying to get him to come out and fix this fence. Upon closer inspection it looks like the boards are placed too close to the ground, and in most cases they are in the ground which is causing them to wick up moisture which is no doubt causing the issues. I have had plenty of houses and plenty of fences and this is the first one we have ever had issues like this.\n\nI understand that wood does some crazy things, but I have never in my life seen wood do this unless it wasn't treated. Remember, I am still not convinced that this is. So, with all of that being said, I cannot recommend this company to anyone. The work is not holding up, he doesn't communicate well, if at all, and it would seem the warranty means nothing. If this was Lowe's I guarantee you they would have already been out here and had replaced all of this stuff, no questions asked. I should have went with them instead because I know they stand behind their product and said they could have done this for $4000 roughly. I paid Reidar and his crew almost $8000 and this thing isnt holding up well at all. All I want is for him to stand behind his product and replace what needs to be fixed so that I can move on to staining this fence even though I am not sure it will help much as I would be surprised if I wasnt replacing this thing in a few years. The funny thing is, the fence at our old house is 10 years old and looks just as good as it did the day it was put up. Lowe's did that one and I spent almost a grand staining and sealing it. I am sure that has made a huge difference in itself but the fact is it just seemed to be a better built fence overall compared to this one. I can fix these issues myself but after paying All Around Fence almost $8000 I feel like I shouldn't have to. I hope Reidar reads this and we can come to a resolution on this and then maybe I can change this review, but as of right now I haven't had any contact from him after trying to get someone out here for almost a year. Again, there is no way I can recommend them at this time. Take your money somewhere else.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888972592b440001:0x5d457fbffc3a7b7f"}
