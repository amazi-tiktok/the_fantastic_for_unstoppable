I looked back to make sure I was even in the right place, but unfortunately I was. They all looked at me which added on to the awkward vibe. Not one of them said a word to me, so I assumed they were waiting to have their eyebrows done. So I just stayed back and waited bc the reviews to this shop were very good so I wanted to see what it was all about. After 5ish minutes a girl get into the chair and one of the other girls starts on her eyebrows. I'm still waiting patiently in the corner when the girl who's fixing the other girls eyebrows says it'll be about 20 minutes before she starts mine. So I'm still like, okay, whatever. Reviews are good, I'll just wait. The entire time I'm waiting there, they're talking about some personal issues which honestly I  probably didn't even want to hear/know. It's been about 15 minutes and the girl in the chair gets up, so casually I start making my way over when the other girl who was on the floor gets into the chair. At this point I decide it's not worth getting my eyebrows done @ this store for the price & lack of professionalism. Needless to say I just walked out & went elsewhere.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1525201453664, "text": "Im sorry about your bad experience here. But in a salon environment people talk and vent about their personal lives sometimes. Im the owner, and the only one who works here and i always make sure to at least greet when someone walks in if im busy. As for the people sitting on the floor, they were young girls, and if they want to sit on the floor and hangout, they can. They were waiting to get their eyebrows done. If i told you it would be 20 minutes before starting on yours, than thats about how long it would take. 20 minutes is much better than going to a nail salon to wait an hour just to have them wax both of your eyebrows off. But im glad you left, since you feel that theres so much wrong in here. I don\u2019t need your negativity in my business. I charge for my work and talent, not what you think i should charge. I am very professional and respectful with my clients, but im also a human being who makes mistakes. I am sorry i did not meet your high expectations, but I guarantee you this, you would have been more than satisfied with your eyebrows. Thanks!"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a0fe9f46c7589:0x16e2ec78440d08ea"}

We first went in for her bc she had one plantar wart on her foot. They cut it open (to do the nitrogen freeze treatment) but then it just spread like wildfire. We went to this  dermatology office several times over several months and the problem just continued to get worse. I kept doing exactly what they said to do  (religiously, every day, and very carefully) and it wasn\u2019t helping. So I called Dr. Stewart\u2019s office and explained our situation. He said it was the worst case he\u2019d seen in a child and gave us our options. He told us he could laser them off that very day and she could leave his office that day without any more warts on her foot. This option was never given to us at the other office (probably bc we never got to see the actual derm- we always saw the nurse practitioner and i don\u2019t know if they are able to do the laser). Anyway, my daughter was so scared but his staff were all so kind and wonderful and helped her so much to be brave and feel comfortable. Dr. Stewart then did as promised and gave us good instructions on what we needed to do to care for it after we left. After that he followed up with me from his personal cell phone several times to make sure she was doing ok and to guide me through caring for her. He did a fantastic job and she no longer has to deal with the pain or embarrassment bc of him and his giving us other options than we\u2019d been given before.

The turnover is high which is bad enough but they will cancel your appointment at the last minute and then when I came in for my new rescheduled appointment I wasn\u2019t even acknowledged by the receptionists. Yes plural because there was 2.  The usual receptionist knows me by face so I guess I didn\u2019t think nothing of it when those two said nothing to me since they seemed preoccupied...one with another customer and the other took a call on her cell and stepped away. I waited 30 mins to find out that my rescheduled appointment needed to be cancelled because the tech had a family emergency and she left. Walked right pass me!  I finally got to my breaking point and acknowledged the 2 ladies and they had no excuses that made any sense. One of them said she thought I was someone else so I guess we all look alike to her but ok and the other one said with all honesty she simply said you are right we said nothing to you. She was the one who took the call on her cell. Ok so the only wax tech that was still there had I guess turned her wax up and said she could wax me but I needed to give her wax time to cool or I could reschedule again. I opted to wait another 15 mins to let it cool. I must say she was good and this my first time with her but she was actually super nice and I apologized for getting rowdy to her that is just how good she was. As I was leaving the 2 ladies in the front wanted to offer me something for my inconvenience but I got prepaid wax passes so there no credit that could be given so they opted to give me samples which I took cause no one has ever given me samples at this place. It\u2019s sample though so I dunno if that is something spectacular. I asked for a number for management and they said that the manager would have to call me. That\u2019s been a month ago and no call but my $121 pre paid wax pass payment just hit my card again today.  I see that isn\u2019t being rescheduled!  So I said all this to say I might be calling the number and asking for a manager again and getting funds reversed because I can not keep coming to a sinking ship.

Awkward ...overpriced and unsure of the experience of the technician (this place charges twice the going rate in our area and the service is not half as good as the other places!)\n\nWhen I arrived the check in process was a little intrusive. The girl at the front desk wanted to see my driver\u2019s license? I\u2019ve been to several spas and had many waxes and never have been asked for a copy of my drivers license. That seems a little extreme for a spa service? But okay. I go to the restroom before my appt starts and when I\u2019m walking back to the waiting area someone calls out my name from a room ..It was my technician (first visit at this place and don\u2019t remember her name)? I felt like that was forward (but not so much so that it ruined the appt). However, then I step into my room and the technician tells me to undress from the waist down that she will do my brows first then my Brazillian ?!? So I don\u2019t have a choice in this and have to lay there EXPOSED while my brows are being done?!? Not only that she didn\u2019t go anywhere! She did not leave the room for me to undress and just stayed in there!?! That\u2019s not typical. Every place I\u2019ve ever been (and I\u2019ve been to many saloons and spas) has always left me in the room to undress then they would come in. More so  than that I\u2019m usually given something to cover up with until the service is needed in that area (unless it\u2019s just a Brazillian that we go straight to). I did not like that!! It was strange and the technician didn\u2019t say a word while she was working which makes things even more awkward!! Oh except for the \u201cshave shaming\u201d as if that\u2019s the reason for the horrible pain that I feel when my hair is being ripped out of my skin around my pubic bone! Lol ?!? So the technician had a dry personality (looking back she seemed weird) ..I had to lay on the table exposed while my brows were getting done first (I didn\u2019t have a choice in that or wasn\u2019t told I did). Also, she stays in the room while I change!!! And when it\u2019s over she stays in the room waiting for me to get dressed!! There was absolutely no concern for privacy or customary respect and boundaries. I much prefer the other place that I go (Marci\u2019s Hoover). The prices are better. The experience isn\u2019t creepy weird or demeaning and my technician is friendly and speaks!\n\nOh and heads up anyone who gets a brow wax, the technician removed all of my make up then waxed my brows! I told her that I prefer that she just get the strays outside of my make up. My brows are thinning and I have a particular shape that I prefer! That was not respected at all!! There is NO need to remove the make up first of all. (That\u2019s just some personal preference of the technician). That should be the clients choice! We should be able to change without someone watching us when we arrive and before we leave!! There\u2019s no way this place will stay around much longer if things don\u2019t change! Why would anyone continue to pay twice the price for a worse experience!? It\u2019s a strip mall wax place just like Marci\u2019s ..only they advertise like it\u2019s some type of luxury saloon. It\u2019s not..thank goodness they didn\u2019t try to sell me products or some membership. I hate it when I\u2019m paying for a service and still being subjected to high pressure sales. So that is a bonus. To add to the bad experience my wax took close to 30 minutes! It\u2019s never taken that long anywhere else. I don\u2019t think the technician was very experienced. I also felt it was a little creepy that she didn\u2019t say much at all but that she just stays in the room while I\u2019m changing out and back into my clothes. When I was leaving I felt rushed, she was standing with her hand in the door watching me put my shoes on!! I felt rushed cuz her next appt was there! I mean give a a girl some space!\n\nTo the management: you need to take note of the things I\u2019ve said.

I didn't care, it was worth every mile I drove for her to be doing my hair again. Ambiance is a very nice place and everyone there is very friendly.

After spending years going to different salons getting mediocre results I tried this one out and I haven\u2019t been disappointed yet with my results. I have had some not so great experiences with the ladies at the front counter but I think that stems from my very first visit with them not setting clear expectations. In the beginning I was told that walk ins are welcomed but appointments are recommended. The 2 times I have had to do a walk in I\u2019ve been turned down. Today I had a 11 o\u2019clock appointment and came in at 9 hoping to get in early because I had to go out of town. I was willing to wait and it was a quick wax (less than 10 mins)  so I was disappointed to hear that it wasn\u2019t possible when I come every 2 weeks at minimal. So I canceled my appointment I had for 11. After thinking it over Jessica is the reason I decided to come back. I would really like to get the wax passes which saves alot of money but I\u2019m afraid how the customer service will be after purchasing.

I would recommend this salon to any guy ( or girl ) looking to have their hair done right you will not be disappointed!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889164cb1f7e4bf:0x72e30b83c9cfcf50"}

Price was very reasonable. Everything had been going good until they hired a new receptionist name Clare who clearly doesn't know what she's doing. My appt was at 9a. I called as soon as they opened to let them know that I would be 5-10 mins late due to the severe thunderstorm. (37 weeks pregnant, I'm not going to drive like a bat out of hell all the way across town) Clare said for me to get there as soon as I could & they would work something out. I got there at 915a she checked me in & told me my appt was at 920. I assumed they switched my time since I was late, right? I waited for about 5 mins before Well another guest was checked in & she got called back within 2 mins. Natalie said that she didn't know I was waiting & she had already called her client to the back. I informed her that I had a 10a appt & if they could have me finish prior then I didn't mind waiting. She never came back to the front. So Its now 930a I asked Clare what was the plan (since I sat there for another 5 mins) & she told me \"you're gonna wait another 5-10 mins & Natalie will be with you) Marci had just told her not to switch me around and it would only be 5-10mins. Well it's 950a now & Natalie just came back to the front & they're still discussing what to do with me. But not communicating with me AT ALL! I listened for 3 more mins before I just got up and walked out. I understand that I was 15 mins late, but 1) I called ahead of time to inform them 2) when I got there I was told my appt was at 920a for Mekeia. 3) if i wasn't going to be able to be served then just tell me that . don't have me just sitting there waiting & then tell me what I'm \"Going To Do\" . & not communicate with me at all. Oh I forgot to mention that Clare claims she had my name wrong. Not paying attention to detail, not using common sense, nor providing great customer service.

From the moment I walked in the door, the staff was incredibly kind, professional, and friendly while helping me fill out their questionnaire and confirming my appointment time. The waiting area was very clean. I brought my cardiac alert dog in with me, and the staff was so courteous and understanding! Usually when trying new places, I\u2019ll have to field some access issues - but not here! They were welcoming to both me and my service dog.\n\nWhen it was time for my appointment, Elizabeth came to escort me to a room and was very attentive and friendly. She mentioned giving me some extra time to get my dog situated (he was in a down-stay out of the way for the whole appointment). Little things like that make the experience for me!\n\nShe made sure I was decent before opening the door to come in, and then began by answering any lingering questions I had about sugaring. We talked about the differences between wax and sugaring, and she walked me through how it would feel before beginning. She was so professional and welcoming - at no point did I ever feel any judgement or anything! She made me feel so comfortable and kept the conversation very light and it really felt like I was catching up with a friend. She made sure I liked the results and offered to tweak the triangle I preferred she leave to straighten it a bit more, then offered me some wipes to get any left over sugar if I felt it while redressing.\n\nAt the front, they helped sign me up for the membership - which was a fantastic deal! Instead of being around $60, I could pay $70 and have unlimited bikini sugaring for the month plus discounted other services. I\u2019m currently scheduled for my second appointment and can\u2019t wait! Not only did the staff make me feel more welcomed than I have ever felt in a beauty salon, but the sugaring itself was much less painful and I like how I only need to wait two weeks for touch ups.\n\nWill absolutely be returning!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888919c2e5b5df63:0x76207c17ae34004d"}
