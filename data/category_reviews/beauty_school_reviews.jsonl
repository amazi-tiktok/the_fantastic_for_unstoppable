She was doing a good job at the beginning I checked on my phone when I thought she was done  and then she said they were uneven so she was going to was just a very little more. But instead she waxed a lot without even asking me if it was okay for her to keep going.when she was done she told me to look at them and when I was I literally had just a small line of eyebrows she waxed almost all of my eyebrows and she still left them uneven. When I saw them I just wanted to cry I didn't want to be rude with her so I just went to pay. My sister was so mad when she saw me she said that I shouldn't even had paid but I still did. The lady that did them didn't even looked like she was sorry that made it worse. Now I have almost no eyebrows. I had very pretty eyebrows before. I told her in the beginning I only wanted the extra hairs waxed and not thin. She did the exact opposite. I was already unsecure about myself after my pregnancy months ago. Now I'm so much worse. I was suppose to go out tomorrow for a special occasion now I can't even go because I don't want anyone to see me. I have just been crying I just can't explain how much this has affected me. Now only solution is to get them microbladed, but that can cost more than $200. That may be my only option.

My hair is 50/50 salt & pepper. I asked for an undercut pixie with the top to be lightened and toned silver. I said my original dark color (the pepper) was dark brown. Even though they toned it after bleaching, it was very brassy. I went back several times so they could tone and correct my color.  When I went back, they charged me more money. It is still brassy. I wish they had warned me that it would be difficult to get my hair to look like the picture I brought. I spent well over $100  including tip (I didn't think the student should suffer because the instructors weren't honest enough to warn me).\nThe student cut my hair somewhat similar to what I asked for, but the instructor corrected her and the cut now looks like a fade instead of an undercut. Nobody listened to me. I was clear about what I wanted. I do not easily speak up in the moment, but I am saying something now. Beware this beauty school. They are much more interested in getting their experience and training than whether the customer is treated fairly. And they had the nerve to charge me more for them to correct their mistake. When the correction did not work after 4 visits, they wanted me to come back again and charge me even MORE money. I said no, and that I may get a crew cut.\nI think the student should go to a better school.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1503946693910, "text": "Fran, we understand your frustrations and we really appreciate you bringing this to our attention.

Recently the student was unfamiliar with highlighting and caused the lightener to \u201cbleed\u201d causing an intense and distinctly different contrast to show up on the root and parted portion of hair. They tried to fix the problem by toning this portion. By toning the hair I no longer had highlights in this portion leaving the hair a reddish dark color on the root in contrast to the blond. They offered to provide additional highlights on another visit but I would still have to pay for the lightener. I was told $13. The next time I came within 7 days to have the lightener done to fix the toned area without highlights. It became apparent the learning leaders only add a small amount of lightener to each extra bowl needed to lighten so they can up charge $13 per bowl. I have noticed this in the past. This time I was charged for 3 bowls. The instructor said these extra bowls were not necessary, however the instructor allowed the student to use this amount. In addition to the bleeding mistake that occurred the previous time without proper supervision, I was disappointed by the poor customer service given by the instructors and poor business strategy taken by charging the customer for a mistake that was done under the lack of care by the learning leader. I have recommended this school in the past, but I will no longer do so.

We appreciate your honest feedback and you're absolutely right-we are a school! Our students are all at different levels of skill based on several factors including, but not limited to, length of time they have been in the program and the specific areas in which they excel. You may not have known this, but we have a 100% guarantee and you can always let us address any issues you might have had with your service. Students work on guests because they need the hands-on experience which is part of their curriculum. Students aren't ready for the salon until they have completed their program, hours, and have taken both their written and state board exams. They are then ready to transition to an actual salon. We also have students who are in a program here we call Phase 2. These students must pass an interview and hands-on assessment in makeup, cutting, color and texture. These \"master level\" students are available upon request and you'll be getting a more advanced, driven student that is much further along in their program. However, these services do cost a bit more. All that being said, we have to remember that we are a school, first and foremost. We love being able to offer extremely low (much lower than an actual salon) prices for our guests because our students need the hands-on experience. We can all remember the first time we tried to accomplish something...sometimes it was great, but sometimes we also had a lot to learn from the experience. But with practice and patience, we got so much better than when we started and that's exactly how it is for our students. We hate that you weren't happy with your hair, but we do appreciate the time you gave our student in letting them perfect their craft."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889220e6dada637:0x717f01db2564dcc5"}

I went a few weeks ago and they seemed really rushed and not as personal as in the past. The instructor didn\u2019t check my hair when I was completely done. After about a week I noticed that my hair was uneven and a huge chunk was shorter. I called to see if they could fix it and was told it had to be within 7 days and I would have to pay for a new cut. I was unable to go in any sooner because it snowed and then I had to work the weekend at my job.  I would gladly have given them a chance to fix it but they haven\u2019t taken any action towards making it right. I am saddened by the fact that they messed my hair up and won\u2019t fix it for the integrity of their establishment. I left a message for the manager and have not gotten a response back.

So, to start, let me explain to you that you do not need to spend this much money on hair school. You don't.  The competitors will ALL help you pass the board, which is the ONLY thing they can promise to do. BUT that is not what this review is about. I made the decision to go to hair school almost a decade ago. I went to Genesis in Daphne, and they said they could tap into my student loans, and I wouldn't have to put anything down.  Sounded amazing to me!  So, I'd say about halfway through, I withdrew, and honestly I can say not because of anything the school did.  I needed a closer location to work it out with a full time job. SO, I withdrew and went somewhere else out of pocket.  I eventually started paying on my student loans and all was grand.  More time went by, and I decided to take a 9 to 5 job with a larger salary.  Then I decided I probably needed a degree to get to the next level.  Well, because I've still got a bit left on my student loans, the university I want to go to needs a copy of all the Genesis Career College transcripts.  Not that anyone can use an \"A\" in \"hair braiding\", but they still need the transcripts. Ok, fine. SO, I spend the better part of 2 weeks trying to get someone on the phone.  I find out pretty quickly in that 2 weeks that Genesis in Daphne closed, and the Mobile location's phone is ALWAYS busy or taken off the hook. At this point, I'd have to say the latter.  I call other locations.  They transfer me to the Mobile location, it's busy.  I finally get smart and start blasting them with phony requests for them to call me because I'm interested in enrolling.  BINGO!  A phone call happens in less than 5 minutes.  I tell the girl that I need to get a copy of my transcripts, and from the daphne location.  She doesn't know how to do that, but \"someone will call me\".  Ok, that never happened. I call back, and email.  Finally, someone does email me. He says that he will send a certified copy and to send the address.  Great. I go online and keep checking and checking, and they haven't received it.  I call up to the Registrar's office.  They explain that it may have been discarded because I'm not actually going to be using those credits.  SO, I email the guy back again.  Again, nothing gets received or updated at the college.  I email the guy again, and again he reassures me that it has been sent, but he'll send it again. This has been going on since OCTOBER. October. So, I call around today, and get someone in Lebanon, TN.  He tells me that he had to get the director to look me up, he has no idea what can be done, what I can do, oh, and that I owe a 3k balance.  NOPE.  Oh, because on top of owing student loans, you still owe the school once you leave, but I was actually able to pay off the school in 2015, finally. He says that he's showing I owe a balance to the school, so I won't be getting transcripts anyway.  So, tonight I spent 4 hours trolling through the last 5 years of my bank statements to prove I paid them in 2015.  All because they aren't organized enough as an organization to provide SEALED records to another institution a previous student is trying to attend. Think about that.  They cannot, as an organization, bring up your records of attendance, classes taken, grades, and put it in an envelope and lick a stamp.  Chris from Lebanon says that this happens ALL the TIME.  My reply was, \"Then it is a systematic issue your organization needs to fix.\"  Basically, the choice to go to Genesis Career College was a blunder of a decision that I still pay for to this day, almost a decade later, in ways I did not ever consider.  So when you're in that sales office planning your financial aid, and thinking about your options, please, consider your exit.  I did not and I regret that I did not fully understand the consequences of using financial aid to go to school for what ended up being a hobby.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a43d16120a55d:0x5f5203343575ff5"}

She agreed to return but when she arrived she informed the stylist that she had changed her mind and wanted a refund instead.\n\nThe stylist let Ms.Jimerson know that she was not authorized to issue refunds, which she is not, and would escalate this matter to the manager or owner to resolve it further.\n\nMs. Jimerson refused any further mediation and left disgruntled. She filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau which we are now disputing. At this point, due to her  attempts to discredit our Salon and the unprofessional manner in which she has behaved, we no longer wish to do business with Ms.Jemerson and will not be issuing a refund or a salon credit."}, "gmap_id": "0x8888d8c924293249:0x6976741efe104f0b"}

I called salon after salon and just didn't feel comfortable paying $400+  to do the treatment just because of my coarser texture. I called Salon Lisa Brown and found not only a reasonable price but an AWESOME stylist (props to Jamal) to tame my mane. He let me know right off the bat that it was formaldehyde free, how things were going to go down and what to expect for aftercare. I was FLOORED once he finished the treatment. I looked like a totally different person and he laid my hair from root to ends, straighter than I've EVER had it!  I will be going back in two weeks to have it properly washed to keep it maintained. Here's my recommendation if you want to take the leap like I did and it come out a success! ( If you're in a salon for \"atmosphere\" instead of your hair, it's a cool little place ;) but not the Taj Mahal.)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888d8c924293249:0x6976741efe104f0b"}

Was mislead into thinking a certain hairstyle could be achieved, and later after starting perming etc, it went to something totally different. It was asked if I was ok with my hair being cut, I agreed because this was the plan I came in with. It went from that to the still couldn\u2019t be achieved because of the density of my hair. Once this was stated, I decided to tell Ms. Lisa, I don\u2019t think we should waste anymore time, and just end it here. It went from that to No, it\u2019s going to be cute. Long story short, I hated my hair, I made this known before I left and Ms. Lisa stated that she thought I would like it better once my curls flatten out, Well... by the time I woke up they were gone. When I expressed how much I didn\u2019t like it, she did say they guarantee their hair do\u2019s and I could come back or scheduled another appt and they would fix it, but obviously, I probably won\u2019t be taking that offer up for obvious reasons, So definitely a waste of money.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888d8c924293249:0x6976741efe104f0b"}
