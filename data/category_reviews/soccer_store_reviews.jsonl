I\u2019ve been looking for a Mexico jersey for a while and couldn\u2019t find them in any stores around me in Atlanta or online. So I googled some soccer stores outside of state and I happened to come up on this one. So I called and asked if they had any and he said they\u2019re going fast but he had some. I told him I was driving from over 2 hours away just to get that Mexico jersey and he did not hesitate to hold the jersey for me. I told him I\u2019d be there the next day when they opened. So the next day I left from Atlanta to Alabama (just a little over 2 hour drive). It was definitely worth the drive! As soon as we walked in he was quick to show me the jersey. We also looked around the store and they have a really great selection of soccer stuff. I definitely recommend this store to anyone!
