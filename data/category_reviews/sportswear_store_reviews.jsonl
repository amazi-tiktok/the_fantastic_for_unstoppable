I almost purchased groomsman shirts from them last fall and am so relieved I didn't. I will not so much as order online ever again. I'm in my 30s and was well dressed aside from a necessary Columbia rain jacket and was joined by my mother and younger brother. When you walk in, it feels like an episode of Hoarders. Everything is everywhere. Stacks. Piles. Overstuffed racks. No sense of organization. It feels like an overstocked Goodwill with name brand stickers strewn about. Prices may or may not be on items. Seeing how poorly $80+ shirts are kept in the store is a definite turnoff.\nEven less settling however, was being followed by the staff as if I was going to stuff their items in my small Kate Spade crossbody bag. Should the three of us separate in the tiny shop, there'd be a person on each of us at the snap of a finger--and this is after I found a staff member's cell phone in a pile of clothes and turned it in to them. As we perused, I heard them complaining \"OH. THAT is why they're here. Orientation.\"\nThat's when I rounded up the crew and we visited different stores with organization, fantastic selections, and genuinely kind staff.\nSave yourself frustration, a headache, and money.

Covid-19 became the reality and there was disaster after disaster. We cancelled, replanned, downsized, and resized to accommodate the changing world around us. At the start, I had expert advice and help from Ben who fashioned two outfits for the preceding parties. The styling, the fit, and the attention to detail was superb. If you like things done right, go to Shaia's. But the story continues, for the actual wedding day we had a tuxedo picked out that was being made in Italy. The factory had to shut down due to the virus and in the few weeks leading up to the wedding, I was facing quite the dilemma. Ben called me for a special appointment to come in and see what could be done from what was on hand at the store. Ben and Ken went far beyond the extra mile to make sure I was not only clothed for my wedding, but the tuxedo was classy, comfortable, and contained the right amount of original. I cannot recommend Shaia's any higher. There were even a few other minor disasters with needing a haircut and my brides' dress needing last minute alterations that we took to Ken because he just got things done. This is where you can truly see Ken's kindness. He helped us in a huge way during our time of need.

Let's all remember the employees deserve our appreciation & patience during busy shopping times...and they don't make more money during those times, just more stress while the corporate folks take in the sales profits. Just try to treat everyone with the same respect you would like to receive from them.  And Academy employees deserve raises & more hired staff to create a sales team force!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2c40d19dfb2d:0x98f12f478f5c3c31"}

I needed to purchase some steel stakes to secure palm trees that are damaged from the storm. I went to the Montgomery Academy Sports Store and purchased these stakes. I talked with the salesman in the back and notified him of our mission and asked him if they could give us some kind of discount and was told no. I asked him to ask the manager and he did and the manager said no. When checking out of the store the manager was up front chit chatting with an employee and a customer ( doing nothing) and I again asked him face to face if he could help us out and he again said no. All the other companies have been good about discounting supplies. Lowe's of Wetumpka,  Marvins in Millbrook,  Harbour Freight,  Home Depot all have been helpful especially Lowe's in Wetumpka. After being told no face to face I told him I appreciated it and then proceeded to name the other companies that have responded responsibly.

I received a call from the store that they didn\u2019t have my item and that it would be best if I canceled my order. That my money hadn\u2019t been taken out of my account. I tried to cancel online but it kept freezing up. I called the corporate customer service waited on hold for over 30 minutes and then they cut my call off. I then called the Decatur store back and ask for a manager. The girl that answered said \u201c I\u2019m a manager\u201d she was short and rude with me . Said they would cancel my order and I would get a email or text when it was taken care of. I did receive it and it stated my money would not be back in my bank account until 7 business days. So isn\u2019t that great!! Academy ruins a Christmas present for my daughter. And has not a second thought or concern for me . I tried to do the right thing order from home social distance for everyone\u2019s safety and this is the thanks I get. I paid for an item last spring $ 700 and basically the same thing happened only difference is they didn\u2019t have my purchased item so I had to buy a $100 higher item of the same kind. I guess you make so much money that I make no difference. So I am sure I won\u2019t be missed. But very poor service and no compassion for taking someone\u2019s money at Christmas..
