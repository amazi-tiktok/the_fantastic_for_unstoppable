Truly, 53 HW saves me money and time.  Many home projects where I discover, elbow deep in it, I am missing one little fastener or that one piece to get done, 53 HW comes through.   Hey, they mix paint as well!  Good stuff to boot.  Recently they mixed a color for me that did not come out right. They took my number as they were closing.  The next day I received a call from the owner to let me know they figured it out and it was ready for pickup.  That kind of service with excellent price point and products is what you get from this store l.  Overall, 53 Hardware saves me a lot of time, frustration, and money.  That is well worth my short drive to 53 Hardware for that \"one thing\" at a good price, if not better than the big box.  If I know they have what I need, 53 Hardware is my primary place to shop for home DIY and other garden needs.
