Everyone has the right to post something negative online so this is a safe space for you to vent.

We tried to reach out to you three times by telephone to figure out what it is that you were upset about but you refuse to answer the phone and actually talk to us.  I guess you are busy working on your complaint to the attorney general\u2019s office and the Alabama State Bar (both of which we welcome you to file by the way - that is your right).  So, let me get this straight - you were visiting Alabama from Texas and you received a speeding ticket. You waited about a month and contacted our law firm to ask for help in handling the ticket.  We responded immediately, gave you the care and concern that you were seeking, went over the process with you and your options.  We quoted you a very reasonable fee and told you what we could do in order to resolve the case.  You told us that was too much and you were going to pay the ticket and move on - obviously that would not be based on our suggestion because we ALWAYS try to avoid a conviction for our clients (and we are a traffic ticket defense law firm... that you contacted for help).  Presumably, before you paid the ticket, you attempted to communicate on your own to try and get the ticket resolved (which every defendant out there has the right to do - only most people would do that first before contacting us but I guess that didn\u2019t occur to you).  You then called us back and were upset because you resolved the ticket on your own\u2026allegedly - after checking, it is clear that no resolution has been entered into the state system.  We love you man - but whatever it is that is troubling you has nothing to do with us - we hope you get whatever it is straightened out.  As for the frivolous complaints you have tried to threaten us with to the Alabama Attorney General\u2019s office and the Alabama State Bar - bring it on.  We fight like hell for ourselves just like we fight like hell for our clients.  And another thing you may want to keep in mind - the goal of resolving a traffic ticket is so that you have no conviction and presumably no public record of it.  But, you sir, have done a great job of creating a public record of it for whatever reason and for the entire world to see.  Best of luck to you.  Joseph C.

We always love and enjoy any type of feedback. We \u2764\ufe0fpublic criticism of our firm because it allows others to see how we handle our business and how we respond and most of all, it causes us to step back and fully analyze a problem or situation to see what happened, where we can improve and it gives us a valuable opportunity to reach out to a client who is clearly hurting and offer support in whatever way we can.\nThe only issue in reaching out to you is that we do not know who you are and this is the first we have heard of any problem such as the one you describe - unfortunately, we do not currently have and have never had a client by the name of Butch Pinkston.  If I personally have an issue with a business, I usually contact the business directly and try to resolve whatever it is that is going on.  Businesses don\u2019t get to make things up or hide behind fake names on the internet - I am as transparent as it gets and all of my actual clients know this.\n*I have been practicing law for 16+ years and have successfully resolved 17,000+ charges for clients over that period of time.  I am a man - through and through - if someone has a problem with me, all they have to do is explain what the issue is and if I have made a mistake, then I am glad to admit the mistake, apologize and fix it.  That is the measure of a man.\nAnyone that knows me and that I have helped knows that I am not a hack, a liar or deceitful - far from it.  If only a successful law practice could be run with a paralegal through text messages - but as you would know if we actually represented you, when someone hires us they are able to text us (and our clients LOVE this option), email us, they get a link to schedule an appointment (at a time convenient for the client) to talk with my staff, they also get a link to schedule an appointment (at a time convenient for the client) with an attorney and also, get our direct dial so all they have to do is call us with a question or issue or to schedule a call with anyone that works for me or an attorney (myself included).\n* You don\u2019t get to the level we are and have the impeccable reputation across Alabama and the country that I have by \u201cpromising everything but delivering nothing.\u201d  Close to 100% of our charges we handle are ultimately dismissed - if that is \u201ccookie-cutter law\u201d then so be it.  Apparently, our clients love having their charges dismissed.  We have the utmost interest in defending cases - our actual clients know this.  Every single time we speak to a potential client or go over case resolutions with our clients, our goal is to develop options with the ultimate goal of having the charge(s) dismissed.  Once we have options on the table, we go over those options and our clients get to decide how to proceed - we don\u2019t force anyone to accept any offer on the table and are always available to continue fighting, take the case to the next level or have a trial.  It is our client\u2019s case and they get to decide.\n* Wow - in your review you said, \u201cI expect this kind of lying, duplicitous BS from the cops and the government but not the people you pay good money to represent you.\u201d  Really?  You expect the cops and the government to lie?  What a sad, sad worldview you have - which explains the many false statements you made while hiding behind a fake name.  I practice law to relieve human suffering - period.  No other reason.  I love people - even the people that choose to post random diatribes attacking me on the internet.\n*I invite anyone reading this or looking for a lawyer to Google my name (Joseph Kreps) and review the info about me and my law firm and all of the great work that we do throughout the State of Alabama for clients located all over the world.  I stand by my work and the work of everyone who is on my team.   Joseph C. Kreps * Alabama Lawyer * Lover of People * Defender of Human Beings"}, "gmap_id": "0x88891905ba2738bb:0x382d0da3c88d46c2"}

At first, I figured there was no point in hiring a lawyer  considering the fact that I was caught dead to rights. I was caught speeding. I was  caught with open container. I blew a .11 once I got to the station. What further proof  would they need to charge me with a DUI? How could I possibly get out of that? A  month went by and I still hadn't hired a lawyer. I got to thinking about it and I figured I  would try and find a good DUI attorney to at least provide some good advice before  entering my case single handedly. I then did some research, and happened to stumble  upon Attorney Joseph C Kreps' YouTube videos online that explained what would  happen if I were actually charged with these convictions. They were so enlightening that  I couldn't help but give this guy a call to see if he could help with my case. I gave him a  call & after getting my information & case details\u037e one of the first things his secretary  mentioned was that they may be able to get the sentence reduced to a public  intoxication. I was astounded, thinking there's no way. I was caught dead to rights. I'm  going down. No doubt about it. I then decided to pay the fee and to hire Attorney Joseph  C Kreps' as my DUI Defense Lawyer (not NEAR as high as what I was quoted from  other firms). His very helpful team then guided me through the process of completing a  series of tasks that would help my case. I completed a questionnaire and a few other\nsimple tasks that would, in fact, turn out to help my case tremendously. A month later, I  was scheduled to arrive in court on a Wednesday. On a Monday afternoon prior to my  court date, I received a phone call that explained to me that I wouldn't need to show up  in court on Wednesday and that there was a high possibility that my case was going to  be dismissed. I was absolutely thrilled. How could this happen? I was caught dead to  rights! Two days later I received a phone call and an email from the firm saying that if I  completed a level two CRO, 20 hours of community service, and paid a $600 fine plus  court costs, that all charges were to be dismissed! My entire future was left in the hands  of Attorney Joseph C Kreps, and I couldn't have put it in a better place. I now have no  DUI charges and no open container charges on my record. I'm telling you from  experience, this man and his firm are the absolute best DUI Defense Firm you could  possibly hire for your case. \u00ad If you have a DUI pending \u00ad Stop what you're doing \u00ad Call  this firm.

We \u2764\ufe0f public criticism of our firm because it allows others to see how we handle our business and how we respond and most of all, it causes us to step back and fully analyze a problem or situation to see what happened, where we can improve and it gives us a valuable opportunity to reach out to a client who is clearly hurting and offer support in whatever way we can.\nWe never claim to be perfect and certainly don't want anyone to think that we are perfect.  As you know, Brooke, we did not represent you. \u00a0We represented your partner who is going through the immigration process in the United States of America. We take great pride in the knowledge and the experience that we have over the last 15+ years in handling and resolving 13,000\u001e+ charges all over the State of Alabama. When I was made aware of these issues, we reached out to you to try to resolve it within hours and on the next business morning 7-18-18.  When we did reach out ASAP, you went on and on and then hung up on us before we could even talk.  We tried to call back to no avail.  I personally tried to call back to no avail.\nThe first and most important thing that I would like to point out is that BOTH of the actual client\u2019s charges were DISMISSED.  And it wasn\u2019t just a \u201ctraffic ticket\u201d.  He had 2 charges one of which was failure to obey police/fireman.  Immigration is a difficult process and who knows how this could have seriously impacted his immigration issues - that process and system is ALWAYS CHANGING as everyone knows\u2026 but it shouldn\u2019t impact him now because we got BOTH OF HIS CHARGES DISMISSED \ud83d\ude09!\nAs to the class that was required of him, we are sorry that his time was taken from him in order to do that - our main concern was and is his immigration status and getting the charges dismissed.  His completing a class while his lawyers worked through issues beyond anyone\u2019s control seems like a small price to pay to continue the long and difficult process of becoming a legal United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Citizen.\nIt is important for anyone reading this to know that we did email you the DISMISSAL disposition of BOTH CHARGES back in March 2018... and heard not a peep out of you until this review surfaced almost 4.5 months later.  It is baffling.  We love deeply and dearly every single one of our clients and their friends and family including your partner and also you, Brooke. \u00a0We still love you no matter you might post about us.  This is the truth because our love for our clients and our love and passion for our work and the system is not dependent on how others think or feel about us because we know the truth and our love is our love no matter what - it\u2019s just who we are.\nI invite anyone reading this or looking for a lawyer to Google my name (Joseph Kreps) at any time and see all of the great information about me and my law firm and all of the great work that we do throughout the State of Alabama. \u00a0I stand by my work and the work of everyone who is on my team.  We love what we do because we love people and we love to help people - it\u2019s why I am alive and why I was put on this earth and called to do this type of work.\nMuch love to you, Brooke, and your partner.  If you change your mind and desire to speak to me then I am always here and always willing to talk.  If you or any family members need our help again in the future, please let us know as we would be honored to assist and help you with anything that comes up.\nJoseph C. Kreps\nAlabama Lawyer * Lover of People * Defender of Human Beings"}, "gmap_id": "0x88891905ba2738bb:0x382d0da3c88d46c2"}

This place moved three times since she has been their client, and they never informed her until she called them herself because they do not contact her.

After calling these people several times, they refused to give her any of her case details.\n\nSo with regard to the other negative review this institution has received, I do NOT agree with the owner that \"it is the work of a competitor.\" I have seen these practices first-hand, and I am far from a capital seeking adversary.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1594754666809, "text": "Because we don't recognize your name and you don't appear to be a client of our firm, based off your screen name, there's no way for us to address this issue without knowing the exact name of the client.

Writing a negative review about a business that's never represented you is one thing but making baseless accusations of racial unfairness about people you don't know and who have spent their careers representing underprivileged segments of our state and communities is something else.\n\nIf your mother is dissatisfied with any service that any lawyer or staff member of our firm has ever provided, then please have your mother, personally, reach out immediately and ask for the head practice manager so that we can rectify this matter.\n\nWe take any client dis-satisfaction very seriously and want every client to be satisfied with our efforts.

He refuses to return phone calls. He called me ONE TIME during my divorce, the day before the hearing. He never even bothered to send me the final divorce decree. I had no idea what my divorce papers said until his secretary emailed them to me, after the THIRD request. I know all of his secretaries because they are the only ones I could ever talk to. Half the time, they didn't return phone calls either. Halfway through the 'mediation' I got the distinct feeling that he was working for the other side. He obviously thinks he can make a living by gaining clients, screwing them over, and going on to the next victim. He must be too young and immature to grasp the concept that most people will need an attorney more than ONCE in their lifetime, and if he thinks he can be successful without the benefit of repeat clients, he is delusional. If he was the last attorney on earth, I would never hire him again. My divorce is final; I'm still missing half my belongings; he's promised me a refund twice and never delivered. On top of that, he suggested we file a contempt motion because of the fact that I was not given all the belongings I was entitled to. He didn't mention at the time that he planned on charging me an additional $1500 to do what I'd already paid him to do. In my opinion, the reason all his pictures on FB look like gangster photos is because he is a crook. He will stand there and 'listen' to you, but he is just pretending to hear you. You'd have more luck talking to a brick wall. Plus the brick wall might return your calls. I read a bad review of his, and I should have heeded it.

This harrowing experience began for my family and I around the end of August of 2018 when my beloved uncle died unexpectedly. We began paperwork for me to administer estate by which this process has been grossly bumbled through and fumbled 95% of the time. Mrs. Shoen didn't keep my family and I updated as to the status of the case and judges wishes at any point in time. Nor did she even bother to let us know that court dates had been canceled due to heirs requests for extension. Nor did she return our phone calls or emails in a timely manner despite being paid $1000 up front to get started on our case. Then she all of a sudden calls me hurriedly around Thanksgiving black Friday  to request the remaining funds due to be paid which was not in line with our original verbal agreement. I contested her request and the amount was decreased to $228 with the remaining to be paid after estate opening. After this scenario, things all seemed to go downhill rapidly.  Heirs we calling my family with information from probate we had no knowledge of despite having hired Kayla to be our representative which was disheartening and also very stressful. To date we have had 3 canceled court dates on technicality of not having all necessary actions completed prior to court by my attorney. My last court date was June 26 at 2pm by which I spent the entire month or so prior trying to contact Kayla for confirmation and a check in to ensure our readiness to move forward. My calls and texts were not answered and\nI never heard anything back from her. Not even a return email was received until the day before the court date. Mrs. Shoen apologized in her email for her gross negligence in handling my uncle's case and said she had closed her practice and that she was withdrawing herself from my case and mailing my case file and a refund check for all money's paid back to me. I spoke with her about this on June 25th. I asked that she send me the USPS confirmation so that I could follow up on the file and refund myself, but she never sent it. Today it is July 5, 2019 and I still have not received anything by mail as promised and also no response to my follow up email...Throughout all this long drawn out process my mom has fallen Ill and lost 40lbs due to stress. To boot, I am dealing with my own distinct stresses in trying to get this estate resolved for my mom because my uncle was her best and only close friend.  I know Kayla may not understand this because it isn't her family or her mom. I understand that Mrs Shoen has been dealing with quiet a few deeply challenging issues of her own here lately and that's why I've been so lenient as I know she is probably still learning how to juggle lifes difficulties simultaneously with lifes obligations and workplace responsibilities. I have compassion for her and truly wish her the best in life but there was left much to be desired from the very minimal level of care attention and concern given to our case. I just wish I would known this before hand as my mom and I have wasted an entire year and still have yet to even get the estate opened. I'm so disappointed, stressed and literally exhausted from this process and dealing with lackadaisical representation has made this process the most cumbersome experience ever. At least when I finally get the file and refund I can move on with my life. I pray and wish I had had the same positive experience as some others have had.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bb093ee5187:0x87380fb81b949ade"}

At each point in my case, we were always ready to make it a final resolution and keeping my goals in mind.  She was always available to answer any question.  I paid good money and got great attention.  She stayed on top of her job.  She mentioned that she \"worked\" for me and I was the boss.  I liked that about her.  She would always explain the legal process with my goals in mind and keep my eye on the ball.  I am so glad that I found her when I needed a divorce lawyer.\n\nUpdate:  Almost a year later, I needed help and called Elizabeth.  She took my call and readily gave me the help I needed.  She was still familiar with every fact in my case to this day.  My goodness the memory that she has is amazing.  She walked me through each issue I am currently having and found a solution that worked without going back to court.  I am so thankful I went with her firm in the first place.  If I had gone elsewhere, I would be facing a new legal case today.  Her staff was friendly.  They understood I was under a tremendous amount of stress with my new issue.  Elizabeth quickly picked up the phone.  She gave me the most current law that applied to my problem.  It was such a relief to know that she is always on my side.

We chose Tim since he was  a member of our legal plan to represent us in a civil case. After telling us that the plan would not cover our case, we paid Tim a $2500 retainer. During this time Tim would be proactive and mail us copies of whatever documents he would send or file with the courts. I looked over our legal plan and found that his charges should have, in fact, been covered by our plan.Our legal plan's counse determined that this was so and advised Tim of the same. Since being notified that his time would be covered by the plan and  to not use my retainer for covered charges, I stopped getting any correspondence from his office. No copies of any documents,  no phone calls, no more updates, nothing. Tim never even told us that there was a hearing for summary judgement. The  only reason we found out was from a copy of the order from the  court, itself.  After the hearing, we found out that Tim didn't even argue our case as we had discussed. We eventually lost our case. Tim didn't even bother to notify us until over a week later. When asked about our options, Tim determined that he no longer wanted to represent us and referred us to another attorney who wouldn't even return our calls. When asked about the refund of the $2500 retainer, Tim put us off for over 6 weeks until he finally acknowledged he was trying to \"come up\" with the money. Our legal plan counsel had also been contacting him to return our retainer without further delay. Throughout this time and during our case Tim would never initiate contact with us. We had to initiate contact with him. Even then, it would take anywhere from a week and a half to a month before he would respond.  Tim eventually decided after 46 days that he was no longer going to refund our money despite knowing that his charges were covered by our plan. I have yet to get a breakdown of how my retainer was spent, much less anything else. I would never refer him to anyone. Now he is running for circuit court judge.

None of this is what really upsets me, what upsets me is that from day one they have lead her believe that she is going to receive a minimum of $2,000,000. I have done several hours of research getting the background on the lawsuits filed for the same reason she filed hers. First off I have not even seen the name Cory Watson Attorneys mentioned in any of the reports. Secondly there appears to be over 10,000 people file suite for the same exact reason, against the same exact company, with several law firms. The litigation for this particular devise has been going on for many years. And, it would appear by all indications she will probably never be paid one penny. To this day, they never contact her, if she contacts them they tell her they expect some kind of payout soon, and they are still insisting that it will be $2,000,000+ Why would they cntinue to lie to her?

I needed an lawyer back in November 2010 after I was involved in a car accident on my job. I found THIRY & CADDELL, LLP on the internet on a Saturday night.  They actually reach out to me that Sunday morning. I had a face to face meeting with Mr. Richard Thiry the following Monday. Mr. Richard went above and beyond my expectations. He was very passionate about his clients and it shows in his work and spirit. The legal process was easy and stress free, I was very informed throughout the whole process by Mr. Richard and his team, and I felt at ease asking any questions I had. Richard Thiry was very diligent and got me a settlement quickly. Fast forwarding on June 14,2018 I was again involved in another car accident on the job after only been employed 2 days. I immediately reach out to THIRY & CADDELL, LLP. Mr. Richard no longer practice law because he had retired but his daughter Renee Thiry also is a lawyer there.  First, I'd like to say THANK YOU to Renee Thiry and the staff. They are very professional, personable and very helpful team.  Renee always keeps her word and came through for me when I needed her most. I hired Renee for my workers comp and personal injury suit.  Renee always made me feel that she had things under control and was on top of the case. My job terminate me after 7 months because of permeant injury due to the car accident. She help me get my unemployment to help me out until my case was settle. As a single mom with two kids it help out A LOT. My workers comp case has now been settled and i am so relieved and will be forever grateful. I know that she is also going to do a great job with my personal injury case as well. I honestly don't know what I would do without them. If you want the best then you definitely want to hire Renee Thiry.  I cannot thank her enough for all she is doing for me.

This attorney will talk up a good game at the initial consultation, then will subsequently reveal that is not even on your side, which is the very least one ought to expect from a defense attorney. Don't expect him to actually remember anything about your case, because he never takes notes and seems to have terrible comprehension skills. I would describe him as incompetent, but it actually seemed worse than incompetence: he didn't believe me and he was deferring to the prosecutor's (his opponent) side. Though there clearly was some incompetence at play. Mr. Sogol told me that if I got into a pre-trial diversion program that my record would be expunged after completing it. However, I looked it up and the alleged offense for which I was arrested CANNOT be expunged under Alabama law, though I plan to litigate that issue when the time is right.

A few days past and I never heard anything back so I emailed her again, she then told me it was not on the agreement made between them and sent the paper work I had sent her and the Mom's attorney.

She never even said she was sorry for messing up the papers 3 separate times. When we hired her, I explained that we knew we were not her only clients but this was very important to us. At first things seemed ok but once I paid the final bill and we discovered she left stuff out of the papers her attitude changed. When you make a mistake you apologize for the mistake and correct it, not make the client feel guilty for asking for it to be corrected.In addition to all of this, we were having my son added to the birth certificate, Margret told us to give it 2 months after the judge signed off on it and we could just get a copy at the Health Dept, when my son went to get it Vital Records had the birth certificate on hold because \"our attorney\" did not pay the $49.50 fee to have it changed nor were we EVER told about the fee. It took him 3 hours to get it straightened out. I would NOT recommend her to ANYONE. Respect goes both ways. When we met with her, I told her I knew we were not her only clients but this was VERY important to us.

While my charges were from 2017, I was not arrested until 2019 because I was sent to the hospital on the date of the offense instead of jail and diagnosed with Sudden Traumatic Shock exasperated by alcohol.  Being arrested was completely out of the norm for me.  I did not know where to begin, what to expect, and was consistently imagining the worst possible outcomes and scenarios.  Based off my charges, my bail agent highly recommended that I contact Mr. Crumbly for counsel.  I had an initial meeting with Mr. Crumbly within a week from the first time I contacted him.  The initial meeting did not take longer then an hour and during that time Mr. Crumbly was able to explain all my available options to include representation options, payment options, court expectations, and expected timelines.  Perhaps the most beneficial thing Mr. Crumbly discussed in the initial meeting was the overall stress of the situation.  He told me that it was human nature to imagine the worst possible outcomes and to not worry about that as it was him and his teams job to make sure those outcomes don\u2019t happen.  He was absolutely right and ,during the entire course of my case, I constantly imagined the worst possible scenarios; however, I always made myself think back to that initial conversation with Mr. Crumbly and remembered that is why he is there.  After that initial meeting, Mr. Crumbly and his team handled everything for 6 months up until my court date with the Judge.  Before I even had to go before the Judge, Mr. Crumbly had secured a deal with the DA for me to enter the Pre-Trial Intervention Program (PTIP) and have charges dropped following the completion of the program.  I was more than happy to enter PTIP as it took all uncertainty and stress off the table and I was able to hold everything going forward in my own hands.  As of May 2020, I have successfully completed the PTIP program and am currently working with Mr. Crumbly on having my charges expunged.  I am very pleased with the services I have received from Mr. Crumbly and his team and would highly recommend them.

This led to several serious concerns I had as to what negative impacts this DUI might have regarding maintaining my current place of employment, a valid Alabama Driver\u2019s License, and the potential for increased auto insurance rates. In addition, I was uninformed of all the specific issues pertaining to Alabama State Law as they apply to a DUI charge especially, with respect to possible fines, imprisonment, unknown future adverse impacts, or establishment of an unfavorable permanent criminal history. The level of stress in my daily life was extremely high, to say the least, due to this situation and these concerns.\n\nI was referred to the Law Office(s) of Russell W. Crumbley to try and sort all these issues out. Russell put me immediately at ease and clarified for me, in a no-nonsense way, what needed to be done to effectively address the DUI charge against me. He also kept me informed as to the current status of my case as it made its way through the Alabama judicial process and provided reassuring personal representation at any and all court scheduled hearings or appointments. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND retaining Russell as your DUI Attorney should you ever find yourself in a similar situation. He is a completely knowledgeable and competent attorney in the area of Alabama DUI Criminal Law and you can rest assured that he will obtain the best possible outcome regarding your case.\n\nSincerely Yours-\n\nGreg Kaltz\n\nP.S. \u2013 Due to Russell\u2019s expertise, he obtained a DISMISSAL of the DUI charges against me!

When I explained I was busy I was asked if I would speak with him over the phone. I agreed and I was transfered to Mr. Crumbley.  After listening to me explain my why I left the review and my account of my interactions with Mr. Matt Wisda, Mr. Crumbley asked me several questions.\n1. Would I consider removing my review?\n2. Would I consider moving it to Mr. Wisda\u2019s webpage?\n3. If he (Crumbley) were to fire Mr. Wisda would I then delete my review! I said no.\n4. Was there ANYTHING he (Crumbley) could say or do that would result in me removing the review? To which I responded \u201cNot ethically\u201d, because I felt he was trying to \u201clead me\u201d into asking for a monetary resolution.\n\nDuring our discussion Mr. Crumbley stated he was not at all happy about Mr. Wisda\u2019s conduct. And that he was considering actions (including termination).  He asked once more if there was anything he could do To get me to retract the review against \u201cCrumbley, Blackwell, & Wisda Lawfirm\u201d.  I explained to him that when I researched Divorce Attorneys/Firms I based my decision in part on the reviews of his Firms website and information regarding the lawyers and therefore would not consider removing the review. We said goodbye and I hung up.\n\nI spent that day wondering if he would call again. I just knew \u201cIT\u201d wasn\u2019t over.\nSo this evening I checked on my review out of curiosity...and wouldn\u2019t you know it there is this long drawn out explanation that it was I who was misinformed etc.  Never once mentioning any unethical behavior on behalf of Mr. Wisda!\nI want to SHOUT from the highest rooftops what a sleazy slimeball you are! Shall I post more? Shall I post information Mr. Wisda freely disclosed to me about a clearly VERY SENSITIVE divorce and custody battle where the children involved had been...!\nYou disgust me!\n\nI retained Matt Wisda to represent me for my divorce.  I feel he acted unethically.\nI contacted his office after receiving an invoice for services that were not rendered. When I followed up with an appointment a few days later not only did he begin by talking about another case he had been working on (this was the 2nd time he mentioned details of this other party's case!) but he also presented me with an official Settlement Agreement\" that clearly stated me and my spouse had both agreed to - WHICH NEITHER OF US HAD!\n\nWe never went through discovery at all! No mediation - nothing!\nThe entire document looked copy and pasted, and all of the assets and then some were to be awarded to me!\n\nMr. Wisda was trying to fool me into thinking he had been hard at work on my case and that I was entitled to everything when in fact he hadn't done anything. Additionally It was never my intention to try take my husband to the proverbial cleaners. I just wanted a fair settlement.\n\nI didn't even look at the \"Settlement Agreement\" he'd drawn up while at his office. I had already decided to sever our business agreement and told him so.  I asked when I could pick up my remaining retainer and he said it would be about a week.\n\nWhen I went to pick up the monies, enclosed with my check was an invoice of almost $700 for the bogus \"Settlement Agreement\" that had been drawn up without consultation or discovery.  Coincidentally the new invoice showed just one line item for the preparing of said agreement which was dated after the phone call I mentioned above.\n\nI immediately drew up a letter refusing to pay and insisting I be refunded.  Additionally in the letter I called him out for trying to fool me and get paid for it. I emailed this letter and received a response early the next morning stating they would immediately refund the that money, which they did.\n\nI am leaving this review to make others aware.  In our consultation meeting he told me his practice \"is like a game to me.\"  And because  conducting his business in such a way, I feel, is an abuse of his power as an attorney and is extremely unethical.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1528493792927, "text": "We deeply regret that your experience with our office did not meet your expectation. We work very hard to not let that happen. Having said that, you say that you received a \u201csettlement agreement\u201d that indicated you and your husband had agreed to the settlement terms when, in fact, you had not agreed. You also say that this agreement was put together without doing any \u201cdiscovery\u201d or any \u201cmediation\u201d. You initially hired Mr. Wisda to assist you in negotiating an uncontested divorce with your husband\u2019s lawyer. In fact, you produced, for us, a \u201csettlement agreement\u201d created by your husband\u2019s lawyer when you hired Mr. Wisda. That settlement agreement had already been prepared absent any \u201cdiscovery\u201d or attempt to \u201cmediate\u201d. It was clearly the intentions of both parties (and their lawyers) to settle this matter, if possible, without costly litigation. This type divorce typically does not involve \u201cdiscovery\u201d (in the traditional sense) and most certainly doesn\u2019t involve \u201cmediation\u201d. In these type matters we simply go with settlement negotiations to the extent we are able, which necessarily includes \u201csettlement proposals\u201d. Also, in this type situation, both parties tend to agree that they know what the assets are and their values are not in dispute.\n\nThe \u201csettlement agreement\u201d your husband\u2019s attorney prepared, and gave you, was just like the one Mr. Wisda gave you. In reviewing your husband\u2019s proposal it is noted that it also includes language stating that the two of you \u201cacknowledged and agreed\u201d to things that you had not already agreed upon. In other words, both lawyers settlement agreements included the very same language in that regard. In fact, most paragraphs in all settlement agreements are full of language such as \u201cthe parties acknowledge and agree \u2026\u201d. This language is included to satisfy legal requirements and applies to you ONLY AFTER you have actually read it, agreed to it and signed it. It is not intended to mean that you have already seen it and agreed to it. And, it is NEVER INTENDED to deceive. Your attorney, Matt Wisda, did exactly what your husband\u2019s lawyer did with respect to that language.\n\nAs far as the \u201cattempt to fool you\u201d is concerned: you received an itemized statement of the charges. You received two billing statements. The second of those two seems to be where you objected. That statement involves the \u201csettlement agreement\u201d. You were dissatisfied with that charge and objected to that bill and, although you had NOT notified him of your desire to terminate him until after that work was done, we refunded every penny to you of that part of the bill. And your objection, as much as any we can tell, is founded on your belief that it included the \u201cbogus\u201d settlement language indicating that you and your husband had agreed to the terms that you had not agreed to.\n\nWe strive to handle cases the way our clients direct us. And, while the services you received were not satisfactory to you, Mr. Wisda DID NOT bill you for services not rendered. His conduct was not unethical. His ability to communicate effectively with you, I will agree, must have missed the mark. For example, we are not sure how, exactly, you did not understand that the \u201cacknowledged and agreed\u201d language in the settlement agreement did not mean you had both already agreed to that agreement. That was no more the intent of what Mr. Wisda provided you than it was the intent of what your husband\u2019s attorney provided him. It was merely two lawyers doing their jobs and adding the language that was going to be necessary at some point, in advance. Perhaps THAT is why it looked copied and pasted.\n\nWe would encourage ANYONE who is dissatisfied in ANY way, with ANYONE in our office, to meet with any of us. WE ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE to meet with that person and do everything we can to alleviate their concern and fight for your cause. Your case matters to us. And, YOU matter to us. Best wishes moving forward during this trying time.\n\n~ Russell Crumbley & Matt Wisda"}, "gmap_id": "0x886214b5eb6aa54b:0x60d777fdf93ee41a"}

I had heard a lot of good things about him and his firm from other people that had used his services. I scheduled a consultation and went to meet Mr. Crumbley. I was very nervous about my situation, but within minutes he had me at ease and feeling confident we would win this case. During our meeting, Mr. Crumbley was very professional and knowledgeable and easy to talk to. I followed his advice and we took the case to a jury trial in the higher court. We were scheduled court dates several times and each time I went, the court wasn\u2019t able to try the case at that time and would reschedule at a later date. Jump forward 6 years (that\u2019s our court system), and the court finally scheduled a court date. So since it had been 6 years, I had moved a couple of times so the court didn\u2019t have my current address so I was never notified of the new date. Mr. Crumbley still appeared in court on my behalf, he informed the court that he had tried to contact me but was unable to reach me. The court was talking about doing several different things, but Mr. Crumbley kept fighting on my behalf to reach a solution that was in my best interest.

Dean replied within 5 minutes, and with great interest in my inquiry! Asking questions i hadn't thought of in order to fully understand my status & give the most accurate reply.

I had multiple questions ranging from money to get my stitches removed to whether I needed to obtain a police report and wanted only to speak to the staff member in charge of my case.

He contacted me multiple times to explain my options & offer opinion if I desired. He was truly in my corner for me.
