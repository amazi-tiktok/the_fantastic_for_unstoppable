I was fortunate enough to get connected with John, from Overland Tailor Tuning in Hoover, AL\n\nI reached out to John and over the course of 2 weeks we communicated back and forth, he walked me through the entire process (in fact I have 2 pages of messages) John took the time to answer any and every question that I had as well as asking me questions about my truck in the event I decided to go ahead and tune. Note: John even volunteered his email and mobile number should I want to talk more about the tuning process for my Tacoma.\n\nI was still on the fence about driving 4hrs, each way but John\u2019s explanation of what would take place was well thought out and made me feel comfortable that this was a very thorough tuning process.\n\nWhen I arrived, John took 15 minutes to discuss every step that would take place (he had a checklist already prepared) from adding a battery tender and why he did that, checking for codes, if I would need a TSB update, he double checked with me on the following; did I tow or haul, was I needing AGM battery support, had I re-geared, as well as checking the general condition of my Tacoma with the diagnostic tool that he had. I knew I had come to the right place to get my Tacoma tuned.\n\nThe tuning process was relatively quick, and it was now time for the test drive. John explained that he would be accompanying me and would use a bluetooth diagnostic tool to connect to my Tacoma while on the test drive to monitor key engine parameters to make sure that everything was working as it should after the tune.\n\nThe tune? I could immediately notice that tip in flat spot was gone, acceleration was smoother, and my Tacoma seemed to have a little bit of pep in its step now. My 245-mile return trip home would allow the tune to settle in and allow for my required follow up with John to discuss how my Tacoma ran during the ride home and provide feedback.\n\nThe entire process from first contact thru follow up after the tune was first class and professionally done!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJ98MlKlz403GQkFda7g1TnrrdoqCNsqsnfzra=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1620270260847, "text": "Bob - Thank you for the review..

We talked and even tho he could practically finish my sentences I was still a little worried about having someone tune my tuck I do not know. So I kept digging and found a forum on Tacoma world and found there was a guy in Hoover Al. Who also done tuning and was one of their recommended guys. I went to his page, got his number, and started talking to him. After a few quick texts back and forth I confirmed he was the previous guy I had found on Facebook. Rest assured, you're dealing with someone who knows their stuff and has a passion for it as well.

I found John with Overland Tailor on a forum online and saw where he offered a performance tune for Tacomas. So I did some digging and decided to move forward with getting my truck tuned.\nI have been driving on the KDMax 6.0 Tune for a couple of weeks now and can say that making the choice to go this route with the KDMax over the Kruiser tune was well worth it! Everything from the shift points to acceleration and deceleration is vastly improved and I am so very impressed. That's just the tune, though. I couldn't have asked for a more positive experience working with John through the process. This isn't some guy looking to make some side change flashing tunes. He knows his stuff and has the experience to back it up. Starting from a thorough checklist to ensure everything was in order before performing the tune, to taking a solid test drive to ensure the truck was performing as it should, John made sure he did everything he could to ensure I was satisfied with the tune.\n\nIf you are on the fence about whether or not you should get the tune, you won't find a more knowledgeable and friendly guy to make sure all your questions and hesitations are answered.\n\nThanks, John!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1620270210164, "text": "Matthew -\n\nSo glad you are loving the tune and thank you so much for taking the time out of your busy schedule to write the review..

I avoided them in my Acura, Audi and TDI VWs because of nightmare stories I had read- everything from bricking ECUs to engine/transmission/exhaust damage. My nightmare premonition of a kid with a backwards Ed Hardy hat, crawling under my dash to give a 280HP truck 500HP for a couple of days until everything blew was unfounded. And I didn't want any part of that.\n\nWhen I got my JK, I tried a Superchips tuner and was able to do some basic calibrations which worked out. Kind of. Honestly, I mostly read trouble codes (because Jeep), and made a speedometer cal change due to tire size. Ultimately, I ended up removing the crazy throttle tip-in that everyone on the Jeep forum was raving about, which made that small wheelbase Jeep buck and become unlivable. It wasn't really a \"tune\", but gave me pause.\n\nSo to say that I was doubtful about tuning enhancements is a bit of an understatement.\n\nBut after talking to you, and seeing what a competent, reasoned approach might do, I decided to give it a shot. I have to admit that close proximity had a part in it as well. I don't think I would've driven several hours to try this out, which, SPOILER ALERT, would have been entirely my loss.\n\nMy truck didn't feel powerful or entirely capable prior to the tune, and the transmission seemed absent-minded. You can read about that all over this forum. It didn't make the truck unable to be driven- it just wasn't a lot of fun.\n\nGiving the truck the boot during the test drive (post update) and feeling that acceleration and power that has always been there but inaccessible was a real eye-opener. I can sense that the truck isn't 100% just yet, which is expected (because you explained it- thoroughly and in a way that made sense), and because it's hunting like it did when new- trying to learn how I drive it.\n\nI don't drive fast anymore, and most of the time I won't come near the new potential my rig has, but it's nice to know it's there. The way it should have been from the factory.\n\nAnd before I go, I should also mention professionalism. In aviation, we use checklists for everything, so to see you use one for this tune gave me a good impression. As did the cleanliness of your garage and neatness of your gear. I also realize that I didn't ask a question that went unanswered or got shrugged off. You took care during the updates, and the results speak for themselves.\n\nIf you're on the fence about this, do it. You won't regret it.\n\nThanks again for everything!\n\nBrett", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1620270307521, "text": "Brett - Thank you for taking the time to write the review.
