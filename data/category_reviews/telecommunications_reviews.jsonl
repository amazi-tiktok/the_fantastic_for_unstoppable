Mr Garcia had fallen for a scam artist and had allowed the person access to his computer. The laptop was terribly infected. I cleaned the system of the infections, tools, and changes made to his computer, which I cleaned and worked through midnight on Friday night to ensure he would have it back on Saturday.  To work on the computer I had to set the desktop magnifier back to normal 100% rather than 150% magnification. On opening Monday morning, 12/18, he came back into the shop very angry and abusive, complaining he couldn't see his desktop.  I set the desktop magnification back to 150%, and he told me about the password problem.  I tried to go through the 2 step verification with him to retrieve his password, but since he had previously done this multiple times at home , he had been put into \"time out\" by Google, telling him to come back and try again in a few hours.  He demanded that I call google and get it fixed, which google doesn't do (to my knowledge).  I asked him to be patient and try again later, but he continued to be abusive.  We did receive a message that the password was changed 6 days before, which would have been December 12.  He stated he thought he knew the password, but it didn't work.
