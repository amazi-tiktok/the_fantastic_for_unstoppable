You also forgot to mention that your wife was trying to shut you up when you came in yelling and cursing at me. You also forgot to mention when you were cursing at me all I said to you was sir please leave the store. Not that it\u2019s your business but I chose 3rd shift. My customers are my number one priority. I take my job very serious when it comes to my customers. I don\u2019t like  that you\u2019re unhappy,but I also know everyone can\u2019t be pleased. I know you said your wife was disabled... maybe you should try getting out for her next time if 1 minute is too much time for her to be up.  You sure were able to get out to cuss me out. I don\u2019t like that you\u2019re unhappy with me, but I\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Don\u2019t know what else to say.

Not sure why Budget allows these people to use it's name, but their customer service is awful.  They did not put the hand dolly in the truck for me when I rented a truck from there.  I live about 25 miles away from there, and so to drive the Budget truck back there for the dolly, it used up over five gallons of fuel round trip.  That's over $20 worth of fuel I have to put back into the truck now because it has to be full when you turn it in.  They refused to fill the truck back up even though I had to use the gas because of their mistake.\n\nBudget has a limit of 212 miles of use when you rent a truck, and I had to use 50 of those miles going back for the dolly they forgot.  I will now have to pay a penalty for going over my miles when I turn the truck in.  They refused bring me the dolly or even meet me closer to my home with the dolly even though it was their mistake.  The employee I was working with told me repeatedly it wasn't her problem and she didn't care (I recorded her saying it on my iPhone).  And when I asked to speak to the owner, he said he wouldn't help me because I'm moving far away and I guess I won't be around to use Buddy's Service Center anymore.  Said it wouldn't benefit him financially to make the gas in the truck right.  And when I asked if happy customers benefit him financially he just shrugged his shoulders and said he didn't care.\n\nThe employee then went on to shove my paperwork into my stomach where I was leaning against the counter and refused to answer any more questions.  The owner then said the employee would not be punished for her actions.\n\nDo yourself a favor and use Uhaul or Ryder or anyone else.  Budget Customer Service would not help with the gas either.  They said I used the gas and didn't care that I only had to use it because of their mistake they made.\n\nMoving is stressful enough already.

I came in looking for a restroom, looked on the door saw the male/female sign and no letter indicating I couldn't use it. I did my business, cleaned up after myself and went to the counter to make a purchase. I politely asked the clerk how she was doing. I don't know her name, maybe she was the owner. She gave me no reply and had the most disgruntled look on her face. As I am paying, I asked asked her why she seemed upset. She angrily said, \"HOW ABOUT NEXT TIME YOU DICIDE TO \"BLOW UP\" SOMEONE'S TOILET YOU ASK!\". To which I calmly replied, \"You should put a sign on the door letting customers know to ask\". As I'm leaving she said with agrivation, \"YOU SHOULD ASK!\" Maybe I was wrong for not asking, but I don't think I deserved the level of disrespect this woman gave me. If she is the owner of this store, she should seriously rethink her attitude and how she treats her \"paying customers\".

There's more gas stations around here in a one mile radius you ho!\" An jumps in her car an took off", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88892e3b4d2951ad:0x374c5c2269bbb2b"}

She grabbed  my items and threw them in the trash and said this is her store. If this person was a manager it explains why the store have poor reviews and act unprofessional. Several  customers left in shock during this person unprofessional act. If I can give this store a zero I would!! If you're looking for a place with great customer service skills this not your place.

From the moment I spoke, he screamed, yelled, repeatedly exclaimed, \"it's not my fault, it's not my fault!\" and would not allow me to continue.  He belittled me and spoke down to me as though I was trash, with multiple customers waiting in line with their jaws dropped in disbelief.  I simple gave up, gave him $10.00 to prepay for fuel (again). But he continued his tyrant and I had to ask several times for my receipt before he finally handed it to me.  At that point, I wanted my receipt, my new purchase and to leave.  If this gentleman is the manager or owner, I certainly have lost respect for him and absolutely refuse to visit Exxon in Saginaw, AL. A little common courtesy goes a long way.  As I stated, I wanted nothing for free and someone else benefited from my loss, fine, they are better for it, but to be treated as I was, while spending money at his store is a true testament to the type of business he runs.

The conclusion is this. The people who work there are lesser than human beings. Management clearly has no clue what\u2019s going on.

I was watching her do the transaction and I thought she would have enough sense to give me my receipt or assume I wanted my receipt. Because, I saw her print the receipt out. But nope. She was just like \"Okay..\" Like trying to make me get out of line. And I was like \"I want my receipt.\" They need to start putting surveys on the receipts of all the gas stations.

I mean the position requires top notch customer service...actually, I'm lying,  it doesn't even require \"good customer service\", bc customer service doesn't take much effort at all!! If you are even the slightest bit capable to understand how to smile, respond to a question with that smile, and be available to do YOUR job, like YOU were hired to do when YOU APPLIED (no one asked you to apply for the position...especially when you are not capable to atleast do those extremely simple things/requirements), then, anyone, who is anyone, can work in customer service if they allow themselves to be genuine. Anyone will easily  outshine  the current employees. As well as, a difference in profits will most likely  be seen, bc these current employees obviously are  not fit one bit due to their lack of simple professionalism.

This is not a busy time of day so cashier can stock & run register without closing store.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNV_DKJzwu9Pli6Nij-LwnQeq0UBPEB3DGkbtjr=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNb67EBDa_yRzVCCJDeKXRTOVXGBEKNUuafOE0A=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPuJbQVg9nviCwbTun85k0ozUFBUTXAIncoeNs=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfdq6EL78GuaSlD3pxujBcx6JjXDLVrrGIrD3V=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOb43Gj-xbiiYd4gck1Kwf3xCHrXj20au6sDyHe=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNggM1kONygXB3zuyhfm9ypn4GVrT158fHgSp2H=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKF_v8Dc-6K1nCllFdERxiIaAAsX_ZYI-9T6h5=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOg8HO8u5q-p1OG1cI1q42HDmGDjEKvANuB7Rp4=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVANWnWtYvxrXQwJ7VTCcWo9E7rRkeC0-SVdM_=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzfnZV2GJiAuw5zSHbbSFeBQpMeyzxbHR9h2ku=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNksYhCNLuZyOMLThuENabFGm7J-0K0BX0h1bGx=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a22ff2c2077:0x65e12b1f464e9ea8"}

He told me that he can do it that all I needed to do is ordered the parts. So I did. So I called made an appointment to bring the truck down. Took it down on Thursday by Friday even it was done so I go pick it up. Everything seemed great going home then the following Sunday going to storage unit an all at once it felt like the brakes was grabbing and released but than I was hearing a noise. It happen so fast I made it to the road to pull off and got out to look. That's when I saw the rearend streaming hot. So I got someone to come get it to take it back. So I hauled it down and called the next day to let him know what happen. Had lots of people thats worked on them. Little farther away. They asked me what it done when it happen and they asked me how many pinion threads was showing so I counted and they was probably an 3/4 of an inch showing so they said that he over tightened it. Well the guy at South auto told me that it was a bad bearing in the kit that it would cost me another 200 or so dollars to be fixed so I've done been tho two different people rebuilding it. Put over $1000 in it already so therefore he wasn't holding his word either. So I just picked my truck up and told him I'll look at it myself bc I don't think it's much I hope. Well come to find out on my carrier bearings are hammer marks instand of pressing them on he used a hammer and beat them in so now Ive gotta put another set of bearing all the way tho the hole rearend. Costing another 100 dollars and free labor bc I'm doing it myself. Taking it apart and looking at it the outer pinion bearings is gone but worth me not driving it far I'm praying that I can clean everything up bc I'm not seeing alot of metal in it so hopefully it will be good after I get it fixed.

However, today multiple pumps weren't operational, and three different keypads weren't functioning forcing us to move around an already busy station.  We settled on one that flowed very slow.  A young lady beside us was charged before $.01 before the pump shut down.  We walked in to let the attendant behind the counter know, and he said nothing while shrugging his shoulders, twice, and proceeded to ignore us.  Mapco should be ashamed of not only allowing a relatively still new station, in a busy spot, to be so inadequate, but also for hiring such a poor excuse for customer service.  We'll be finding another station, which is also disappointing because this one was convenient.  Boo!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626689606fed65:0x53af332bb7e6213e"}

She pointed to the drink on the other side of the shelf, so I asked then why is the $1.99 straight under the naked smoothies. She goes around to the back of the shelf when she comes out her exact words were \"they are just misshelfed.\" I asked \"since they are the price advertised that's what I'm getting it for right.\" She procced to tell me \"no I'm not but we have cheaper drinks if you can't afford it.\" On top of all that she said it in front of four customers, which one female customer who was buying the same drink said I'll just go to pilot across street where they dont mistreat they're customers. So I bought the cola fizz and ask the cashier who told me her name was Tammy. Then I ask Tammy how to contact the manager she looked behind her at the blonde from the food area who shook her head no and Tammy said she couldn't give that information out so I ask what the blonde employees name was and she tried to say she didn't know it. After one or two other customers put their things down and left the store saying they wouldn't ever be back as will I unless the nameless blonde does not work there at all, for her very rude and unprofessional behavior.

Let me explain, I went to this gas station on a Thursday afternoon around 3pm about a month ago. It was the day before payday, and had only 4 dollar bills and a little over $2 in loose change. Got which item/s I needed and went to pay and he refused to let me purchase the item/s because I had $1.21 in pennies. I argued with him for a couple minutes and finally gave up and grabbed my money off the counter and as I was walking out, I reminded this man that pennies are an American currency too, and walked out. I get into the vehicle and I hear this man yelling at me saying this is his country and to be honest I couldn't make out what he was saying after that. This man pursued me and chased me out to my car and was pretty much threatening me. A week later, I returned to the store with my boyfriend, but this time I did not go in the store. This man informed my boyfriend that if i come back to the store he will call the police and have me arrested! What kind of BS is that??

I just politely asked if Mapco laws were different than those in the rest of Alabama. Once I realized he was not going to make it right I left the can on the counter and told them to keep it.
