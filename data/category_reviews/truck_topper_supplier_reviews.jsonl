Update (3-19-18) - When I picked up the truck from commercial van it was very dirty and there were little pieces of bed-liner plastic stuck all over the truck. It looked like over-spray, but they came off when I wiped them, thinking that this wouldn't be a problem I took the truck home (that was my big mistake). I didn't notice the paint chips until after I went home and washed all the little pieces of over-spray plastic off. There are 2 chips next to the drivers side Z71 emblem a gouge in the clear coat right above the drivers side tail light and 2 large chips in the clear coat between the bed and cab on the passengers side. All of these are in the immediate area around where they were working.  I also found a scuff where something rubbery with grit on it was dragged across my passenger rear door and had to use buffing compound to get it off. If you have work done there you need to stay and watch them, because as with any auto shop damage done will never be \"their\" fault.  Troy the owner called me this morning and asked if I was the one that wrote the bad review of his business. When I told him yes I wrote it he said that review is unnecessary and that I had planned to scam him from the start. When I got tired of listening to his accusations I hung up on him. He then calls me back and leaves a message telling me I was extremely unprofessional and I was no longer welcome at his business. As the owner of a business that relies on good experiences with customers it is HIS job to be the professional. And the professional thing to do would have been to ask me to bring it back so they could look at the damage instead of accusing me of being a scammer. All I was going to ask for was some touch up paint so I could fix it myself, but all I got was hostility and accusations. My father is going to get a bed-liner done on his truck, but he will not be using Commercial Van Specialists in Loxley. Troy and his \"business\" will never get another dime of my money, nor will they get any business from any of my family and friends.  When I give someone money to work on my vehicle I expect them to treat it and me with respect, but these people fall terribly terribly short.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a6e8131eab6fb:0xa40d31008c34e55a"}
