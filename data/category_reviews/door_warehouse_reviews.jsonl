We paid a deposit on our windows on June 1st, we were told it would be 8 to 10 weeks before they were installed. Called after 10 weeks  told the production company had delays. I had to call multiple times to find out this information. Never once did they call to inform me about any delay. So I waited another 4 weeks and called back. Got the same run around. Called back 2 to 3 weeks later and told them that they had a couple of days to figure something out or we would seek legal action. Miraculously a few days later they called with a confirmed ship date. The windows finally shipped and we had an appointment for install the next week. So TOTAL time from paying deposit to install was 19 weeks and 5 days.\n\nAfter they installed the windows and my wife paid them, I get home from work to see trash in the driveway and the yard. I call Zach the owner and told him about the issue.

Words cannot express about there workmanship. This is the best two man crew I have seen. They showed up on time ready to work. They did not take any lunch breaks except water breaks. They also explained the how's and why's of how they had to install the windows. On top of that Josh also fix my Doors from some previous installers. They are extremely detailed and the work can speak for itself. On a scale of 0-10 I would give them a 10 and recommend them.

The remainder of the single hungs would be replaced by double hungs and the 3 remaining picture frames would be replaced with picture frame windows.\n\nOnly Bill from Window Depot would listen to us and provided honest feedback some of which may have actually resulted them taking a few hundred dollars the less from us.  They also gave us an honest price since we went with our own financing.\n\nIt was the complete opposite than what we experienced with Champion who insisted on bells and whistles we didn't need or want and cost $2000 more for the same style and quality windows.  Champions sales pitch was also high stress (must sign today shtick to get special demo offer).\n\nWindow World had come recommended from a few friends but they insisted we go with double hung in all but the one picture frame over our bay window.  They insisted it would cost too much and wasn't worth it vs their recommendation for 15 double hung and 1 bay window.  Customer always knows best and Window World lost the job from the get go for that mistake.\n\nThe quality of the Window Depot installation job is also visibly much better compared to friends who have had Window World windows installed.\n\nBill in sales and Zach were great to work with.
