The company that built my pool is now out of business, go figure. They quoted me one price on phone then after he came and instructed us on pool maintenance I received a bill for another $135.\nThis year I called for pump repair/replacement. We were quoted one price that was to include new salt cell and replumb so we could maintain salt cell.\nThe tech that came out said \u201coh, I don\u2019t know anything about salt cells I\u2019m just here to replace pump.\u201d  I was not hone my son was there and did not know the whole agreement.\nWhen my daughter in law called back to discuss she was told no the quote was for pump replacement only. If we had repaired pump it would have included the salt cell.\nThis is totally unacceptable.\nI will not use them again!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889160c0cb33e79:0xf7f0ec7acbfe0330"}

I was surprised at how responsive they were returning their calls within 48 hours.  They were able to resolve an issue in less than a month that the previous company couldn't resolve in a year.  They treated me more like a friend than a random customer.  I have called them every year to open and maintain my pool for the last 3 years and have yet to be disappointed.  I highly recommend giving them a call for whatever your pool needs may be.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889160c0cb33e79:0xf7f0ec7acbfe0330"}
