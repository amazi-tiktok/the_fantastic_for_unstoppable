Boyfriend's new car had a clutch failure. Ordered a conversion kit online to do ourselves. After not being able to put it back together it was brought to Gill's. It turned out the company we ordered from sent us the wrong kit. Gill's said it would be a week or so. After hearing nothing, had to call and see where progress was, got some excuse about why it wasn't done yet. Okay, not a big deal but should have been kept up to date. Week after week of not being kept up to date, and hearing excuse after excuse as to why, 2 months later car is ready. Car feels great, except for a weird rumbling sensation that wasn't there before. Oh well, not sure what it is. Notice a bolt just sitting in the console that wasn't there before. Turns out they didn't even connect the steering column. Thank goodness it didn't give out and KILL US while driving down 280 for the week we couldn't figure out the rumbling/random bolt.

I brought my BMW X5 there to have the water pump replaced. They replaced the water pump, but damaged other parts on my vehicle while doing the repair. I was quoted $360 labor to replace the water pump. I called to check on my vehicle later that evening, and Yvonne said that her technician was having a hard time installing the water pump and that they had to charge me an extra hour worth of labor. Who fault is that? I told them no way, so they only charged me the $360 that I was originally quoted. However they did mentioned that my car needed 2 more repairs and quoted me $563 for one and $440 for the other. The $440 repair was for a hose that was damaged while they were changing the pump. The hose cost $40 from the BMW dealership and they said it would be 4 hours of labor, which didn't sound right for a hose. I called 3 other independent shops and was quoted $130 for the same repair parts and labor. The $563 was for a hood latch and cable, the parts at dealer are $80. Yvonne also said it would be 4 hours labor. I called several independent shops and was quoted $200 for parts and labor. I guess 4 is there magic number. When I asked Yvonne to double check those quotes all of a sudden she wasn't able to find the labor rates in the system. How did she come up with those figures initially?

We actually charged less labor to install the water pump than the labor guide prescribes.  We also told you about another coolant leak that you say we caused, but we did not; you also declined that repair.

I've told myself several times this will be my last time because I have had to take my car back for rework several times.  The last time I visited was the case.  They were suppose to repair my windshield reservoir from a blown tire.  After getting home I noticed the hose was missing from the reservoir to the wipers and no fluids in the tank.  I called the shop and told them they didn't fix it and they said there must be a hole in it.  Clearly they didn't do any work on the reservoir or even look at it.  I took it back again and they connected the hosing and told me I needed a new pump.  I probably needed a new pump, but I felt like this should have been told to me the first time.  If you're looking for a shop that can do general maintenance work use them.  The people are generally friendly, but be willing to take your car back if the problem isn't solved the first time.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88892e6a3d8df1bd:0xc9603d81c6e4aa93"}

I live about an hour and a half away so I really love it!  I did all my negotiating via email and set up a test drive appointment. Very, very, easy sale for the company. My biggest disappointment is the fact that the car was filthy when I arrived and the battery terminals were severely corroded. I am convinced nobody from the service department even looked under the hood until I made them.  I wanted the terminals cleaned,  I wanted an oil change,  all fluids topped off and a cabin air filter change (Very minimal requests for a car dealership) I stated it would have to be detailed inside. The detail department worked on it but they would only be there until 12 or 12:30. So we concluded our business (paid cash) and I went to lunch without the car.  Well by the time I got back the headliner was much cleaner but it smelled terribly in the car (like stagnant mop water). Nothing else was even wiped down and unfortunately the detail department was gone. There was sticky crusted disgusting something in all the buttons so some would stick in certain positions. Literally the battery terminal was only brushed with a wire brush to knock off the corrosion. I don't think the oil was changed. When I got home the oil did not appear new. I think they put new on top of the old then they mixed together. The cabin air filter was not changed. I removed it to check because everytime I used recirculated air instead of fresh it smelled bad. It has a new one now and it no longer has an odor.\n\nMy salesman was okay, but seriously the easiest commission ever. Wish I would have at least gotten an after the sale phone call. Just to check in. Would have made me feel better about the other issues.\n\nMy complaints are only directed to the service and detail departments.\n\nI am now looking for a truck in the $20,000 range (same as my Maxima) and I am not even looking at this company now.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb264d8d2482b:0xf6be7f6160faedaf"}

My salesman was actually a nice  man, so i have absolutely nothing bad to say about him.  After going through this ridiculous process of trying to prove my income for 2-3 hours and trying to be put in a car  the finance company wanted me to have. I was exhausted, over it and ready to leave. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, someone decided to make a big deal out of nothing. My children went ahead of me and went to the door. They were holding the door for each other and then was holding it for me, waiting for me to catch up and come out. Before I got to the door they were approached by a lady. She told my children to either go out the door or go find their moma or daddy and they they were letting the air out. I was appalled!! I asked her what was the problem. I asked her name and she mumbled something and I asked her again and she told me she didn\u2019t owe me an explanation!!  Come to find out she was the owner. The salesman walked up to me try to find out what was going on. She began to butt in, so then the gentleman walked me out the door to discuss it. it started to rain, he offered to grab an umbrella for me. We make our way into the building and the owner runs up to the salesman and tells him he is her employee and He better not walk me out the door. How pathetic and nasty can a human be over nothing!!\nI\u2019m sick of people  acting ignorant for no reason towards me. So needless to say I left all deals on the table and vowed to make it known that I would never spend a dime with a company that doesn\u2019t value my business or dollar. So it\u2019s above me now!!\n\nAnd so far from what I hear the cars are junk! A friend of mine bought a van and the alternator went out 2 days after she purchased it.\n\nOh and if you plan on buying a car using your business name don\u2019t waste your time.

The salesman kept trying to put me in 2015 or 2016 vehicle and that wasn't what I wanted. The salesman was real pushy and not at all patient. I left from there with a 2016 Camry, the same one he threw in my face as the 1st car I drove even though I told him I hated those Camry. In the end he wound up giving me a car i absolutely hate. He made sure he got a good commission off of me, in spite of what I told him I like and wanted. I will take my other family members to another car lot instead of this one. So now I'm going to go to my father, God mother, God sisters, sisters, and lil brother and God daddy, who are all ministers, and plead with God to reverse this curse that was done to me and make a way out of no way to get the car I want.

They were very friendly and honest and the vehicle was just as described except for one minor issue.  I had been told it had a new battery, but during inspection we discovered that the battery was not new. It was just a mix-up and they were happy to install a new battery while we were finishing up the financial side of the deal.  Would have loved to have gotten the car at a bit lower price (who wouldn't?) but this was an exceptional low-mileage one-owner specimen, and they did work with me on the price.  I've shopped Miatas for quite some time and lately Carvana seems to have almost cornered the market on clean low-mileage Miatas and have jacked the prices up really high.  But I was able to buy this Miata well below what Carvana would have priced it at, and I feel that I got a good deal considering the current market and the premium condition of this vehicle  (and lots of buyers have had very bad experiences with Carvana, so I'm glad I didn't have to deal with them).  Highly recommend Moates Auto Xchange and would absolutely do business with them again!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1605547210512, "text": "Thank you Mr Giles for the review.

I was told to come back that Saturday; May 2nd so that a mechanic can look at it. I went that Saturday and had the lights repaired. That same Saturday night my entire driver side taillight went out. I knew they were closed Sunday but I called just in case I could leave a voicemail to give them a heads up about me coming in on Monday; May 4th regarding the taillight. May 4th they tried to repair the issue however ALL of my lights started malfunctioning. They tell me to come back that Wednesday; May 6th so that their mechanic can look at it. They gave me a work order stating that they are working on diagnosing the problem in case I got pulled over for no brake lights, reverse lights, headlights or turn signal. They proceeded to pull my vehicle through the shop and when I got inside it I noticed an airbag sensor that was not there before. I asked John if he could have it cleared out and he said that he would have the mechanic do it on Wednesday and that it should be no problem. I then attempted to turn my AC on (which was on while they were working on it but John said that he had turned it off) but the AC wouldn't come on. I get out of my vehicle and ask John if he could have the code cleared because I felt that it was messing with the operation of my AC and it's been 90\u00b0 lately. John then tells another employee named Skyler to come clear the code however the code does not clear. During this time the owner comes and introduces himself and asked me and another customer if we were being tended to, the other customer stated that he was already tended to then I stated that I was being tended to and pointed to my vehicle. The owner then leaves to never return again. They then proceeded to turn the vehicle off in hopes of resetting it however at that point the vehicle would no longer start. John then told me that I needed to leave and that I could return Wednesday to have their mechanic look at it but at this point, I had no dash lights, interior lights, exterior lights, no AC, no radio, no power steering, and sensors going off. The vehicle would no longer start up. I started to get upset, John claims I brought my vehicle in like that which is 100% untrue, I drove it in with no issues other than the driver taillight but I was unable to drive it away. I defended myself and vehicle over that statement then John pulled their doors closed while several employees including a manager/ assistant manager watched. I ended up having to call the police (because I had no clue what else I could or should do). The shop then claimed that I had a bad battery and that was the result of all of this however when they put a brand new battery in there it did NOT fix all the problems, the vehicle did start up and it did have headlights but that was it. After me refusing to tow my vehicle away and almost 2 hours later Mitch (I believe the manager or assistant manager) then offered to let the vehicle stay and have their mechanic look at it on Wednesday May 6th. May 6th, I went to go pick up my vehicle and John was working the front desk, they tried to hand me my keys in the lot hoping I would just leave immediately but when I asked for a full detail work order on what all had been done to my vehicle, I received attitude and was told that I should be happy that they fixed it for free and that they don't document all the work that's done on vehicles. I sat up there until I received a work order (over 30mins later) but when I received the \"work order\" it stated, \"gave customer a battery and replaced 10 fuse\". I told the mechanic that that was not a detailed work order but I was told that was all I was going to get. I do not believe that they would have fixed the damages their employee, John, caused to my vehicle if I did not have 4years of documentation from the one and only other mechanic I've been to, video footage from my own vehicle and computer readings from my Vivint smart security proving the condition of my vehicle.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e9b414671032d:0x29e4a24dd6f16484"}

I had to have my car towed here the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. I was told that I would get a detailed estimate the following Monday. I was fine with that. When I called Monday I was told that they had already started replacing and fixing the damaged parts to my car without my permission and without my knowledge. So I specifically said please stop working on it until I get the detailed estimate I was promised and had looked it over. The next day I decided to have my car towed to a different shop that specializes in Volkswagen and Audi cars. When I called Hesco to tell them what I had decided they informed me that my car was almost completely finished. The owner made a decision without my permission yet again and without calling to inform me what was going on. I was highly disappointed that every decision made about my car was made without my input or knowledge. And that my request for them to stop the repairs was completely ignored. This business is very unprofessional and lacks the ability to communicate with their customers. I also feel that I was taken advantage of because I am a woman. Not to mention the repairs done to my car were done wrong. I ended up having to have all the transmission fluid drained and replaced bc they used a brand that is not recommended for German cars. I also had to have the tires rebalanced and aligned bc Hesco didn't properly do that either.

He asked multiple times if it was ready, was told only 20 more mins, then 30...well 2 hours after the said time he left. We had plans at 11am, so those didn't happen WHICH could have been planned for-like loading up my kids (one being a newborn) in the car and picking him up. No apologies for the extra wait time and never honest about how long it was going to take.\nCome that following week, SURPRISE, there was an oil leak on the garage floor AND the check engine light was back on. So we took it back once again. He was told that it was just old oil coming out and it was fine and that some other piece needed to be replaced for the check engine light. Like why wasn't this fixed the first time!? Unless we got super unlucky and something went wrong within the 3/4 day time.\n\nWell now it's about 4 months later and there's still oil spots on the floor!\nSo we called today, I got a so-so person on the phone and was told to bring it back in, no \"oh my goodness! That's not what we like to hear..please bring it back in!\" It was just \"bring it back\".\n\n1st, can we make the comparison on the comment from Ashton Morgan below?? This was the SAME day, the SAME time and my husband remembers talking and waiting with Ashton.\nWe aren't very knowledgable on car repairs and we should've gotten a 2nd opinion(the Garage in Pelham is literally walking distance and everyone always has great things to say about them, but this was just for a cheap oil change-never again!) ..but we just had a baby and didn't have much spare time or sleep to decide these things with a clear mind.\n\nI just reccomend going somewhere else for piece of mind EVEN for an oil change, even if this was just a random bad day (which look at the rating-use your brains people!

You should look it up. With that said here is our reply to your review.\nI am sorry you are having an issue after the repair but an engine replacement is just that, the engine along with any extra parts that we felt were questionable and they are listed on your invoice. There is not an ECM on your invoice. Please keep in mind that there are several other things under the hood of your car that can also cause future problems. Unfortunately we are not able to detect a component such as an ECM, starter, alternator, Oxygen Sensor, Injector and so on that is about to go bad, it is just impossible. Your vehicle is 11 years old and does have 175,000 miles on and usually parts and components will begin to fail and need replacing after 10 years. This ECM is not covered under warranty because we did not replace this part and it does not come with an engine. I have copied and pasted some information for you that came from a site called my mechanic explaining the ECM\u2019s function to your car. We have ordered the ECM, as you know, and as soon as it is installed and the car is test drove we will call you.\nHere is some information that I pulled from the site \"My Mechanic\" that may help you better understand an ECM's function.\nThe engine control module (ECM), also commonly referred to as the engine control unit (ECU) or powertrain control module (PCM), is one of the most important components found on virtually all  vehicles. It essentially functions as the main computer for many of the vehicle\u2019s engine performance and drivability functions. The ECM takes the information from the engine's various sensors and uses that information to calculate and tune engine spark and fuel for maximum power and efficiency. Erratic engine behavior also indicates a bad or failing ECM. A faulty computer may cause the vehicle to intermittently stall or misfire.

My P30 Step Van was towed in to get a refreshing and almost had to be towed away. I heard their ad on the radio, gave them a call and found out they service Cintas vans. I spoke to the owner Matt on the phone and he assured me that he was the place to come to and he would take care of me. I told him what I wanted done, I also left a list with the most important to be taken care of first (fuel tank leak and master cylinder replacement) with the receptionist. I mentioned new tires but didn\u2019t decide what to install, but he did, and installed them without my consent. Later he said he thought that\u2019s what I wanted \u201cthe cheap ones.\u201d He decided to do what he wanted and void my concerns (that I spoke of on every visit). I was charged over $400.00 in parts (radiator, v belt and lug nuts) plus labor @ $74/hour added without my consent nor were they spoken of when I made payments in person. I was charged ($35.00) for an air cleaner that he had left from a previous vehicle and promised that he wouldn\u2019t charge me for since I was getting so much work done. That Monday of week three, I stopped by to realize no work had been done over the past 5 days and I immediately stopped the work and told them I would be back in the morning to pick up and pay off balance. Next morning I waited over and hour for the motor to be pressure washed like he promised it would be done yesterday by lunch. While waiting he then decided that he would for free replace the master cylinder and patch the fuel tank leak with a $6.00 putty instead of replacing the tank like I asked on day one. All while repairs being done there were no actual receipt/list of parts and labor but guesstimations made until I made final payment. After I reviewed the receipt just before I paid the remaining $1,400+ balance I had to request that Matt break down and fix the double charges on receipt (I was so angry that I missed a few issues on the receipt). A week turned into a month and if I had not stopped the work there\u2019s no telling how long it would have taken to get the van back. Now I\u2019m weeks behind schedule on preparing for the van for body work and getting it wrapped.   The total cost was $3,863.68 and $1,417.25 of it was labor. I felt robbed and played. This place is not worthy of your money and will waste your time\u2026. so please be advised!

I realized this after I paid. Also, the paper work was drawn up and balance paid before he decided to replace master cylinder.\nMatt told me the only man allowed to work on my vehicle had taken off several days due to court date and illness hence why the time frame was pushed back.\nHe spoke negatively about customers in front of me while they were on hold with the receptionist who also was not professional.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1496431288541, "text": "Hello Mr. Adair,\nWe are sorry that you are not happy-- our customers are very important to us.

You brought the vehicle in for the oil leak and we found your axle seal to be leaking. This is on the transmission side of your vehicle. The seal was replaced and you also requested a new drive belt which we happily installed for you. I advised you that there may be further oil leaks, and we would need to keep an eye on it and to bring it back in if oil was still visibly leaking on the ground. You had the vehicle towed in for a no start issue. After 3 hours of diagnosis not charged to you, we found that there was an ECM update needed for the vehicle. This is not a service we provide, and I know the advisor informed you that we were waiting on the programmer to come and flash the ECM. The advisor should of given you a rough estimate of cost for this service and I apologize he did not. We also did not know what the cost would be for the service because it has ranged from $45.00 to $400 in the past. So as we knew the fix, the cost was out of our hands. Once the programmer arrived, he performed the flash on the ECM, the vehicle cranked, and he gave me a bill for $200. We called you, let you know the vehicle was repaired and the cost was $200. We literally did not make one dime off of you, and spent 3 hours of diagnosing to confirm we had the right fix for you ( Normally a $345 cost). If your oil light is still on, then you may have another oil leak on the engine side and would need to address that issue, just as I advised you personally. As far as misgendering, we apologize, not really sure what else to say. We will do better with that situation as a whole. We apologize again for the way you feel. We were just doing our best to get your vehicle back in your hands, at the cheapest cost possible. We are not magicians, nor fortune tellers.

I normally work on my car myself, but am willing to pay others to do so when problems are above my experience. I asked them to fix whatever it was that made the check engine light be on, which I knew was something with the vacuum system. I also asked them to fix two windows that weren\u2019t working. They \u201cfixed\u201d my car and gave it back to me. Well on my drive home, I discovered a rat chewed halfway through my seat belt and left dropping in the floorboard that they did not clean up. The next day I let them know when I got off work and they said to bring it in and they would fix it. And they did, but they replaced my seatbelt with a black one and my interior is grey. When they replaced my window regulators, they left metal chips from drilling all in my carpet and leather interior, so they did not do a clean job and did not clean up after themselves. ALSO, my check engine light came back on and was running the same codes as it was before I brought it to them. So then I had to leave it with them for several more days. They had my car for over one week. One last thing is that my driver window was tight before they serviced it and made no road noise. Now, it leaks air over fifty and I don\u2019t want to have to bring the car back to them for a third time. That same door now makes an awful rattling noise when it shuts, which it also did not do before they touched my car. I have had pleasant experiences with them in the past, and I left reviews those times as well but service was not what it use to be this visit.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1608237580748, "text": "Arthur,\nSorry to hear about your displeasure with our work. Lets start from the top. The vehicle was brought in after you personally attempted to repair many issues with the vehicle yourself and admitted that you may have done something wrong as everything you had done has still not fixed it and the same check engine lights remain on and the vehicle was running rough, even after you worked on it personally. We used our extensive diagnostic equipment and found multiple leaks throughout your vehicles intake system. I personally called and told you we had found these leaks and would need to take off the intake manifold you just put on yourself to see what was going on under it, as that is where the main leak was. I also notified you that there was an code in your ecu for the EGR system and that it may be triggered by the massive intake leak and we would need to correct the major leak first, and let you drive the vehicle to see if there was still an issue with the EGR system. The EGR Valve was also covered with epoxy from what looked to be a band aid repair from a previous time. This could be an issue, but during the diagnosis we did check each component of the system and did confirm the actuators and the valves were operating as they should.  Once we had your approval for the work, we moved forward. Once the intake manifold was removed, we found that you had left the old intake gaskets on the engine and also used the new gaskets of the intake manifold you just replaced. This is what we call being \"double gasketed\" and quickly saw this was the issue with the massive intake leak. We purchased new intake gaskets since the new ones you installed were severely damaged. We removed the old gaskets and cleaned the surface to ensure proper sealing on installation. Everything went together very smooth on the install and a quick smoke test found that the leak was no longer and the issue was repaired. The codes were cleared and the vehicle was test driven and confirmed that the vehicle was running properly and no longer had any further codes in the system. You were called and told the good news and were made aware that the EGR valve was still in question but would need significant miles put on it to be addressed. Once you took the vehicle and drove it, the light came back on and when you brought it back in we found that the same EGR code was back and found that the EGR Valve that you epoxied was blocking the air passage and triggering the light. You were not charged any further diagnosis and we repaired the EGR valve and there was no further issue.\n\nAfter these issues were handled you requested that we look at your windows. The window regulators were found to be the issue at hand and they are riveted in from the factory and are very difficult to perfect. We Use OEM ford rivets and installed them to perfection with the factory holes in the door that were not modified in any way shape or form. I do apologize there is wind noise with the window now, we would be glad to take care of this issue and resolve it for you at no cost.  I was also not aware of the pieces in the floor that were claimed to be left by us, and I sincerely apologize for the possible mess left behind. I would be glad to provide a complimentary vacuum of your interior from a detail shop of your choosing. There was a good bit of mess on the floor, including crumbs and such, so we may of overlooked what mess we made, versus what mess was there before we began our work.\n\nThe seatbelt issue. We have never had a rat issue before at this location. We have been here for 8 years and never once faced an issue of the sort. We have biweekly pest control services done and stay very proactive with pest control due to the known issues of old downtown buildings and sewer systems. When brought to our concern, we replaced your belt with an OEM Ford part and purchased it by your VIN number at no cost. The interior in your vehicle was sun faded and that is why there is a color difference."}, "gmap_id": "0x88891bb89a66390d:0xc218ac2ba8793b57"}

They charged my daughter $100 to tell her that her check engine light meant her gas cap was loose. If they'll take advantage of a 19 y/o girl who's out of state, what else do you think they'll do? Seriously: $100 to read a check engine light code and (literally) tighten a gas cap. #epicfail", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1608235243266, "text": "Kevin, I believe you may not fully understand the process of diagnosis on a vehicle. We take pride in our diagnosis and ensure the diagnosis is correct before we tell a customer any type of estimate. Our standard diagnostic rate is $100 and we roll that fee into the repair if you decided to do the repair with us. We have signage throughout the main office with this verbiage and discuss the process with customers as they drop a vehicle off. But yes, lets walk through it so you and everyone can understand. First, we read that check engine light on the vehicle, and used the $6500.00 computer scanner to do so. We went through and found every lasting detail on the issue down to the date it happened and how often it happened. That is where Autozone stops. They get their $30 scan tool out and tell you 10 guesses of items it could be. So now that we have a lot of data, and approved $100 of diagnostic work on the vehicle ( up to 1 hour of diagnosis ) we can move forward and start using our years of training and knowledge to properly diagnose your vehicle. Now my technician gets out his smoke machine (a $1600 tool)  that pressurizes your daughters Evap Emissions system and also fills the system with smoke so we can determine if there is a leak on the system. Then we put the vehicle on our $4500 lift to ensure that we inspect every inch of the system that has a fault. We also use the scanner in the above mentioned process to activate all of the solenoids of the evap system to ensure they are working properly and letting the system properly work. So now that we have used our multi thousand dollars in tools and years of knowledge that is priceless, we have determined your daughters system is actually in perfectly working condition and the only fault is that a personal mistake happened of someone leaving the gas cap loose! Whew! Seems like quite a lot for such a simple task, right?  Well what if you went by the local auto parts store, got a free scan on the vehicle and they sold you an evap canister for your daughters vehicle and then you take it somewhere for an install and spend $1000.00 and the same problem remains. I am sure this review would look a lot different if you took into consideration the time, the effort, the knowledge, and the care that was put into your 19 year olds daughter vehicle to ensure we did not sell her any parts or service she did not need and made sure she was getting the most honest and best value possible when she put her trust in our shop. I apologize you feel like we took advantage of her. I hope that you see we spent a careful amount of time ensuring we had a proper diagnosis, and realize that doing so does not come free. This business is how we feed our families and have done so for 8 years. If we did not charge customers for diagnosis, then we would become a charity, and likely go out of business, and your daughter would be stuck down the street at the dishonest shop that sold her thousands in repair work that was not needed. I am certainly glad to hear your daughters vehicle is still doing well and the check engine light has not come back on after our thorough diagnosis, with out costing her any extra money.  If you would like to further discuss this issue you are welcome to call me, Michael Lee, the owner whenever you would like to. I would be glad to walk you through our process and make sure you fully understand the extent of work we did ensuring your daughters vehicle was safe and properly diagnosed and why the $100.00 was charged. Most would consider it an #epicsave , you know, since we were the honest shop that did not take advantage of her and took every possible step to make sure her vehicle was diagnosed properly.

When I arrived, I was looking at the vehicle from the outside in before being approached by a salesperson. When the lady finally came up to assist me, I asked if I could look inside of the vehicle - if she had the keys - because the truck was locked. She told me \"no\" but she could take me inside and give me the specs for the vehicle from the tablet. Ok, fine... thats good for the moment. We get in and she starts running numbers on what the payment would be and telling me what the truck had it in based on what was on her tablet... disregarding the fact I asked her multiple times to go outside and get it unlocked so that I could get inside of it and look. I know what I can afford, I already did the numbers before I got here. All I wanted to do was look at it and see if it fit my family's needs. She finally unlocked it but when I started touching the touch screen she yelled at me like I was a kid even though there was little damage I could do to the vehicle (not that it was my intentions but) since the vehicle was in demo mode. I was also not allowed to sit in the drivers seat. She had told me multiple times that the truck was out of my price range, knowing NOTHING about my finances because I had not yet disclosed that information in any form. Then she had the \"manager\" come out and he told me the same thing, that I couldnt afford this vehicle but they could put me in a cheaper vehicle. Long story short, they lost a purchase from a client who makes over $100k per year because \"I couldnt afford that vehicle\". We will take out business on to Prattville to the Chevy dealer up here when they get the 2018 Traverse in stock.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2bc855df96e3:0x97ba0eb72dcdfe02"}

But do not bother taking any foreign vehicle to their shop that needs anything more than an oil change. I had a vehicle break down on me and took it here to avoid towing it to the dealership in Birmingham. I quickly received an estimate of almost $23,000 to fix my suv and was told that I should contact my insurance company because it was totaled.\n\nI ended up taking it to the dealership for a second opinion (like I should have to begin with) and ended up only paying $3700 to repair what was wrong with my suv, and that didn\u2019t include a single thing listed on the original estimate sent to me by CBA.\n\nI really wish they would have just turned me away before I took it there in the first place if they could not service my vehicle instead of guessing what the problem was and writing it off as a lost cause.\n\nI called CBA last week to update them on the status of my vehicle and to let them know what really was wrong with it - all they wanted to know was how \u201creputable the shop was that I took my vehicle to\u201d and to try to tell me that they never referred to my car as totaled. Not only did they put us in a horrible situation, they also tried to act like they never said the things they did and asked what exactly I was expecting from my phone call.

I have no disapproval towards the individual employees there.\n\nWith that said, that is unfortunately the extent of my positives about the business. I've brought two of my vehicles there a total of three times, over the course of two years, and each time, I have been disappointed. My first vehicle had a minor oil leak, and I took it to CBA to check it out. Long story short, they charged me over $1000 and a week of time, and in the end, the issue wasn't resolved. Brought my vehicle to another shop on Atl Highway, $250 later, and it was fixed. All in all, this wasn't a huge deal, but I was disappointed in CBA.\n\nFast forward 2 years, and i take another one of my vehicles that I had just purchased to CBA for a post-purchase full diagnosis (This alone cost $120) which they assured me would cover just about everything i needed to get done to the vehicle to get it to top shape. They quoted me over $5,000 worth of service. This alone wasn't completely insane. It was an older vehicle, and yes, a good few things needed fixing. However, I jotted down the items they told me I needed to replace and decided to do the items myself (brake change, coolant flush, oil change, filters, etc). Took off the brakes. The Pads, Rotors were literally brand new. They said my front caliper mount and caliper itself were in terrible condition. Completely false--it was in perfect condition upon further inspection. Performed the coolant change after they claimed it was dirty and needed changing (btw they quoted me $140 for the coolant change, which if you know, is one of the easiest things you can do yourself for $20 worth of coolant and 30 min of your time max). This also turned out to be unecessary. The coolant I drained was the exact same color as the new coolant I purchased myself. I did this for every item on the list of things they told me I needed to change, and the ONLY thing that actually needed to be changed was the front driver struts and the radiator fan.\n\nA week after I get the $5000 list of things that need to be serviced, I drive to Atlanta. Halfway there on the interstate, my timing/fan belt shred apart, engine overheats, and my car is disabled. Tow it to a garage nearby and they inform me that my water pump was well on its way out, A/C compressor had imploded, and timing/fan belts should have been changed a long time ago. NONE OF THESE WERE MENTIONED BY CBA. Fortunately I did not get into an accident, but I trusted CBA to diagnose what I needed to fix on my vehicle, and they failed to mention, at all, three incredibly easy to inspect components that were failing, and caused my vehicle to stop driving in the middle of the highway. Absolutely unacceptable.\n\nIf you're reading this, CBA, come on, step your game up. If you're going to charge one of the highest rates in the entire state of Alabama, maybe provide service that backs up that rate. I respect you all as individuals, but  as a \"reputable automotive service center\", I am appalled.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1596806181463, "text": "We take your detailed feedback seriously, as our customers' safety and satisfaction are very important to us.

CBA was the only other shop I called, as soon as Danny answered my call he said he knew he had to help me, not to worry, they would do everything they could to get me through this. He did. He helped me get it towed from Prattville to their shop in Montgomery. Kept me updated every step of the way and constantly reassured me that they were there to help. My car, unfortunately, had some very major issues and even at CBA prices still was out of my price range. But, I didn't leave without transportation. Danny went above and beyond to help me find a suitable vehicle that I could afford and I left yesterday the owner of a reliable, running vehicle. The people of CBA are some of the kindest people I have had the blessing of meeting. They are truly doing works that reflect the epitome of Christians.

They are just using \"Christian Brothers\" for marketing purposes, not to show a genuine Christian nature. I went in for an alternator swap. I knew it was the alternator and told them as much; didn't stop them from charging me $48 to \"diagnose\" the problem. That was for an half hour of labor which if you want to count the time it took for them to tell me the price, was not a half hour after I brought it in. So yes, their hourly labor rate is $96 which strikes me as a little high, and yes, they don\u2019t mind rounding up to the detriment of the customer. The rest of the bill was just as offensive and out of tune with normal auto repair prices. A re-manufactured alternator for my car was $117 at the time, they charged $244.20 and kept the core fee for themselves. No, they didn't put a new one in, just a re-man. They then charged me $39.78 for a serpentine belt, which I don't mind that they replaced, but a new one at any auto parts store runs around $20. So paying twice for parts is pretty painful, but then they add on a fee for \"shop supplies\"; I'm not sure what for, wear and tear on the tools? A paper towel or two? Whatever they were, they cost me $37.10. You'd think that \"shop supplies\" would be included when you pay premium for the parts and labor. On top of all of that, they padded the hours they were replacing the alternator. They charged me for 1.5 hours ($144.09) but the guy was only working on it for 45 minutes tops. The rest of the time that it was in their garage it just sat there. That's right, a car in Christian Brothers Automotive's garage is accruing labor costs even if it just sits there, hate to see what the overnight tab would be. Just think of the \u201cshop supplies\u201d that leaked into a car that sat there overnight.\n\nThey have three salesman upfront and only two technicians when I was there. This shows their focus: extract every possible penny from a potential customer, especially if he is from out of town. Why pay extra techs when you are still billing for the time that the car sits in their garage right? Another indication of their less-than-honest nature is that they put all these odd-ball prices on the parts and shop fees. Like what is with the 10 cents on shop supplies, they couldn't round that off? Well they could, but they don't want you to realize that they are just padding the bill. Ten cents looks more authentic. They also have a sign in the back that says: \"Ask every customer: Is there anything else we can check for you today?\" I'd hate to see the proposal for work you get back when you give these guys a greenlight to check out your entire car.\n\nThe technicians were good, the alternator seems to be working out fine. But the salesmen are only good at small talk. They brought my car back out of the garage and it started to smoke. They thought the engine was about to explode or something they turn it off and frantically check the oil. When I get out there they say that the oil pan is empty. Nope, check again. When they checked again they saw that it was half full like I knew it was. The smoke was from the debris that got knocked down onto the serpentine belt. Some debris that my $37.10 in shop supplies should have cleaned up. Guess not.\n\nAll-in-all, I paid $545 for a pretty simple fix, and they quoted me on the phone $250 as I was driving trying to get somewhere before my car died. I guess they knew they had me, but I hope this review saves somebody else the expense and frustration of dealing with these guys. These guys bend you over with a smile on their face. If you want this type of service and pay these type of prices, just go to the dealer, at least they are more knowledgeable about your car.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2db31cb0a5bf:0x2c43880b4b10967d"}

I know it's all to protect them from liability suits. What ever happened to trust, recommendations, honest opinions? Every answer to every question seemed will rehearsed. Two days later my alternator goes out! Maybe a coincidence, but it seems like everyone I put my trust in the professionals, things start going wrong with my car. Don't trust mechanics, lawyers, maintenance individuals, had one of them tell me, \"if we fix it too well, we'll be out of a job, always have to leave something for another day.\" There's no real honest people in this area, not anymore. Bureaucrats have got their fingers into everything. Law suits are the \"American Way!\" So you can't really blame them to avoid taking responsibility for their actions. I know what my part costs, they were going to charge me nearly $500 in labor to loosen and tighten bout 6 bolts? A little extreme, they did an estimate but I never got to see it, I asked to see the defective part, but was given the excuse we would have to put it back on the lift. Since it wasn't on the lift, they had no plans to fix it!\n\nAllen from Phenix Firestone called, his only concern was why I was so critical of him. I thought that was clear, but this was the second time I took this vehicle there for the same issue, the first time I was told nothing was wrong with it. In any case in order to resolve the problem Allen stated, \"we're not working in your cars anymore!\" I guess I hurt his feelings?\n\nI used to love taking a vehicle to Phenix Firestone, always felt like they were looking out for me, always trusted them! Now I get the feeling I'm unimportant, it's really changed over the years!\n\nEnough said hope you all have a great holiday I'll be home fixing my cars!

So, if an auto center changes your brakes in 30 min but the book says it takes 1.5 hours, then the shop charges you for the extra hour as an extra rake. Now, I do not mind paying the extra as long as the quality matches. This shop may do quick work, but it is not at the quality I am paying for. Poor value given, and they would not make it right either. Basically the repair guy did not remove all the necessary components (like a radiator) to save some time and shoved the water pump in at an angle.\n\nI will never use them again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888c4e6e0b99431:0x62babd6da353f44f"}

They fixed both and stuck to fair estimate.\n\nI wouldn't do business with them now after my last experience.\n\nMonth 1 & 2\nOur car needed a new engine. The shop owner wanted to get an engine from his supplying junkyard. He missed one that became available. This process took about 2 weeks before we decided to find an engine ourselves which he was not happy with but agreed to. He said they could have it put in within a 3 day period. The engine company we bought from needed it done in 10 days for warranty purposes. Griffith used all of the 10 days to because other cars came in front of me while we had to wait on engine. They finally got it in and started but had to send to dealership because the car went into anti-theft mode and wouldn't start. We had to actually arrange the drop off to the dealership ourselves. I feel like we were running his business for him because he was almost never there. The employees even mentioned that problem in passing.\n\nMonth 3\nWe become worried after not hearing anything from dealership or Griffin for about 2.5ish weeks. I had to contact dealership for them to tell me that they told Griffin that the car needed a major fuse panel that could be $1200+. I called Griffin to tell him I approved the install because we really needed the car. It's month 3 folks!\n\nIs it Month 4? Getting close anyway.\nWe had to go ourselves to the dealership to confront them about not getting to our car. This should be Griffin's job. The dealership says that the part didn't fix the problem. Car still doesn't work. We decide to give up because the car needed another part for $2400 to \"maybe\" fix. We decide to just give up. Dealership is trying to get more money from us even though they didn't fix the problem. Griffin is trying to put that on us. We said we would pay for his time, but does this seem fair? Griffin himself might be a knowledgable mechanic, but he is a rookie business owner with no organization or management skills of his people.  He wasted a huge amount of our time (3+months), money ($6000+) and stressed my wife and I to no end. We are going to have to scrap our car with a new engine that doesn't run.\n\nThey do good oil changes and put a muffler on another car we brought, but he also made me pay for the part up front which shows bad business to me as well.\n\n* FINAL RESULT\npaid griffin $1400 because the car ended up not working out. He said he made no money and it would have been $2000 if it had worked + whatever it would be to charge AC. When we walked in to pay he didn't even recognize us. My wife and I talked to this guy several times in person and on phone. The waiting area had mice running around too FYI if you are scared of them. After that we went to the dealer shop that had our car and basically gave it to the tech working on it. he paid for the dealer work and gave us a little cash. When we went to clean the car out I noticed that the driver seat leather looked very dirty and worn.

I went in to get oil change and a get a quote on new master cylinder for my son's car. My son had a free oil change card that his mother gave him.  This his first oil change of his first car I bought him last year. He's had the card for over a year and it has no expiration date on it. The service tech \"manager\" said he didn't think the card was still good. Again, it had no expiration date on it. He said well it should've been signed by manager, though there's no place for it to be signed by a manager. The \"manage\" said well anyone could've just picked it up and put the date on it and brought it back.  I said I didn't do that nor did my son or his mother. I told him I didn't appreciate being accused of stealing a free oil change card. He said two other people did that yesterday. I said that is not my fault nor an excuse to accuse me of doing the same thing. He could not understand what he had done over a $34.95 oil change. He called the owner and the owner said the card fine, of course. He did not apologize for accusing me of stealing the free oil change card. He said he had to make sure it was ok or it would come out of his paycheck. Again, no reason to ever utter someone could have just picked one up and brought it in unsigned. All he had to say is he had to call his owner to see how to process the card not accuse me of possibly stealing it. With that lack of ability to understand the damage to the customer for your handling of this made me question giving someone like that the responsibility to work on the brakes on my son's car. So, I took my free oil change card from his fingertips and told the inexperienced \"manager\" that I'd take my business elsewhere. As I left he said the free oil change card was \"null and void\". He just had to be right. He would not listen to the customer who was getting ready to pay $559 for work plus and extra $36 for the full synthetic oil change. Hint empathy people. I only do business with people I like period and though I just met this guy he gave me reason not to like him in under 10 minutes. I had never been in a Meineke in my life until today and will never do so again. Thanks to this manager at the South Huntsville shop. I wonder if this is the intent of the Meineke representative who gave this card to my son's mother?", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1622217384048, "text": "Hi Tom, this should never be the impression we leave.

They were able to replace that at no cost to me. Secondly, screws were missing and clips weren't reinstalled. The manager assured me they would be replaced, and they were. Lastly the radiator was mounted improperly (very wobbly, almost hitting the engine). This was initially resolved with plastic zip ties and told by the manager that it was repaired and I was good to go. Obviously this was unacceptable at an initial service fee of $105/hr.

My father took his truck up there a week before to get transmission treatment and oil change. The next day the transmission fell out of the truck and he had to buy a new transmission. They also put way too small of an oil filter on his truck.\n\nBasically, they use the cheapest stuff and charge you a premium price. They do terrible work, and they do not care what happens to your property. They are very pushy salesmen when it comes to the useless (or harmful) and overpriced additives that they want you to buy. I took my Mustang back to them and asked them to replace the oil with what it needs. They refused. I ended up being on the phone with the management and all I got offered was $20.00 off another oil change. The oil change they just have me with flushing out my coolant and oil and replacing coolent and the wrong oil was just over $200.00.  Needless to say, I change my own oil now and use Royal Purple oil (the best) and K&N oil filters. If you do it yourself, you know it is done right with the best parts and is cheaper.

It is torn, off of its track, dry-rotted and very obviously needs replacing. The man at the front desk walks out with me to my car to see the problem and sees it as clearly as I could. We went back into the shop to set up an appointment that ended up being for a whole week later which was excessively long for the possibility of my car getting flooded if it rained. Today after the week had gone by, I took my car in told them my name and that I had an appointment, which they seemed not to even have on their books of me scheduling, asked for my address, phone number, and for the keys. Nearly 2 hours later I finally get a call back from them saying they didn\u2019t have the part in stock, that they hadn\u2019t done any kind of research on what my options were before my appointment (which we agreed they would do), told me they couldn\u2019t get the seal as an individual part but would have to replace the whole sunroof instead, and that if I wanted that done it would be over $700 for it or if not that they would only charge $110 for running their \u201cdiagnostics\u201d. A fee for \u201cDiagnostics\u201d to look at my car for no more than a minute to tell my seal had dry-rotted and needed replacing, really?

NOPE, I go home, switch out all my personal items, bring back my Jeep only to be told that they made a mistake on the trade-in price of my Jeep, and that I would need to pay them $3000 more or give the Honda Pilot back....which I did and they sold it to another lady waiting to buy it that day!  How convenient.  Buying a car is supposed to be a joyous experience, and this experience was anything but!  I was so hurt, I had to wait several days before I was able to even speak about the situation.  My intentions for this review is to inform potential buyers that they should be proceed with caution when dealing with King Honda of Auburn!  -Genia B.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c132456a45:0x37bab76a5afd1067"}

Well needless to say, this caused me extreme stress and anxiety. At this moment, I picked up the phone and gave Mr. Dave King of King Honda Auburn a call. Immediately, he pledged his absolute commitment to working with Service Manager Randy Melius and the other dedicated service professionals to identify and fix my ignition problems. Within two days of making contact with Mr. Dave King and getting my car to King Honda of Auburn, my fears subsided. His service team did just what was assured to me. I am no longer living in fear of my car not starting which compromised the safety my family and me.\n\nIn closing, please know that the automotive professionals of King Honda of Auburn will be there for you years after the ink dries on your purchasing contract.
