I have never once written a review like this, I have worked in Customer Service for almost 10 years, and I always give benefit of doubt.  In this case, Walton and Tower absolutely deserves this review:\n\nI recently moved from Kansas to Alabama for work, and due to the Pandemic, could not travel to view homes prior to my relocation.  My family helped tour properties, and I saw pictures and videos to help make my decision.  The home I found in Odenville, AL looked amazing from the initial pictures. Walton and Tower Real Estate made many promises that the house would be in \u201clike-new\u201d condition by the time I arrived. So I loaded up a 26\u201d U-Haul, signed a lease and headed to Alabama. My nightmare started the day I walked through the doors for the very first time.\n\nPrior to leaving a rental property, it is a standard that the property be professionally cleaned/repaired/painted prior to another tenet moving in.  Every time I move out of a property, I pay to have a professional group clean it, out of my pocket. I was given assurances by Walton that this would all be handled prior to my arrival, especially given my situation.  To my shock, it was a mess.  During a Global Pandemic, this company did not have the house professionally cleaned or sanitized in any meaningful way.  Here are just a few examples of things I had to deal with on my first night (before I could even start to unpack):\n-\tThe ceiling fans had a half an inch of dust on every arm (hard to miss even for an amateur cleaning company).\n-\tHUMAN HAIR in the bathtubs and floors.\n-\tFood particles and stain in the microwave, and on the cooking surfaces.\n-\tThe counters in the kitchen were sticky with grease, food, and god knows what else.\n-\t All the Stainless-Steel appliance surfaces had stains.\n-\tTONS of dust above the fridge, cabinets, edges, fans, and several surfaces throughout.\n- The kitchen/bathroom floors had not been mopped, one pass with my Swiffer mop and the pad was solid black.\n-\tSpiderwebs still hanging in the breezeways inside the house.\n-\tThe worst part was the carpets, walking on it in socks you could feel your feet sticking to sections of it.  Gallons of black SLUDGE filled my own personal carpet cleaner after running it in only one room of the house.  The carpets had NOT been cleaned.\n\nThe house was disgusting, and the reaction of W&T was even more disgusting. In this Global Pandemic, cleanliness matters\u2026 I spent hours scrubbing surfaces, carpet cleaning, mopping, and using specialized cleaning products on every corner of the house.  One wipe with just a damp paper towel would pick up handfuls of dust and grim.\n\nWhen I called the management group for help, their response was nothing short of inappropriate, I did NOT get a callback, but instead an EMAIL saying they found the cleaning of the home to be \u201csatisfactory\u201d. Imagine you go to the hospital to have surgery, and afterwards you wake up and the doctor tells you, \u201cWell, I didn't do everything I was supposed to, but I think I did a satisfactory job\u201d,  no one would be happy with that result.  I have given this company multiple chances to help in any way to fix this issue, and at every turn they have either ignored my requests, or shrugged me off as a \"difficult\" tenet ONE WEEK IN.

Both this review and reply are being written after only two weeks of occupancy of the house. As mentioned, the tenant had multiple family members view the house prior to leasing. Both emails and phone calls have resulted in threats by the tenant to harm our business after a demand for cash was made. We do not \u201cpay off\u201d tenants to keep them from leaving negative reviews. We are sincerely sorry for the overlooked dust above the refrigerator and on ceiling fan blades, but we do not believe that these items show a lack of concern for tenant safety during the pandemic as is asserted in this review.\nWhile we believe things like streaky stainless steel are subjective, timely payment of rent is not. It is part of a binding lease agreement-signed by both property manager and tenant. The first two rent payments due from the tenant were late resulting in $215 in late fees. As the tenant seemed to be unclear about the terms of the lease he signed, we initially refunded the fees as a one-time courtesy only to receive emails threatening to contact the property owner or \u201chandle himself\u201d if he was not given money for what he deemed an unsatisfactory cleaning. He made good on those threats with the above review. We do not pay off tenants. We made efforts prior to his arrival to make for an easy transition by arranging for the key to be at the house rather than being picked up from our office as is standard procedure, fielded calls from family members about matters that had been responded to days before and again, waived late fees that were a result of a failure to comply to a binding lease agreement. As mentioned by the tenant, we also had someone from our office go to the house to discuss his complaints in person.\nWe cannot find reason where none exists.

I have been renting with them for around 14 months now. If you qualify and meet their standards they are wonderful to work with. If you are paying your rent in full and on time, they will go above and beyond to meet your needs. However, if there is an unexpected life turn, even notifying them will not help. I was laid off at work and could no longer afford the rent. Even their qualifications say that you must make 3x the rent in a months time. I now make less than 2x the rent. I notified them of my life changes thinking that was right thing to do, but as I had forgotten, just remember they have a contract in place and that is what they will go by like any other business. They are still a great company despite my disagreements and misunderstandings on some of their business practices, but if are going into renting with them knowing there is even a possibility of financial changes in your life, I would not recommend them.\n\nAdding in response to owners reply. They did offer me release option, but ultimately that is continuing to pay the rent in full as usual until it is released, sold, or until end of your lease (which ever comes first). This is extremely risky option for someone who cannot afford the rent in the first place. Can\u2019t afford their rent, but they want you to pay two rents while waiting for them to find another person to lease. Great idea guys. Even when I offered to pay 3 months rent, plus them keeping deposit to end lease ( 6400 total).  They claim they can get it leased in a month or two (3200 total) so why not take the 6400 total and let me go? Hmmm, wonder if it\u2019s because they cannot/ or don\u2019t try to immediately lease it out??? Just a thought. You have to move out before they will begin to show, again paying two rents. Not a great option when I cannot afford their rent, so no that\u2019s not helpful as he claims. Not sure how that helps me at all as they are \u201chelping me out of a bad situation\u201d. And I have signed and returned the release option papers, so I am unaware of what that is about. I even got confirmation emails they were received, which I am happy to provide to anyone showing the dates of his post vs the dates of the emails. Also, I highly doubt I am the only person that has gotten frustrated from being in a financially binding situation, so not sure how that deems me the most difficult with this type situation. Again, great company, until you are in a financial situation where you cannot make rent.\n\nUpdate on this (today 7/30/19), as if the owner below saying I did not sign and return the forms in June wasn\u2019t enough, just got a call saying they did not have the forms (supposedly) and could not process anything. I told them I had email confirmation that all forms were received and would be glad to forward that over. Was told that worker was on maternity leave and they could not access email to get the forms. Not sure how that\u2019s my problem??? But sure, I\u2019ll redo everything again since you cannot properly arrange cover while employees are out on leave. \ud83d\ude04", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1561389386223, "text": "Cindy,\nThank you for clarifying the fact that we hold renters to the agreement that they signed.

We didn't file a police report as there was no evidence that a break in had actually occurred.

First of all, we listed our home during the Covid-19 pandemic of 2020.  Moreover, our home was in the higher price range for the Huntsville area (only 8 homes in the price range had sold in the previous year).  When we were interviewing potential real estate agents, many of the candidates told us we should expect it to take two to three years to sell our home.  Christine did not.  She told us she would market our home locally and nationally and that she would find us a buyer at a fair price.\n\nThe marketing was fabulous!  Great photos, aerial drone pictures, a video walkthrough as well as a high-tech simulated 3-D viewing system.  We were very impressed!  Nonetheless, we were worried because during the pandemic, lending on higher-priced homes became very tight.  Nonetheless, we received a number of offers quickly.  Unfortunately, the initial offers were too low.  Christine had done an appraisal on the home and encouraged us to wait as she said our listing price was very fair.  We took her advice and ended up with several interested buyers in an acceptable price range and we sold our home.\n\nThe closing went very smoothly because Christine and her team tied up quite a few loose ends to complete the transaction.  We had already moved out-of-state and relied on Christine and her team to coordinate the resolution of all the inspection items as well as the sale of our pool table and the shipping of a several furniture pieces we had left in the house to an antique store to be sold on consignment.  Talk about full service!  Everything was wrapped up within six months and we could not be happier!

Bottom line:  BEST choice I could have made when listing my home for sale! At literally the last possible moment, I made the decision to move 700 miles away for a career move.  Purchasing a new home that I found and loved, required me to sell my current home.  Here\u2019s the kicker\u2026we had 6 days to so, and I was at that time on vacation. We called and spoke with Angie, thinking there was probably not a chance it could happen.  Angie immediately agreed to go to our home for us while we were gone, and give an assessment.  Within minutes, she was on the phone with us, with a plan, and more importantly to me, complete confidence that we could do this. We traveled home, and now with only four days left to get an offer, we did basic cleaning, had pictures taken, and the home was listed. Finally, within 12 hours of listing, and still more than 3 days from our deadline, we had an offer.  The offer was even ten thousand over asking price! The amount of and quality of work that Angie put in for us, was in my opinion astronomical. Her listing style, describing the house was something I had never seen before.  It would have made me want to purchase my home all over again!  Finally, I am a no nonsense kinda guy, and I can be difficult. I\u2019ll be the first to admit that I have very little patience.  This for me was the greatest attribute that Angie displayed during the process.  She was attentive, and amazingly responsive. It did not matter what time of day it was, Angie would respond to any questions I had.  No matter what, she was sure to communicate with me every single detail of the process.  If I needed anything, she was on it and never once did I feel like I couldn\u2019t get answers.  A little over a month later, I\u2019m now moved 700 miles away, moved into my new home, and couldn\u2019t be more thankful to Angie.  Looking back at the process, and the seemingly endless list of tasks that are required when selling and purchasing a house simultaneously, I\u2019m adamant that I would not have been able to do this in the required amount of time if it hadn\u2019t been for Angie.  If you are like me, have no patience, want immediate results, want immediate answers, quick communication, a no-nonsense approach, an absolutely amazing listing style, and finally a perfect balance between professionalism and friendliness, then search no further.

We had originally booked a different condo that was closer to the Hangout Festival. There was a problem with the owners of that condo, and we were moved to this one. I was a bit upset because we were staying with another couple, and we were now sharing a studio apartment. There was ZERO privacy. It would be a great condo for just one couple or a small family, though. I also have to say that Bender was very sweet about it, and refunded me some of my money for the inconvenience.  I was also scared when I saw the pictures of the place. The pictures DEFINITELY need to be updated. It looks much better in person. It is very very clean, but it needs to be updated. There is no dishwasher, which was a bit of a pain. Also all of the dishes were ceramic and glass, which were not allowed at the pool or anything- I'd recommend bringing some plastic cups and paper plates. The location was AMAZING. Right on the beach. I really enjoyed the patio in the mornings. The pool was lovely, and the beach was perfection. If you are renting this place for Hangout Fest, know that this is quite the walk! We were told it was a mile away but it was actually  1.4 miles, which means that its about a 3 mile walk every day. So be prepared! Overall our stay was much better than expected, but the condo could use some updating and it was a little further than I had hoped for.

From the very first interaction over the phone, I got a good vibe from him. I can't stand the pushy car salesman type and he couldn't be further from that. He has a calm, focused demeanor that is both professional and friendly. As many others have noted, Dean was quick to respond to our inquiries as well as accommodating of our unusual communication hours (nightshift). Did I mention we are an active duty military family purchasing from out of state?? He made it an easy process and was so helpful in giving us information we wouldn't have known not being local, like which areas were convenient to shopping and highly-rated schools for our kids. In fact, he found and sent us the listing that ultimately became our new home before it was on any of the popular real estate sites. I believe this gave us an edge in an extremely competitive market. Ask for his opinion! He isn't pushy, but is more than willing to share his recommendation if you ask, which was very appreciated on our end. He also spotted a few things for the seller to address before the closing that I would have never noticed. I truly cannot recommend Dean enough!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1621531049421, "text": "Thank you Alicia! I loved how you said I wasn't \"pushy\". Nobody likes pushy. Yet so many people are.

Being a former Realtor myself in Tennessee, I'm aware of the responsibility an agent has to their client.  When we hired Mr. Stanton, we were pleased with his feedback and demeanor.  As time passed the feedback, both from his weekly calls stopping and the review emails from the property viewings, slowed down significantly, however we would still consider it satisfactory.  Throughout listing our property with Mr. Stanton, we provided him with all of the information he requested.  However, 36 hours from closing, we were told that we would have to pay our property pool assessment to the tune of $4700.  It was our understanding this would be assumed by the new buyers.  At first he said that he didn't want to go around and around if we told him or not (which we did upon hiring him), but he was aware of our other assessment, so the logic of knowing one but not the other makes no sense.  As I stated in an email to him, even if we pretend that we didn't pass along the information, he's presented himself as one of the most knowledgable and successful agents in the area with lot of experience at the Gulf Shores Plantation.  How would an expert agent who does business there all the time, not be aware to ask about an assessment that began a year and a half ago, which all units there had.  He then proceeded to tell us that he checked on it and the assessment was non-transferrable and could not be assumed by the buyer, which we double checked with our HOA and that was untrue.  We had to pay it because our agent didn't negotiate that on our behalf in the contract.  We gave him a grace period to do something to make it right and were basically told that it just was what it was.  Instead, Mr. Stanton tried to force the situation/closing like everything was common practice.  Had any effort been shown to correct this or any financial responsibility whatsoever been taken, we absolutely wouldn't have posted reviews on every website we could.  As we indicated to the company before closing, with this not happening, we felt like we needed to let our HOA, others rental services and the general public know our experience with Mr. Stanton and Exit Realty.\n\nOne of their brokers/owners stepped in to call us to see what could be done and apologized repeatedly, saying he believed it was an honest mistake and that it has changed how they will do things in the future.  He said on all future transactions, they will have a disclosure form for things like assessments.  First, I am shocked that's not already common practice as I know in Tennessee everything has a disclosure.  Second, I am glad that this error may have changed how Exit Realty does business, but it was at $4700 of my expense.  We hope this helps anyone who is looking to list or buy in the future and will assist you in assuring the same thing doesn't happen to anyone else", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0546b1066981:0xc327fec7a2544bfa"}

I spent most of the summer looking at both options but had difficulty in reaching a decision.  Each time I procrastinated, the house sold before I could make up my mind.  Amy warned me that this season was a sellers market and houses were selling on the first day of listing.  I finally saw a townhouse that I loved and attempted to put a contract on the property.  Amy told me that I should offer one price but I hesitated and wanted to offer a lower price.  After losing the bid on two townhouses, Amy continued to search in every area of town she thought I would like.  On this particular morning she texted me and said another townhouse had come on the market in the neighborhood I desired and I needed to act on it if I was interested.  She arranged for me to tour the property immediately.  Again I was trying to decide if this is what I should do, so she informed me of an alternative option to secure the property.  I finally decided to submit the bid and again she admonished me to rethink my offer as there were others looking at the property.  I adjusted my price according to her advice and to my surprise, my offer was accepted.  Amy walked me through every step of the process which resulted in a more than satisfactory result.  She worked tirelessly with me to make sure I understood all the terminology, options and closing attorney.  I moved in my home in October and have been very satisfied with the process and my new home.  I highly recommend Amy as she is very knowledgeable not only with the current housing market, but every detail of the loan process.  She made sure I got the best with the least amount of confusion.  I have had other realtors in the past; however, Amy was hands on day and night to assure me that I understood terminology, what was expected from me and what would be acceptable with the seller. I have recommended her to several others that I felt would benefit from her handling their own journey.   I know you will be glad you've chosen Amy to represent you in your next home purchase.

The first two Realtors loved the house, did a walk through and immediately gave me a briefing about their qualifications and then presented me with a quote that looked like It was a duplicate of the quote we received about 2 years ago when we tried to sell.  We weren't impressed.  We didn't feel that they put a lot of thought into our home.  Our third Realtor was Michael Rosenblum.  Just as the others, he proceeded to walk through the house.  When he returned, he handed me, not a quote, but a brochure about Rosenblum Realty.  He then proceeded to suggest to me several upgrades in the house that we should consider before putting it on the market.  Again, he did not give me a quote, but he offered to help me get the work done at a reasonable price.  We completed the upgrades and then signed with Rosenblum Realty.  Michael took pictures of the house immediately and helped us with staging services as well.  The brochure was beautifully done.  It was so nice we kept several copies to show our family and friends.  Our house sold in about 6 months at full price.  We appreciated the dedication Michael had in selling our home.  It made us feel as if our house was the only one he had to sell.

This house was moved out of and abandoned without any cleaning at all. Our purchasing agent contacted Ms. Burbach throughout the process prior to the final walk through and we were assured the house would be cleaned prior to closing. These pictures were taken at the final walk through and provided to Ms. Burbach and her response was that she did not see a problem. After a lengthy back and forth between agents, we were subsequently offered $50 to cover the cleaning of this house in a take it or cancel the closing statement from Ms. Burback. Multiple cleaning agencies were contacted and the same pictures that are attached here were provided to them, and all promptly declined to clean this house for a measly $50. We have spent countless hours cleaning this house on our own over the last week, to get it to an acceptable point to even start moving in. Keller Williams and Ms. Burback conduct in this situation is inexcusable.\n\nAdditionally, many items that were attached to the house at the showing were removed prior to the final walk through (Ring door bell system, digital dead bolts, TV mounts in the bedrooms). None of these items were disclosed in the listing documents as intended to be uninstalled from the house prior to closing (all were assumed to be left at the house as they were attached/installed on the house). All of these removed items left multiple large holes in and marring on the associated walls or door that were not repaired.\n\nIf you are a purchaser, beware.

In a matter of weeks we found a house we liked in the Reserve. Jayne managed to negotiate the price 10000 dollars off the listing, and we've been pleased with our experience with Keller Williams ever since.\n\nRecently, I discovered a roof leak, so I called a roof inspector, and he said the leak was due to improper flashing around the chimney. The final quote to repair our damaged living room ceiling and to reflash the chimney was 1400 dollars.\n\nI contacted the home inspector we'd originally hired to catch things like this, and I requested a full refund for the $250 dollars I'd paid him, but he refused. \"Contract only covers a year,\" he said rather tersely.\n\nSo I crafted an email to Keller Williams to offer feedback on the inspector they'd suggested and ended it with, \"I am merely offering this letter as feedback so your company may suggest home inspectors who value things like work ethics and customer satisfaction.\"\n\nA day later, I received a response from Robert Simons, team leader, who offered a $250 dollar reimbursement for the inspection cost.\n\n\"While you state that you recognize that Keller Williams Realty does not have any responsibility for Mr. Owens not observing the wear of your flashing, I want to offer to reimburse you for the cost of the inspection in good faith and to thank you for your trust in Keller Williams Realty and Jayne.\"\n\nI was aghast. I don't know how else to put it.\n\nKeller Williams is top notch in customer satisfaction. They run an honest business, and I'll certainly rely on them again in the future.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889f8d369a8326d:0x46375f0f3570cf1c"}

We have a maintenance dispatcher that sits and communicates between owners, contractors and tenants.  The delay sometimes is caused by not receiving quick owner approvals or requests for additional bids which are not the PMs fault. We do our best to find the best solution for ALL parties involved.  This means even coming out of our pocket at times to make the situation work. We deal with everyone honestly and we understand that maintenance concerns upset tenants when there is a delay. We request that if you have a question, please bring it to us directly and we will attempt to get you a quick answer."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626cefccd65b01:0x673fc930957d877"}

If you can, avoid her and the rental business. The property we rented had tar dripping from the walls when he it was extremely muggy outside. I actually video tapped the tar so people could actually see it. Gross. The toilet constantly flooded which was disgusting. The stove did not work. There was actually paint all inside the top burner that couldn't be removed. We had to buy a counter stove. Yes, this bad. She knew about this too. Her response was oh this should be easy to get out. No. The kitchen cabinets were nasty and had cigarette tar on them and full of sticky stuff. Could've come off. When we moved in we hired a company to come in and they couldn't clean much of the mess. Michelle was there when the housekeepers where there trying to clean up a mess that should have been cleaned before we even moved in. The cleaners actually apologized for not being able to help. Michelle didnt say a word. The floor in the master bedroom smells like cat or dog pee. Need air freshener to try and kill the smell. The floors and cabinets needs to be replaced. This is just the inside. No dishwasher or garbage disposal. Refrigerator broke down a few times. I hate to say this. It puts the people on the spot who work for her, but the actually called her a slumlord. I have a little statement from one of them. I dont want to name drop. The bugs. The house is full of them. We have a exterminator that comes out but doesnt do us any good. We have even tried our own methods but doesnt work. Some of the windows did not open when we first moved in. We had to force a couple of them. Finally my husband decided to video tape it because it wouldn't open. Then when it did the screens where tore up. Cant keep the windows open. She should have done a walk THROUGH when she bought this house or had it inspected. IDK if she did. Its pretty bad. The instillation is horrible. The electricity bill costs double to keep us cool due to poor installation and poor air conditioning that has broken down that needed to be fixed.

Our interest in selling our home was high and we took a chance with Southern State Realty Partners. I had so many questions throughout the process and each one was answered with detailed information. Our home had a contract within the first two days of being listed and was not just a result of a 'hot' market, but of the work done by Jeff and Chelsea. My wife and I decided not to build a home as originally planned after the sell of our home. This could have been a stress induced nightmare, but Jeff took us to view a couple of homes and found one we really thought was best for our family. The offer was written up that night and accepted. We moved in to our new home in less than a month! Selling and moving is often hard on the mind and body, but I felt more at ease and joyful because I knew who was working for me.

My rent was always due by the 6th well they changed that and did not tell me then tried to charge me 50$ extra for Jan Feb and March claiming I was late but they just took too long to deposit my checks. NOT AT ANY POINT IN TIME WAS I CONTACTED AND MADE AWARE OF ANY LATE CHARGES. I HAD TO FIND THE INFORMATION ON MY ONLINE PORTAL MYSELF 3 months later and I never got a formal letter stating that I owe anything. If you owe a business, arent they supposed to send you a letter or written notice? They are so unprofessional because not only did I get ZERO letters, in the lease it stated I was to pay 45$ for late fee not 50$ so someone is not able to ensure things are consistent in this office anymore. I would not recommend dealing with this office whatsoever. They raised my rent and took three weeks to stop a huge rain water leak I had coming through my ceiling, and let me go without a working fridge for nearly a week while leaving two fridges in the tiny apartment for two weeks for storage not able to use either one. It has just been a ridiculous experience I am hoping there is a still a decent place to rent from in this area but so far this place has done me wrong totally I got two babies under 2.  Can\u2019t afford unnecessary extra charges, rent going up, and not having a fridge. Just ridiculous and sad. I cannot wait to move.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1589572580769, "text": "Kyrie,  we are so sorry this has been your experience and we would like to be able to look into your complaint.
