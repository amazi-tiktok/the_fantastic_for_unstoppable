House looks wonderful. He patched several rough spots and a crack so well that you couldn't tell they existed. He was neat while doing his work, and he cleaned up after himself when he was done. He also pressure washed my fence (looks like new and I was gobsmacked at how good it looked) and painted my front rails and back deck. I would highly recommend him and do plan on using him again.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1473130846368, "text": "Thanks for the kind words and good luck with the sale!"}, "gmap_id": "0x886212ca0fc597b9:0xea585f76853866fe"}
