My 19 MO daughter was in class with only one teacher and 12 kids total for the whole week.(The first and also the last week). Her teacher was very kind by nature, but practically it\u2019s impossible to manage 12 kids by one person. She was sick and missed few weeks of the daycare. When we went back I was little late I went there around 10:21, I was turned back by the director saying that it was close to nap time and I cannot drop her off. I was not expecting this. And we decided not to send her back after this experience. I would not recommend this daycare to any one. Luckily with grace of god my daughter only attended the first week and we decided not to send her back. We had a very bad experience, poor management.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2b9eff38b075:0x62d02eec9cef701c"}
