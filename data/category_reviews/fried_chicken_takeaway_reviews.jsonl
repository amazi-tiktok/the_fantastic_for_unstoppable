So  I went in and tried to explain to the clerk what happened since THAT was the last place I had used the card (no money on it until today after Aug 11) until today when I went to Circle K, and let him know that he may want to check the pumps and make sure everything is good. Guy looked at me like a deer caught in headlights......\"u first problem\" - Okay, but still its a good idea to go check it (His words to me where \"Im too lazy\" not \"U first problem\"). Apparently after talking to several people, I AM NOT the first person to have a problem with their card being skimmed at the pumps. I wanted to so badly scream at the guy putting gas in his car and pulling out his debit card \"DONT DO IT!\" but I didn't....I simply got in my own car and left.
