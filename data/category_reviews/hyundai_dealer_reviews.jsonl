This is not my first Hyundai since reinventing itself and blowing our minds. Needless to say I purchased what is now my 5th Hyundai.  However, i'm here to brag on the man who walked my husband and I through this entire process in this humid Alabama weather.  Initially, I came in to take advantage of the $50 GIFT CARD that Hyundai was offering for simply test driving its vehicles, but I also knew that I would potentially be driving off the lot with something new as well. Brandon Blagg was awesome from the gate. He stood and walked over to me, invited me to his desk, and inquired concerning my business. A few questions later, a copy of my license, and \"BAM\" we were test driving a base model Santa Fe.' One would think that this guy designed these vehicle with his level of knowledge concerning them. Recalling that I have own several vehicles in my lifetime, it is feasible to understand that we have dealt with our share of sales consultants. This is by far the first person who not only informed us of what we would potentially enjoy about the vehicle, but patiently explained in detail its benefits, and demonstrated  to us its functionality. He took a base model vehicle and literally painted a picture that lifted it beyond it's level. He hung out with us for over an hour doing comparisons and contrasts. He was honest concerning pro and cons, but never negative.. not one time. For him every vehicle had its benefits, and for every person there was vehicle that fit them. THIS IS WHAT HE DID! He didn't interfere with our choice, but he made sure that we would be satisfied once we left  the lot for good. In the end we ended up purchasing a Santa Fe' SEL 2.4 engine with both the Convenience and Premium Package. He didn't use a hustler tactic to cause us to go for a higher grade, it was simply his transparency and patience that ultimately led to our selection. Recalling that this was in 90 + degree weather, this man didn't stop until the tires shined.  He made me laugh, shared stories, explained who was whom of the CEO vs. COO, and also wasn't shy around me whatsoever. He even blew bubble gum bubbles for our delightful 6 year old who stood amazed at the excellence his gum blowing abilities. Brandon Blagg, job well done. You deserve all that's coming for your hard work and dedication to service. Aside from our direct experience with Brandon, everyone rocked. Their pleasantness was superb, two of the women conversed with me, they offered treats to my babies, and others smiled and waved. There wasn't a rude attitude in the building. The lobby and bathrooms are well designed and clean. As lengthly a process that car buying could be, they have enough going for themselves to make you relax and enjoy your time.\n\nThanks Again, Tae A.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b128e81df3f:0x8980930b2c0cfffb"}

I test drove the vehicle on a Monday and pointed out a few cosmetic issues that I feel should have been addressed prior to placing the car up for sale (only a few hundred dollars to correct).  That combined with the manager coming outside to talk to me smoking a cigarette, should have clued me in to the professionalism and pride taken at the dealership.\nI was asked that if the problems I pointed out were corrected,  would I purchase the car? I agreed.  The following day I recieved the bill of sale and I noticed that the price shown on the internet was not the price shown on the bill of sale. When I asked the manager, the explanation I recieved was that the car was headed to auction the day I saw it and the price on the internet was the auction price, not the sale price (what does that have to do with me? And the price I came intending to pay is the price that I saw advertised ).  I was then told that they would sell it to me at the internet price but I would have to pay for the repairs which would be $400+.  Since the price was still under book value,  I agreed.  I was then told that the car would be repaired, HAND WAXED and ready for me in a couple days.  I was informed Friday that the car was ready. I drove up Saturday only to find the car just as dirty as it was when I test drove it on Monday(they sprayed the dirt off but there was still hair and dirt on the inside of the car.... wheel wells were dirty, etc). Of all the cars I've bought,  no one has ever tried to delivered me a dirty car! I discussed this with the manager who appeared to care nothing about it.  I left with no intention of buying the car,  but the salesman,\nMr. Willie, called and said that he would take care of it...... he took it to a local shop and had it washed and vacuumed.  As a customer, when money is spent, whether it be $30 or $30,000, you want to feel good about spending it. That's not the feeling I left with.  In the end, I purchased what I feel is a great vehicle.   But the service is what will definitely keep me from being a repeat customer or recommending to anyone else.  Professionalism and putting the customer first is definitely lacking and needs a lot of improvement.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b128e81df3f:0x8980930b2c0cfffb"}

This was the worst car buying experience ever. My original salesman was nice but knew nothing about a car at all. My battery had a dead cell when I first purchased it. I took it back for the battery to be replace and it took four hours to get a new battery. I asked them to take me to the service center to find out what was taking so long and the guy that work in the front said my battery has been there for two hours. And the guys that were supposed to be working were playing and joking around the next time I needed work done was three days later I noticed the bumper on the car was popped out of place, the 12 volt adapters didn't work, the service light had come on, the key tumbler was messed up in the ignition. I went to try and get that fixed and they told me it would be two days well I asked if they would give me a replacement car to get back and forth to work they told me no they don't do that. Ok so I paid for the work myself. A few days later I discovered my account was overdrawn 500 dollars and when I ask the finance manager why my account was charged and I paid 1000  in cash his response was well we wanted 1500 for the car and u couldn't do that. So they took it upon themselves to take the other 500 dollars. Now after they agreed to give my money back.  I waited a week and called and he said I could pick it up across the street so I went across the street from them and the guy over there didn't know what I was talking about so he called Cleveland Moore the guy I've been having problems with to asked him where I needed to go Cleveland didn't know that he was on speaker phone and said \" she so damn stupid\" he really called me stupid and then when I informed him he was on speaker phone he said so. Meaning he didn't care. So I feel disrespected and I was so upset I called a manager who said it will be handled and I will be waiting to find out the results of this because if they are not satisfactory I would like to speak with the owner myself.

This was the worst car buying experience ever. My original salesman was nice but knew nothing about a car at all. My battery had a dead cell when I first purchased it. I took it back for the battery to be replace and it took four hours to get a new battery. I asked them to take me to the service center to find out what was taking so long and the guy that work in the front said my battery has been there for two hours. And the guys that were supposed to be working were playing and joking around the next time I needed work done was three days later I noticed the bumper on the car was popped out of place, the 12 volt adapters didn't work, the service light had come on, the key tumbler was messed up in the ignition. I went to try and get that fixed and they told me it would be two days well I asked if they would give me a replacement car to get back and forth to work they told me no they don't do that. Ok so I paid for the work myself. A few days later I discovered my account was overdrawn 500 dollars and when I ask the finance manager why my account was charged and I paid 1000  in cash his response was well we wanted 1500 for the car and u couldn't do that. So they took it upon themselves to take the other 500 dollars. Now after they agreed to give my money back.  I waited a week and called and he said I could pick it up across the street so I went across the street from them and the guy over there didn't know what I was talking about so he called Cleveland Moore the guy I've been having problems with to asked him where I needed to go Cleveland didn't know that he was on speaker phone and said \" she so damn stupid\" he really called me stupid and then when I informed him he was on speaker phone he said so. Meaning he didn't care. So I feel disrespected and I was so upset I called a manager who said it will be handled and I will be waiting to find out the results of this because if they are not satisfactory I would like to speak with the owner myself. I can't believe people have to go through so much to get a car this is very terrible service and I want to know that my voice and opinion.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b128e81df3f:0x8980930b2c0cfffb"}

And if you do, please, make sure you ask them to print and show you any TSB's (Technical Service Bulletin) on the vehicle you are considering. A TSB is not like a safety recall and therefore the dealership is not required to make the repair. Make them prove to you that they have repaired all of the items on each and every TSB. However, I can almost promise you that they will not make the repairs before selling you the vehicle. I purchased a used 2007 Hyundai Entourage van from Jim Burke Hyundai's used car dealership in March this year after having purchased a new Elantra from them last year. I did not make them show me the TSB's because I wasn't aware of them at the time. Unfortunately there are several of them on the van I purchased. One of them had to do with a part that causes called the \"Junction Box Switch\" or Instrument Panel Module that causes the battery to discharge. That means when you go out to your car it simply won't start!! I found the TSB on it and it says in large print that it was issued to all Hyundai General Managers and that the repair should be made before retail sale of the van. Many of us believe that purchasing a used car from what you think is a reputable dealership will protect you from these type issues. Well...this dealership is not reputable and should be put out of business. I have contacted them to give them a change to try and make this right to keep customers happy and try to get return business but they obviously are not intersted in this. I will be taking further action regarding this issue.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b128e81df3f:0x8980930b2c0cfffb"}

I was told by Lee and the \"salesman\" that the truck was $11,000, only to charge me $13,000. Of course once I realized what they did and contacted them they play dumb and it is too late. I know if I should have taken more time to review and ask questions but it was the end of the day, past business hours already and I needed to leave with the truck that day. Regardless you should never practice those business ethics in any industry. I have had to change the rotors, brakes, brake drums, brake cylinder, master cylinder, calipers and brackets, hub assembly, CV axles, steering arm, I am in the process of changing the transfer case (over $2,000 on it's own) and it still needs a steering column, gear box, front differential, driveshaft and possibly the rear differential. When it's all said and done I will have put at least 5 times the value of this truck into making it run right and paying it off.

They spent most of the time trying to convince me to settle for the one they had, which was the wrong color (not a huge deal) and a Limited where I was looking for an Ultimate and didn't have any of the specific features I'd picked the Ultimate for (a bigger deal). When they finally agreed that they could order the car I wanted, they tried to convince me to buy it faster, claiming that in the few weeks I was planning to wait until some new payoffs reported on my credit, qualifying me for a 0% interest rate, my trade would decline in value and that I didn't want a 0% interest rate anyway. They kept me another 20 minutes after I said I needed to leave for an appointment, and even had the sales manager come out asking us, \"Why do you hate my car\", to try to convince us to buy the wrong one again. They didn't even pretend to care if I got the car I wanted (even though I'd have been spending more money), they just wanted me to buy whatever they could push off on me right that second. Overall, a terrible experience, and I felt more like a hostage negotiating for my release than a customer.\n\nAfter it was all said and done, I bought somewhere else, got exactly the car I wanted, in exactly the time frame I wanted.

I had an OUTSTANDING & EXCEPTIONALLY POSITIVE experience purchasing a brand new 2021 Hyundai Elantra SE at the Tameron Hyundai dealership.\nFirst off, I received a call from Andrea in customer relations after I visited the website. She was SO friendly, pleasant, easy going and helpful!\nShe helped me set up a time to come in and look at the cars available.\nWhen we got to the Hyundai dealership at noon, we met with Kevin Dailey.\nMy son and I felt so at ease with him. Kevin was AWESOME!!!\nHe was very friendly, respectful, attentive and knowledgeable.\nHe gave us a great introduction of the Hyundai Elantra SE we wanted. Despite the torrential downpour and flash food warning sirens and crazy scary lightning that day, we enjoyed the test drive with him.\nThe car drove like a dream through all that terrible weather. Kevin did a great job of working to get my monthly car payment rate at a price I felt comfortable with. He also guided me on how to coordinate with my AAA car insurance agent while waiting on financing dept, then he introduced us to Chayse. Chayse also did an exceptional job of getting all my financing paperwork together.He generously provided copies of documents I needed to get my new car\u2019s tag and registration done at the DMV.\nI had no real expectations that day other than to test drive a car.\nMy son and I researched a lot and compared the Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic and Hyundai Elantra SE. The excellent warranty, and better safety features, more cabin room, and other specs sold us on the Hyundai Elantra SE. Our prior vehicle broke down in February. It has been a tough 3 +months without the ability to go anywhere.\nFrom start to finish we had an incredibly positive experience with everyone at Tameron Hyundai.\nFor us, it\u2019s not just about a car. It\u2019s about our freedom to get out and live life. We are TRULY GRATEFUL for our entire experience!\nKevin also scheduled our first maintenance appointment for November before we even drove off the lot!\nWe were thrilled to hear the warranty is doubled and our maintenance is will be handled at Tameron as well! AMAZING!!!\nAfter driving in our last vehicle for 20 years, I\u2019m SO GLAD we decided to trust our instincts and research about our new Gorgeous Hyundai Elantra and the Tameron Hyundai dealership! I posted Kevin\u2019s business card on all my social media. This is THE BEST Mother\u2019s day gift ever!\nIf you ever need to look for a new car I HIGHLY recommend Kevin Dailey and the entire team at Tameron Hyundai!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a1067f2749:0xf08fc8940d9b4549"}

Her service advisor, Brian informed her that the oil leak was coming from the o-ring for the drain plug due to it being cracked. Brian said this is considered a \u201cwear and tear item\u201d and that she should probably get her oil changed since she was due for another one in around another 1k miles.\n\nThis is where my issue begins, I call Brian to get more information and he is immediately defensive when I ask him for the information about what is going on. I asked him why the O ring isn\u2019t just a parts warranty issue, they pull the plug, put a new seal in it, fill it back up with oil and quote a filter IF she wants to put one in since it is close, he mumbled and tried to get his thoughts together and said i may not understand how warranty works.

Choose wisely consumers********\n\nFound a vehicle at this dealership on Cargurus for $4994, checked the dealership website before making the trip, car listed there for the same price with a red line marked through it saying \"don't pay list price\". Arrived to the dealership, took a test drive, checked the dealership website while on the test drive, same price  of $4994 with the red line marked through it.  Sat in the dealership waiting to get a price to pay cash, waited almost as long as I would have if I were financing it for the young man to come back with an \"out the door price\" of $7900. Sir what happened to the price of $4994 that is on your website????  Now would you look at this, the car is no longer on the website yet it was there 30 minutes ago on the test drive. Is that why I sat there so long? So that you could remove the vehicle from the website and come back with an inflated bs price. Sounds like shady business to me. I WILL NEVER patronize Tameron Hyundai but who there cares, no one. It was only a $5000.00 sale anyway. But you DEFINITELY get 5 stars for being unprofessional, unethical and full of it!

Adam showed him a Tuscon that had just been traded in and was awaiting service and safety check. He loved it. Tameron made the vehicle a priority in getting it serviced and detailed for him. After we left, we found a small alignment problem on the rear wheel, they had it on the rack the following morning and made the repair. Never was he pressured into a car out of his budget, as a matter of fact they found a way to save our Marine a couple hundred dollars off the \"non-negotiable\" price.

This isn't a place for me I guess I'll keep looking elsewhere.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a1067f2749:0xf08fc8940d9b4549"}

I had been researching a Hyundai Accent and wanted to look at them. I ended up working with a man (his name starts with a J) who took me to the used accents. When test driving the car he only let me go around the block, I mean the car didn't even get over 40mph. He did not show me that the car was certified, no car fax, and the price was 2-3 thousand dollars than every website I have looked at about this car. In fact, a brand new Hyundai Accent was listed only a few hundred dollars more than the used 2013 one I was looking at. When bringing this up he told me they were not willing to work with me on the price and when I was going to leave he mentioned that \"Were not the type of people who will call you later and lower the price.\" So I left, then I went down the street and bought a Honda Accord that was a year older, had more miles on it and paid $1,000 more than the price J told me he wouldn't budge on the Accent. Why? Because Billy at Tameron Honda treated me as a serious buyer who was paying cash and needed a car instead of a 20 year old college girl who J hurried out the door thinking I wasn't ready to buy.

However, I did find  Tameron Hyundai that allowed me to come in, and they checked my car.\nI first was met by Joe Bajalia, Service Manager, who was Great! I told Joe I was concerned about my safety, and I had a 4 Hour drive back home. He called in his National Award Winning technician, Chris Cochran. Chris took my IONIQ for a test drive, and also checked out the car with his device that identified Car trouble.\nAfter Chris\u2019s Evaluation, he educated me on what I was experiencing in the steering , and how the car is designed to work on the interstate . I felt very comfortable in his confidence and his explanation.\nThe Previous dealership where I had my car serviced in South Alabama did not put enough air of equal portions in the tires, and Joe got a very polite professional technician to make sure the tires work properly inflated. There was one other man that assisted me when I arrived . This man wrote up the paperwork. He too was also very professional and polite!\nI certainly did appreciate Tameron Hyundai taking my concerns seriously , especially when I was concerned about my safety!

I will NEVER purchase from Tameron again. It took over two weeks to get my contract finalized. When I received my final contract, it was past the date to get my car tag. I called and they told me that they would pay the 15.00 late fee that I was charged. I sent my paperwork to them and never heard back. When I purchased the car I told the salesman that the car needed tires and he told me the car didn't  need tires and the tires look like that because they are \"low profile\". I just had tires put on the car. I purchased an extended warranty that was supposed to cover everything for 2 years or 24,000 miles. I noticed that when I  purchased the car the drivers seat rocked a little. The seat has gotten progressively worse and I took the car to a Nissan Dealership and was told the seat needs to be replaced, the warranty doesn't cover it, and it would be $1,748.00 to fix.\nDear Tameron,\nYou will never get another dime of mine!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a1067f2749:0xf08fc8940d9b4549"}

I had the opportunity to work with Mike Kelly, which turned out great.  From my initial, quite spontaneous interest in the car, to the test drive, to the eventual price haggling process, Mike presented himself professionally and factually throughout the entire experience.  He displayed a tremendous amount of respect for my desires with regards to the sale, we both managed to appreciate each other's role in the brief relationship, and we were both able to come to an agreement that both saved me an acceptable amount of expense and allowed Tameron to earn a profit from the purchase.  Mike was very forthcoming regarding his thoughts on the car, as well as advice for making the most of the transaction, and it was and is still very much appreciated and made the overall interaction much easier through which to navigate.

I\"ll be up front, I made every stupid decision you could buying a used car. The Yukon my wife wanted had a little difficulty starting (that was my first warning sign I failed to heed). When I asked the salesman he just brushed it off as it hadn't been turned on that day (my second warning sign).\n\nWhen we got into the room for negotiations I told him upfront what my requirements were. He then (what I later learned is a typical salesman trick) went to \"argue\" with his boss about giving me the deal I wanted. After a few hours he finally invited me back to his \"bosses\" office to sign the deal.\n\nWhen I sat down to sign, he handed me a stack of papers that I spent some time reviewing. I honestly could not make sense of the numbers. When I started asking him about them he responded, \"I thought we were here to buy a car!\" (my final warning sign I failed to heed). I caved to this high pressure sales tactic and just wanted to get out of there as quick as possible as it had already been 4+ hours. When I finally got my vehicles they said it took so long because they had to \"clean\" them. Worst cleaning job ever.\n\nThe NEXT day the Yukon I bought died in a parking lot. I should have taken it back and got my Expedition back I traded in but I felt like I had to make do with what I bought (besides, I bought the warranty!) Took it to a local repair shop and sure enough the fuel pump needed to be replaced. Lucky for me, I only had to pay the $100 deductible!\n\nLess than a year into owning the vehicle, the transmission went out. Fortunately for me I again ONLY had to pay the $100 deductible to replace the transmission. Little did I know, transmissions tend to go bad again after they go out the first time. About a year later, the transmission went out a second time! That was the final straw, so I traded it in at Driver's Way where I had a MUCH better experience.\n\nNow, my second car I mentioned I bought that same time along with the Yukon ended up having a broken motor mount and the A/C compressor went out less than a year after purchase. Both vehicles were only 3-5 years used and less than 75k miles on them. Maybe I just had terrible luck from Tameron Hyundai but I can't help but feel they knew about these issues and just passed them on to me based on their sales practices.\n\nTameron Hyundai lives by the moto \"Caveat emptor\"...
