Our policy is to follow up with each and every one of our clients after every appointment to make sure that they are happy with their service. This is an important part of how we maintain excellent relationships with our clients and resolve any issues that may arise. However, when we first read your 1-star review, we attempted to reach out to you to see what had gone wrong so that we could fix it for you.

We did, however, have a Savannah S. who had recently stopped working with us, which is why we reached the conclusion we did.\n\nAlthough 4 years have passed, we would sincerely like to know how we could have improved your experience and would love the opportunity to make you a happy customer moving forward.

It is now Jul 2021 so now I am posting here:  I really did not want to leave this review as I really liked the technician that worked at my house as a person.  And I am not requesting that anything be done to make things right.  I am good at this point.  The job that was done on the tile floors was good (with one exception noted later).  What makes me unhappy is when I have to do work to clean up after a job is done.  I was a bit bothered right away when I noticed that the technician was leaving boot prints everywhere he walked on my hardwood floors on his way to the tile floors he was cleaning.  I didn't say anything as he was just starting, and I thought maybe it would be taken care of.  He worked hard and did a good job on the tile floors (with the one exception I will note later).  Once he was finished and was removing the corrugated water line and the machines, rancid smelling water was spilled in some areas on my hardwood floors.  Also, while pulling the corrugated water line out of the house, he pulled it around the corners of a room scuffing the baseboards.  I had to put my foot between the baseboard and the line so it would stop hitting the baseboard.  This prevented it from doing any noticeable damage.  He did bring in a wet mop and attempted to clean the hardwood area but did nothing more than smear the rancid smelling water around which dried leaving a VERY noticeable film on the floor.  I had to clean a fairly large area of the hardwood floor twice to remove the dried, rancid water and most of the smell.  As noted above (the one exception) I also mopped the tile floors he cleaned with vinegar and water as some of the quarter round in the tile floor area had filth on it and I figured some of that floor probably had some of the same rancid water on it.  The rancid water smell stayed in the house for more than a day.  The second cleaning of the hardwood floors and time got rid of the rest of it.   My bet is that the machines and/or the water line contained the rancid water from other jobs.  I really hate leaving comments like this, but it is probably important that the company be made aware of these type of issues for training purposes.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626c9eeb4ff555:0x1c3ae99102e6b228"}

And you bring up a great point about our pricing compared to traditional carpet cleaners. It is true that we are not the least expensive carpet cleaner in Huntsville, but our patented cleaning technology does provide a better long term value. The difference is our certified zero residue cleaning process. We will explain: with traditional carpet cleaners, soaps and detergents are combined with hot water extraction to clean and sanitize carpets. And although this is a tried and true process, it has a big problem; it's impossible to get all the soap and detergent out of the carpet. And this soapy residue (which can feel a little crunchy under your feet after drying) ends up acting like a dirt magnet which results in spots and traffic lanes reappearing. But with the Zerorez patented process, we do not use soaps and detergents to clean and sanitize carpets but instead a revolutionary, and completely non-toxic, solution called Empowered Water. This process results in a zero residue cleaning, and without residue, carpets stay cleaner, longer. Additionally, they feel softer than you can imagine. Thank you again for your business and fantastic review! We look forward to seeing you again."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626c9eeb4ff555:0x1c3ae99102e6b228"}

I had to go behind them to ask questions like: \"Did you clean the top of the cabinets, did you wipe down doors, did you clean the windows,\" etc. because it wasn't being done. As I inspected the kitchen, I noticed dried food stuck on the cabinets, dust on top of the cabinets, which I asked them to go back and clean -same experience in the bathrooms. One of the last tasks was mopping the floor. As one lady mopped, I noticed a small puddle of water on the floor, so I wiped it up. I looked at the white napkin in my hand and it was gray. Yes, she mopped my bathroom and kitchen floors with a filthy mop. I brought it to her attention and the second lady mopped behind the first one with another dirty mop. I seriously thought about asking the ladies to leave early, but I overheard one of them talking on the phone (at work) telling the caller that she was trying to make some money and would be home soon.

Drew one of the sales guys made up stories about the situation, told my tenant I had told him things when I hadn't even talked to the guy yet and told two different things ones to me and my tenant .I asked Drew why he did this and let him know I would be calling the office and  he proceeded to call my tenant a couple of times and send me a  6 page text over the situation which I found very unprofessional . When I called to complain about this Jacob the owners son took  up for the actions, was rude to me, did not listen to me and acted like I was bothering him.I was told my cabinets needed replaced when they did not. They pulled the vanity out of my master bathroom that did not need pulled out to begin with  without cutting the caulk and when they pulled the vanity it caused the mirror in the bathroom to fall on the sink shattering my mirror and busting my sink in the bathroom and tried to blame it on the heat in the room.I called  David the head of the construction department several times asking a start date and was told no repairs would be started  until they had 18 thousand upfront, Half the cost, and to ask my adjuster to call  his cooperate office and have Fed Ex deliver it to them.I asked my adjuster about it and he said that they did not that money upfront and was beyond shocked I had been told that.They still have their little lock box on my door a week after I told them I will not be using their services anymore, I have called four times to ask to have removed.I have called and asked  three times to speak to the owner of the franchise and got no response. The office staff is not friendly, they have horrible attitudes and make you feel  brushed off.

But then everything got very confusing. We didn't know what was going to happen or when. Then they came in and packed all of our things up, first our clothes and no one told us to keep out any clothes. So we had no clothes blankets or pillows by the time they finished. There was 2 rooms that just had to be cleaned but they threw out our beds and furniture and took out all the carpet. We put notes on two closets and put don't enter.. I found the notes in the floor when we returned. They packed up everything and took it with them but nothing was cleaned it was just in the box they had packed it in.\nThey told us they we're going to clean the duck work, it was not cleaned, the ceiling fans were not cleaned nor were the blinds. We have had to just  about replace everything  we own plus we had use or own  money to eat at the hotel for   for over 2 months. Being nice is great but we had to many people telling us different things..it took a month after we got to come home before they started bring things back. It made difficult to cook. We had to buy new pots just fry an egg.\nWhen they finally brought things back they were very confused about everything because the young guy and 3 woman that packed us up were fired. They didn't seem to know what was ours and what wasn't.  There are quite a few things missing.  Some of the items are antique and can't be replaced.  The thing is these items problem  went to someone else  and they just saw it was old and not there's. Maybe I need to go check the thrift store.  I didn't think this was going to be easy but this has been a nightmare. I have items that have tags on them, but they didn't take them or clean them. My blinds still have soot on them and it is not easy to clean. They we're supposed to clean and check or duct work , not even touched. And we saw the check our insurance sent them and that was way too much for this mess.

For two weeks, we checked every\nday, no workmen.  We were assured we would be back in by Christmas.  We went through three Project Managers, and\nthree different set of drywall and painters.  The first painting crew stood on my washer and dryer to paint the\nceiling in the laundry leaving dents and scratches.  We had stored the liquor from our bar in tubs in the garage,\nas Servpro would not remove alcohol from the home.  Apparently the painters had found it and consumed a great deal\nbefore they were removed from the job by Darin Ingle.  They also got paint all over our floors so Servpro brought\nin commercial scrubbers which removed the finish on all of our floors.\n\nTo shorten this story, I will cut to the return home.  We finally returned to our home in early March with work still\ngoing on, Painting and damaged floors. The first night home the water under the sink of my brand new cabinets\nflooded the kitchen.  They had to send in dryers and a plumber who said it was not hooked up correctly and\nreworked all of the kitchen dishwasher and sink plumbing. They sent in a professional flooring company  to assess\nthe floors. Their solution required us to move back into a hotel for at least a week so they could clean, reseal\nthe tile and recolor the grout.\n\nThe only thing that saved this project was Darin Ingle who arrived on the project in February.  Darin was sent in from another state to resolve the\nproblems at the Montgomery location that included our home.  Darin took the reins, brought in new crews and came\nevery day to ensure the work got back on track and that it was done correctly.  Darin's arrival was months into\nthe project and while we have never sued anyone, we were on the verge of doing just that to get another company\nto come in so we could go home.  I am not sure if Servpro's executives realize that Darin not only saved our project,\nsaved them from a lawsuit but did an amazing job saving their reputation.  I would only call them again if Darin Ingle handled the job.\nBecause of Darin, I am giving Servpro a 2 star rating and Darin a 5.\n\nAn update to my review.  I was contacted by Mr. Bowen, an owner.  Mr. Bowen was determined to do something to do something for All we had been through.  He offered to send in a crew or something.  While his offer was appreciated, we had already fixed many of the issues and did not feel we could ensure another work crew I agreed to think it over and get back with him.  The one thing, as I explained to him, that distressed me everytime I went into the laundry was the dents and scratches on the tops of the washer and dryer which he eagerly agreed to replace.  With much of manufacturing shut down for long periods, appliances are in short supply.  However, Mr. Bowen and Darin Ingle were able to replace order And have new ones installed.  My frustration is no longer renewed when I walk into my laundry room.  My thanks to Mr. Bowen for reaching out and making this a better experience, and to Darin Ingle for making it happen.  It is good to know they cared to make things better.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1600260211243, "text": "Hi Judy, I am one of the owners and I am terribly sorry to hear about your experience.

Paid for tile cleaning and grout sealing. Crew had to come out 3 times in one day to attempt to fix and finish. First, they forgot to seal the shower that we paid $90 for them to do. Then, we noticed a film all over every single tile that would not come up; Technician did NOT allow the tile and grout to dry before spraying grout sealer..Then, did not wipe off the excess grout sealer, just left it all over each and every tile. 3rd trip out of same day to day to try and fix it, they used every chemical, scrubber machine, everything they had to try and get it off, guess what, didn't work. So now, my grout is wet UNDER the sealer, which never had proper curing time, because they did not let the grout dry before applying, and my tiles have giant stains, splotches, blobs all over every single one because they did not remove the sealer from the tile after spraying the grout. And on top of it, one of the technicians decided that no, all of my white grout was actually completely stained before they got here that's why it's dark (Not because it was wet, which was the case)..He ended up arguing with me and cursing at me.

She then informed me Nadia would not arrive at work until 9 due to unknown reasons.  I was shocked.  I understand things happen.  So ok I left a message with the lady to ask Nadia to call me.  I waited most of the day on her call.  I emailed her that afternoon.  I expressed my continued interest in the position and asked could we schedule another interview.  Now Thursday I didn't receive any response from Nadia.  I received email today from Office Pride stating I didn't met the requirements from r the position I applied for and they decided to go in a different direction.  Wow seriously!  How is that possible when I didn't even interview.  At this point, I'm furious they would decline me for a position I know I'm qualified for.  So I called the office and spoke to Nadia.  She apologized for her not showing up.  I asked her why she couldn't communicate with me after she arrived at the office and realized she missed the interview.

It didn\u2019t hurt that we were getting more bang for the buck - Office Pride\u2019s prices were lower and they would be coming more often.  Another bonus is that each month an inspection is performed. Office Pride sends over one of their reps to come in and check over our facility to double check the quality of cleaning.

We have received consistent, responsive, quality service from Office Pride of Huntsville at a very fair price. Office Pride's carpet cleaning service rescued us with top-notch, professional service at Christmas with a last minute carpet cleaning two days before our annual open house, securing a place in our annual Christmas prep for many years to come.
