I paid a large copay about three weeks ago to get an MRI and still know nothing. They \"sent it off to Birmingham\" to be read where the results would then be sent to my doctor, but my doctor has heard nothing. First of all if you have a state of the art MRI facility in Decatur Alabama why can you not have someone in Decatur Alabama read the results? Secondly if the results cannot be read at the facility then why Birmingham? There are plenty of places in the area that have someone in house to read your MRI, or at least get the results back to you in a day or three.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1514388261931, "text": "Good Morning, Rebekka Sharpe.  The results of your MRI were sent to your referring physician on 11/15/17 in under 24 hours. We have the fax confirmation on file of when and where it was sent.  Your referring physician is whom you need to speak with about those results. If you are having trouble still, please call us at 256-350-7779.  Just let us know! We will be happy to send the results again to your referring physician if they need us to. We partner with a group of Radiologists to read our scans out of Birmingham. This helps to provide accurate reads in a timely manner (24 hour results). I hope this information helps.  Have a great day and we wish you a Happy New Year."}, "gmap_id": "0x886286909a0c2b1d:0x4eb6c3fa4619dbcf"}

I can't recommend Joe Molina and the guys at HESCO Automotive highly enough, they are highly professional, extremely efficient, keep you informed at every juncture of the process, and very reasonable.

This business is very unprofessional and lacks the ability to communicate with their customers. I also feel that I was taken advantage of because I am a woman.

I went in on Tuesday 12/18 because my car was running hot. Tammy was nice enough to give me a ride home while I waited. Firstly my car was not correctly diagnosed I spent over 500$ here and still having the same issue. When I picked it up drove toward Wal-Mart it immediately got hot so the looked at it again right before closing then i leave again same thing finally I park in publix to let it cool down. Again in the morning I take it back. Again they check it send me on my way 30 minutes later car hot again. I call and was pretty much brushed off and was told that they fixed what they thought was the problem. So as of right now I've been charged all this money car still running hot n they acting like it's cool I came in with 1 problem which has still not to be resolved.
