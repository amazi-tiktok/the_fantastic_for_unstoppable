Street parking. The location is within their home community, to which they wish to give back by providing a healthy alternative such as this. I had the \"millionaire 'burger'\" along with sweet potato fries - quite tasty! It was piled high with veggies, avocado, and other add-ons. The burger look and texture was great. As usual with meat substitutes, you must treat it as a new kind of \"meat\" rather than compare it to actual beef. If you do this and let it stand on its own, this burger (along with other substitutes) tastes great. Next time I'm here, I want to try the jackfruit \"pulled pork\" and possibly a smoothie. This was my first vegan restaurant experience and it was quite lovely! Highly recommended for those hesitant on exploring this new type of cuisine.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVaNHp7Dt0nDMEvvBlQtwu6aOBk9NkhEpBxNyC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888e099329268b5:0x4dd55dbc73530bf1"}
