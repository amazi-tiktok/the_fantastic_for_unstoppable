Been in this game for 35 years. The whole New Breed experience has been very satisfying. You get the bow you want, the look you want, in a very timely fashion, and they are built with pride and backed by customer service that is just awesome. The bows are absolutely some of the quietest, most dead in hand bows you willwfind on the  illshot, and can be set up however you like. With the most solid back wall available (flat sides of mods, 2 cable stops, and two limb stops simultaneously) for Max let off, or just cable stops or limb stops and minimal let off for target shooting or hunting if that's what you prefer. Best warranty(transferrable with sale of bow) in the industry. I was really looking forward to shimming and tuning my ETX35, but with 4 identically matched limbs, and mine having zero cam lean, I didn't get to do much of that. I had bullet holes ini6 shots after just eyeballing the rest. Amazing !!! As far as shooting, these bows just perform. I was looking for a bow I could combine with my tuning abilities to sell people the perfectly tuned bow that will perform how they want it to, and I am happy to say, I am very happy that I found New Breed Archery. It is just archers building archers the bows they want and backing their products !  Looking forward to ordering my next one very soon. Thanks New Breed!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888904c74c0d731b:0x3565a9ae4cbe81c0"}
