I have been a customer of his for many years and have purchased an Xbox 360, Xbox 1, Nintendo 64, Wii, and, more recently, the hard to find Nintendo Switch. Besides selling consoles dating back to the \u201980s (Nintendo, Sega, Etc.) Scott has a vast selection of games and accessories for all the consoles. Plus, he has repaired my phone screen more times than I can count. Scott provides returning customers with great discounts and bundle deals. He has also offered me store credit or trades that I\u2019m comfortable with; Unlike the unsatisfying offers, other establishments offer that will leave one feeling remorseful. Game-N-Trade also has a selection of comics and figurines, but I don\u2019t know much about those. So, cheers to Scott and Game-N-Trade for making my family and me delighted customers. I\u2019m confident once you visit his unique establishment and see the quality merchandise at exceptional prices, you\u2019ll understand why he has so many satisfied, returning customers.

Our main card game is Magic the Gathering and we generally have approximately 100,000 mtg cards traded in per month. We continue to allow trade ins even though we are paying storage fees on somewhere between 2.5 and 3 million cards in the to be processed areas right now. I'm sorry you're disappointed in the service or offers you have received. We always give the customer the pricing and the choice to keep or sell their items. I know that this is not the case exactly with you, but you would be amazed if you knew how many people think if a card is $200 online that they can bring it and sell it to me for $200 cash. I work very hard to offer a fair trade in policy and all individual trade in pricing is based on the percentage given for the particular game and the quality of the card alone. Bulk collections have their own pricing schedules and I ask the players to sort out the expensive cards from the bulk to make sure they get the most money for their trade ins."}, "gmap_id": "0x88890b09fcf5a675:0xce64eacf9912dcea"}

We generally check both Amazon and Tcgplayer. Right now most Pokemon is selling for more than normal. We are having to pay more than retail for most products just to keep it in stock so people can have a place to purchase it. Our first run of Pokemon that comes direct is priced less than you can get the items direct from Pokemon for. The wholesale companies are charging more as well. We also limit quantities on most Pokemon items so everyone gets a chance to purchase. We keep Pokemon in stock that hasn't been in most retail stores for ten years. Out of print collectibles almost always sell for more than retail. We always have multiple Pokemon items at regular retail price. I also make sure to point those items out to customers when they come in. This is an issue with the limited printing from Pokemon. That's why it's sold out everywhere locally. We've also been cut on available quantities from the distributors. Out of 200 elite trainer boxes of Shining Fates ordered, we received only two and we sold them for $49.99 each release day. Checking with Walmart.com today 3-17-21, MOST products we have in stock are actually less than buying online from them. Example, Shining Fates ETBs are $130 on Walmart.com, they are $99.99 at our store. Evolutions booster packs are $31.99 each at Walmart.com, while ours are $17.99. Vivid Voltage booster boxes are $299.99, ours are $199.99. Crimson Invasion ETBs are $135.24 at Walmart while ours are $84.95. Champion's Path ETBS are $109.99, ours are $99.99. In looking up over 20 in stock products, the ONLY Pokemon item I  found less at Walmart.com was the Dubwool box which is $34.95 while ours is $34.99. Several products I found we are over 50% less than Walmart.com. Market value (also known as OMV, or \"open market valuation\") is the price an asset would fetch in the marketplace, or the value that the investment community gives to a particular equity or business. I think you were referring to MSRP (Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price) or LIST price. MSRP will not generally apply for out of print or high demand collectibles in ANY industry. Same thing happened with the VW TDI a few years back when they were selling for $20,000 over MSRP and you had to put in your order three months in advance."}, "gmap_id": "0x88890b09fcf5a675:0xce64eacf9912dcea"}

Prices are at or higher than the highest ebay sold listing and it makes zero sense to pay the same price and likely not even get the best condition since highest sold usually equals close to like new.  Especially if you need to drive up to an hour or two and a half in my case.  You are just wasting money on gas and wasting your time. A lesson learned.\n\nOtherwise, if you want used games it's likely in the ball park.\n\nConsidering you never asked once about the condition of the discs, manuals, or anything else\n\nI already knew you would mention this and there was no point with how high you are reaching for the stars with the pricing. Might as well just buy new copies.\n\nit's scarcely worth taking your \"criticism\" seriously.\nI'm sure it is buddy, you seem like you will always be right in your world.\n\nHowever, what makes this hilarious is how you attempted to state that game stores should sell for well under eBay completed listings because \"stores don't have to pay EBay fees\"...\n\nNo serious collector walks into a store and attempts to lecture the owner about how to price their stock and they certainly don't lie about the pricing practices enacted.\n\nI didn't lecture you, what I said before you got ALL BENT of of shape is that the prices were higher than other stores I have been to. And that isn't a lecture or and just a basic opinion. It is a basic fact that that the prices are higher than other stores and wasn't meant in anyway way bad. It was just me being simply honest and why I was not really interested in anything.  If someone tells you that your prices are higher than other stores it isn't bad or even someone lecturing you.  You got very defensive. I also stated that if it is the prices you want to sell at that it is fine, that isn't an issue and it is your right.  You didn't try to see my mutual compromise but just kept on with your silly attitude.\n\nA normal person would actually request a price check on a game they felt as though may have been too high. Since the market fluctuates, that's reasonable. Pouting and storming out isn't.\n\nFor sure not pouting or storming out, there was nothing there for me so what was the point of staying?\n\nYour prices are some of the highest I have seen personally, this isn't a negative or something to be used against you, it just is what it is and it affects you a lot for whatever reason.\n\nIn the end, I buy sealed games most of the time so it wasn't a big deal for me.  I was just stating the prices are higher than other stores I have been to. It's literally not bad at all to say, it's like saying trees are green and the sky is blue as to what we relate to.  Same thing with your prices, oh well.\n\nFor the record, I only said the prices were higher than other stores (Not a big deal, it is your choice) but you got very VERY defensive asking me what is a good price, what is a good price, what's your opinion of a good price. WEll , you asked and I gave you a few exmaples.

Without wasting too much of our time, I'll touch on a few of your \"contrapoints\":\n\nYour idea of market pricing was Facebook marketplace and eBay sold listing after taking off fees. You must be under the impression that operating a business costs nothing but selling on EBay does. You would be sharply mistaken.\n\nCondition matters when it comes to a product. If the disc is scratched up, that matters to most people. All of our discs are scratch free. Your false assertion that our pricing is based on the most expensive sold listing is hilarious and easily disproven with an ounce of footwork by anyone, aside from you.\n\nI never got bent out of shape. I DID laugh at a couple of things you said, but they were so incredulous, I couldn't stop myself. Your softly muttered \"you're just stubborn\", however, was hilarious. Thanks for that giggle.\n\nNice strawman you built here. Too bad the cameras and mics we have in house would tell a different story. It's no matter. You've obviously got nothing in your life aside from attempting to lecture a business owner how to run his business. Maybe you should take a crack at it. With your expert knowledge, I'm sure you'll enjoy great success. Have a nice day."}, "gmap_id": "0x886265345bd3fbc1:0xc31a36f24261f674"}

She already had her mind made up that she wouldn't help us and couldn't fathom the idea that she was wrong. I guarantee this... my next visit to the Pell City store, if she's working the counter, I will walk out. I will refuse to deal with her ever again. She was very rude, snide, and ignorant.

Nigel and Leilani run the store and are two of my favorite people. They get to know their customers very well and it makes the atmosphere feel like you're walking in to a good friends house to play the day away with some Smash Bros or Halo.\n\nLeilani makes the best tacos I have ever had in my life. If you get the chance, go to Taco Tuesday. You won't regret it. In fact all the food is delicious. An order of double fries or nachos goes perfect with a D&D session.\n\nNigel has the uncanny ability to bring fun wherever he goes. He's set up the cafe to accommodate nearly any genre of nerd from retro gamers to hardcore tournament competitors. He's also constantly working to improve his business and make sure everyone that walks in the door has a great time. He also runs a pretty dope YouTube channel called Nerd Torch TV.\n\nThe store is organized and managed extremely well. There are several rooms dedicated to different types of gaming. There is a room for tabletop games, another for rhythm games like Guitar Hero or DDR, and other rooms dedicated to console games. There's even a PC built for gaming. Multiplayer games are very popular and this is a great place to find people that love to play Smash. I don't think I've ever been to the cafe when there wasn't someone playing Smash or Mario Cart. There's a great community built up around the cafe as well. All of the cafe members are invited to a GroupMe chat where you can get updates on events or just chat and hang out. This year, they organized a secret santa for everyone.\n\nIf you love games, nerds, and having a good time then you won't be dissapointed if drop by NERDtorch Cafe.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1514529783552, "text": "Thanks so much for writing such a detailed description of NERDtorch Cafe!
