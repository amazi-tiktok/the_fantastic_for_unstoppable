We sometimes do not get a full bag, shorting us before our next delivery.  Our aprons that we receive often have half of the tie torn off. So we can't even tie them on. Also, they come very stained occasionally as if they have been mildewed and then laundered. The mildew stain is still there after the wash. We pay a fee each week for these items to be replaced as needed, but we rarely see new items in the\nmix. We have also had problems with the posting of payments in a timely manner.

I work for a nursing home and was pregnant and had to buy new scrub tops and they only had one in stock and had to order another one. So they were both already paid for and I ended up not going back to pick it up right away I went back after I had my baby which was only a few months later that I came back to pick my shirt up that I have paid for already. I was told that I couldn\u2019t get my shirt bc it had already been so long since I bought it and that I also couldn\u2019t get my money back and I was never told ever that I had to pick it up by a certain time or I wouldn\u2019t be able to get it and would lose out on a 34 dollar scrub shirt. I was told well it\u2019s on your  receipt. I\u2019m sorry but not very many people read the small fine print on their receipt so if y\u2019all are going to make such a rule that someone can\u2019t get what they paid for if u don\u2019t pick it up within a certain time it would be nice for that to be told to us before we purchase it. So we can be sure to send someone to pick it up if we can\u2019t make it there. I just think it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous that I am now out 32 dollars for something I had no clue about. So they told me they put my shirt back in inventory which means they resold my shirt and just got double the one for that one shirt. I also called to ask for a manager which they were suppose to have call me and it\u2019s now been over a week and I have yet to hear from a manager.\n\n***UPDATE I never said exactly how many months it had been bc I didn\u2019t know exactly how long it had been but what I don\u2019t understand is that I never was told them I only received a text stating that it was at the store a few times never said I had to pick it up by a certain date and I have a different number now so that may could have been a reason why I may not have gotten anything saying I had to pick it up by a certain time I didn\u2019t think it really matter or would hurt for it to sit there considering it was paid for already but it\u2019s fine it\u2019s a loss Its no big deal I just felt like If y\u2019all send stuff back and are gonna do that u should tell everyone before it is every purchased. And I never spoke to a manager or was never told it was a manager I called back the next day after I went to try and pick it up and was told I\u2019d have someone in contact with me about it and never heard back from anyone. I never said I didn\u2019t get a 20 percent discount that isn\u2019t the point I still paid what I\u2019m required to pay so that discount shouldn\u2019t matter in this situation. But it\u2019s fine I honestly don\u2019t want the shirt anymore i just felt it wasn\u2019t handle professionally and should have been told to me before I ever bought the shirt then I would have been sure to have my mom or husband go get the shirt. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t know one shirt would take up that much room.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1563897058541, "text": "I\u2019m the owner and this doesn\u2019t sound right at all.  Let me check into this please.\n\nHi, I checked into this and found out that you ordered this top in January, 7 months ago and our records indicate several phone calls, text messages and emails to you with no response.  Our last attempt to contact you was at the end of May, 5 months after you ordered and stating we\u2019d hold it another 2 weeks but if you didn\u2019t pickup, it would be sent back to the vendor.  When we send a garment back to the vendor and only because we don\u2019t carry that item in the store and don\u2019t have room; we are charged a 20% restocking fee plus UPS & Fed Ex want pickup for less than $12.  So, restocking fee, shipping charges and employee time spent on your purchase does not equal a double profit but rather a loss.  Plus, you payroll deducted and got a 20% discount.  We work very hard to please our customers.  I also talked to the manager and she spoke with you in person on Saturday.  I personally check my receipt for store return policies before going and specially would look if it had been 7 months."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4308a448a9e5:0x15e6b9804f42bc3d"}

A scrub top was purchased here, right before closing time, so my wife couldn't even try it on. After seeing that it does not fit well, it was brought back to the retailer the next business day. The lady then made every excuse not to take back the return, suggesting it has been washed and ironed, and had spots on it, when in fact it hadn't been washed or ironed.  I assured the retailer that we can even show her our work schedule to prove it hasn't been worn to work.  This retailer sold us a defective product and then claimed it's the customers fault that it is defective. After looking at two other scrub tops and finding spots on them, the retailer claimed that they were not there a minute ago and practically implied that one of us is responsible for her manufacturer defect. Buyer beware.\n\nUPDATE: Dear Barb n Bae, thank you for further demonstrating the level of unproffesionalism at your place of business by assuming that Google reviews works like Facebook, and publicly insulting a customer. Clearly, this business is not aware of the terms of policy on Google Reviews. The owner's ( now removed) comment is a blatant conflict-of-interest violation, ( spouse status as LLC co-owner), as well as inappropriate. The time to resolve any misunderstanding was presented, and has came & gone, during the two very civil consecutive visits to the store. If the retailer would like their defective garment for forensic examination and reassurance that it has not been washed or bleached, they are welcome to it.\n\n7/28/2016 Dear William, thank you for your prompt response. We have already offered the garment to you for forensic examination that it has not been washed or bleached. My wife posted a review in addition to mine, as she is a separate individual, and we both had an experience in your store. This purchase was actually our second purchase at your store. We are both educated people, and don't appreciate being taken for fools or called liars. In all reasonable sense, and before calling a returning customer a flat-out liar, you must consider the possibility that some garments you receive from the manufacturer may have had a small defect when you receive them. You may have vast experience in this business, but everyone can make mistakes, and after turning over hundreds of different tops, there is a small chance that something may have been overlooked. Human error occurs, and this is a fact. We are not implying that your M.O. is to rip customers off, however, please understand that when we know for a fact that the garment has not been washed or bleached (why would we do this to a brand new scrub?) , yet we are being told that we washed/bleached it, it creates a sense of mistrust. Had this been TJ Maxx or Target, they would not bother to argue with a returning customer. If you review your video footage, you can see that neither my wife, nor I, was not in any way hostile, did not insult you, and did not raise our voice. Thanks for following up, and God Bless you, as well", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e8fb7dceccf71:0x5a8cbc584256fb5a"}

I only had a problem with finding uniform pants to fit my daughter who is 11 years old and wears plus size pants. It was very hard to find pants in the store or online to fit her. She's about a size 161/2 plus. The pants so long that she was standing on them. Every pair that I bought would have to be altered for her height. Which is an inconvenience, due to the fact that school starts for her this week. I wanted to purchase her pants with this company because the quality is so good. Unfortunately, I will have to search other stores, which so far I've had no luck. I also found out by   a store rep that the company will no longer carry girls 16 half size or size 18 in pants. That was very unfortunate to hear. I will have to shop other stores to find her size again.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1564026871467, "text": "Good evening, LaTwan,\n\nI appreciate you taking the time to write to us.
