We got a really great deal on the drone and accessories, and Alex even recommended some items, such as blade guards, that I would have never thought of (at least not until after I replaced the blades a dozen times).\n\nAlex and his group are prompt, professional, and I will gladly recommend them to anyone considering...well ANYTHING related to needing a DJ, photographers, videographers, etc.  Great company!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a1cea6d790263:0xf47c8d2d579ac772"}
