Firstly, they  are exceptionally kind and welcoming people - very pleasant to speak and do business with.  I purchased their \"jumbo\" sized shrimp, and was very impressed with not only their actual size, but also the standardization of the the \"jumbo\" certification.  I have often bought \"jumbo\" shrimp from other sources and been disappointed to find that while a few jumbo sized shrimp were present, there were also many shrimp that did not meet the size qualifications of \"jumbo.\"  That was not the case with the Stewarts shrimp - \"jumbo\" actually meant \"jumbo\" and all the shrimp I've eaten so far have been of the appropriate size.  The most impressive finding regarding the Stewart's shrimp was the taste.  They are incredibly flavorful, with a salty richness that is very noticeable, but still allows the \"shrimp\" flavor to shine.   Just for fun, I did a side-by-side taste test of the Stewart's shrimp and a closely located competitor.  It was no contest - the Stewart shrimp beat the boots off the competition... A unanimous agreement amongst everyone that took place in the taste test.\n\nI was so impressed by the Stewarts that I called to let them know how much I have enjoyed my experience with them.\n\nFor all of these reasons, I don't plan on buying shrimp anywhere else.  I'll be a customer for life.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a1a8e908fc779:0xb64e96b93869d0eb"}

We purchased 2 whole red snapper at $52.61 and a half of filet of Salmon at $27.13. They politely provided ice for the ride as requested. Before we could get home we started smelling a foul smell from the fish. This has never happened on our ride from Whole Foods which is a farther distance. We are not fish experts by any means- just seafood lovers. Anyone who does fish would know that one of the fish that we were sold was spoiled and should not be eaten. Definitely an owner or employee of a seafood market would know this. I did some research to determine the signs of bad fish (Spoiled fish has an unpleasant, sharp smell of trimethylamine (bad fish) and rot. Eyes of fresh fish are bulging and shiny. Eyes of old fish are cloudy and sunken into the head. Gills and fins of fresh fish are moist).\nOne of our fish had all of the signs listed (I posted pictures of the two snappers we were sold).\nSo what was meant for dinner for two is now dinner for one for @ $52.61.\nThis was my first and last experience at the Hoover Seafood Market.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNATU6XldunLINz-JN-nOTTZwB9oIs5fqLJdHcJ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888921d89afd6587:0xdb4d19b7faf174e6"}

I had been planning to visit ROE for quite a while (I do not live in Calera) and was looking forward to visiting both their bar and game store. According to Google Maps, ROE identifies itself as Black-owned, veteran-led, and women-led; three things I would normally go out of my way to support. However, the following sign greeted me upon arrival, prominently featured in ROE's store-front window: \"Guns are welcome on premises. Please keep all weapons holstered unless need arises. In such cases, judicious marksmanship is appreciated.\" So despite making a special trip to Calera specifically to visit ROE, I turned around and never plan to visit so long as this ridiculous and dangerous policy remains in place. As a university professor, I believe in evidence-based reasoning, and data shows that the \"good guy with a gun myth\" is just that -- a myth. I prefer to keep my tavern interactions with folks armed with deadly weapons to the realm of fantasy, where they belong; NOT my not-so-local hobby shop.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1628094336334, "text": "As the owner, I would like to say I am sorry that you felt that way about our store without speaking with us about it.  My husband is a combat arms vet and I am military raised, and so we have a slightly different humor.  I agree that our store is not for everyone, just like not every shop is for us.  That being said, spending any time in our store with our regulars would show that while we allow carry (and only a small amount actually carry), misbehavior with such items is NOT TOLERATED.  We have found that those that stay with us, stay because they feel welcomed and accepted for who they are without judgement; and we have ALL types here.  No one here gets away with bullying or criticizing others for their various believes as long as said believes bring no harm to self or others.  We consciously monitor the behavior and body language of everyone that visits as should be done no matter the type of shop.  Once again, I am sorry you felt your trip a waste of time, and hope that you do find a shop where you feel comfortable and happy, because end the end, that is what is important."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889240e48ac29ef:0xc41581582d3a19c2"}

And it's almost Christmas and everytime it gets close to November, I'm just so upset about it. I didn't call my bank bc I thought they were going to fix the issue. Just so disappointed. Haven't shopped there since. I normally order my stuff online because I don't like going into the stores, very messy and unorganized.

She is not nice at all, past 6 years of many business given to her and not once a thank you. Jenny is very rude and uncooperative.\n\nGave Jenny $2,000 worth of business last week and she got paid the full amount. Upon paying she informed don't come here again. I asked for what as I have been going to her since the past 6 years with thousands of dollars given to her.\n-I even explained to her \"I AM ASIAN TOO why are you doing this to me when I have always paid (in large sums)\"?\n\nShe has lost a large chunk of business by telling me not to come. I thought she was joking when she told me when I came to pick up the material.\n\nIn normal fashion I came following week and she said, \"no work for you\". She refused to do my personal clothes. Still confused on why considering I gave her $2,000 the previous week I was bewildered.\n\nI suggest going to Birmingham or using someone else in town. This lady demands cash, refused to fill out a W9 form to evade taxes, and she runs a shady operation in which the Federal government needs to do an audit on her.\n-She doesn't report any taxes and clearly told me that information last week when she refused to accept a verified business check. Her response, \"NO NO NO only cash I no pay tax\"", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1572572333176, "text": "Hello Mr. Patel,\nThis is Jenny. ( I have someone write this on my behalf, as you know my English is not very good.)\n\nI appreciate your business over the years, however as a small private business owner, I have the rights to refuse service. I have been very cordial and welcoming to you over the years, however if my actions somehow displayed otherwise, I sincerely apologize. I valued all my customers. To clear the misunderstanding as to why I no longer wish to provide service I'll provide the reasons why.\n\nUpon the transaction exchange, you demanded that I fill out a W-9 for you. Since I have never filled one out and the document was foreign to me I objected because I had no idea what it was (it was against my better judgment to sign any documents that I don't understand). I asked you to speak to my daughter on the telephone to explain it to her so she can translate it back to me and I later realized I had to provide one.\n\nThis exchange was not a pleasant one for both parties. I apologize that I am not fluent in English and therefore misunderstood you when you try to explain the W-9 form to me.\n\nHowever, you fail to mentioned in your reviews how you treated me during the exchange which is why I asked you to not bring me your service again. I felt your actions towards me was very hostile and threatening. You came back to my shop and explicitly told my daughter you were \"close friends\" with the owner of the shop and will shut my business down (I am the business owner, and the person who I am renting from does not know you.)\n\nNot only did you threw wild accusations when I refused to show you proof of paperwork my private tax documents/records (these are my personal documents) and REPEATLY threaten to call the police on me for \"evading tax\". If this were the case, I would no longer be in business. Another thing, I do take checks. As for your last statement, please don't use lies to slander me.\n\nI too was quite \"bewildered\" when you came back the following week to ask for my service after I asked that you to not come back again. As you left, you once again yell at me and threatened to \"shut my business down\".\n\nOnce again, I thank you for your previous business and hope the best for you. I hope this will clear the prior misunderstanding."}, "gmap_id": "0x8888a8491997cc7f:0xb6d296ddbbec197"}

Margo recommended I try CBG oil for both my pain and energy issues.  I'm now completely off all my prescription meds and am doing much better than I had been on them.  I've learned to manage my pain and energy in a much more effective way that doesn't mess with my weight or personality.

We were doing further research and my dad interrupted us to say that the ringing he had for years in his right ear was barely there. Fast forward to a few days later, the ring is gone.

I can\u2019t say enough about the friendliness of Mrs Margo!!! Now if you are are on the fence about trying the CBD products, here\u2019s my suggestion for you: DO IT!!! My husband and I have decided to try it out over the last week and a half or so, and there have been MAJOR differences!!!!\n\nMy personal testimony for the CBD products: I have synthetic cartilage, a medal plate and six screws that sit across the orbital bone in the right side of my face. You can imagine the pain it causes. My first time in to check out the store and the products, I explained to Mrs Margo about the metal and screws, she allowed me to sample a pain cream they have, for several hours that day I was COMPLETELY PAIN FREE!!! For the first time in over 3 years!!!! I bought a bottle of the Water Soluble CBD oil, and took it home to try. As I have used the product I have began to notice that the pain in my face is more manageable, my anxiety hasn\u2019t been nearly as high. Due to other medical issues, there are certain days where pain would keep me from doing ANYTHING AT ALL. It would hurt to breathe or even roll over in bed. Since using this product, I have notice the pain is more manageable, and on days that I would normally just lay in bed and try to lay completely still, I am getting up and doing things like baking cupcakes and making icing from scratch!!! I am a true believer in this product now!!! Give it and Mrs Margo at Your CBD Store in Enterprise a shot! See what it can do for you!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1589218880927, "text": "Hi Ashley. Thank you for taking your time to share your experience with others!

We arrived a couple of hours before our showtime, so like anyone else would have done, we decided to take a look around and see what some of the stores had to offer.\n\nI saw the Un Voyage Plain in the store window as we were walking by. I was in the market for a pair of comfortable shoes to wear to an upcoming event that requires all attendees to adhere to a business casual dress code. I don't often go to these types of events, so I didn't really know what I wanted, but I was immediately drawn to this shoe when I saw it in the store window.\n\nI went in to take a closer look and was greeted by an associate named LeeAnn. She was extremely knowledgeable with a keen eye for detail. She asked me when I had had my feet measured last, and honestly I couldn't remember ever having my feet measured.\n\nAfter taking my measurements, she recommended going with a half size higher than I usually buy and using insoles to take up some of the extra space since one of my feet is a half size bigger than the other. I took her advice, and I have never been more comfortable in a pair of formal shoes.\n\nOverall the experience was great, and I will be a regular customer going forward.

I looked at him and stated that the piece of paper I gave him states thats all I need for a refund and I hope its not going to be a problem since the order number and barcode was on the shipping receipt.
