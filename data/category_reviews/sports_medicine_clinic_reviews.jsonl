I received a shoulder injury this summer and was referred by Grandview ER to Dr. Moul.  I went to her office on a Monday and saw Dr. Sudduth who was so kind but felt that I needed to come back the next day and see Dr. Moul to talk about surgery.  I went back the next day and she looked at my X-rays, came in the examination room, and never examined  me.  She told me to take the sling off and go to physical therapy for three weeks which I did.  The therapists questioned why an MRI was never done and felt my injury was more severe than she thought and so did I.  When I returned 3 weeks later for my follow up she told me to stop therapy and gave me a steroid pack.  I told her how bad it was still hurting.  Still no MRI so I went to my regular doctor who sent me for an MRI.  I have a torn labrum and have an appointment with Dr. Andrews surgical group tomorrow.\n\nI had my surgery with Andrews  on 11/20/20 and had a labrum tear repair,  rotator cuff repair, and debris cleanup in my joint.  I am looking at a long recovery now which could have been avoided and already done with a simple MRI four months ago to see what was really going on inside my shoulder.  I am very frustrated because I spent  probably $700-800 dollars in unnecessary PT fees and copays which only made my issues worse.  Since surgery I have started PT but am fixing to experience a break in services because I have used my allotted physical therapy services for the year by being sent needlessly to therapy for a month by Dr. Moul instead of her taking the time to do an MRI to see what would have been obvious.  I am beyond frustrated with the situation above and will be looking into possible courses of action to recover expenses that could have been avoided if she had used reasonable medical judgement.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1605536459814, "text": "We would like the opportunity to address your concerns.

But anyway, I was scheduled for an MRI and didn't realize how claustrophobic I was until the day of.  I immediately left the hospital and came back to  the office and explained to the nurse the issue I had.  Her was response was we can only give you one pill. First of all, I was new patient and they know nothing about me.  I hate taking medicine, but I was desperate to find out what is wrong with my arm.  I have been on the same job for 16 years and only have to go to the doctor twice because of job related issues.  When I initially met Dr. Determann he seemed like he really wanted to find out what was going on as well. After getting the MRI he only saw a small spot and started saying his office wasn't in to do pain management and that I was able to go back to work as normal lifting same amount weight.  He also stated that I should not be on light duty.  The medicine he prescribed for me made me drowsy and I could not function, so I brought it back and asked the nurse to dispose of them. He mentioned physical therapy and it's been over a week and I have not heard from the office for an appointment.  He mentioned making a referral appointment to see a rheumatologist and I have not received an appointment yet.  It's sad to me for someone to assume and stereotype instead of giving me a real solution other than medicine. This small spot has had me off work for almost six weeks and the office would not even fill out fmla papers so I didn't have to use up all my annual leave.  Dr. Determann told me I had to go the physician that referred me to him for them to complete the paperwork. This really bothered me, so I went to Dr. Goldman at the Daphne received a much simpler solution that gave some much needed relief the next day.  Some people are actually hurting and not after a prescription.  I don't want to be contacted by email, text, calls, or any form of communication from this office.  I have already told some of my family and friends Do Not Come to this office in Fairhope.  The staff and environment in Daphne was like night and day.

I love everybody here and I would totally recommend anyone and everyone to come here for Physical Therapy!

I have had a great experience with Dr. Waldrop and the staff at Andrews Sports medicine. I just had my 3rd follow up appt with Dr. Waldrop after my foot surgery six weeks ago. My foot is doing great! He always checks my foot himself, including doing my last X-ray himself. He personally provides instruction and maintains expectations so you are prepared and feel a bit in control. The follow up appointments are quick, which means the wait times are very short, a rarity in doctors offices. But he has always been friendly and answered my few concerns. It's all a balancing act and for me, a skilled surgeon with a great staff (who also answer emails) and very limited waiting times has been very enjoyable.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc9dd09ad61:0x3abf8613961397d5"}

His nurse practictioner takes on the same attitude, she was as crass and insulting as they come. She is that way because he is that way. There is a single word to describe her that I will for integrity sake leave out. My surgery consultation was on Thursday and he was very willing to schedule my surgery for the following Monday however would not tell me what he planned to do procedure wise. I had many uneasy feelings due to his haughty attitude but continued to ask questions so I could make a well informed decision about my surgery. He talked down to me like I was an uneducated piece of garbage and had no sense. Still trying to overlook the insults, I continued to attempt to ask questions, but was rudely shut down as he walked right out the door with me still asking for information. I was very shocked and upset about the entire experience because my family/I have always had such wonderful experiences with the doctors/surgeons of Andrews Sports Medicine. I am rather taken back that they continue to allow such a fester to be a part of their team. I left there and immediately searched for another surgeon AND facility. He now gives me apprehensions about Andrews judgement in allowing him to continue to practice there. My thoughts were, he may be a good surgeon but who in their right mind would want that hateful and uncaring of a person to DO the surgery and then be THE person they rely on for the next 6-8 months in healing/recovery. He does not deserve the one star I had to choose in doing my review. Please don\u2019t waste your time with him. He & his nurse practitioner are NOT the caring and compassionate people that doctors and nurses are called to be.***Oh...never even saw one of the many X-rays that were taken of my foot. Never discussed it or even offered to show it to me...doubt that he even looked at it to be honest. ARROGANT MAN...not what a doctor should be. I have now learned from others who won\u2019t take the time to post that they were treated the same way.

I had back surgery in 2009 (L5-S1 discectomy) and was strongly discouraged from running by a PT I saw after my surgery.  I had been feeling pretty good getting back into it, but was worried about possible injury both to my back and knees.  Andrew's running assessment and subsequent muscle strength assessment were extremely helpful.  He gave me a couple of things to change while running to help prevent injury and a list of stretches to strengthen my leg and core muscles.  A few weeks ago I ran my very first half marathon.  A few weeks before that, I had tweaked my back doing something stupid and was afraid I was going to have to give up running the half.  I emailed Andrew who encouraged me that all was not lost.  With his expert advice, I not only ran the whole way, but ran faster than I was expecting!  I have since run a 10K and have 2 more half marathons and a 10-miler on the horizon.\n\nSeriously, make an appointment with Andrew!  For anything!  Not just if you're a runner or athlete.  He can help with normal (and not so normal) life pains, post-surgery issues, etc.  Not only is he knowledgeable about how the body works, but he also takes the time to explain the whats and whys and hows.  My only complaint is that he lives in Alabama while I'm in Colorado and therefore I can't very easily make appointments with him!

Instead of going 3 days a week for several weeks (which is really hard to do if you are working), I was set up over a longer period of time (once a week, then twice a month, then 4 weeks/6 weeks later).  The phone exercise app he provides, allows me to track the exercises I have to do.  He is very encouraging especially at times when I think I'm not making any progress and teaches you self release methods to relieve pain.  I am now into my 4th month of therapy  (6th visit) and I'm running again!  My hip feels stronger and I'm looking forward to many more miles on trails and roads in the future.  Andrews approach does take self motivation because you have to do the work on your own rather than at office setting for an hour 3 days a week.  But being pain free is a great motivator.

I was heartbroken to think that I wouldn\u2019t be able to race. Thankfully I found Andrew through his insightful Facebook posts and gave him a call last January. His wholistic and long term vision for getting better and staying better was exactly what I was looking for. The running analysis he provided revealed so many things that could have stalled my fitness goals indefinitely had they been left unaddressed.  I travel a lot for work as well, so his \u201cwork on your own\u201d method for physical therapy exercises rather than multiple visits per week was a perfect way for me to augment my existing exercise routine without disrupting my work schedule. By March I was able to finish the Atlanta Sprint race - still walking more than I wanted but at least I was on the course and it only took about 30 minutes more than usual.  After about 5 or 6 visits I had made good progress and was on my way to pain free running. By July I was able to run the Asheville Super and only had to pace myself a bit on the downhill portion towards the end of the race.  In August I started having shin splints.  I reached out to Andrew via Facebook Messenger and within an hour had a new set of exercises that took care of the problem in a few weeks.  No \u201cmake an appointment with the receptionist\u201d or other nonsense like that.  The last time I had shin splints they lingered for months and the only advice I got from my doctor was to take a few Advil every day and stop exercising - not an option for me. Now in November I was able to run the Carolina Beast without any pain.  Achieving this goal would not have happened without Andrew\u2019s help and seemed impossible when I was limping out of the store with a knee brace last December.\nAt first I was worried about not being able to have insurance cover my therapy. In retrospect, the investment I made with PhysioWorks is going to save me so much money in the long run.  Andrew\u2019s approach was exactly what this Spartan needed to finally join the Trifecta Tribe.  If you\u2019re an Obstacle Course Racer and have any pain that\u2019s keeping you off the course, I highly recommend you give PhysioWorks a try. Andrew works with a local Crossfit business as well, so he can help with more than just running.\nThanks Andrew!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1509839627753, "text": "Thanks Tag!

I saw Andrew at Physioworks about a month ago now. I'm a non-formally trained regular runner with several halves and one full marathon, so far, under my belt. Previous to going to Physioworks I had suffered from regular occurring achilles tendinopathy and strains to my gastrocnemious muscle. Andrew was able to shed light on several corrections I could make to improve my form and methods. After roughly 30 minutes of range of motion and strength testing, I got on the treadmill for a running assessment. Andrew showed me several things about my stride that I could improve; everything from how my feet were falling to how my torso was positioned while running. After the appointment Andrew gave me several strengthening exercises for my weak muscle groups and left me with some invaluable tools advice to improve both my time and endurance.

I am getting a little older now and I have to slow down a little but I am glad that this guy knows what he is doing. He has proved trustworthy.\nHe did not pay me to say any of the above.

I personally experienced this situation below on 10/08/2018. If you get a bill from them, double check everything. They are trying to make patients responsible for their own adjustment errors back in 2014. They just caught these errors they made in 2018 because they waited 4 years to audit their books. That being said.......my story below.\n\nUOC is a good organization and has always done a great job whenever I have visited their office. However, I recently received a bill out of the blue saying I owed over $300.00. First and foremost, I pay my bills on time and do not let my accounts become delinquent. I called their office to find out why I received a letter saying I owed money since I was recently just in their office and they never mentioned this balance before. I found out they recently did an audit on September 28th, 2018 and realized they made an internal accounting error from 4 years ago. So when my account was adjusted back from THEIR mistakes, my account showed an open balance and they sent me a bill demanding payment.\n\nLong story short - Their company made an internal accounting error and they just caught this 4 years later and are now trying to back charge their patients for their OWN mistakes in their accounting department. I went down to their office and they were not willing to work things out with me based off of their own negligence in their bookkeeping department. Not until I told them that my attorney and I were going to sue them and I was going to bring in Fox 6 News on your side (to expose their company with what they were doing behind the scenes to their patients) did they try to eliminate my bill from where they made a mistake (now my patient balance is zero - how convenient). I have never heard of any type of business back charging someone for THEIR own mistakes.

I have suffered accelerated degenerative disc disease (DDS), spondylosis, and stenosis  in my spine, since age 38. In the past 15 years, my condition has necessitated a spinal fusion (L5-S1), a microdiscectomy (L4-L5),  and a neck (cervical) fusion (C3-C4).       The surgeries were successful with the last neck surgery sparing me from becoming a paraplegic or death. I have been blessed with excellent surgeons and caregivers. I'm grateful.\nI had tried chiropractor prior to my surgeries. The chiropractor worked diligently with me. I also worked hard doing all to help myself. The effort did not help. I would suppose my spine had too many mechanical issues at that time.\nAs I aged, my condition worsened until I was bed fast 18 hours or more each 24 hour cycle. One day as I was laying in bed , the latter part of 2015, I thought maybe I should try chiropractor services again. After all, the surgeries had alleviated some of the worst mechanical problems in my spine. I had 7 primary points of pain. The pain between my shoulder blades was the worse, a grating, stinging type of pain. My thoughts were, If I can knock out 80% of that pain, I would be 30-40% better overall. Also, this pain would mushroom into total body pain, unless I was able to quiet the pain. Laying on ice gel packs would help quiet the pain.\nI obtained the services of Dr. Anthony Houssain at SpineCare.  My first meeting (Jan. 2016) with Dr. Houssain, I laid out my objective. My objective was to lessen the pain between the shoulder blades by 80%.  Dr. Houssain set me on a treatment path to help me accomplish my objective. He was encouraging and very knowledgeable. Dr. Houssain believed he could give me back a part of my life that I had lost.\nOn my second visit,  Dr. Houssain manipulated 3 vertebrates in my thoracic area. I went home and lay down. I had a first, two hours pain free between the shoulder blades. Now, I had hope and believed we were on the right path to accomplish my goal. He has helped me not only to obtain my objective , but to exceed my objective. At times, I do have pain between my shoulder blades. When I experience the pain, I execute the home part of Dr. Houssain's treatment program. Dr. Houssain's treatment program with other tools in my toolbox are sufficient to manage and mostly alleviate the pain between the shoulder blades.\nI love the game of golf. Seven or eight years ago, I was having a good day for me. My son and I decided to play a round of golf. My whole body was in pain after the round. I got home, went to my room, shut the door, and cried my heart out. I was in total body pain and believed I would never play golf again. This was my last round of golf with my son. I did not hit a golf ball for another 7-8 years.\nAfter the pain between my shoulder blades was mostly alleviated and/or pain level lessened, it was time to attempt a round of golf again. On April 19, 2016, I played golf with my son, shooting 89. I was sore, but did not have any serious side-effects. I now play golf, about once a week. I am now able to be up more hours per day.\nMy objective was accomplished with Dr. Houssain's help. In fact, it would not have happened without him. I am not well, but I have a much better life. Will I continue to improve or will the good ride end? I don't know, but I know it been a much better ride since April. I thank the good Lord for putting people in my life to help me, Dr Houssain being one of those people.\nI know every one is different, and one may obtain better results than me, or not obtain as good results as me. But, I always have kept trying to find any nugget that would help me be better. I hope those who read this, will keep trying to find that nugget for themselves. If one keeps trying, they may well find the nugget that makes their life better.. Keep on, keeping on.

He's the only reason why I tried the new place after he moved from Spincare. Unfortunately, I won't be returning here due to the way this company deals with their customers financially.\nI saw Dr. Robinson back in October 2017 and again in November 2017. He's always great, he has great bedside manners, and he cracks me up.  Everything was awesome as usual. I paid my copay, was told I have a $0 balance, and was good to go both times. I never like to have balances, so I pay whatever I owe when I see a doctor.\nFast forward SEVEN MONTHS LATER, I get a BILL in the mail for unpaid fees that apparently only went towards my deductable and now I owe $88. I called last Monday and was told I'd have to call next Monday to speak to the billing person, so I waited 7 more days and called today. She went over the bill in detail, including how they even gave me some discount to adjust my bill as if they're doing me a favor.\nI maintained my voice and words and told her I guess I have no choice but to pay this bill, even though you guys waited over a half year to bill me. I told her I was coincidentally planning on coming back to see Dr. Robinson again but now that I got this bill, I'll be going somewhere else. She told me \"well I'm sorry you feel that way.\"\nSo, that's that. I'll miss Dr. Robinson because he's literally a miracle worker, but this billing and the way the company manages their patient's accounts is **extremely** unprofessional.  It does not take 7 months for people's health insurance to get back to you. This is 100% P3's fault due to negligence, laziness...maybe both.\n\nWhat's funny is my husband got a free massage session from them in the mail the same week I got that bill...he hasn't seen Dr. Robinson in over a year.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886212f544b4c8a7:0x4331ab6555e87ed7"}

He has a genuine nature, a respect for where you are in the process, and a drive to see you return to wellness.  He took the time to evaluate me and was methodical in his design of a plan that worked not only in the clinic but could be transitioned to home. He championed me through tough times with kindness, professionalism, and a warmth that led to a trust which is necessary for the recovery process to be successful.  He is a credit to his profession and an asset to TherapySouth.\nThroughout the following weeks, I worked with Abbey.  Abbey is truly a pioneer in her field.  She is focused and attentive during every session, kind, compassionate, knowledgeable, and helpful.  When I was doubtful, she was always there to encourage me, being honest with me about the challenges I would face, yet reassuring me that I would one day be able to return to a life filled with many athletic endeavors.  Abbey is understanding and genuinely takes a personal interest in how you're feeling.  She always made sure to explain every exercise in depth and also how it would aid in my progress going forward.  I feel lucky to have been guided by Abbey along my PT journey, for it was her encouragement that pushed me through when I was at my lowest.\nHannah is also extremely helpful and efficient.  Being the face you see when you first walk in, she is cheerful and always greets the patients by name.  TherapySouth has an amazing team and, more importantly, great teamwork.

She told me to quit wearing the cast and start to use it. If it wasn't better in 2 weeks I would need to see a surgeon. Well I saw a surgeon today and it is too late to fix my thumb. He put a stack splint on to try and pull the bones together so fibrous tissue can form and help with my pain. I will never have full function of my thumb again, it won't bend all the way due to the break. And I will never be able to use my thumb without pain. It will also get arthritis because it was left untreated. Basically, the 5 weeks I spent under Dr Casey's care was a complete waste of my time.

I had a core decompression on hips that went bad. I could barely walk enough to get to my car and couldn't reach my feet. I'm an active duty police lieutenant and firearms instructor. It's hard to teach on the range on crutches and barely able to walk 25 yards. My officers were begging to stop hurting myself for them and retire. Dr. Ryan advised what he thought was best and explained my options and was honest about which options he thought would work. Unlike other experiences he didn't push for surgery, just suggested it as the best option and would do what I decided,  His staff were very kind and caring. Always seemed to remember me. They were careful to explain to my wife and meet her needs to be my caregiver while I healed. The orthopedic surgery pre-op staff and nurses were kind and went out of their way to check on me both prior and after my surgery. Both hospital stays, at St. Thomas, I had the most amazing hospital nurses I've ever had during all my hospital stays in the past, I've had plenty. They not only took of me, but took care of the family that stayed with me, especially my wife. They were careful to check on her needs too. Physical therapy in the hospital, therapist were careful to explain what they were showing me and  watched for my safety. Wish I would have known about Andrews Sports Medicine and St. Thomas Hospital years ago. I am still healing from second hip replacement. I can now reach my feet, put on my own socks and shoes, pick something off the floor, get in my truck and start looking for a time to ride my Harley. Haven't even to just sit on it in three years. Because of Doc and all the others involved I can walk and serve the public for more years, I can teach on the range, I can play with my grandchildren. I'm going from can't get off the bed to being able to get down the steps to enter my house. Still hurting some, still healing, learning to walk again. I know this is wordy, but I can't thank everybody enough for their professionalism and caring. I can have some quality of life and career  back.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1598622643978, "text": "Mr. Christianson, thank you so much!

Big open area with windows and tellers like a bank when you go in.  Find the correct window then check in.  The girl there was chewing her gum like a cow eating its curd.\n\nWait time was 1 hour and 35 minutes .. how perfect is that.\n\nFinally saw the doctor, Johathan Jennings a orthopedic surgeon.   Looked at x-rays for a second then my ankle.  Then he said wow .. looked at x-ray again for an additional 15 seconds and came up with  \"possibly a hair line fracture but it is covered with some calcification\" so not sure - CROCK.  That just doesn't occur in a short time.  He squeezed here and there and ask if it hurt which it did not.  At that point I think he was stumped.\n\nI asked about a cortisone injection for the inflammation and swelling - nope.  OK, how about taking my NSAID's - yep sure.  I told him I have plenty of Day Pro and could try it again ... he got the deer in the headlights look and finally said he didn't know what it was - so, look it up with that fancy smart phone doc.  I told him what it was and he insisted I needed Meloxican instead.  I have high blood pressure and one of the side effects for that medication is a significant increase in BP and it has a black warning.  The other, you guessed it, swelling in the ankles and feet - ho funny is that!  Apparently he never looked over the 4 pages of paperwork they require us to fill out!  OK I say but I need a written script because I'm headed back to Florida.\n\nI go to check out - no script - surprise, lol.  Back to the girl in the stall to ask for it.  She looks at the computer and tells me it was called in to xyz pharmacy ... 15 minutes later we got that fixed.\n\nI was also supposed to be scheduled for a follow up in 30 days ... no one knew anything about that.  Good thing as it would be a cold day before I'd go back to see this guy or this place.  I'd have to be in real tough shape and desperate.\n\nDefinitely NOT RECOMMENDED  I shot better than a half day and $300 for this \"service\".  This outfit is a meat market.

Visited at the recommendation of my physical therapist for a shoulder issue. When I got to the lobby I could tell this place is set up for mass production: there were check-in kiosks like at the airport and a bunch of people waiting. When I was called the first time, it was to pay. When I was called the second time, I was led to a second  waiting room with no explanation. The third time I was led to an x-ray room where I found out I was getting x-rays. Surprise! Eventually, I was led to an examination room. No vitals were taken. I waited. Eventually, a doctor - not the one I had the appointment with - showed up and immediately started to discuss scheduling surgery without examination. He discussed two procedures - the second one was news to me. When I inquired, he then tested my range of motion to confirm what he had seen in the tests. I expressed doubts about the second procedure and he left to get the originally-scheduled doctor. After nearly 30 minutes, they both came back. The second (scheduled) doctor explained why he recommended the second procedure as a preemptive option. He did a good job of explaining the surgery and recovery. He left and the first doctor took me to a scheduler. Everyone I interacted with was cordial and professional. I never saw my x-rays nor the MRI I had brought with me. I realize this place is good and they have a lot of people to get to. I known they are all fine surgeons. But still, I felt like one more item to check off on their to-do list. I still have unanswered  questions and it is ironic that being there for 2.5 hours and waiting most of the time, that I felt rushed when it came to the consultation.

They are professional, but very personable and approachable.  You never feel like they are in a hurry to see you and get you out of the office.  My family and I have seen four different doctors at Andrews for a variety of problems, and each has had a very successful outcome.  They were surgical, had no problems at all, and are as good as new now.  I have also seen the non-surgical doctors and they are great as well.  They know what they are doing, and do it better than any other doctor.  One family member went to an orthopaedic doctor here in Tuscaloosa several times for a problem with her foot.  He had no idea what was wrong or how to treat her, but he did give her steroid injections a couple of times hoping that would help the problem - it didn't help.  We told her to go to Andrews!  She was able to get a new patient appointment within several days, the doctor saw her, knew exactly what the problem was, performed surgery, and she never had any problems with her foot again.  My family and I highly recommend Andrews Sports Medicine and Orthopaedic Center!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1559136165098, "text": "Thank you so much for your trust in our practice and for taking the time to share your family's experience with our team of doctors.

Being an active person who likes to hike and lives on a farm, I immediately went to the doctor and was referred for physical therapy. It didn't help at all. Over the last five years, I have tried different doctors who have referred me to different physical therapists, with no change in pain level.\nAt my last doctor's appointment, my primary doctor asked if anything was bothering me and I told him I still had plantar fasciitis. We talked through my experience and he suggested I try a different podiatrist, Dr. Stark. Dr. Stark immediately referred me to Therapy South and asked that I see Robert Harris. I went to the appointment not expecting any different outcome but I am so glad I went! Robert was encouraging, saying he had a plan and he felt confident he could help me. We started with therapy three times a week, addressing first the plantar problem but then working backward to involve the parts of the leg and hip that caused the injury in the first place. Robert gave me four exercises to do twice daily at home and I logged exercise sessions through an easy to use app. Each appointment has been a teaching experience. Robert asks how I'm doing, I tell him how I'm progressing or having problems and he immediately explains and teaches me a stretch or exercise that will help. Robert's goal is to teach me strategies to address problems independently in the future. Each week finds me feeling better, my plantar fasciitis pain now almost completely gone.

Nine months later, I am able to do most activities that I want/need/love to do without ANY pain and I have gained muscle strength and flexibility that I so desperately needed.\n\nI really don't know what I would have done without the physical therapists Robert and Emily, their interns, and the wonderful staff at TherapySouth-Auburn.

A year and a half ago, I could no longer live with my shoulder pain, both sides due to torn rotator cuffs.  My orthopedist said surgery was likely the only way to successfully heal.  I did not want that and asked for a PT referral.  I began therapy at TherapySouth in January 2018 and was surprised at how thorough and caring the folks were.  I was asked detailed questions throughout my initial evaluation and follow-up questions during each exercise.  Robert and Dreher would adjust exercises according to my limits and evaluate my ongoing recovery at each session.  By April, I had almost full motion in my arms/shoulders, pain was gone, and I even could reach around back to scratch my shoulder blades!  All without any NSAIDS or other drugs.\n\nSo when I began having elbow pain this year, I asked my doctor for a referral to TherapySouth.  Once again a thorough evaluation of my pain and its source was done by Robert.  By the second session I was already experiencing significant relief from pain that was serious enough to keep me awake at night.  And no drugs!  During my last session, I menbtioned that I also suffered from occipital neuralgia.  Robert did not seem surprised and showed me how complex the relationship with all the tendons, muscles, etc in the back and neck can end up causing pain and trigger points.  Here I am two days later with reduced pain throughout my neck, back, shoulders.\n\nIf you are injured, TherapySouth is the place to go for Physical Therapy.  I've literally been to dozens of therapists over a lifetime.  No one comes close to these folks.  If I could give them 10 stars instead of 5 I would do that.

After the surgery I did physical therapy and still in pain. Returned to Dr F who just assumed  I had a back problem without him even taking a X-ray. For 7 months he sent me to get injections in my spine. I was still in pain and referred to a back surgeon and what he found was a deteriorated right hip. Once again Dr. F sent me to get injections in my hip. I got an injection in my hip but I will get second opinions with another surgeon on all that Dr. F\u2019s unprofessionally surgery he did and putting me through what he did and assuming I had back problems without an X-ray. I\u2019m sure Dr. F wouldn\u2019t appreciate his family going through what he put me through which could have all been avoided if he would have taken one X-ray. He needs to learn that he can\u2019t see through a person to diagnose their problems. I won\u2019t return here ever again or be put through pain for 7 months for his neglect of a surgeon who only wanted his money. After 7 months he did not know who I was which showed me that he is a money hungry surgeon only. Young surgeon who needs to get his facts straight and stop assuming what\u2019s wrong. A surgeon who didn\u2019t know who I was?  He finally did an X-ray but took 7 months for him to do it. I\u2019ve had enough and never again. Take my advice and find you another surgeon besides Farris you will regret it if you do. I have 3 witnesses to back me up , another surgeon and a injection specialist who also asked me where my back X-ray was, there wasn\u2019t one.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1571837152377, "text": "We apologize that we did not meet your expectations during your time in our clinic.

I went to an urgent care and had X-rays and was told to follow up with Orthopedic Dr to go from here. Which would be no different had I went to the ER in Enterprise.\nI touched base on Friday when I woke up and the telephone receptionist was so very rude. It was suggested to give it the weekend and call back on Monday.\nI called Monday 6/19 and was still swelling, hurting and very upset because I knew driving was also going to come into play. I stuck only with ibuprofen instead of pain medication. As soon as I woke up I called around 8:45AM.  Of course, I explained the story again, passed on my insurance information, and updated my personal information. The young lady on the phone was rude and very short. She then told me that she would speak to the Dr and get back with me. I got dressed and was ready to go as soon as she told me. My Mom was here to make sure I had help etc.  I also called the Irgent care place and requested a disc of my X-rays to pick up. My phone rang again around 11:30 and am was asked if I could contact the urgent care place and have the radiology report sent to SB&J. I did and she said that once the Dr had that info she would call me back and try to get me in after talking to the Dr. Again, we sat and waited for hours. At around 3:20 I received a phone call informing me that the Dr wanted me to wait until Wednesday and continue what I was doing. I stressed again the pain, how unstable I was feeling and the problems with being on crutches. She placed me on hold and came back again and rudely said \"call back on Wednesday\".\nSo, I wasted mine and my Mother's Day trying to get appropriate help. It was now 3:40 in the afternoon.\nI woke up this morning 6/21 and called first thing this morning, around 8:30AM only to reach a different and terrible personality on the phone. I explained the entire situation again.  She said that she would talk to the Dr and give me a call back. Of course, my Mother was here once again to help me. At around 11:40AM I received a call and an appointment was schedule for 6/22. I explained the pain, how long I had been put off and again was not her problem and you could tell she didn't care. I said, \"there is no way I can be seen today?\"  Her response, \"The Dr is trying to leave early today and there is nothing else I can do!\"  I explained that I would be calling around to get into a different branch or somewhere else. She didn't care about me and neither did that Dr apparently. I was angry and emotionally upset. I felt like this practice had no reason to be in business.\nI contacted a different office and guess what. It was 11:50AM and I had an appointment at 1:50PM. The Dr I saw was awesome and nobody seemed to be surprised by my story. Also, all the information that I had given to the rude ladies was not passed along. I had to go by and pick up a disc and a copy of the report to take with me. I now have the appropriate diagnosis, I am not in pain, the correct stability, an exercise strategy and feel \ud83d\udcaf% better. I did not want to cancel the appointment that was scheduled with the other office out of anger but I also did not want to be charged for a no show. I called back and a different rude lady answered the phone and I asked to speak to the girl i spoke with earlier. (Yes, I have the Dr's name and two of the girls I spoke with names however, I will keep them off the review. I told her I needed to cancel the appointment and she said, \"fine and hung up\". So if you want to be treated like you are human or that you are actually cared about this Customer Service and Orthopedic office is NOT the place you want to be.\nIn all honesty they are the only ones here in Enterprise and they must think we need them however, truth be told they need us. Without patients there is no practice. I would love nothing more than to see this business disappear and fail.\nHorrible way to treat people especially when I did everything I was asked to do. \ud83d\ude21", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88926c24f74906c7:0x3e82ddb2f4245634"}
