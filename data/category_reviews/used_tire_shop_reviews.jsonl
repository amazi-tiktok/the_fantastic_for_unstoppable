After getting the motor in it was knocking called and talked to a lady who said owner wasn\u2019t in and he\u2019ll give me a call back, he never called me back. I called a couple days later and he answered I let him know what was going on and he said you only have a 30 day warranty, when in fact my paperwork states I had 60. Thank god I had kept the receipt. He told me I had to fill out the warranty paperwork and present receipts. Ok no problem but on the warranty form it states that the timing belt needs to be replaced, this engine has a chain. He informed me that regardless belt or chain it\u2019s all the same. Well I got some news from you buddy there not, a chain shouldn\u2019t have to be serviced under normal conditions, a belt yes I agree it does. But if the motor is knocking that has nothing to do with it. This is a fair warning for anyone purchasing from here he will not refund your money and will think of any way possible not too, and he uses the square app which makes things much harder to get a refund through your credit card. But I am happy to say after over 8 months I have received my refund and hope this guy flies out of business and really feels it.

When I got there and tell them the problem they took the tire off and said my valve stem was bad and charged me $20 to replace the valve stem. I thought all was good, woke up Tuesday morning it was flat again. I called & spoke to Chris who told me that it was more than likely a cracked rim and there was nothing he could do about it. Today...FRIDAY, I took off work to take my car to Fortners. They first told me that the tire was the wrong size. Then when they got it off the rim they showed me 4 plugs where the tire had been repaired 4 times, previously.

There were only two employees working at the time an I guess they got overwhelmed because more people were in need of service; mind you I was the first customer an they should have been working on my car, but the guy kept stopping to help other people that had pulled up. So finally I had enough an asked the guy to please finish with my car, because I had to go rest before getting on the road (at that time I had been there close to 2 hours). So he did, an I was on my way. We made it through Montgomery without any problems, an then I was awaken by a loud noise, screeching tire sounds, and the sight of my front driver tire rolling away parallel to my truck, heading towards the grassy median. By the grace of God we were not hurt. The inside of the rim was shredded, the bolts were gone, the studs ate up. All this was caused by the a negligent employee that didn't properly tighten the bolts to secure the tire. I spoke with the owner about getting help, but none was offered, an he even tried placing the blame somewhere else. But I will never give Chris Tires anymore of my money/business nor will I recommend them to anyone. I spent over $600 to have my car fixed. I even checked the other tires an the bolts were not secure on them either. Lesson learned, u can't support everyone.

So, if an auto center changes your brakes in 30 min but the book says it takes 1.5 hours, then the shop charges you for the extra hour as an extra rake. Now, I do not mind paying the extra as long as the quality matches. This shop may do quick work, but it is not at the quality I am paying for. Poor value given, and they would not make it right either. Basically the repair guy did not remove all the necessary components (like a radiator) to save some time and shoved the water pump in at an angle.\n\nI will never use them again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888c4e6e0b99431:0x62babd6da353f44f"}

They fixed both and stuck to fair estimate.\n\nI wouldn't do business with them now after my last experience.\n\nMonth 1 & 2\nOur car needed a new engine. The shop owner wanted to get an engine from his supplying junkyard. He missed one that became available. This process took about 2 weeks before we decided to find an engine ourselves which he was not happy with but agreed to. He said they could have it put in within a 3 day period. The engine company we bought from needed it done in 10 days for warranty purposes. Griffith used all of the 10 days to because other cars came in front of me while we had to wait on engine. They finally got it in and started but had to send to dealership because the car went into anti-theft mode and wouldn't start. We had to actually arrange the drop off to the dealership ourselves. I feel like we were running his business for him because he was almost never there. The employees even mentioned that problem in passing.\n\nMonth 3\nWe become worried after not hearing anything from dealership or Griffin for about 2.5ish weeks. I had to contact dealership for them to tell me that they told Griffin that the car needed a major fuse panel that could be $1200+. I called Griffin to tell him I approved the install because we really needed the car. It's month 3 folks!\n\nIs it Month 4? Getting close anyway.\nWe had to go ourselves to the dealership to confront them about not getting to our car. This should be Griffin's job. The dealership says that the part didn't fix the problem. Car still doesn't work. We decide to give up because the car needed another part for $2400 to \"maybe\" fix. We decide to just give up. Dealership is trying to get more money from us even though they didn't fix the problem. Griffin is trying to put that on us. We said we would pay for his time, but does this seem fair? Griffin himself might be a knowledgable mechanic, but he is a rookie business owner with no organization or management skills of his people.  He wasted a huge amount of our time (3+months), money ($6000+) and stressed my wife and I to no end. We are going to have to scrap our car with a new engine that doesn't run.\n\nThey do good oil changes and put a muffler on another car we brought, but he also made me pay for the part up front which shows bad business to me as well.\n\n* FINAL RESULT\npaid griffin $1400 because the car ended up not working out. He said he made no money and it would have been $2000 if it had worked + whatever it would be to charge AC. When we walked in to pay he didn't even recognize us. My wife and I talked to this guy several times in person and on phone. The waiting area had mice running around too FYI if you are scared of them. After that we went to the dealer shop that had our car and basically gave it to the tech working on it. he paid for the dealer work and gave us a little cash. When we went to clean the car out I noticed that the driver seat leather looked very dirty and worn. Griffin said he was sorry.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888c4e6e0b99431:0x62babd6da353f44f"}

I was looking for a dependable repair shop that did quality work and that I could become a repeat customer with. I chose Griffin Automotive because they are ASE certified and after using them with 3 vehicles (06 Nissan Altima, 05 Chevy Silverado, & 2015 Nissan Altima) I have had no complaints with them.\n\nThey do great work, and are realistic with their estimates. If you are looking for a repair shop with a quick turnaround (meaning hours instead of days) then this may not be the shop for you, but I have a spare vehicle and can leave the vehicle for repairs.  They typically tell me that they have other vehicles in front of mine, but will look at it as soon as they get a free moment. I have sent my cars or truck to them at least 9 times (using both the overnight drop box and just bringing it in) and have only waited longer than a day once (and that was because the part got their late in the evening and I picked it up after work the next day)\n\nI have had multiple types of jobs: brakes pads for Altima and Silverado, rotors for Altima and Silverado,, brake drums for Silverado, oil change for Altima and Silverado, window regulator replacement on Silverado, oil leak repair on Altima, engine mounts on Altima, transfer case replacement Silverado 4x4, along with other normal maintenance type items", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888c4e6e0b99431:0x62babd6da353f44f"}
