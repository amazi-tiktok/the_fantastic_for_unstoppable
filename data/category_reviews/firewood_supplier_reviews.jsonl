To begin with, the estimator came out and gave me a price on having 2 trees cut down and having the stumps ground - trees are in the back yard behind a locked gate. I was told to expect a phone call that afternoon for scheduling. After 3 days I called the office and was told that they never received my estimate but they would put me on their schedule. A date was set and then was moved several times. I scheduled someone to come do bobcat work around that date as well. I then received a call asking if they could come that day (Thursday) and do the work. I said yes and left my office to go home and meet them. They finally showed up around 4:45 in the afternoon and got one tree down and told me that they would be back at 8:30 am the next day. I had to call the office at 3 pm to see if they were still coming to finish the work since I had to take another day to stay home from work. I waited to hear back and was told that they should be out sometime that afternoon. The crew finally showed up around 5:30 pm. They were able to get the second tree down but did not have the equipment to grind the stumps and I was told that they would come Saturday morning to finish up. Saturday came and went without anyone showing up and no phone call. The following Wednesday I get a call from the office asking if I was happy with the work and to confirm that they had removed all the debris from my yard, I told the person on the phone that they were not supposed to remove debris but they were supposed to grind stumps. She was unaware of this and said that she would make a note of it and have someone call me. Later that afternoon I got a phone call letting me know that someone would be out the next morning to grind stumps. I waited the entire day at home after taking off work, again, and NTS was again a no call no show. At this point I gave up on having anyone come complete the job. A couple weeks later, the company showed up without calling to try and finish grinding 2 stumps. The guy told my wife that he couldn't finish because there was some concrete and rocks that the didn't initially see and that he would need to come back later to finish the work. At this point I have had to call and cancel on my bobcat guy twice, which has cost both of us money. This job was started in April, and it is now the end of May. If you don't have anything to do and want to work with a company that is completely incompetent with communication, then National Tree Service should be ok.

I have not met you nor have I ever conducted an estimate for a person with your first or last name. That being said, Bigelow's Tree Service is built on the reputation of being on time and completing a job to the highest standard. My 17 years in the military have taught me that being \"in the right place, at the right time, in the right uniform\" is of the utmost importance when establishing relationships. For this reason my business would not survive if I conducted myself in the way you portrayed. I will tell you that I will not be the cheapest in town. I take extra precautions, in accordance with the International Society of Arborists, to ensure the safety of myself and my crew. Additionally I focus on the quality of work, not the speed at which I can get it completed. This being said I am sorry that you had a bad experience with a local tree company, however, I assure you that it was not me. If you would like to discuss this further please give me a call."}, "gmap_id": "0x88926f0416ea86a7:0x28db7ff970827f8d"}
