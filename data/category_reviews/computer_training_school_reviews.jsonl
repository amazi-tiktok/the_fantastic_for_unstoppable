Got an email receipt.\n\nGot my phone back a few days later and it was down to 1%. So I immediately tried to charge it and got an error message that the battery temp was too low to charge.\n\nWent in the next morning and was told it needed a new battery because old battery would not charge new LED screen (which I should have been told on first visit). Paid $60 MORE. Also told there was no tax since I paid with cash and was not offered a receipt nor one by email (like previous time).\n\nMy husband picks the phone up, tries to charge it and gets the SAME error message.\n\nHe calls them and is now told that the motherboard is probably bad and it needs a new one.

We did everything in our power to help you with your phone. And provided you with every option at our disposal. And we did everything that we could over the phone to explain to you the error that your phone was still having from both me and my assistant. Unfortunately sometimes when performing a repair, be it on a car a house or an electronic device there is more wrong with it than just the issue that you drop it off for. These issues are unfortunate, nonetheless, but sometimes they are there. I apologize you're unsatisfied, and if you change your mind and decide to get the device fixed as we said on the phone, the amount that you have already paid for the battery repair will apply towards the motherboard. I hope you have a great day and if you need anything else give us a call!!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888bb3a2b95f70b3:0xf0e2be23900e1414"}

I had an issue with my computer charge port so I dropped it off to get it diagnosed for repair. I was later told it was the DC jack needing replaced and the repair would cost 150.00. I was blown away at the price so I decided to think on it. Shawn told me the part alone cost 50 dollars. I told him I would rather look around for another computer and I would like to pick up my computer. He told me come on by and pick it up the following day. A few days later I decided to pull it apart and see how detailed the work was. As I took it apart I noticed there was no hard drive in it. I called Shawn as he proceeded to say that that happens sometimes and his kid must have forgot to put it back in when they were looking for the issue. Additionally I found the part on eBay new for less than 20 dolllars. Not to mention the fact that the diagnoses when they originally took it apart would have been an extra screw to replace the DC jack which he tried charging me another 100 bucks. All together a very bad experience and I would rather avoid this place at all cost.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1507037043493, "text": "sir we dont use ebay parts\nsorry for the drive being left out\neverybody makes mistakes\nand the diagnoses you was informed about up front\nu did not have to leave it'\nsorry for ur inconvenience"}, "gmap_id": "0x8892928318bc5bf3:0x74cb69ce96d94207"}

They go the extra mile to help you.  Rob is wonderful.  He spent a lot of time helping me with my problem and was patient and friendly the whole time.  They have always had the products that I needed and could always identify what I needed when I really didn't know what is was called. I will always go to The Core for all of my Apple needs.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a806d736a039:0xa4ebfd31be62d644"}

When diagnosed, I was told Apple had risen the price of Hard Drive power cables and that I needed a new Hard Drive and the anticipated cost would exceed $300. I was never contacted by The Core and I made every phone call to receive information regarding MY Mac Book. SLOW, SLOW, SLOW...they're there to expedite the process, not slow it down. After being told 3x's that my Hard Drive power cable would arrive the \"next day\", I was fed up with the process and proceeded to take my Mac Book to the University Supe Store, Apple Store (located in the Ferguson Center, at The University of Alabama)...and it was fixed in less than 4hours. Oh yea, and the final cost was only $40 for a new Hard Drive power cable and the installation. The actual Hard Drive was discovered...sorry The Core you're Apple privileges should be revoked strictly on your customer service, not to mention your \"knowledge\" of Apple products.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a806d736a039:0xa4ebfd31be62d644"}

I couldn't find time in my schedule to actually drive to their store, so this was pretty frustrating  I ended up taking my iMac issues to the SupeStore on UA's campus and they fixed my hard drive in a day.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a806d736a039:0xa4ebfd31be62d644"}

Don't buy your equipment ANYWHERE else whether you are a company or an individual in West Alabama. Buying printers, computers, including Mac related products at their subsidiary, The Core, costs the same as buying at Best Buy, Staples, The Iphone Clinic, except you get to avoid set up problems, software and hardware conflicts and unnecessary downtime.\n\nIts owner, Tuscom, AND The Core, is THE ONLY CERTIFIED Mac Reseller and SERVICE PROVIDER, in Tuscaloosa and Northport. Do not take your iPhone, iPad, Macbook Pro, Macbook Air to anyone else because if that company messes up your equipment a certified service provider CANNOT fix it legally. Just because the company has Iphone or Mac in its name, does mean that company is legally allowed to work on Mac products. Don't be fooled!\n\nThey troubleshot my Mac (for free) and uploaded my software and files to my new Mac for the same price as buying the computer. As my business grows, I will buy EVERYTHING from them. Run, don't walk, and sign up with these guys if you own a business, small or big. You will save so much money and headaches as you grow.   The employees will NEVER sell you anything you don't need AND will answer any question you have, whether, you are a tech newbie or a pro, in language that mirrors your level of knowledge. That kind of integrity is priceless.\n\nRob is great!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a806d736a039:0xa4ebfd31be62d644"}
