Walking in I was greeted with open arms and the environment in the office was nothing but positive and inviting. The two girls in the office were extremely helpful and patient. I believe their names were Amber and Marisa. I left the leasing office feeling better than I did leaving any other apartments that day. As I was leaving I also ran into Johnathan (I think that is his name) the maintenance supervisor and was blown away with how nice and friendly he was. It is that kind of customer service that makes looking for apartments a breeze! Although I did not end up moving in because my job had stationed me somewhere else I now look forward to moving back to Birmingham and renting from Alpine Village. Thank you for make my apartment searching experience an easy one!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889226e970e81e5:0xee87e48bb963c749"}

There are hidden fees that were not explained and I was unaware of until I got my last bill. I had made numerous attempts to reach the office and was unsuccessful until I sent an email stating that I wanted someone to address the complaint I had. Finally I made contact with the Property Manager. I asked for explanation and I got some crappy excuse about the cost of my bill and told \u201cSorry for the hidden fees.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m fine with the rent, water, trash and sewer fee. My first sewer bill was 88 dollars and I think that is unfit and unfair. I understand that there may be an inflation cost with the County or BWW but this is ridiculous. Still it\u2019s been paid on time like everything else. The kicker for me is the \u201cMandatory Cable Service.\u201d I was told that it came with my unit. I\u2019m being charged for 1 HD cable box and 10MB of internet speed that I never even had set up. Recently, I called to get it set up and the customer service rep had a horrible attitude and said that there is a 65 dollar service connection fee due upfront BEFORE they come out to set up service. I was told that this is mandatory although this unit came with cable and internet and I\u2019m being charged 75 dollars monthly for it. Pathetic.\n\nI constantly have problems with my toilet, there\u2019s mildew in the hall and bathroom and my air constantly goes in and out. I\u2019d rather turn a fan on. DO NOT BRING YOUR BUSINESS HERE.\n\nThe staff seemed nice and friendly and that\u2019s what will draw you in. Response time to application was swift. Which is what impressed me. But stay away. Go somewhere else. I do not intend to renew my lease. I will be leaving the first chance I get. I am strongly considering just paying to end my lease just so I can go somewhere else. If I am going to pay 850-900+ a month for an older 2 bedroom 1 bathroom unit then I expect better service. For there not to be trash everywhere and for the necessities in my unit to work properly and to know exactly what I am going to be paying for upfront.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889226e970e81e5:0xee87e48bb963c749"}
