I had been planning to visit ROE for quite a while (I do not live in Calera) and was looking forward to visiting both their bar and game store. According to Google Maps, ROE identifies itself as Black-owned, veteran-led, and women-led; three things I would normally go out of my way to support. However, the following sign greeted me upon arrival, prominently featured in ROE's store-front window: \"Guns are welcome on premises. Please keep all weapons holstered unless need arises. In such cases, judicious marksmanship is appreciated.\" So despite making a special trip to Calera specifically to visit ROE, I turned around and never plan to visit so long as this ridiculous and dangerous policy remains in place. As a university professor, I believe in evidence-based reasoning, and data shows that the \"good guy with a gun myth\" is just that -- a myth. I prefer to keep my tavern interactions with folks armed with deadly weapons to the realm of fantasy, where they belong; NOT my not-so-local hobby shop.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1628094336334, "text": "As the owner, I would like to say I am sorry that you felt that way about our store without speaking with us about it.

That being said, spending any time in our store with our regulars would show that while we allow carry (and only a small amount actually carry), misbehavior with such items is NOT TOLERATED.  We have found that those that stay with us, stay because they feel welcomed and accepted for who they are without judgement; and we have ALL types here.  No one here gets away with bullying or criticizing others for their various believes as long as said believes bring no harm to self or others.  We consciously monitor the behavior and body language of everyone that visits as should be done no matter the type of shop.

I've also explained to you directly that our pricing is a lower percentage for Pokemon than for Magic since the turnover is much lower than Magic. I realize you play both games and you're welcome to trade in Magic or Pokemon for store credit for anything, not just trading Pokemon for Pokemon. Our singles inventory should be right at Tcgplayer mid prices other than the cards under $1. Our base price for mtg rares and Mythics is $1 and commons is .25. Our Pokemon base price is .25 no matter rarity.  Our sealed products are generally based on Tcgplayer pricing as well. Our main card game is Magic the Gathering and we generally have approximately 100,000 mtg cards traded in per month. We continue to allow trade ins even though we are paying storage fees on somewhere between 2.5 and 3 million cards in the to be processed areas right now. I'm sorry you're disappointed in the service or offers you have received. We always give the customer the pricing and the choice to keep or sell their items. I know that this is not the case exactly with you, but you would be amazed if you knew how many people think if a card is $200 online that they can bring it and sell it to me for $200 cash. I work very hard to offer a fair trade in policy and all individual trade in pricing is based on the percentage given for the particular game and the quality of the card alone. Bulk collections have their own pricing schedules and I ask the players to sort out the expensive cards from the bulk to make sure they get the most money for their trade ins."}, "gmap_id": "0x88890b09fcf5a675:0xce64eacf9912dcea"}

We generally check both Amazon and Tcgplayer. Right now most Pokemon is selling for more than normal. We are having to pay more than retail for most products just to keep it in stock so people can have a place to purchase it. Our first run of Pokemon that comes direct is priced less than you can get the items direct from Pokemon for. The wholesale companies are charging more as well. We also limit quantities on most Pokemon items so everyone gets a chance to purchase. We keep Pokemon in stock that hasn't been in most retail stores for ten years. Out of print collectibles almost always sell for more than retail. We always have multiple Pokemon items at regular retail price. I also make sure to point those items out to customers when they come in. This is an issue with the limited printing from Pokemon. That's why it's sold out everywhere locally. We've also been cut on available quantities from the distributors. Out of 200 elite trainer boxes of Shining Fates ordered, we received only two and we sold them for $49.99 each release day. Checking with Walmart.com today 3-17-21, MOST products we have in stock are actually less than buying online from them. Example, Shining Fates ETBs are $130 on Walmart.com, they are $99.99 at our store. Evolutions booster packs are $31.99 each at Walmart.com, while ours are $17.99. Vivid Voltage booster boxes are $299.99, ours are $199.99. Crimson Invasion ETBs are $135.24 at Walmart while ours are $84.95. Champion's Path ETBS are $109.99, ours are $99.99. In looking up over 20 in stock products, the ONLY Pokemon item I  found less at Walmart.com was the Dubwool box which is $34.95 while ours is $34.99. Several products I found we are over 50% less than Walmart.com. Market value (also known as OMV, or \"open market valuation\") is the price an asset would fetch in the marketplace, or the value that the investment community gives to a particular equity or business. I think you were referring to MSRP (Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price) or LIST price. MSRP will not generally apply for out of print or high demand collectibles in ANY industry. Same thing happened with the VW TDI a few years back when they were selling for $20,000 over MSRP and you had to put in your order three months in advance."}, "gmap_id": "0x88890b09fcf5a675:0xce64eacf9912dcea"}

The business model of this place does not cater to customers at all. Their philosophy is to hold items on the slim chance that they appreciate in value to sell online, and the items that decrease in value they hope to sell at MSRP for those who don't realize they could get it for cheaper elsewhere.\n\nEverything in store is MSRP, no discounts.That would make sense if they were selling fresh, just released product, but the store is filled with nothing but old product that can be found for half the price elsewhere. They used to provide a discount when you paid entirely in cash but that seems to have disappeared.\n\nI have no problem paying more to support a store that allows us table space and a nice atmosphere to play, but this store has neither. All table space is catered specifically for miniature wargames (which are better for standing at rather than sitting down) and the one lone table in the back is always filled with a MtG game, leaving no room for anything else.\n\nThe employees have little to no knowledge of anything outside of MtG and consistently complain (under their breath and behind our backs) about the lack of purchases customers make if they just come in to play a game or two, which makes sense considering their greedy practice. Even after bringing in new customers that would've never thought to bring in, as well as setting up events ourselves that the store didn't bother helping with, we as customers are still considered a burden. Their demo shelf is also filled with games they don't carry or are out-of-print, so if you try a game out that you like, you won't even be able to purchase it, nor a copy of it, in the store.\n\nTournaments and events are horribly disorganized. I payed and 'participated' in a Keyforge league and paid to play a couple of games per week, but as it got near the end it turns out that missing a match never mattered and the final tournament with a promised prize support (hence the initial payment) never showed up. The new matchups were ALWAYS late and overall it was a lackluster experience that I could've just played with friends for a better time.\n\nThat's not to say it's been all bad, one employee named Josh was always super helpful and friendly, making space for us and always letting us borrow any of his supplies (like brushes and paints) to help out with beginning miniatures, but he left a while back and haven't seen him since. He was the last saving grace that the store was hanging on and now it's not worth any of my time nor money to bother going.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891087e54e0fdf:0xa7fa043f5f99189c"}
