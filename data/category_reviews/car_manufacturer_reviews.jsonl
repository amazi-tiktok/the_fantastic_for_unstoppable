READ THE HISTORY OF A NEW 2019 HONDA ODYSSEY, WITH 400 MILES THAT HAD TRANSMISSION NEUTRALIZED BY TURNING ON THE LIGHTS ON THE DASHBOARD.\n\nThis vehicle was towed 2 times to the HONDA COGGIN ORLANDO. THAT'S WHY I DON'T WANT THAT ODYSSEY BECAUSE IT IS A RISK FOR MY FAMILY.\n\nSo far I have not changed the truck or the HONDA COGGIN ORLANDO dealer, or the HONDA car factory.\n\nSHOPPING EXPERIENCE\n\nOn Tuesday 13 / Nov / 2019, the seller WILBERT RODRIGUEZ showed me the ODYSSEY EXL, but after giving me information about the monthly payments, it was not available to me. He offered me the EX model, but I told him that I was not going to continue with the purchase; Well, for me it was a problem that I did not have the entertainment system for my children (BLUE RAY OR DVD), he told me that this was not a problem; that we could try for the EX and they added the entertainment system to me, I insisted several times on the subject because for me it is a familiar subject. The sale was made and it was a hoax, they didn't give me the system.\n\nAFTER SALES EXPERIENCE AND FAILURE OF THE 2019 HONDA ODYSSEY EX\n\nOn 16 / Nov / 2018 MY HONDA ODYSSEY HAD THE TRANSMISSION NEUTRALIZED, it said on the dashboard park in a safe place, check transmission, check emission of gases and the blind spot indicator light. I called the dealer several times, the WILBERT salesperson, the service department, they never answered me, left messages and never returned my call. Call the HONDA route assistance service which also took several minutes to attend to me; They sent me a crane from AAA.\n\nThey changed the battery and restored the electrical system of the ODYSSEY 2019. They give it back to me.\n\nOn 17 / Nov / 2018 the fault returned and the transmission was neutralized again; I left the vehicle in service. I make the exception of that moment that I do not want the truck because I feel insecure in it, it is not a glass that does not rise or a door that does not close, IT IS A PREGNANT SITUATION for a vehicle to neutralize you and thereby put you at RISK TO YOUR FAMILY.\n\nGentlemen of HONDA, I express to you through these lines, I bought a vehicle to enjoy with my family, I did not buy a problem, I refuse to accept being the guinea pig of a fault of the HONDA brand.\n\nJASON WHITTEN general sales manager informally told me that was a problem that HONDA AMERICA had to solve because they don't make cars that only sell them.\n\n(Original)\nHONDA COGGIN ORLANDO LA PEOR EXPERIENCIA DE VENTA Y POST VENTA que he recibido en un concesionario en mi vida!!!.  LEA LA HISTORIA DE UNA HONDA ODYSSEY NUEVA  2019, CON 400 MILLAS QUE SE LE NEUTRALIZ\u00d3 LA TRANSMISION PRENDIENDO TESTIGOS DE LUCES EN EL TABLERO.\n\nEste veh\u00edculo fue trasladado 2 veces en gr\u00faa a la HONDA COGGIN ORLANDO. POR ELLO NO QUIERO ESA ODYSSEY PORQUE ES UN RIESGO PARA MI FAMILIA.\n\nHasta ahora no me cambian la camioneta ni el concesionario HONDA COGGIN ORLANDO, ni la f\u00e1brica de los autos HONDA.\n\nEXPERIENCIA DE COMPRA\n\nEl martes 13/Nov/2019, el vendedor WILBERT RODRIGUEZ me mostr\u00f3 la ODYSSEY EXL, pero despu\u00e9s de darme informaci\u00f3n sobre los pagos mensuales la misma no estaba a mi alcance. El me ofreci\u00f3 el modelo EX, pero le dije que no iba a continuar con la compra; pues para m\u00ed era un problema que no ten\u00eda el sistema de entretenimiento para mis hijos (BLUE RAY O DVD), \u00e9l me manifest\u00f3 que esto no era un problema; que pod\u00edamos intentar por la EX y ellos me agregaban el sistema de entretenimiento, le insist\u00ed varias veces sobre el tema porque para m\u00ed es un tema familiar. Se dio la venta y fue un enga\u00f1o no me dieron el sistema.\n\nEXPERIENCIA POST VENTA Y FALLA DEL HONDA ODYSSEY EX 2019\n\nEl 16/nov/2018 MI HONDA ODYSSEY SE LE NEUTRALIZO LA TRANSMISION dec\u00eda en el tablero estaci\u00f3nese en un lugar seguro, revisar transmisi\u00f3n, revisar emisi\u00f3n de gases y la luz de testigo del punto ciego. llame varias veces al concesionario, al vendedor WILBERT, al departamento de servicio, nunca me atendieron, deje mensajes y jam\u00e1s me devolvieron la llamada. Llame al servicio de asistencia de ruta de HONDA el cual tambi\u00e9n tardo varios minutos en atenderme; me mandaron una gr\u00faa de AAA.\n\nCambiaron la bater\u00eda y restauraron el sistema el\u00e9ctrico de la ODYSSEY 2019. Me la entregan de vuelta.\n\nEl 17/Nov/2018 vuelve a presentar la falla y la transmisi\u00f3n se neutraliza nuevamente; dej\u00e9 el veh\u00edculo en servicio. Hago la salvedad de ese momento que no quiero la camioneta pues me siento inseguro en ella, no se trata de un vidrio que no sube o una puerta que no cierra, ES UNA SITUACION EMBARAZOSA que un veh\u00edculo se te neutralice y con ello pongas en RIESGO A TU FAMILIA.\n\nSe\u00f1ores de HONDA, les expreso a trav\u00e9s de estas l\u00edneas, compr\u00e9 un veh\u00edculo para disfrutar con mi familia, no compr\u00e9 un problema, me niego a aceptar ser el conejillo de indias de una falla de la marca HONDA.\n\nJASON WHITTEN gerente general de ventas de manera informal me dijo eso era un problema que ten\u00eda que resolver la HONDA AMERICA que ellos no fabrican carros que solo los venden.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfNOV8dUGYsgSu4vk9NPpOd_MvD8DxH8mxvx3y=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bd111ec1b7ec1:0xaf96df819ea89f01"}
