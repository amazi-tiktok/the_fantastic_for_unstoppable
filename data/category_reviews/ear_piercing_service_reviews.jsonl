Though I think that having your ears pierced is something of a right of passage that should happen in the pre-teen years, a step closer to becoming a young woman, and she is about half that age, I'm a sucker for my little girl and we decided this would be our event for the day.  I researched online and found a few places that were still offering this service despite this pandemic.  We finally landed on Claire's as it appeals to children in her age group.\n\nAs an added bonus to the day, my niece, who is just a few years older than my daughter, and my teenage nephew got to come with us.  Big Girl's Day and extra help to keep them wrangled.  We entered the store and asked a young woman sweeping the floor near a large unmarked puddle of water how to get started.  Without lifting her head she replied quickly, \u201cyou get in line,\" and stepped past us to keep sweeping.\n\nStill unsure of what to do, my nephew saw the sign situated nearly above the entrance, something that wouldn't have been seen without guidance or turning around to leave.  After waiting in line for about 30 minutes for the 4 customers ahead of us to be seen, another employee asked for my driver's license.  I explained that I only have the temporary PDF version because I recently renewed it, but it is perfectly legal per Alabama Code.\n\n\"We have to have the paper copy,\" she said.\n\nI argued, \"But this is valid.\"\n\n\"I signed a contract for the company that says I have to have a paper copy of your license.\"\n\nI stared, in awe, that she could say that to two excited young girls without even so much as a fake frown, but kept her face as blank and emotionless as Ben Stein's is when he verbally buries an opponent in a trivia competition.  My daughter's eyes welled with tears.  I quickly assured her that this is not a failed evening because I could call someone to bring their license from home and we could still get it done tonight.\n\nWe browsed the thousand's of items for sale while we waited for our help who was only 20 minutes away at most.  The glue-on nails and clearance jewelry was sure to extend the evening's fun.  It was hard to stay focused on the good time, however, when the first woman we spoke with that was sweeping the floors nearly ran into my daughter as she barreled past with a mop, then a few minutes later made a point to put a returned item back on the shelf directly behind my daughters feet, throwing it instead of placing it, and hitting my daughter's ankle.  A simple \"sorry\" may have helped my growing annoyance, but she said absolutely nothing at all.  Nothing.\n\nOnce our help arrived, we cheered together and made our way back to the now empty ear piercing line.  We waited for several minutes, but no one came to help us.  After trying to wave someone down, our hero with the license left us in line to find help.  He was told that they were closing in 10 minutes and needed to mop so they could go home, so they weren't going to do the piercing.\n\nThe look of defeat on my daughter broke my heart and while her cousins comforted her, I placed the souvenir's we intended to buy in addition to the starter earrings on the shelf closest to us and wasn't shy about letting my baby girl know that it's ok, and that because of the uncalled for, horrid way they treated us, we will never shop at a Claire's again, and will make the date a weekend long event by going elsewhere to get it done tomorrow.\n\nI wanted to scream.  What purpose did the nasty attitude and horrendous customer service serve for Clarie's or their employees?  But instead of making my darling feel even worse by causing a scene and publicly scolding those wicked-acting women  like I wanted to, I decided to go the route of public shaming and posting our way-less-than-pleasant experience online for others to take into consideration when choosing the best place to share that memory with their babies.\n\nDon't go to Claire's.  They suck.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da39209e213:0x81182ba20954e921"}

As with many children he didn't really care too much for the clippers. But Sam who was cutting his hair was EXTREMELY patient with and also worked quickly to get the experience for him over with. She also did a FANTASTIC job with the haircut. I was VERY pleased with the outcome! Not to mention when we were cashing out I left my phone sitting by the register when we left! Now, my son's appointment was on a Saturday. We live all the way on the outskirts of Leeds. Right after his appointment we ate at Panera, came home & took a nap straight away. That's when I FINALLY realized I'd left it! By then they were closed! And they're closed on Sundays as well! So, I had to wait ALL THE WAY 'til Monday to call and make sure it was there! AND IT WAS! They'd kindly put it up for me until my fianc\u00e9 went to pick it up! Such kind, respectful, professional individuals! Also, Dawn (hope that's how she spells her name\uf914) was the one I spoke with on Monday as well as being there when my son had his appointment. Sorry it's such a LONG \"review\", but it's just MINE and SON'S experience. And I felt as if it needed to be shared. ESPECIALLY if kids are involved. Most parents want to make sure they're taking their child/children to the right place.

I contacted them through Facebook looking to set an appointment for two scoop tongue piercings. I sent them a picture of what I wanted and I was told they could do it. I had to pay a 20 dollar deposit to book my appointment and pay the remainder when I got to the shop. First, I had to pay the remainder before even receiving my service which I can understand but that wasn't on their website, Facebook page or anything. Secondly, when I went back to get my piercing, the lady pulled out the wrong kind of bar. I stated,\"that's too small. That's not what I want.\" I pulled my phone out to show her the pic I sent and she told me\" yea we don't have that bar for that piercing.\" She was very like nonchalant. We kept trying to make small talk and ask\nQuestions and she just seemed annoyed like she didn't wanna deal with us.  So I became upset, because whoever I was talking to on the Facebook page said y'all could do that piercing. Never said y'all didn't have the materials to do so. So she proceeds to show my thicker bars but still not what I initially went there to get. I'm telling her like noo, this not what I wanted.  She asks if I want anything else because they don't do refunds. So I came and paid 70 dollars under the assumption I would get what I wanted, they didn't have it and I couldn't get a refund. MINUS ONE STAR.  So I tell her I'll wait while my sister gets hers done first because I was upset. She got ready to do my sisters. The dots she placed on my sisters tongue were symmetrical  and even, BUT once she pierced her tongue we both instantly noticed it was more so to the left, way left, then the center of her tongue. My sister said she was fine with it. Cool. So I got back in the chair to get mines. I wasn't about to waste 70 bucks. ALSO I FEEL A CUSTOMER SHOULD NOT PAY FOR A SERVICE BEFORE THEY GET IT DONE ! Seeing as how there are no refunds, which I was told after the fact, and then lied about being able to do what I wanted. Anyways, I get in the chair. She is drawing the dots on my tongue and had to mark my tongue like 3-4 times because then we're not even. When she finally gets it even and placed in the middle. Let me say the ink taste terrible! She proceeds to pierce and I can feel as soon as the needle went in and was not near the middle of my tongue. IMMEDIATELY I notice my Piercing is to the left of my tongue also. So I'm irritated all over again. I kept trying to show her how it wasn't in the middle and she says\"it's just the way you holding your tongue.\" Lmao, this was horrible! So I continue to tell her it's not in the middle and she tells me we can take it out and redo it and I'm like fine. She then Says \"well not right now I have other appointments coming.\"\nLike NO you should finish with the appointment you already are in and I PAID ! So I leave and then I decided hell no. I'm getting this redone. I go back and she tells me to come back at 4. Two hours later. Cool.\nI come back. Have to wait like 30 min. She finally calls be back to redo it. I'm showing her how it's NOT in the middle. The second time hurt like HELL because my tongue was already starting to swell from the first go round. She gets it in a much better position this time. It's closer to middle but VERY slanted. I said thanks and it looks MUCH better then before because it honestly does and I left. My sister wanted hers done over but she saw how painful mines was and neither of us should not have even had to go thru that. It should've been right the first time AND we should've got what we originally came for. So now my tongue is 2x swollen and sore because it had to go thru the trauma  twice ! Her hands were also shakey and normally when people pierce something like a tongue, they stand in front of you. Instead she was on the side which might have been the reason for them being sideways. Like I stated. The place was very clean and had a cool vibe. I just had a bad experience.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886286825a6aa277:0xfa4f89d127fb3708"}

If I could give zero stars, I would. I decided to come to Royal Spade after seeing a Facebook post about Friday the 13th tattoo specials. The Facebook post stated that they would be doing small 2-4 inch simple tattoo designs from 1-10pm and it specifically said Walk-In only. I arrived at the shop around 6:30pm and paid for my tattoo. At that point, there were five other people in the waiting area. As I waited, several other people came into the shop. I waited for a couple of hours as the people that came in before me got their tattoos done. At around 9:45, the receptionist called back people that arrived after I did. I was a little confused, so I went to the desk and asked the receptionist if I was next in line. She told me that there was one couple ahead of me but that I would be next after that. She asked what my tattoo was, and I told her it was the symbol for the air element, which was only a triangle with a line through it. She told me that she would try to squeeze me in next before the couple because my tattoo was so simple. At around 10:30, the couple that was ahead of me was called back. A few minutes later, another couple that arrived after me was called back. I went to the front desk and told the receptionist that I thought I was next. It was at this point that one of the tattoo artists came up and told me that they could not keep tattooing all night and that they could not accept walk-ins all night. I pointed out that people who arrived after me were called back, and that I had been there since 6:30pm. That is when he informed me that everyone that was called back had been in earlier that day and were told to come back later. I was dumbfounded that I was not told this once; not when I came in nor during the four-hour duration I spent waiting. I was not informed about any possibility that I would not be able to get my tattoo tonight until after I had been waiting four hours, and then was told that I could not get my tattoo. It also makes no sense to me why people could leave and come back for a special that was advertised as Walk-In only. I am extremely disappointed in the lack of organization and customer service of this shop and I would not wish this horrible experience on anyone.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1568439422525, "text": "We already told you that we were sorry we cannot get to your tattoo, we were booked for the rest of the day. if you paid for your tattoo? you can come back for a refund tomorrow, but that's about it. we will not be able to help you with any other services in the future due to your lack of respect for us."}, "gmap_id": "0x886286825a6aa277:0xfa4f89d127fb3708"}
