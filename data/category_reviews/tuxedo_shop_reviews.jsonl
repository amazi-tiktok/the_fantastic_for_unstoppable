The manufacturer estimated a ship date about 6 weeks prior to my wedding. To make a long story short, the dresses never came in.\n\nFor more details, read below, but the bottom line is that I would take my business elsewhere in the future, and I recommend that others do the same. The consultants in the store were very nice and helpful, but it's not worth the headache of dealing with Promenade's lack of good communication skills. I guess they missed the lesson in business school that the customer is always right.\n\nWhen the dresses did not arrive in time for my wedding, they did offer us dresses from another source that were in stock. However, the sizes that my bridesmaids needed were not available. All three of my bridesmaids lived out of town, so having Promenade alter a larger dress down a size was not a feasible option for me, even though the store suggested altering dresses THEN shipping to the bridesmaids. I felt that anyone who knows anything would realize this option was crazy on a timeline of 10 days before the wedding. What were we going to do if the dresses were altered, shipped, and arrived 5 days before the wedding, and still didn't fit?\n\nSo about 10 days before my wedding, I ordered replacement dresses from David's Bridal and paid for overnight shipping. I'll admit that the fact that the original dresses never came in may have been the dress manufacturer's fault, but Promenade did not handle the situation well. The owner did not return phone calls when my mother or I would leave messages at the store, and she did not check the status of the supposed shipment as early or as often as I would have liked.\n\nI requested that the store reimburse me for the cost of the replacement dresses that the girls did not want or even like, but they refused. I sent an email to the owner with the invoices for these dresses, and never heard another word about it until I sent another email, waited 10 days, received no response, and then called the store to follow up.\n\nI don't want to sound like another jaded bride, but the truth is that there are plenty of other local businesses that do a better job of communicating with their customers and valuing customer satisfaction.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d45f35aef892b:0xb0bea7f33837c8f2"}

We didn't find a huge selection, and the one dress my daughter liked had sequins missing and coming off the back; the stitching was loose. Not to mention we didn't find much of anything under $500.

One of my dearest friends is getting married 2 weeks from tomorrow. The other 2 bridesmaids and I ordered our dresses back in December and were assured they would arrive 12 weeks from the time of order. The last dress was ordered December 29th. I called toward the end of March to check on my dress since I needed to make arrangements to get from Tuscaloosa to Tuscumbia for pick up. I was assured at that time the dress would ship on April 13 and arrive at their store in 7 to 10 business days. I called back on April 26th to check on the status of the dress. I was told at that time the that the dresses would be in early this week. I called yesterday and was told the dresses were at the UPS hub in Muscle Shoals and were left off the truck for the delivery and the owner did not have time to go get the dresses. I was assured at that time that the dresses would be in Friday morning and I could pick mine up Saturday with no issue. Friday rolled around and to no ones surprise, the dresses did not arrive. We were again assured the dresses would arrive Monday (less than 2 weeks from the wedding). Call me a skeptic, but I have lost ALL TRUST in this business. We have now come up with a back up plan to have dresses here the week of the wedding from another company. The bride and other 2 bridesmaids have made numerous calls to this business and also been given the run around. Had we not taken matters into our own hands, I am not convinced we would have any dresses for the wedding. I wanted to put this information out there so others can avoid this unnecessary stress and hardship my friends and I have gone through. We are now working with them to get our money back and to no ones surprise we are being given the run around yet again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d45f35aef892b:0xb0bea7f33837c8f2"}

So, now, he just went to pick it up for prom TOMORROW NIGHT and they have sent it back!!!  We paid the extra for them to \"hold it\" and they sent it back anyeay!\nRidiculous!

The staff was extremely kind and helpful. I probably tried on at least a dozen dresses and it didn\u2019t phase them one bit. They were so accommodating when I brought my 18 month old nephew to dress fittings and even let me come try my dress on the day it came in even though I couldn\u2019t come in until just minutes before they closed. And the alterations! My dress was very intricate - covered in lace with a fitted corset top. I lost quite a bit of weight between the time we order the dress and when it came in. The top was huge but after she took it in, it was perfectly fitted to my body. I\u2019m also very short but I desperately wanted to keep the scalloping at the bottom. She had to remove all of the lace, hem the dress, and then sew the lace back on. I couldn\u2019t even tell it was different at all! The bustle was absolutely perfect too.

Today, surpassed all of my expectations. Today, Mrs. Pat just proved that going above and beyond for something you\u2019re passionate about and loving your customers is what makes businesses like hers successful. Jos A Banks is where John Michael ordered his custom tux for the wedding in early March. Due to the pandemic, their store closed and we were unable to pick it up upon its arrival to the store. Now, the store is closed until May 30th, even though the mall is open and the tuxedo is there; they\u2019re not willing to work with us in order to find a solution to get his custom tux to him, refund our money, or assist us along the way. Last night, after working 12 hours in the ER, around 9:00 pm, I sent a message to Mrs. Pat at Modern Brides. John Michael and I both were so upset. She responded within minutes, welcoming us into her store, and this morning, only 12 hours later: she had taken measurements, allowed him to try on a few tuxedo options, and had a new rental suit ordered that should be here in 1-2 days. Talk about a blessing! Mrs. Pat has been phenomenal! She\u2019s so excellent with customer service, but also just a sweet person. She has extended the offer to other brides, as well. She knows everyone, and everyone loves her because she\u2019s so precious. So, if you find yourself like me, stuck without options due to this crazy time - caterer, photographer, tuxedo rentals - anything to do with your wedding, please contact Mrs. Pat! You will not regret it. I cannot say enough about this sweet, angelic, Godly woman.

The first week in October I was told the alterations had not begun as they had not received all the fittings yet (which they HAD!). I was also told I did not come in soon enough, I kindly reminded them I had been in at least two months prior. Later that day, another bridesmaid called and was told alterations were currently being performed and they would be done soon. Over a week later I called and was told my dress was finished, AND HAD BEEN FINISHED and they were waiting on me to come pick it up. However, no one at that store was gracious enough to give me a phone call letting me know the dress was ready. Other bridesmaids were told their dress was ready when it wasn't; or that their dress was not ready when it was. Alterations were also extremely overpriced for the experience that we had.. Not to mention they looked bad. Please, if you value your sanity, your money, and your relationships with the people in your wedding, DO NOT SHOP HERE, you're better off making your own dress.

We had a family member pick up the wedding gown and maid of honor's dress to save us a three hour trip the week of the wedding.  When the dresses were picked up they were on cheap plastic hangers, like you get at Wal-Mart, and they were in the thin clear plastic bags, the kind dry cleaners use, with a knot tied in the end of the bag.  We were told the nice zipper bags are only used for the short prom dresses.   I guess that they reward you for NOT spending a large amount of money at this boutique.  This sends the message that a prom dress is more important than a wedding dress.  My family member went to another bridal store and purchased a zippered garment bag for my daughter's wedding gown so the cheap bag we were given at Modern Bride wouldn't tear and possibly let dust or something worse damage the wedding gown.  By the way, the garment bag from the other bridal shop only cost us $10, so it can't be the cost of the garment bags that keeps Modern Brides from providing them to the brides purchasing their gown there, after all they do provide them for the much less expensive and short prom dresses they sell there.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cb731641629:0xecde2f90485b3aa8"}

BUT I would absolutely recommend you get your alterations done somewhere else. I was very unhappy after both fittings and was glad I had an aunt there to confirm it was not a good fit even though the owner/seamstress was trying to tell me it was. She was pinning for more alterations trying to assure me it would be better, but I didn't like it with it pinned and was terrified at my 3rd and final fitting I would still hate it. I was about to scrap the whole thing and get a completely different dress (crying over the thought of the cost) when my aunt took me to another tailor who immediately (just by pinning the dress differently) was able to get the dress to fit me MUCH better. Seeing the photos side by side made it apparent Modern Brides was not qualified to be altering wedding dresses (see below for yourself - Left photo Modern Brides pinning; Right photo other seamstress pinning). Unfortunately so much padding was already added by Modern Brides that the new seamstress/tailor could only do so much with the top so it was never a perfect fit and I fretted about it at my wedding and am still noticing the ill-fitting in the wedding photos. Modern Brides was professional about returning SOME of the money on the alterations (as another reviewer mentioned - every time I went in the store there was some new charge on my dress and despite paying it every time I was treated multiple times like I was delinquent) and offered a free cleaning of the dress still, but I needed to post to try to spare others from what I went through. Also, a friend had the same experience just before me and I should have listened and NOT let Modern Brides do my alterations.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKrJZh-qf3QHCmcUriTpRytlIjt2n1-B3NKhxh=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZoyvVOVlVCrNyBdjDQLGo_cglIkDw03MOTqTJ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cb731641629:0xecde2f90485b3aa8"}

I looked everywhere in my area and she couldn't find what she was satisfied with so while reading reviews I noticed that Modern Brides had some good reviews and we decided to go there. The young ladies that showed us the prom dresses were very nice and my daughter got to try on several dresses. While picking out her dress, all workers were as nice and patient as they could possibly be. My daughter did have to have some alterations to her dress and the alterations were very expensive! We started out with a 20% discount off the dress, but every alteration had a price to it. She had to have the length taken off, three layers at $20 per layer! $60 dollars. $20 to take up one strap. Pat, the lady doing the alterations, said it would be done in a couple weeks. After 3 weeks, I had to call and the dress still wasn't finished. When we went to pick up the dress, 1 week later after calling again, the alterations were aweful! It was to short, the strap taken up was to tight, and the chest area was still to big. The front of the dress was crooked and the side without a strap turned under. When I brought all this to Pat's attention, she blamed it on the way the dress was made. Said all the beads on the dress was causing it to turn under. My daughter's prom dress the year before had the same amount, if not more, beads at the top and we didn't have this problem. She charged me $5 more dollars for doing a quick chest take up and when the dress still didn't fit right, she charged $30 more for leaving the dress again so she could take the chest area up right. She wouldn't even take off the $5 I had just paid her for the seam she had just took up! After another week of leaving the dress again, it still wasn't right. The front without a strap was lower than the side with the strap making the front look lopsided! We left with the dress and still had to go purchase body tape and breast push up inserts! Another $30! Be advised that I did read the reviews before purchasing the dress and until I purchased the dress everyone was great, but afterwards, the owner/seamstress was very rude and non-negotiable. Everything she does has a price! So beware before planning a wedding or prom dress affair with this company.

I was unsure why, but I assume it is because their gowns are marked up well over retail. After my daughter tried on 1-2 more gowns, an older lady walked over to us and very rudely yelled at my daughter if she was taking pictures she would have to delete all of them before leaving the store. She also said \"I know two of my girls have already told you to stop taking pictures\". This is untrue, as the only person who had previously said anything was the salesgirl (not ours) that said not to take photos of the tags. I could see my daughter was very visibly upset, so we said thank you and left the store. They lost my business forever, as well as everyone I know that I can tell about our experience.

My measurements were wrong the first time, so I went back and saw the manager. She measured again and changed everything. When I received my suit for the final fitting, everything was as per the original measurements and too big. They are supposed to overnight my new suit which I'll see 3 days before my wedding.\nIn addition, my son is very small, and I asked for the smallest fit. He received a regular slim fit instead of extreme slim fit which looks baggy. I was told by the person on duty that they don't have extreme slim fit for children (my son is 11, so I'm paying full price for his rental). I don't believe this to be true and will be speaking with the manager soon. I will not recommend them to anyone else. All of my groomsmen and father of the bride are using them, and the father of the bride at a different Men's Warehouse didn't receive his shoes. I can't believe we're paying $200 / person for all of the hiccups during the preparation phase.\n\nEDIT / UPDATE - My new arrival came in a couple of days before my wedding and fit fine.  In the shuffle, the new order had a white shirt instead of ivory and I didn't realize until the day of my wedding that my shirt was ALL wrong!  Luckily Newnan in GA was able to fix me up.  My mom drove over an hour both ways to get me an ivory shirt.\nMeanwhile, I'm waiting on my custom suit.  They were supposed to make up for ALL of this with a \"special\" custom suit, and there's nothing different about the one I am receiving versus any other Joe Custom Suit.  (mind you there were 7-8 in the bridal party who all rented suits from Men's Warehouses across the Southeast who all had some sort of issue).\nI went in yesterday to pick up after my final fitting a week ago, and they had not touched it.  I was told on a Tuesday I could come get it on the weekend.  No calls, no emails, nothing.  So I go in AFTER the weekend and it had not been touched and they said, \"wait 10 minutes and we'll have it ready.\"  NO!  I don't want my custom suit rushed.  I should add that customer service reply 4 months ago gave me a nice discount on my rental, and Kyla and David mean well at this location, but they can't, and shouldn't walk behind all of their employees.\nThis is the worst experience I've ever had with any establishment in the US.

They said it would arrive on May 20th instead and I would receive a phone call. No call on that date, I called on the 23rd and it was there. They refitted my pants which is great, and the jacket fits perfect, but said it would arrive today, June 4th.

Perhaps, better communication would be helpful too.

I went with my fiance and two brothers to buy them suits for the wedding, and weren't treated very well. My middle brother wears camouflage, jeans and boots all the time and obviously the employees there aren't used to seeing that and deem anyone who does wear it beneath them because there was a very rude comment made about my brother behind his back but within earshot. After our 2 hour trip there, he had to use the restroom, on his way to the restroom he passes by an employee helping a mother and her son. The employee proceeds the comment after seeing my brother \"what is that?\" And laughs with the mother and son he's currently helping. Strike one. You can tell the man helping us deems it beneath him also because he acted like it pained him to be seen with us and halfway measured them for tailoring until we told him more needed to be done to make the suits look like they should. Strike 2. They tell us at checkout that the suits will be ready in two weeks on a specific date and we could come pick them up. My fiance and I make a special trip again to come pick them up, get there and they have to search for our order and lo and behold....it's not ready. But \"don't worry. It will be ready tomorrow. You can just get it then.\" No we can't because we have to drive for 2 hours and can't just keep doing that on a whim. Not a call, email or anything informing us that the suits weren't ready. I firmly believe they had just stuffed them into the back room and forgotten about them. Strike 3. We have yet to go back to pick up the order because we haven't found the time but I'm waiting for the next mishap. So if you were to ask me, NO do not go to this location. Terrible service. Rude and think they're better.\n\nLet me add: After going the 2nd time to pick the suits up. We had to wait almost 20 minutes for them to locate and 'steam' our suits when we had already called on the way to let them know we were coming to pick them up.

Better yet, I would assign a negative number if that were an option. If you do not read any further, the takeaway is this: Run don't walk to Jos. A. Bank for tuxedo rentals. I have never encountered such incompetence or ignorance as I have at Men's Wearhouse.\n\nWhere shall I begin. . . If you go to Men's Wearhouse you will be lectured ad nauseum about the importance of everyone in your wedding party providing the group number at the fitting. Great in theory. In reality, we were given the incorrect group number. Thankfully, one of the groomsmen caught the error and provided us the correct number. Yes, let that sink in. No one at Men's Wearhouse was competent enough to provide the number. Don't stress the importance of something and then screw it up. We were, of course, offered no explanation as to why we were given the incorrect number.\n\nMoving on to the next issue. I had a coupon from a bridal magazine that I provided during our initial visit. This coupon was to be applied to each tuxedo rental (14 total). Do you think it was applied? Of course not. It came to our attention when several groomsmen commented on the cost of the tuxedo rentals. Of course, there was no explanation for why the coupon was not applied.\n\nAt this point, it is Thursday morning and we are getting married on Saturday. Have they called to tell my fiancee that his tuxedo is ready? Of course not.\n\nAnd, here's the best part of the story, every time I have called to point out some screw up, the phone is answered \"Hi. This is _____. How can I provide you with world class service today?\" Well, start with doing your job and being competent. But that isn't going to happen. Go to Jos. A.

Where do I begin?\n\nI'd give zero stars for this particular location, but 1. you can't give 0 stars on Google Reviews, and 2. we did actually have a good experience renting our wedding tuxes with one of the managers Homer (who is the only competent employee here, so I give a star to Homer. And well, we didn't actually pick up the wedding tuxes at this location, just placed the order, but I'm pretty sure if we did get them from here something would've gone wrong.) but everything else we have tried to do at this store was a complete fail.\n\nMy husband ordered a couple suits and two pairs of pants to get alterations done. They completely wonked up the alterations and made the suit look like a baggy potato sack. We actually did extensive research on how men's suits should fit and the finished product didn't turn out to look anything like the books.\n\nNot only were the alterations terrible but they weren't completed on time. Something about the pants not being shipped on time, but they were smart on their part and gave us a phone call to tell us it wasn't ready when they said it would be.\n\nAfter the messed up all the alterations my husband went back for a second fitting to have them fix the problem. The first suit was completed in a timely manner and turned out exactly how he wanted it to be. They told him to come back the next Saturday and the other suit and two pairs of pants would be done by then.\n\nThis is where things get screwy. The second suit's alterations were completely off, and it seemed like no one had touched them. Pair of pants #1 were even longer and baggier than the pants on the suit, like they definitely were not touched or tailored whatsoever. They were too long by a good 4-5 inches and too baggy in the waist. ON TOP OF ALL THIS PAIR OF PANTS #2 WAS NOT DONE AND NO ONE HAD CALLED OR INFORMED US THEY WERE NOT READY. They said the tailor had left for the day. SO WE HAD DRIVEN AN HOUR TO GO TO THIS STORE TO PICK UP NOTHING BECAUSE ALL THE ALTERATIONS WERE WRONG AND THE ORDER WASN'T EVEN COMPLETED.\n\nIt is very very very clear that some managers in here are not doing their jobs correctly. I came here on a Saturday night - the store was a mess. There were ties and handkerchiefs not hung up, hangers not spaced evenly apart, the phone was ringing of the hook and no one was picking it up, and all the employees were either watching TV and I believe the manager was outside on his cell phone. It is clear that the tailors, or at least one of them doesn't have a brain and is completely incompetent. I understand that these people are most likely overworked or underpaid but it is such a disappointment to receive poor customer service in our economy because there are plenty of people who are more intelligent and harder working that can't find jobs because schmucks like the people at Men's Wearhouse are getting paid to watch TV, talk on their cell phones, and leave work before getting their jobs done.\n\nThis store is a joke and it is pathetic.

I was then told \"I'll call you back before lunch.\" Guess what? No call back. I was up against a deadline, and gave them well over a month to get a PAIR OF PANTS in and get an entire suit tailored.\n\nAfter calling numerous times, I physically went up to the store and got my money refunded. The manger was there and knew who I was, and offered to get it tailored same day. Too late, I ended up having to rent a suit for my event.
