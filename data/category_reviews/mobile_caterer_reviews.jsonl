What can I say...The Hotdoghery food truck has THE ABSOLUTE, HANDS DOWN BEST hot dogs and Conecuh dogs in Mobile! Their food is great and their level of professionalism, customer service and kindness are even greater!\nThese ladies were recently set up in our apartment complex on a Friday evening and although my sister and I caught them as they were LITERALLY closing up shop and leaving for the evening, these ladies STILL took out valuable time and opened back up just for us to take our orders!\n\nBoth of these ladies were SO kind to us and they served us as if we were their FIRST customers of the day, even though we were their LAST ones of the evening. Our food looked amazing and was very well prepared, not rushed. They didn\u2019t serve us the typical \u201cend of business\u201d scraps that others likely would\u2019ve served us and that really meant a lot to my sister Alisha and I. I gladly recommend anyone to grab a tasty bite from the Hotdoghery food truck when you can.

We hate your expectations were not satisfied.\n\nWe set high standards with our business and pride ourselves on our customer service  however we failed to come through for you.\u00a0 Our customers are our number one priority.\n\nThere was a  miscommunication internally with the posting of our where abouts on this particular day as it was suppose to remain a private event. We had a very small time frame to serve the teachers as we are still dealing with Covid.  Being an essential resource to our community and surrounding areas our tasks were not prepared to accept walk up patrons on this day and in turn caused errors to be made and we take full responsibility!!\n\nThe difference in the charges you mentioned was most likely the automatic gratuity on the amount purchased paying with your credit card.\n\nPlease allow us another chance to redeem our business code that we pride ourselves on and give you the experience you were denied.\n\nWe\u2019ll be in touch, or please give me a call at 251-895-8499 if it's more convenient for you, looking forward to speaking with you.\n\n\u200dBest Regards,\nKim McDonald\nOwner\n\u200d\u200dThe Hotdoghery, LLC\n251-895-8499"}, "gmap_id": "0x889ba9d62b838e27:0x8d7b6b55831d4da9"}
