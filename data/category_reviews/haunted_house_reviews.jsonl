The haunt was good overall, needed more interactive scenes, more scares as well... there was lots of running, and people trying to slam through doors- so there is room for people to be injured- several scenes require crawling, bending, stooping and running- if any of that is not something you can do i would  reconsider this haunt- all in all  it wasn't like any other haunt we have been to. To counteract the wait they had movies to view, as well as pin ball machines, and a concession stand (which was not open) in the lobby, and a nice selection of music.\n\nNOW- the nitty gritty.\n\nWe purchased VIP tickets, no where on the website does it give a description of what VIP includes- but from our experience we always get  VIP because we get the best of the haunt- shorter wait times, more scares, more hands on.  UNFORTUNATELY for us this was not the case- on the ticket it states 7:00 pm-11:00 pm no set time  to be there, no rules or regulations. We arrived at 8:45 pm- walked to the ticket desk and presented our tickets, and were told that  from that moment  we had a 4.5 hour wait, VIP offered no perks, there was no shorter wait, VIP just offered a more hands on experience during the haunt- plus you wear a nifty glow necklace. The clerk asked were we local, and stated that if we wanted to we could go home and wait until our time - we were not local - we had in fact drove 1 hour to this haunt-  we discussed this and decided we were just going to get a refund and go home. NOPE- there are no refunds. the clerk offered us to come back the next night or later on in the month-  but we were uninterested. We had no choice but to wait or lose 200.00.\nWe literally waited 4 hours and 50 minutes.  By the time we were called to participate we were worn out and sleepy. I say all of that to question why make people pay more for VIP with no true perks? We were not grabbed more, we were not interacted with more, there was no extra  questions asked nor were we involved in the haunt as we were told we would be -\n\nGiving them 2 stars - we had a good time- but any bad situation is what you make it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8861eee6869c4cef:0xce85bade29fe3290"}

The actors can grab you, run away with you , etc. But because of the craziness of the world with COVID , they took that into consideration and made it \u201csafe\u201d (lol) and mainly grab at your leg or arm.

Swamp ride(haunted hay ride), Haunted Corn Maze, Haunted House. All the employees were real nice and they had cotton candy and other vendors there for food etc. There were no monsters walking around so the scares didn't start until the first attraction. This Haunt most closely resembles Hollis Haunted Chicken House, but its better and cheaper. They also have really cool looking shirts that glow in blacklight and come in girl and guy colors. (I tried to edit the shirt though because I wont wear a shirt with what a consider to be a curse word on it).\n\nFirstly, we did the swamp ride. Its a tractor pulling a trailer with wood benches...basically a hay ride with no hay. The monsters came out of the woods, ran around the trailer, jumped on the trailer, and did touch. It was very well done and if I hadn't been holding onto my wife there is no doubt she would have jumped off and went running into the woods.\n\nSecondly, we did the corm maze. Its not a maze though, more like a trail cut out through the corn. There were several spots cut out for monsters to stand waiting to scare us. My wife tried to take off running several times and it was quite fun for me to watch. The best part of the corn maze was listening to the monsters yelling at each other about us as we walked through. It added a bit of comedy to the scares.\n\nThirdly, we did the Haunted House. Once we entered we got a little story and 2 ladies starting telling my wife how good she smelled and how she was going to look pretty with blood all over her. The haunt was well done and had obvious themes throughout. It weaved inside and outside as well. There were some cool effects used and again a lot of touching.\n\nMy wife commented afterwards that she has never been touched so much at a haunted house (which is not a bad thing). I can also say that she tried to run away more here than any other haunt. I can't say which of the three haunts were the best, but the combination of the three made for a very good experience. The combination of the three took about 45 minutes and we were there a total of an hour.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888968173ac98621:0x9287636fabd74bf1"}

The staff working both lines did great at handling things the best they could and giving information on when things would start back up. The furnace tour was decent it has been better.

With regards to the experience and scare factor, the attraction is money well spent.  Top notch actors and scenes, great location, and I definitely felt like we got our money's worth.  I especially appreciated the \"Slasher\" ticket option that allowed us to have a shorter wait time to get into the attraction.  My youngest daughter became very (visibly) scared early on into the walk.  (She thought she was ready for it but realized pretty quickly that she wasn't.)  What happened next, for me, is what sets this attraction apart from other similar attractions.  As soon as the actors became aware of how frightened she was, they made it a point to do everything that they could do to comfort/reassure her.  The crazy clown in the orange jumpsuit was great to us, leading us out at the end. The cemetery sisters were especially kind to her as was the young man playing the part of the butcher.  He was a large guy and his size alone was intimidating (as was his costume).  When he saw how upset she was, he approached her and told her that everything was going to be ok and that he would walk the remainder of the way with us!  He essentially stepped in as a bodyguard of sorts for us.  As we walked on through, all of the actors went out of their way to let her know that they weren't going to scare her.  Attention to detail with regards to scaring people is what attractions such as this are known for.  The attention to other details (such as comforting a frightened child) are a totally different skill set that the amazing actors at Doomsday bring to the table.

The actors hid behind doors, around corners, and in the darkness waiting to jump-scare and were committed to staying in character and making creepy and scary voices. The creatures of nightmares unleashed their hunting rituals and you may find yourself in spine-tingling scare zones without warning! Enjoy the butcher shop, clowns, zombies, vampires and more. The bubble suds room was the icing on the cake. Endless entertainment brought us scares we were dying for around every corner. See what awaits your dreams, because the only nightmare would be missing the haunt. If you\u2019re not to scared check them out. Were glad we did. It brought many scares and laughs well cherish for a lifetime.\n\nRemember\u2026You can\u2019t by Halloween memories on a shelf. You have to go make them! And it\u2019s the right time and place. They\u2019ll leave a light on for ya!  BOOO!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862598d5fc92b09:0x5aec40973e6b6b95"}

The only thing that killed it for me was, if you don\u2019t spend the extra money to buy the fast pass... You\u2019re gonna be waiting in line for 3+ hours, unless you get there super early to wait in the ticket line.

Not realizing that it was NOT the ticket line because the sigh for admission is on the other side of the haunted house so if the people in line didn\u2019t inform me the ticket line was on the other side I would have waited in line longer than I did. So I got back in line in waited about 2 hours maybe 3 hours... just to go in a clown house that only lasted about 3 Minutes. After the clown house I had to wait another 2 hours just to go in the main haunted house. We had to wait longer because they informed us they needed a break because they been working since 7:00pm Reminder (you have people in line that has been waiting just as long.) Went into the haunted house and it was amazing! Everything was awesome! I loved it. But hated the wait! Just a little advice..... 1.)Feed your staff before they start! That prevents longer wait  times.2.)  Please have at least a staff member directing people where to go to buy tickets it would have helped me a lot.  3.) Keep up the good work. If y\u2019all get the wait time down by at least a hour I think it would be GREAT! I will be returning to see if reviews actually matter to you guys! Not trying to be smart just being honest! I understand the wait time warnings but at least try to make every effort to make the wait a little shorter than it was. FYI you have to pay first than wait the long wait. So your kinda force to stay. I don\u2019t think they do refunds!
