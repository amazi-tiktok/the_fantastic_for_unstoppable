Here are some answers: Montgomery is a steam-powered sternwheel-propelled snagboat built in 1925 by the Charleston Dry Dock and Machine Company of Charleston, South Carolina, and operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Montgomery cleared snags and obstructions from the Coosa, Alabama, Apalachicola, Chattahoochee, Flint, Black Warrior, and Tombigbee Rivers until her retirement from the Corps of Engineers on November 8, 1982. She was restored in 1984 and again in 2004, declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989. Montgomery now operates as a museum ship at the Tom Bevill Lock and Dam Visitor Center in Pickensville, Alabama.\n\nMy experience with the Monty was pleasant . . . for historical reasons and for architectural reasons and for engineering reasons. It represents a tool used long ago that I have never thought about and couldn't have imagined. It pulled stumps out of rivers and rivers-to-be. Cool stuff.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88868507ebea76e7:0xb0b004352b8d279c"}
