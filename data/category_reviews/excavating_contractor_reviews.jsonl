I set up the original appointment via e-mail. I live 5 time zones away and coordinated the work for the week I was at my Mom's. Josh came by, gave me an estimate, and recommended removal of two trees. Both were close to the house, one was a 50-ft oak tree.  Josh was able to reschedule a day earlier than he originally projected.\n\nAbout 6 hours of work, and the tree felling operations went flawlessly dropping right between house and fence. The crew was professional, Josh was personally meticulous about cleaning and power blowing yard clean, especially around pool. Josh owns and runs this business and of course will be saturated with calls after severe weather events.  That's why I elected to have the work done on my schedule, not Mother Nature's. I had some questions after the work was completed and Josh provided timely responses and follow up to my questions.

When our septic field failed less that 5 years after it was installed, we called to see if they would come fix it. They said it wasn't under warranty and would not help us at all.  We knew it wasn't under warranty but the county septic engineer said we should contact them to come fix their work because they put it in they are familiar with it. They they asked where it was leaking,  and said if it was off the side it was our fault, (note I wasn't trying to place blame, I was trying to get help) The leak is on the top, close to where the main pipe should connect into the dome system.  I was then told I would save a LOT of money if we just had a load of land fill and put it on top, and that would \"fix\" the problem. I told that to the county engineer, and was informed that would be illegal, and just cause more problems, and we would be liable for an Illegal fix, for several reasons, 1- we are not licensed or certified to work on a septic field, even though it is our own. 2- we would not have pulled a permit for the fix, which if we ever sold the house and they found out about the fix we would be liable.

I have limited experience in this field and discussed over the phone the issues with the tank. They saved me a LOT of money by being HONEST, which is very limited in today's world.  Instead of telling me I had to have new lines run (which makes a lot of money), they re-routed from the header. Exceptional honest people!! I'd recommend ROSSER'S to anyone!!
