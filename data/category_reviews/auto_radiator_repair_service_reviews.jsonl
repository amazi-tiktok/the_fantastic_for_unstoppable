My first impression walking in was not favorable, as the owners smoke indoors and it is not well maintained. I would say the highlight of this place is the employees, because they were super helpful and polite as my car was put into the garage. Be careful if you have insurance; once I brought up that my insurance might cover the work, the owner got really shady and kept telling me that it wasn't a good idea to contact my insurance company. I ended up leaving my car here for about a week and I heard no updates from the store and they wouldn't answer any phone calls. I decided I didn't want to conduct business with these folks anymore. When I finally got the owner on the phone, he protested that the job would cost me about $6,000, but calling around and showing the invoice to other mechanics in the area, they told me they would do the same job for about $4,000. I ended up having the car towed to the dealership because of the bad vibes I got with APT.\n\nIn summary, I cannot attest to their expertise fixing the car, but I definitely didn't like their low level of professionalism.

He asked multiple times if it was ready, was told only 20 more mins, then 30...well 2 hours after the said time he left. We had plans at 11am, so those didn't happen WHICH could have been planned for-like loading up my kids (one being a newborn) in the car and picking him up. No apologies for the extra wait time and never honest about how long it was going to take.\nCome that following week, SURPRISE, there was an oil leak on the garage floor AND the check engine light was back on. So we took it back once again. He was told that it was just old oil coming out and it was fine and that some other piece needed to be replaced for the check engine light. Like why wasn't this fixed the first time!? Unless we got super unlucky and something went wrong within the 3/4 day time.\n\nWell now it's about 4 months later and there's still oil spots on the floor!\nSo we called today, I got a so-so person on the phone and was told to bring it back in, no \"oh my goodness! That's not what we like to hear..please bring it back in!\" It was just \"bring it back\".\n\n1st, can we make the comparison on the comment from Ashton Morgan below?? This was the SAME day, the SAME time and my husband remembers talking and waiting with Ashton.\nWe aren't very knowledgable on car repairs and we should've gotten a 2nd opinion(the Garage in Pelham is literally walking distance and everyone always has great things to say about them, but this was just for a cheap oil change-never again!) ..but we just had a baby and didn't have much spare time or sleep to decide these things with a clear mind.\n\nI just reccomend going somewhere else for piece of mind EVEN for an oil change, even if this was just a random bad day (which look at the rating-use your brains people!

So I called them up. For the same repair they were going to have to charge close to $900. It was better but still hurt. Took my car up and waited. Got a call from Mike and he said that he wanted to check over the car before I spent all that money. He discovered what the dealership didn't, that something was just unplugged. Only charged the diagnostic fee! He could have charged me fully, but he and this business have been ethical. I take my car to them anytime I have issues, and they've been precise and sure every time.

Had been told by two regular customers that they do really good work. The office attendant (Mike, I think was his name), was straight-forward, respectful, patient, gave me a phone quote, had the work done timely, with the final bill ending up being a little less than the original quote, even after adding the tow bill & taxes. It was a very welcomed change from the experience I'd had at another local shop I'd been referred to (but later warned about from several other past customers) where I repeatedly had to endure rudeness from the know-it-all mechanic, immediate breakdowns from same issue I'd just paid to have repaired, & ignored voicemails asking to speak to the owner. Guthrie's owner followed-up the very next day to make sure everything was going well with the work on my car. I would much rather pay for a job well done the first time than a little less and keep breaking down, having my car towed, finding another way to work at the last minute to keep my job, and then constantly being talked down to in person & over the phone (while the owner justifies it as him \"being from New York\",... to which I reminded them both that he's now n ALABAMA, & that cocky attitude won't do here, especially with me!!... 3 different types of repairs... never fixed after being told they were!).

I had a vehicle break down on me and took it here to avoid towing it to the dealership in Birmingham. I quickly received an estimate of almost $23,000 to fix my suv and was told that I should contact my insurance company because it was totaled.\n\nI ended up taking it to the dealership for a second opinion (like I should have to begin with) and ended up only paying $3700 to repair what was wrong with my suv, and that didn\u2019t include a single thing listed on the original estimate sent to me by CBA.\n\nI really wish they would have just turned me away before I took it there in the first place if they could not service my vehicle instead of guessing what the problem was and writing it off as a lost cause.\n\nI called CBA last week to update them on the status of my vehicle and to let them know what really was wrong with it - all they wanted to know was how \u201creputable the shop was that I took my vehicle to\u201d and to try to tell me that they never referred to my car as totaled.

I have no disapproval towards the individual employees there.\n\nWith that said, that is unfortunately the extent of my positives about the business. I've brought two of my vehicles there a total of three times, over the course of two years, and each time, I have been disappointed. My first vehicle had a minor oil leak, and I took it to CBA to check it out. Long story short, they charged me over $1000 and a week of time, and in the end, the issue wasn't resolved. Brought my vehicle to another shop on Atl Highway, $250 later, and it was fixed. All in all, this wasn't a huge deal, but I was disappointed in CBA.\n\nFast forward 2 years, and i take another one of my vehicles that I had just purchased to CBA for a post-purchase full diagnosis (This alone cost $120) which they assured me would cover just about everything i needed to get done to the vehicle to get it to top shape. They quoted me over $5,000 worth of service. This alone wasn't completely insane. It was an older vehicle, and yes, a good few things needed fixing. However, I jotted down the items they told me I needed to replace and decided to do the items myself (brake change, coolant flush, oil change, filters, etc). Took off the brakes. The Pads, Rotors were literally brand new. They said my front caliper mount and caliper itself were in terrible condition. Completely false--it was in perfect condition upon further inspection. Performed the coolant change after they claimed it was dirty and needed changing (btw they quoted me $140 for the coolant change, which if you know, is one of the easiest things you can do yourself for $20 worth of coolant and 30 min of your time max). This also turned out to be unecessary. The coolant I drained was the exact same color as the new coolant I purchased myself. I did this for every item on the list of things they told me I needed to change, and the ONLY thing that actually needed to be changed was the front driver struts and the radiator fan.\n\nA week after I get the $5000 list of things that need to be serviced, I drive to Atlanta. Halfway there on the interstate, my timing/fan belt shred apart, engine overheats, and my car is disabled. Tow it to a garage nearby and they inform me that my water pump was well on its way out, A/C compressor had imploded, and timing/fan belts should have been changed a long time ago. NONE OF THESE WERE MENTIONED BY CBA. Fortunately I did not get into an accident, but I trusted CBA to diagnose what I needed to fix on my vehicle, and they failed to mention, at all, three incredibly easy to inspect components that were failing, and caused my vehicle to stop driving in the middle of the highway. Absolutely unacceptable.\n\nIf you're reading this, CBA, come on, step your game up. If you're going to charge one of the highest rates in the entire state of Alabama, maybe provide service that backs up that rate. I respect you all as individuals, but  as a \"reputable automotive service center\", I am appalled.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1596806181463, "text": "We take your detailed feedback seriously, as our customers' safety and satisfaction are very important to us.

CBA was the only other shop I called, as soon as Danny answered my call he said he knew he had to help me, not to worry, they would do everything they could to get me through this. He did. He helped me get it towed from Prattville to their shop in Montgomery. Kept me updated every step of the way and constantly reassured me that they were there to help. My car, unfortunately, had some very major issues and even at CBA prices still was out of my price range. But, I didn't leave without transportation. Danny went above and beyond to help me find a suitable vehicle that I could afford and I left yesterday the owner of a reliable, running vehicle. The people of CBA are some of the kindest people I have had the blessing of meeting. They are truly doing works that reflect the epitome of Christians.

They are just using \"Christian Brothers\" for marketing purposes, not to show a genuine Christian nature. I went in for an alternator swap. I knew it was the alternator and told them as much; didn't stop them from charging me $48 to \"diagnose\" the problem. That was for an half hour of labor which if you want to count the time it took for them to tell me the price, was not a half hour after I brought it in. So yes, their hourly labor rate is $96 which strikes me as a little high, and yes, they don\u2019t mind rounding up to the detriment of the customer. The rest of the bill was just as offensive and out of tune with normal auto repair prices. A re-manufactured alternator for my car was $117 at the time, they charged $244.20 and kept the core fee for themselves. No, they didn't put a new one in, just a re-man. They then charged me $39.78 for a serpentine belt, which I don't mind that they replaced, but a new one at any auto parts store runs around $20. So paying twice for parts is pretty painful, but then they add on a fee for \"shop supplies\"; I'm not sure what for, wear and tear on the tools? A paper towel or two? Whatever they were, they cost me $37.10. You'd think that \"shop supplies\" would be included when you pay premium for the parts and labor. On top of all of that, they padded the hours they were replacing the alternator. They charged me for 1.5 hours ($144.09) but the guy was only working on it for 45 minutes tops. The rest of the time that it was in their garage it just sat there. That's right, a car in Christian Brothers Automotive's garage is accruing labor costs even if it just sits there, hate to see what the overnight tab would be. Just think of the \u201cshop supplies\u201d that leaked into a car that sat there overnight.\n\nThey have three salesman upfront and only two technicians when I was there. This shows their focus: extract every possible penny from a potential customer, especially if he is from out of town. Why pay extra techs when you are still billing for the time that the car sits in their garage right? Another indication of their less-than-honest nature is that they put all these odd-ball prices on the parts and shop fees. Like what is with the 10 cents on shop supplies, they couldn't round that off? Well they could, but they don't want you to realize that they are just padding the bill. Ten cents looks more authentic. They also have a sign in the back that says: \"Ask every customer: Is there anything else we can check for you today?\" I'd hate to see the proposal for work you get back when you give these guys a greenlight to check out your entire car.\n\nThe technicians were good, the alternator seems to be working out fine. But the salesmen are only good at small talk. They brought my car back out of the garage and it started to smoke. They thought the engine was about to explode or something they turn it off and frantically check the oil. When I get out there they say that the oil pan is empty. Nope, check again. When they checked again they saw that it was half full like I knew it was. The smoke was from the debris that got knocked down onto the serpentine belt. Some debris that my $37.10 in shop supplies should have cleaned up. Guess not.\n\nAll-in-all, I paid $545 for a pretty simple fix, and they quoted me on the phone $250 as I was driving trying to get somewhere before my car died. I guess they knew they had me, but I hope this review saves somebody else the expense and frustration of dealing with these guys. These guys bend you over with a smile on their face. If you want this type of service and pay these type of prices, just go to the dealer, at least they are more knowledgeable about your car.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2db31cb0a5bf:0x2c43880b4b10967d"}

I took my car to Kia because my air wasn\u2019t working they kept my car for a day and a half. I got my car back the air was working fine. I didn\u2019t pay anything. About a week later I went back in for my follow up appointment because I was informed to bring the car back so they could check my Freon levels. I took the car back and the rep that car up to me informed me it would be 139.00 for a diagnostic reading. I got upset because if you charge to do a diagnostic reading why wasn\u2019t that service performed the first time. I ended up getting a phone call back from a guy named Jaizon, that apologized about my previous encounter with the pricing and he informed me I wasn\u2019t supposed to pay anything for the diagnostic fee.  I took my car back to the dealership and left it. A few hours later I get a phone call from a totally difference representative that tells me I\u2019m going to have to pay 280 dollars for them to figure out what\u2019s wrong with my car. I informed them to have my car ready for me to pick it up then five minutes later the same rep called me back and stated they would knock 100 dollars off of the 280 to make it 170 for the diagnostic fee. I\u2019ve gotten literally four prices for simply finding out what\u2019s wrong with my car. I\u2019ve wasted my time, and gas by making trips up there that was a complete waste of time! I\u2019ve gotten more lies and inaccuracy from this company than any other company in Huntsville thus far. And I\u2019ve only been in Huntsville about 2 years. They will NEVER have to worry about me bringing my car there again. That\u2019s for sure! Giving them one star is too much credit, I wish I could remove it too!!!

I went in to get oil change and a get a quote on new master cylinder for my son's car. My son had a free oil change card that his mother gave him.  This his first oil change of his first car I bought him last year. He's had the card for over a year and it has no expiration date on it. The service tech \"manager\" said he didn't think the card was still good. Again, it had no expiration date on it. He said well it should've been signed by manager, though there's no place for it to be signed by a manager. The \"manage\" said well anyone could've just picked it up and put the date on it and brought it back.  I said I didn't do that nor did my son or his mother. I told him I didn't appreciate being accused of stealing a free oil change card. He said two other people did that yesterday. I said that is not my fault nor an excuse to accuse me of doing the same thing. He could not understand what he had done over a $34.95 oil change. He called the owner and the owner said the card fine, of course. He did not apologize for accusing me of stealing the free oil change card. He said he had to make sure it was ok or it would come out of his paycheck. Again, no reason to ever utter someone could have just picked one up and brought it in unsigned. All he had to say is he had to call his owner to see how to process the card not accuse me of possibly stealing it. With that lack of ability to understand the damage to the customer for your handling of this made me question giving someone like that the responsibility to work on the brakes on my son's car. So, I took my free oil change card from his fingertips and told the inexperienced \"manager\" that I'd take my business elsewhere. As I left he said the free oil change card was \"null and void\". He just had to be right. He would not listen to the customer who was getting ready to pay $559 for work plus and extra $36 for the full synthetic oil change. Hint empathy people. I only do business with people I like period and though I just met this guy he gave me reason not to like him in under 10 minutes. I had never been in a Meineke in my life until today and will never do so again. Thanks to this manager at the South Huntsville shop.

They were able to replace that at no cost to me. Secondly, screws were missing and clips weren't reinstalled. The manager assured me they would be replaced, and they were. Lastly the radiator was mounted improperly (very wobbly, almost hitting the engine). This was initially resolved with plastic zip ties and told by the manager that it was repaired and I was good to go. Obviously this was unacceptable at an initial service fee of $105/hr.

Again I said I just need a quote, he told me he could not give me a quote with out bringing it in for inspection.  I will never use Meineke again, that is how they lure you in, you take your car/truck there for something and before you leave they scare you to death saying something else is life or death.
