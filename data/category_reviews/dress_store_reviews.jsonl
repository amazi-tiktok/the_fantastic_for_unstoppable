Found the cutest two dresses and proceeded to the check to ask if I could leave them there for ten mins while I walk literally two stores down. I\u2019ve done this time and time before we always eat at the local restaurant connected to the strip mall. I was quickly told NO sorry we can\u2019t hold anything. I was a little shocked and explained she was two doors down and I wanted to make sure they were a good fit due to them being final sale. The two looked at each other and said sorry because you can go online 24 hours and order we aren\u2019t allowed to hold anything. Now if I\u2019d previously not held something before maybe I\u2019d believe them. One proceeded to say I\u2019ll put it in the fitting room and we can just say she\u2019s waiting on the fitting room!! Which means YOUR HOLDING IT. I smiled and told them that was ok and walked out needless to say I will only order from online or if I see the manager ( can\u2019t remeber her name but she\u2019s awesome) I\u2019ll only shop then.

Anyway, the dresses were supposed to be in at least 6 weeks before the wedding. The dresses never came in and we had less than 2 weeks before the wedding.  In a panic my daughter went to David's Bridal and she found a way more beautiful  dress that complemented all the girls. They put a rush on it and they came in in one week! They altered them in 2 days, all seven and was ready days before the wedding! I had to call 3 times, over 3 weeks to get my refund back from promenade.

They said no they do it by the dates of prom no matter how early you bought the dress.

I would not recommend Promenade for any bridal services, especially bridesmaids dresses. I ordered dresses for my three bridesmaids about 5 months prior to my wedding. The manufacturer estimated a ship date about 6 weeks prior to my wedding. To make a long story short, the dresses never came in.\n\nFor more details, read below, but the bottom line is that I would take my business elsewhere in the future, and I recommend that others do the same. The consultants in the store were very nice and helpful, but it's not worth the headache of dealing with Promenade's lack of good communication skills. I guess they missed the lesson in business school that the customer is always right.\n\nWhen the dresses did not arrive in time for my wedding, they did offer us dresses from another source that were in stock. However, the sizes that my bridesmaids needed were not available. All three of my bridesmaids lived out of town, so having Promenade alter a larger dress down a size was not a feasible option for me, even though the store suggested altering dresses THEN shipping to the bridesmaids. I felt that anyone who knows anything would realize this option was crazy on a timeline of 10 days before the wedding. What were we going to do if the dresses were altered, shipped, and arrived 5 days before the wedding, and still didn't fit?\n\nSo about 10 days before my wedding, I ordered replacement dresses from David's Bridal and paid for overnight shipping. I'll admit that the fact that the original dresses never came in may have been the dress manufacturer's fault, but Promenade did not handle the situation well. The owner did not return phone calls when my mother or I would leave messages at the store, and she did not check the status of the supposed shipment as early or as often as I would have liked.\n\nI requested that the store reimburse me for the cost of the replacement dresses that the girls did not want or even like, but they refused. I sent an email to the owner with the invoices for these dresses, and never heard another word about it until I sent another email, waited 10 days, received no response, and then called the store to follow up.\n\nI don't want to sound like another jaded bride, but the truth is that there are plenty of other local businesses that do a better job of communicating with their customers and valuing customer satisfaction.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d45f35aef892b:0xb0bea7f33837c8f2"}

The other 2 bridesmaids and I ordered our dresses back in December and were assured they would arrive 12 weeks from the time of order. The last dress was ordered December 29th. I called toward the end of March to check on my dress since I needed to make arrangements to get from Tuscaloosa to Tuscumbia for pick up. I was assured at that time the dress would ship on April 13 and arrive at their store in 7 to 10 business days. I called back on April 26th to check on the status of the dress. I was told at that time the that the dresses would be in early this week. I called yesterday and was told the dresses were at the UPS hub in Muscle Shoals and were left off the truck for the delivery and the owner did not have time to go get the dresses. I was assured at that time that the dresses would be in Friday morning and I could pick mine up Saturday with no issue. Friday rolled around and to no ones surprise, the dresses did not arrive. We were again assured the dresses would arrive Monday (less than 2 weeks from the wedding). Call me a skeptic, but I have lost ALL TRUST in this business. We have now come up with a back up plan to have dresses here the week of the wedding from another company. The bride and other 2 bridesmaids have made numerous calls to this business and also been given the run around. Had we not taken matters into our own hands, I am not convinced we would have any dresses for the wedding.

I had a great experience at my first appointment. A very nice, young lady, who was engaged herself, assisted me. She let me try on the dresses I had picked and delivered the style of dresses I was looking for. She was very accommodating to my mother and sister who I had brought with me. We found my dress and I could not have been happier with that first visit. We had a glass of champagne after we decided on it and it was a lovely enjoyable visit.\nThe owner was there and she was helpful and kind as well. When she saw that I was really leaning towards one, she stepped in and let me know what alterations could be made and we ended up changing the neckline a little bit.\nWhen I went to pick up my dress, we had a different experience. In addition to my mother and sister, I brought a couple of friends along to see me in it. I walked in first, and told the lady at the desk that I had an appointment to pick up my dress. She then began to walk back towards the dressing rooms. I didn't follow her at first because 1. she didn't tell me to and 2. my friends and family weren't all inside the shop yet. When I did take a few steps towards where she went, I saw she had turned around and looked annoyed that I had not followed her.\nI put on the dress and she assisted me. After I was in it, I had to ask her if I could go show my friends.\nBy the time I got out and we looked over my dress, my sister and mother had already noticed how unpleasant the girl helping me was. She made us feel like we were a bother to her.\nI enjoyed my first experience tremendously. My second was not so pleasant. The shop is wonderful as long as you do not get the grumpy girl. I wish I had caught her name, but she wasn't friendly enough to tell me and I was too scared of her to ask. I would and do recommend this shop.

They said no need to call ahead weeks in advance and wouldn't schedule me an appointment.

I reminded them I would like them to make sure my dress was steamed properly so I could actually see what it looked like.  When I arrived for my appointment, they had just started to steam it...I had to sit by myself and waited 45 mins to try on my sort of steamed dress.

It's great that they also have a rental option because formal dresses can get expensive if purchasing. There is also a good amount of parking in front and on the side of the store. The Customer Service was excellent even when there was a rush of customers in the store. There was quality attention given to everyone which I'm sure was nice to see and feel.
