I have been hesitating because many reviews say their sheets are rough, coarse, even scratchy. After investigating these reviews, I'm guessing that their white sheets are not this way. Again guessing that their Natural sheets have a tendency to be rough and scratchy. Then I saw their Ticking Stripe. Though not particularly attracted to the pattern, I liked those better than plain white.\nThen it was the cost that prohibited a purchase. After checking quality sheets from other companies, I learned that quality sheets are just REALLY expensive. LL Bean sells their best egyptian cotton sheets in the size I need for $30 less than Red Land. I went down to their best percale sheets, $50 less. That's significantly lower and I know those sheets would have been great. But Red Land is ALL done in America. From the cotton in the field all the way to the finished sheets, it's done in the US. I am tired of everything coming from China or another country. So I took the plunge and paid the extra money and then hoped i wouldn't be disappointed with rough sheets that would prevent me from getting sleep. Reviewer, I can tell you I am elated with the Ticking Stripe sheets. Would I prefer solid colors or pretty patterns? Yes, but I won't trade these sheets for anything! When I first laid my face on the pillow, I could feel it was somewhat rough. (I washed them first)  But they weren't so rough that I couldn't stand it. I have Fibromyalgia and my whole body is ultra sensitive, especially my skin. I allowed myself to forget about the slight roughness of the pillowcase, my body relaxed and all was well. They are not rough on my bare legs or arms. They have excellent body, but not too stiff. I like a sheet with body, not sheets that are so \"soft\" that they practically stick to me and my sleep shirt. Blech! Thank you Red Land for truly making sheets that will last the rest of my life and beyond.\nI have a 100% latex mattress. Was worried the fitted sheet would be too loose and bunch up. The 14\" fit snug and perfect. The top sheet is long enough to fit the full length of my bed but still plenty to tuck in without constantly coming out. Thank you!
