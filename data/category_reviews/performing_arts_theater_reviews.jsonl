With any complaints about a shows audio, we have audio techs from the VBC try to help them solve the issue, but that does not always happen. From that, all I can do is apologize that you had a less than wonderful experience at the show. We do wish that there was more that we could do because the biggest reason we do this job is to help people have a good time, and really do not like when people don\u2019t.

Beloved stories told through expert training, costuming, set design, lighting and make-up. Experienced professionals are directing and producing here. Full-time pursuits, not just locals with a passion (not that there's anything wrong with that). Broadway-style quality. Repertory equals reliable quality, a familiarity with all aspects of putting on rotating musicals and plays. Shows are also added anew. Original music is sprinkled in. If you haven't seen a show here, you will be thrilled. If you have, \"get season tickets.\" Great place for kids to learn the craft of stage acting, backstage skills and be a part of something bigger than themselves. A second home for growth and happiness. Each season offers a \"teen Halloween show,\" a holiday selection where the venue is the Saenger Theater downtown, a Shakespeare selection, a kids' musical, plus summer stock musicals. \"The Conclusion of Edgar Allen Poe,\" \"A Christmas Carol,\" \"A Midsumer Night's Dream,\" and \"Mary Poppins\" are among the offerings in recent years. Plenty of adjacent parking. Great place to unwind and escape. A gem in the community. Favorite place for live entertainment. Go here and do this.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a52a6c9b81101:0x8409de40dc3142bf"}
