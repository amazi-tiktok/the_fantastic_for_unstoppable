My personal things were put in two storage containers 6 years ago by a business that cleaned up our water damaged house.  Five years ago that business we got to do the clean up went out of business and the two containers were taken out of our yard with my belongings and without notice.  I am not allowed to have access to them because I don't have the pin # to the account. Five years ago, we got no help from the local business or main company.  We tried to get everything take care of then and couldn't get in touch with the business that worked originally with us and PODS would only talk to the original business that was no longer in existence.\nSo, skip to a week ago I get a letter that informs me of the amount that is owed on the two pods since 2016 and will be put up for auction at the end of the month.  I am a third party and have tried to work with this company - I called and asked about the letter and was told it was a mistake and I shouldn't have gotten it.  Yet, six years later I am still not allowed to get my families' things that are still in the storage units.  So, I was told that nothing could be done and my things would be sold at an auction on 29th of this month.  So, if I paid the $26,692 that was owed by the other company that contracted with Pods originally, could I get my things with no PIN #?  I would just like some help and it seems like no one cares at this company.  There needs to be some way to work this out.

My story goes like this.  Ordered 2 PODS and realized the day of loading that I was going to need another one.  I called PODS and requested a new container and the call lasted for two hours and fifteen minutes.  I also scheduled the pickup for all the PODS after loaded and was assured all three would be stored in Montgomery, AL, which would be the closest storage facility that would deliver to my new address in Auburn, AL.  The technician told me to just call about three days before I needed them delivered to the new address and there wouldn\u2019t be any issue.  There was a big issue.  They didn\u2019t store my PODS in Montgomery, they stored them in Birmingham and claimed they needed five days for transit and three day for logistics.  I spoke to three or four supervisors and nobody could do anything to get my PODS on the day I requested.  They did say that if my PODS would have been stored in Montgomery like they said there would not have been any issue.  THEIR FAULT! So they put in an account review and some guy called and stated they lost the 2:15 min call I had with them.  He credited my account $100 dollars and said basically take it or leave it and he didn\u2019t have to give me anything.  So I accepted I was getting my PODS on the earliest date they said.  I moved my entire family down the day prior because all three PODS were scheduled to be delivered.  They only delivered two of the three and stated the other one was never scheduled.  I asked if someone could just please contact the Birmingham facility and see if they can make an exception and deliver it the next day but was met with the standard \u201cthat is not our policy or procedure\u201d.  I had to drive my family back to my parent\u2019s house to stay with them for another week because the one POD they didn\u2019t send is the one with all of our furniture.  It is taking them nine additional days to deliver my last POD and I\u2019m having to take more vacation time off to unload it.  They also charged me for and extra month of storage because due to their mistake the PODS were in storage for more than 30 days and they don\u2019t prorate monthly storage fees.  I will never use this company again.  They have ONE job, to deliver/store PODS and they can\u2019t even do that right.  WHEN they make a mistake, and they will, they will not fix it.  They will tell you to submit and account review and someone will get back to you in 3-5 days.  Not one time did I call them and spend less than an hour on the phone.  If you ask for a supervisor, they put you on hold for half hour and then come back on stating they are busy.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891f1fb1cb8e33:0x27a0a5ff6fe82e95"}
