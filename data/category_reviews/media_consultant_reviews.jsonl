I hear horror stories like these from potential clients on a regular basis. I always advise them, whether they hire me or not, to \"do this and do that\" and \"ask this and ask that\" BEFORE selecting their next marketing agency. There are simply too many marketing service providers that over promise and under deliver, selling services that they know are not in the best interest of their clients. Even worse, many so-called \"web marketing\" agencies are experienced only with \"traditional\" marketing such as print, radio, or television, but expanded their services into the web arena in order to survive (or be more profitable). While most of these agencies are excellent at providing \"traditional\" marketing services, many of them are wholly unqualified to provide any type of online marketing services.
