We do not have dairy-based protein smoothies; we have coconut milk sweetened with Stevia as \"magic milk\" base.  We use Ghirardelli chocolate powder & Ghirardelli syrup. Our mocha powder has 20g protein/scoop.\n\nWe certainly would have made you another option (probably recommending no protein powder). Hopefully there's something else you'd like to try - maybe a delicious pop? Our Cold Brew is a popular coffee-flavored pop.

I\u2019ve been there multiple times and while the tea/tapioca pearls are a hit or miss I still go because I like that they don\u2019t use powdered Thai tea, to my knowledge anyways. I also enjoy one girl who seems to always work there and is very friendly and nice( I don\u2019t know her name but she is short and always has hoop earings). I recently went there with my friend (a HOUR and about ten minutes before they closed) and ordered our typical drinks with the tapioca pearls and was told that they didn\u2019t have any. Disappointed because that is one of the biggest reasons for a BUBBLE tea, they did offer strawberry and mango popping boba (which aren\u2019t our favorites due to it being a Thai tea and my friend doesn\u2019t enjoy them at all) and I nicely told them never mind. The girl that was working gave me a really rude/nasty look that almost makes me not want to come back because of it.( this same girl has helped me my first time coming to this location and her friend was behind me and she was very, VERY distracted by that).
