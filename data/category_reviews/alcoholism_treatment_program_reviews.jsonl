Over the years it has grown into a steadfast southside sanctuary for anyone looking to stay sober reguardless of D.O.C. . JAFI now provides space for AA, HA, CA and CMA meetings as well as a place to hang out during the day for JAFI members who pay a nominal monthly fee to keep the place operational. JAFI occupies a strange but unique place in the hearts and minds of hundreds of folks from all walks of life who found serenity in sobriety in Birmingham.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bdad3184f13:0xb1cc2d8a5cfffd52"}
