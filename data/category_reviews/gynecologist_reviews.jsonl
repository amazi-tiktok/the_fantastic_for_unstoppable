I noticed a pattern that a lot of reviewers complained of the wait time and I will say that I did have a couple appointments where I waited a little longer to be seen. It really wasn\u2019t that long so it was barely worth mentioning but I figured I would since it seems to be an issue with other patients. But knowing what I know now I understand why. Dr. Voss is amazing. I came in for my pregnancy and ended up being high risk. She explained everything in great detail and what the plan would be for my pregnancy. She even addressed why there may be a longer wait time sometimes, which I didn\u2019t even bring up, but I thought it was nice that she did. It shows that she\u2019s aware of patient concerns and doing what she can about it. They see patients for regular appointments but also unscheduled appointments if there is an issue that isn\u2019t severe enough for the ER but still needs to be addressed quickly. This was me on a couple of occasions. I called in the morning on 3 separate occasions and was seen within a couple of hours due to complications with my pregnancy. So I really appreciate being seen so quickly and will take waiting a little bit longer for scheduled appointments because of it. The entire staff is very friendly and attentive. When things got serious with my pregnancy Dr.Voss was on top of it and I couldn\u2019t have asked for better care. Things could have gone a lot worse for a lot of reasons but her quick action due to her vast knowledge made sure that the outcome was best case scenario. She followed up with me a couple of times after everything to make sure I was doing okay and I really felt like she took her time. She spent a considerable amount of time talking with me about everything, which is not always the case with some doctors. Very often I feel rushed when I am seeing a physician so in the situation I was in it was nice to feel like I had her ear and care. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to come back to Dr. Voss for future pregnancies or any other needs.

I waited there about 30mins. The nurse then took me to the exam room, as I sat there for at least another hour maybe a little more. I became anxious but,tried to be patient.

I weigh 100lbs.,I was not interested in any of this but, listened. She spent about 20mins or so in the room with me she explained everything in great depth and reassured me questions that I worried about were nothing to be concerned about.

Dr. Torrence seems to be the only capable staff member, which means you wait for 3+ hours for OB appointments. As I had a child to take care of, I couldn't do that. So I switched to Dr. Voss. Biggest mistake of my life. I tore with a 6 pound baby. So when my 9 pound baby shot out like a freaking rocket because she kept turning up the pitocin, you can only imagine the aftermath. When I went to my 6 week checkup, I asked her why she didn't give me a c-section to begin with since my son was measuring huge, she told me that I was crazy with hormones and if I spoke to her like that again, we'd have to involve lawyers. I immediately switched to Dr. Heim whom when he saw the size of my son could not believe that I had him vaginally. These women are running a chop shop and I'm not sure why they are the first practice that Tricare refers to.

I came in and had to pay another copay.  Then Dr. Raines proceeds to ask me why I am there.  Really??!!  Then she says my results were fine.  In my opinion, it was like they wanted another copay from me. I now see Dr. Scott at Women's Medical Center and he is the best.  He has been a blessing to me and it is such a relief to have a DR that sincerely cares.

Dr. Malone said she would recommend Bush set me up with physical therapy. I mentioned physical therapy to Bush at my follow up appointment only to be told\" I never heard of pregnant women doing physical therapy\". Then out of nowhere I received a phone call from a therapy center letting me know ladies first had sent a referral *tada* three weeks before my due date. I went to one appointment and the therapist was shocked that they waited so late to finally send me and stated that there was not much (if anything) they could do for me. not to mention that it was not safe for me to do physical therapy do far into my pregnancy. on the day of my due date I went in for my check up. I told the medical assistant that I was having minimal fetal movement she just said ok and left the room. Bush came in assessed me and we discussed induction. I left the office only to be call back to return. When I spoke to Bush She said that she was unaware that I told the medical assistant a having minimal movement from my baby.
