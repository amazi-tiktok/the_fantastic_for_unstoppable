I wish food and drinks were served in reusable containers to not have to create so much trash.\nDolphin sightings included!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVPTJQFzHZAOhgyVr-4UoUb8P5PZNuYqQu697M=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6_5EqO7xhotVzi3NSXVzABZVn8icyuA8vxDBk=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwmiDKQv4AZzuiMZkoC4zFn_Xx1KBCVuo8vL2O=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYOZinqnA7_tvGfcvKsDKg4GIXbJIhjcvC0OEa=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqcRYhBTWsI9YPMAvivdwHi4Kk_HQI5aUGIF-X=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1622599320519, "text": "Stefan thank you very much for the great review!

And it was not very busy by this time. Seemingly lazy, incompetent and unconcerned staff in regards to customer service and customer satisfaction. Manager was nice enough but somewhat nonchalant about the situation and I'm pretty sure I was not the first to discuss these issues with him last night and I think most of his staff should be dismissed and replaced with people who actually provide the type customer service expected when spending the amount of money we spend here every year.

Surely an Italian restaurant can't mess up Italian dishes. Hence my sarcasm.\n\nI wanted something quick, to-go. The venue was quite busy so I knew it'd be a little while before my order was ready. No problem. But after about 40 minutes I started getting a little antsy. I walked over to the VERY friendly young woman whom I had placed my order with. She advised it'd just be a few more minutes.\n\nShe was right, my food (I ordered the Pasta Linguine w/shrimp and scallops, and a Chicken Ceaser salad), was ready in those few minutes she mentioned. My order was totally screwed--the blame could be placed on me for not checking my food before I left, but that's not my job to know their job.\n\nMy chicken Ceaser salad didn't have any chicken. They had placed the chicken that was supposed to be on the salad on the linguine. And they also placed some vegetable soup with my order. I don't even like vegetable soup. The pasta was totally dry as well, it was supposed to have a tomato, creamy sauce but maybe mine disappeared, because it certainly wasn't anywhere to be found.\n\nI ended up at least trying to eat some of the pasta but it prematurely & intentionally went into the trash. The salad was fresh though.\n\nWith so many restaurant offerings it often hard to give a spot another shot, nothing different in this case.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a4d65451269:0x9fba3973b50c979f"}

We entered through the front and stood for several minutes before the guests at the table near the door told us to go to the other end to be seated. I didn't understand this as the sign at the front entrance said see a waitress/hostess to be seated. However no one ever came. We stood there at the back entrance several minutes before anyone even approached us, though 3 waitresses were in the dining area. Finally, Rebekah (she ended up our waitress and never told us her name, but I saw it on our ticket when I paid), asked if we wanted to be seated (Duh!) and took us to our table. She was not the friendliest, like I said, didn't introduce herself just asked our drink orders, but she seemed so unhappy to be there. Our not-so-friendly waitress was the downside to our night and why I rated 3 instead of 4 stars. On to the good stuff.\n\nWe ordered the Fiddlefish Shrimp app bc I saw a pic online and it looked delicious. IT WAS. My son ordered the pick 2---fish and shrimp. I ordered shrimp and grits. My daughter had a cheeseburger. We all enjoyed our food, except the slaw seemed to have onions and my son really disliked that and didn't eat it. He said the fried corn on the cob was just ok, but his fish was wonderful. I tried it, but not the shrimp. The shrimp and grits had chopped sausage and a very tasty cream sauce. It was really good, but different from others I have tried. Didn't try my daughter's hamburger but it was huge and looked Delish. The food was good portions for the price. It was very reasonably priced. It was a low-key casual environment and besides our waitress we had a good experience. I left her a $10 tip even though she didn't really deserve one because everyone has bad days, right? I hope Rebekah comes to work in a better mood on her next shift. I do want to mention that the waitress that brought our food was SUPER FRIENDLY. We are staying directly across the street from the restaurant in Grand Pointe and it was nice to walk to dinner.

We came here on one of our 2 nights out for dinner while we were on vacation, and what a waste. We came in last night with a party of 10. We were seated immediately on a Saturday night (first red flag).\nAfter being sat our drink orders were taken and came out great.  We ordered our meals, of which included a dozen raw oysters. After some coversation and curiosity at the table, we realized that we wouldn't have enough oysters for everyone to try so we ordered more, to which our server became visibly flustered over the fact that we were adding to our order.\nThe oysters came out with watered down horseradish sauce, aweful. How can you screw up raw oysters? This place did.\nOur meal came out a plate or 2 at a time over a 20 minute period. Some of us felt uncomfortable eating while others didnt have their food. The food runner told us that she was sorry and that some of the food orders didnt get put in. So we ate our food as it came out so it didn't go cold.\nI had fish tacos with coleslaw which was terrible. My girlfriend had chicken marsala, to which she said \"I think you make better marsala sauce.\"\nThe seafood potato that a friend got looked like the only decent food on the table. In the end no one could finish their meal and we boxed it up to possibly stomach for lunch today.\nThis review may sound a little harsh but our experience was no where close to the types of reviews this place has.

Our table was ready upon arrival , and we were seated and greeted by our server Daniel Nowosielski. Excellence in every way from hello to come again. The unique appetizer was the variety of Chargrilled Oysters. Unequivocally better than baked... Grilled to Perfection! For me, they were some of the Best of the South! We also tried the Fiddlefish Shrimp,for $7.99, they were fresh,  spicy , hot , lightly breaded and fried. Delicious! One other particular dish not to be denied is the Shrimp n Grits! Not to be denied... It rates right up there with , if not better (I won't name) than some 5 star restaurants! Happy hour features $3.00 Bushwackers. Which anywhere on the beach is $8! We  sampled a small one with 8 spoons! It was very good! $3.00 during Happy Hour. The full bar also had other specials.     The good presentation , quality, and quantity of all entrees was EXCELLENT. Comments about each can be seen under that particular picture. Finally we shared the hot Molten Fudge Brownie and ice cream dessert, and the Key Lime Pie. They were both incredible. At the  end , Chef Ashley, made time to come out and greet the guests, make sure we enjoyed our meal and was there to answer any questions and in our case, take our compliments! Again see more comments under the pictures.Excellent Food, Fellowship, fun, and new friends along with reasonable prices, accomodations clean and comfortable, parking safe & well lighted.

We started out with cheese dip because my six year old just loves cheese dip  but when they brought it out my daughter wouldn't eat anymore of it  and that's not like her it's her favorite thing. So I tried it to see  what the issue was and let me tell you the cheese dip tasted like it wasn't even cheese dip at all not even a slight taste close to cheese dip yes it looked like cheese dip but the taste not so much it was so gross I had to spit it out myself. I ordered the shrimp scewers with scallpos and rice and beans and salad well when that was brought out and I tested it I had to spit that out as well the scallops were raw and the taste / flavor of the meal didn't even taste right might have been the cooking oil or whatever seasoning they use but that was awful. My husband ordered ceviche to start out and when that was brought out the flavors of that was awful it had raw shrimp pieces in this plate it's supposed to come with shrimp but I wasn't expecting it to be all raw and the pieces of the shrimp was cut way to big for this plate it had way to much salt and when we ordered the ceviche we wasn't told or asked which type of ceviche we wanted so they just brought out whatever they wanted my husband and myself didn't like this plate at all I had to pick out all of the raw shrimp which makes over 90 percent of the plate which wasn't fun. So then lastly just to make sure we wasn't over exaggerating my husband ordered something simiple which all Mexican restaurants offer and is so easy to make which was carne asada with a side of rice and beans and side of tortillas  let's just start off by saying whatever meat that was they used couldn't have been real beef the flavor and texture of the meat was just awful and disgusting didn't even taste like beef  and the meet was so tough couldn't even cut or chew the meat. And the side of tortillas that were brought out  everyone.knows what tortillas are supposed.to look and taste like but these tortillas something was definitely wrong with them they didn't even taste like tortillas  and the color of them didn't even look right . And to sum up this my husband and myself are not picky eaters by all means we love every type of food  and will try anything and eat anything I'm American and my husband is Mexican I've been. To many different Mexican restaurants with different dishes and authenticy not to mention eating the real deal authentic Mexican food at my mom n laws house. But by far I've never been to a restaurant like this and I will never go back there oh and not to mention I had told the waiter about my scewers l plate that I didn't like them I took 3 bites and couldn't eat anymore she aasked me if I wanted to remake the dish or get something else I felt it was safer to choose something else  so I told her that she can pack it to go cause it was taking awhile and I'll be Damned soon as I get home I took one bite and about got sick gagging  had to spit the food out I ordered empanadas which should be very easy to make. But these empanadas didn't look like empanadas at all the outside which is the dough Its supposed to be a light tan color the color of the maseca/ flour. This dough was orange like a sweet potato and the shape looked like a half of a banana  on the inside they put that gross  so called cheese dip and shrimp on the inside another dish wasted I had to feed it to my dogs I just can't get over the disappointment of 5 meals and $60 later  that not even one of my dishes had even the slightest bit of hope and I hate to be blunt but I want to let people know of my experience here and would hope they not waste that amount of money on something you can't even eat. The only thing I will give credit on was the service is good  the waiter is super sweet and the sweet tea was decent. Hopefully in the future this restraunt will get some help I would hate to see it close down we need this type of restraunt in the area. So good luck", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88892432c6c4a403:0x664e688c607f8507"}

My lunch entre was about $18 before drink and tip.  I'm willing to spend that for high quality but what I was served was akin to a Captain D's drive through after a long ride home.\n\nMaybe I went on a bad day, they certainly seemed short-staffed.  To be fair, this was about 1:30PM so their A-team may have been taking a break.  My waitress was everywhere at once, doing a bang-up and dandy job.  Kudos to her.\n\nI ordered scallops.  My waitress warned me this would be plated as 4 medium-sized scallops and two sticks of asparagus.  Well, gulp, OK; I've eaten at fancier restaurants where they charged you by the amount of food they left off the plate.  I was determined to press on and gave her the go-ahead on the order.\n\nThe plate came and had one (1) plastic spoon as the sole tableware item.  Ever try to cut asparagus with a plastic spoon?  I wound up stabbing the stalk and biting off the top as I ate the mouthful.  Yeah, I could have asked for a plastic knife as well, but one must have one's standards, mustn't one?\n\nThe scallops were indeed scallops, that was about all I could say about them: not rubber, not raw, just cooked right so yeah, scallops.\n\nNow, with all this meh prelude I can finally get to the sauce served on the scallops.  I have never had anything so heavenly delightful.  It looked to have a 1-beer roux base and something that seemed fizzy as it hit the tongue.  The result is that you got a splash of favor and then the hit-and-run sauce simply disappeared.  It seemed magical.  If they'd sell just the sauce, I'd buy a case.\n\nN.B.: Don't worry, the sauce didn't have any alcohol; a 1-beer roux has been cooked long enough to drink one beer; a 6-beer roux is cooked the time to drink a full six-pack and then through the roux out just to be safe and start again.\n\nCalculating the tip was tricky.  The waitress had performed solidly and came close to offsetting the other problems.  The kitchen staff nailed cooking the scallops, the asparagus, and that nectar sauce.  However I did not want to encourage what I perceived as a poorly thought out restaurant concept.\n\nThen I decided to quit being so much of an engineer and just tacked $3.50 on the bill, then quickly left.\n\nI'll probably go back in a few months because I'd love to help these folks get this venture going.  The city needs a good, solid, really-cooked-here Cajun restaurant, I gar-on-tee, to channel Justin Wilson.  (If you're a teenager and have gotten this far down the review, you've surprised me: good on you.  Now go google Justin.)\n\ntl;dr: good restaurant idea, too expensive for what you get, not everything is fried.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862816ecf607f4b:0x11f456a3c5ae345b"}

This was the worst seafood I have ever had. We got a boil bag and there was so much butter that the seasoning wouldn\u2019t even stick to the food and you couldn\u2019t taste the seasoning. We ordered a Cajun spicy boil bag and all you could taste was butter and garlic. No Cajun in sight. I also ordered a separate order of corn and potatoes and had mild du jour sauce on it and it was corn and potatoes floating in butter with wet seasoning sitting on the top. We had the fried fish basket and it was okay compared to the rest of the food, but definitely not the best. We spent $80 on a bag of butter. I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone.\nHowever, I would give our server 5 stars. Her name was either Dez or Dee I believe. I\u2019m not 100 percent sure.

After that we got no more service. My 11 year old son after 30 min waiting had to go to the bar to ask for more tea. I ran out of water and was never asked for a refill. We finished our two pieces of fish and waited 35 min and we was never offered any more fish. When Clint finally brought the ticket, I asked him \"why was we never ask for more fish\" his answer was we are out of fish. So I ask what could he do toward the price since we was not serverd what we came to eat. That was the All you can eat. He said they was nothing. \u00a0Please have a Manger contact me.

After a few minutes, the meal went further south. Chip's steak had a distinct chemical taste to it, like it had been sprayed with oven cleaner. Sarah's had so much grit it was like they just picked it off the floor. Think that could be it? Nope. We began readying to leave at 11:30, only for Sarah and Chip to start puking, and me to have severe bowel discomfort. (I had one bite of her steak to test it, and I'm grateful for only that one.) They were sick until Sunday, vomiting and diarrhea. THIS was a $40 per plate place? THAT'S not even the end. Chip actually CALLED them to talk to the DM, and you know what the Manager told him?

We waited 15 minutes for water, the couple at the table next to us mentioned to the managament that we had been waiting for a while (because we weren't going to say anything). Darryl (management) said he'd give us 10% off for the wait. We finally ordered, the food took forever to come out (even the fried pickles appetizer took forever) and the order was wrong. I asked for Darryl's favorite which is fish in their New Orleans cream sauce on a bed of rice. I got fried flounder, with hush puppies and rice on the side and the waitress said \"that's how it comes\" despite the menu saying different. I thought okay whatever and mentioned that's not what I wanted then she said she could bring the New Orleans sauce on the side. So I said okay that's fine. I ate it, it was fine, fish was cold but the sauce was good. When the bill came she charged me 3.99 for the sauce (even though it should've came on my meal already) and there was no 10% off as Darryl said there would be. By this point I didn't even care and wanted to leave so I paid for it all. When the checks came back the waitress stood there and watched as we added tips. Literally just stood there as we were contemplating what to give.\n\nOverall, terrible experience.

Usually you order on 1 side of the building then drive around to the other side to get your food at the window. Because of this, the wait time in the drive way is extremely slow because they cook everything fresh. So you order your food, pull up to the window and wait abotu 5-10 minutes but the person behind you has to wait until you get your food before they can order because you are too close. ITS TERRIBLE.

I got very frustrated at our attempts failing and the manager kindly and professionally explained to me that they were strained with the demand and lack of staffing. We agreed to wait despite having young children. While waiting they got together and figured out a plan to seat us within just 30 minutes.

Tonight my entire view on the restaurant changed. We called the restaurant to place a To-go order, and the hostess claimed they have only one bartender who can take a to-go order and she was just to busy to call back in an hour. She is the only one who can take a To-go order? We decided to go sit at the bar and have a drink or two until we could place the order because we don\u2019t mind waiting on the food here it\u2019s just that good. The manager claims the staff can\u2019t handle it, and she won\u2019t be taking To-go order tonight. You mean to tell me that we pay that much for that food when we come down here, and you can\u2019t have a more efficient kitchen staff to take a Togo order? Hire more kitchen employees! It\u2019s simple. I\u2019ve worked in the service industry in Raleigh in a high volume restaurant, and we were always staffed well, and ready for any amount of guest that our restaurant could handle.

We were seated, the waiter brought out hushpuppies before taking our order. The waiter was very attentive and professional so no issues there. The view was great.

I didn\u2019t enjoy the tuna. I have bought better cuts of Yellow fin in Little Rock Arkansas at the grocery store. It was not seasoned at all and had a lobster sauce on it that tasted like eggs Benedict. It was a bit chewy even though lightly seared. The \u00c9touff\u00e9e was even worse. The shrimp were small and no flavor at all in the sauce.

The garlic potatoes were prepared the regular way. The salad was good, however they add the dressing to it.

We ordered food and some salads. And waited........ It took a while and the food arrived. Never got our salads. He apologized for that and then brought them as well. The salads were decent. Steaks were ok, but some were so thin that there was no way to cook them correctly to temp. Of which most were medium to medium rare. The waiter did keep our drinks full and was polite. Forgetting the salads was minor. But after two attempts to try this place.... It's just not that good. We won't be back sadly. Too pricey for it to be mediocre.\n\nWell... It was ok. Wasn't bad. But to be honest, I wanted it to be great since it is a new place. The smothered filet was very good and perfectly prepared. Ceasar salad starter was just ok. Tried the pecan bread pudding.

So many mistakes, several made more than twice, and everyone had an excuse or wanted to blame it on their other \u201cteam\u201d members.\n\nFirst, my son had to ask for sweet tea twice. Both times he was brought unsweet tea. When we complained that the second glass wasn\u2019t sweet either, she tried to act like it was my personal definition of \u201csweet\u201d that was wrong. They figured out someone neglected to actually put the sweetener in but never apologized. And then tried to charge us $3 for it when it was included in the kid\u2019s meal. They also tried to charge $3.40 for my daughter\u2019s milk that was supposed to be included AFTER being told to remove the charge. Second, my coffee that I ordered when I arrived was cold and I had to wait 10 minutes for a replacement AFTER asking for it AGAIN. Another excuse was given when asked why the coffee wasn\u2019t kept hot in the kitchen.\n\nLast, what is most upsetting is how we were made to feel when making our complaints. I know it\u2019s a fairly new restaurant at that location. I get that there are certain mistakes that happen at any restaurant (like forgetting lemons in the water which also happened tonight). What I don\u2019t get is how 3 or 4 people on their \u201cteam\u201d could make us feel like we were difficult customers when it was their repeated mistakes that led us to complain! And never once did they offer to compensate. In fact, they tried to charge us for their mistakes! I would have rather eaten at Chick-fil-A where my business is appreciated. My family will not be going back.\n\nJust so you know, this is my first time ever to leave a bad review for anyone. I don\u2019t do this as a hobby.

Naturally sirloins are a lean meat and it's difficult to keep this cut tender if not cooked rare/medium-rare. Nonetheless I did enjoy my food and the service was decent.\n\nVisit 2) Ordered the ribeye and garlic mashed potatoes (I know it's completely opposite from the last meal). The mashed potatoes were fantastic. The ribeye though, MAN! That ribeye was an excellent steak and seasoned to perfection. Ribeyes are one of the fattiest cuts and they can be cooked well done while maintaining tenderness. I got mine medium rare. I highly recommend that dish.\n\nOverall this place has a great atmosphere, the service was good, and the food has a good range.

So many mistakes, several made more than twice, and everyone had an excuse or wanted to blame it on their other \u201cteam\u201d members.\n\nFirst, my son had to ask for sweet tea twice. Both times he was brought unsweet tea. When we complained that the second glass wasn\u2019t sweet either, she tried to act like it was my personal definition of \u201csweet\u201d that was wrong. They figured out someone neglected to actually put the sweetener in but never apologized. And then tried to charge us $3 for it when it was included in the kid\u2019s meal. They also tried to charge $3.40 for my daughter\u2019s milk that was supposed to be included AFTER being told to remove the charge. Second, my coffee that I ordered when I arrived was cold and I had to wait 10 minutes for a replacement AFTER asking for it AGAIN. Another excuse was given when asked why the coffee wasn\u2019t kept hot in the kitchen.\n\nLast, what is most upsetting is how we were made to feel when making our complaints. I know it\u2019s a fairly new restaurant at that location. I get that there are certain mistakes that happen at any restaurant (like forgetting lemons in the water which also happened tonight). What I don\u2019t get is how 3 or 4 people on their \u201cteam\u201d could make us feel like we were difficult customers when it was their repeated mistakes that led us to complain! And never once did they offer to compensate. In fact, they tried to charge us for their mistakes! I would have rather eaten at Chick-fil-A where my business is appreciated. My family will not be going back.\n\nJust so you know, this is my first time ever to leave a bad review for anyone. I don\u2019t do this as a hobby. I\u2019ve never felt so disrespected at a restaurant before.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923e1ccb42077:0x85f66f6e42d882c7"}

We had issues with an overcooked steak and they offered to put another on the grill.  We denied because the one we had was good but it was not how we ordered, which was our fault we tried something new and it backfired.  Anyway, I loved it.  Patrick was a great waiter.  Atmosphere is great, decor was entertaining, and the place was clean.  I didn't go to the restrooms so I can't comment on that.  There is alot of parking but even with that said, we had to drive around looking for parking on a Sunday afternoon at 2:30pm.  My husband even said that made him want to eat there even more because it meant it was good.  We were not disappointed.  It was delicious.  No sure if there is wifi but either way, it's a restaurant enjoy the company you went with and/or the decor around.  Disconnect if you can, it's worth it.\nSide note:  I would have given 4.5 rating if I could.  Con was not so bad to give a full blank star  but I could't do that.  So it is what it is...\nCon:\nPlace was HOT!!  I am usually cold natured and it was hot even for me.  My husband couldn't take off any more layers.  Our waiter was sweating and so were other people around us.  It was a bit disgusting.  Our waiter was a good sport though.\nFINAL VERDICT:\nWE WILL BE BACK.  REALLY ENJOYED IT!

I never had to wait on a drink and he was polite and I could tell he knew what he was doing. He is the sole reason they even got 2 Stars. The food.....Oh the food. It was absolutely terrible. It was my wife's birthday and she really wanted to go here. It was my first time. I ordered some lobster tails she had the ultimate feast. When I got my food a $40 meal, my lobster was like a rubber band ball it was disgusting. I could barely rip it apart with my fingers. It could literally bounce. I had to cut it with a steak knife. I should have been fluffy, buttery and savory. I know it's not an ocean side restaurant but with a name like Red lobster I figured the lobster would be decent. I was so let down. Please make sure your cooks can at the most cook lobster. How is a place named Red Lobster serving such terribly cooked lobster. Your chef clearly doesn't belong at your store.  My in-laws ordered fish and chips. The fish had to have been dipped and breaded 15 times before it hit the fryer. When they finished they had almost an entire plate of batter that they picked and pealed off their fish. I was so embarrassed taking them here. My kids ordered the sirloin steak, they claimed to like it but they are kids, kids like anything. The steaks looked pretty beaten up and over cooked. Thank you Arthur for offering to replace the meal with a better cooked one,( \"which I turned down\" ) and thank you for being a fantastic server! I know that's a tough job. You were worth the $50 tip I left you. But Red Lobster I beg you to hire some efficient chefs and focus on training your cooks how to properly prepare lobster, steak and even a simple fish and chips. Find people who want to be there and who care weather their food is good. I'm not asking you to fire this person that cooked our food tonight but at the very least spend hours retraining them to cook your food the way it should be. I can't imagine how much money your company wastes throwing away food that was cooked terribly. I'm not sure I'll ever go to another Red lobster again which stinks because my wife raved about it, but it was just upsetting. I hope anyone who reads this doesn't have the same experience. I work too had for my $$$ to have someone not care how their food turns out. I don't blame red Lobster as I don't know their current situation but they have to know that their cook is not very good.

I was taken aback and perhaps this is on me for simply not getting up and walking out or bringing it up real time. This whole situation we all find ourselves in is awkward for all involved.  However, it is not on the customer's shoulders to enforce state rules. I just don't get it since it seemed most if not all of the other employees had appropriate facial covering.  Rationally I can tell myself that the exposure risk was probably low. On the other hand should I be having to go through that because a restaurant/employee couldn't be respectful of their customers?\n\nUpdate 3 weeks later:  Although I never received anything other than a canned response on Yelp in spite of contacting them via their website, I made a visit last night in hopes of finding improvement and dinning. Well, incredulously, it was worse!  The State's mask orders are still in effect. Opening the door and entering this time even the host doesn't have a mask and the first server we see - no mask. We turned and walked out.  You have to ask yourself what kind of corporate/management approach so blatantly violates an obvious and easily implementable order. And if they have this disregard about the things you can see then what about those things you can't even during non-pandemic times.\n\nThis can be done correctly. I've witnessed it at many other both local and chain establishments.

It all started when I asked for water, no lemon, and get brought back water with lemon. Not that big of a deal, it happens, simple mistake. I very foolishly paid for our food at the table tablet early as we were a bit short on time and wanted to leave as soon as we were done. Our food arrived and the steak was over done like shoe leather, the lobster tail was like eating a rubber band, and the side of fries was missing. The shrimp was at least alright. Our waitress was not seen again for 20+ minutes. She finally came back around, we mentioned some issues, and she vanished again. After several minutes, we caught some other waitress nearby and asked for a manager. After another 15+  minutes of no manager nor our waitress being seen, we left as we simply had no more time to waste dealing with this ordeal, we were already late at this point. We didn't get all the ordered food and half of what we did get wasn't even edible.

The Red Lobster there literally has the same qualities, defects, pros and cons as the one here in Huntsville, AL. Both lack in cleanliness. At peak hours the bathrooms become disgusting.

There\u2019s nothing fresh about it. I have nothing negative to say regarding the staff. They seem like they work extremely hard. Sometimes it seems like they\u2019re just holding on. Much respect.

The server was very obviously annoyed that we were in her section.

Any time she came to the table she barely spoke beyond necessity, we would thank her for various things and she did not once acknowledge us. She brought half of my order out and I suppose my face expressed a question and she stared at me... the appropriate thing to say is, \" Can I get you anything else?\" I finally said, \"Is the soup coming out now or later?\" Her reply? \"No, it's coming out now...\" and a brisk walk away.

We ate here because we got a giftcard for Christmas and it turned out to be a big mistake. We ordered an appetizer, soup, salad, and dinner entree. Our appetizer came out and the waiter set it down on the table and quickly walked away as I was trying to tell him he didn't give us any plates or forks. So from the get go I was irritated. We tried to flag several people down and were ignored each time. So after getting no help we started eating our shrimp appetizer with our hands. Finally a different server helped us and got us some forks. But still no plates. Our appetizer was gone by the time our original waiter finally came back to the table and mumbled \"I shoulda been brought these out to ya\" at me and finally got us plates and biscuits. Then our dinner entrees were brought out by yet another different server. We tried to ask for our soup and salad but she turned and walked away so quickly I don't think she heard me. We had nearly finished our dinner entrees by the time our original server came to check on us, and instead of apologizing for the mistake just said \"yeah I know\" when I said we had ordered a soup and salad. If you know, then where is my food? We both finished our dinner entrees before he brought our soup and salad out and by that point we were already full. I paid $8 for a bowl of soup I didn't even eat. The manager comped one of our meals but I will never go back there after that experience.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1550685082849, "text": "Hi,Caitlyn Hoppe.

I Ordered food online was late to make sure the food would be ready (9:52) the food wasnt brought out until after 10:15. No problem.... Things Happen...but then the biscuits were burned (paid for these extra biscuits, I wish I could attach pics) asked for new biscuits and decided to order a chilled shot of patron. The bartender PUTS ICE WATER IN GLASS (in a poor attempt to chill the glass) and pours the warm shot in the glass. This is not chilled, strike 2. Asked for a lime after we had to wait to get her to turn and we were the only 2 people at the bar besides the bartender. The bartender LITERALLY brought a lime with her BARE HANDS and said here you go. No napkin, no tooth pick, straight hand to hand contact. Clearly she should have not been working the bar. Didn't even want the drink just wanted to kill time until the food came back that they screwed up. Paid for the drink and she says have a good one. WHERE ARE MY BISCUITS???? she NEVER brought them back out. I said forget it and left with the burned biscuits which are inedible. This is the LAST time I will visit this red lobster. Until they revamp and retrain their staff... They have lost 2 customers. I mean the carpet even stinks here, you can smell it reeking and there is so much dust your allergies with not like you.

I've gone to Red Lobster numerous times, too many too count. I have had many instances of unsatisfactory service (the latest being 5 minutes ago) but I give them chances because they are one of a few seafood restaurants in this area. And I love my snow crab. I Ordered food online was late to make sure the food would be ready (9:52) the food wasnt brought out until after 10:15. No problem.... Things Happen...but then the biscuits were burned (paid for these extra biscuits, I wish I could attach pics) asked for new biscuits and decided to order a chilled shot of patron. The bartender PUTS ICE WATER IN GLASS (in a poor attempt to chill the glass) and pours the warm shot in the glass. This is not chilled, strike 2. Asked for a lime after we had to wait to get her to turn and we were the only 2 people at the bar besides the bartender. The bartender LITERALLY brought a lime with her BARE HANDS and said here you go. No napkin, no tooth pick, straight hand to hand contact. Clearly she should have not been working the bar. Didn't even want the drink just wanted to kill time until the food came back that they screwed up. Paid for the drink and she says have a good one. WHERE ARE MY BISCUITS???? she NEVER brought them back out. I said forget it and left with the burned biscuits which are inedible. This is the LAST time I will visit this red lobster. Until they revamp and retrain their staff... They have lost 2 customers. I mean the carpet even stinks here, you can smell it reeking and there is so much dust your allergies with not like you. It's a shame you spend all this money for subpar quality. Shame on you Red Lobster!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b4242329453:0xaf13e57fcb31a1d7"}

He is 85 and a veteran from World War II, Vietnam, and Korea. He retired to   Huntsville almost 30 years ago. He has been going to the Red Lobster there for 30 years.  We had our meal and he insisted on paying the bill. He handed me his wallet which had 3 crisp 50 dollars bills inside. He asked to take two and put them in with the bill.... he wanted to pay the 47 dollar bill and get change to tip the waiter.  I removed the two bills and he ask that i lay them side by side in the envelope so that they did not get stuck together and so the waiter could see there were two and not just one. The lunch was slow taking almost two hours to complete so he finally asked if we could make our way to the car while my wife stayed and waited for the change.  i brought him to the car and we waited for another 20 minutes but my wife did not come.  Finally she did come out and was blown away.  The waiter came back by the table and through the plastic bill holder on the table and said there was no bill or money inside and that he was reprinting the bill for my wife to pay again. I went back into the restaurant to talk to the waiter, but he wouldn't even talk he left for a bit and the manager came out to talk to me. He said that i must have dropped the money and the bill and asked if it was in my pockets. I explained that I knew for sure the money was there because my dad had asked be to take the money from his wallet and to lay the bills next to each other so not to have a mis understanding and that i had closed the plastic envelope before is left and my wife had not even touched it.. only the waiter had touched it.  The manager did not seem to know what to do, but said if i left my number he would call if it turned up. It was a bad situation for everyone. The lady;s sitting across from us leaned over to my wife and said ' we saw you pay the bill\"...  I finally decided that having my dad at the restaurant for 2 and a half hours was too long for him to be up so I just told them to keep our money and i left.  I guess i was hoping that the manager would say here is your 40 dollars change you asked for and we will find this mis-placed bill and work it out... i understand it is a bad situation but my dad now will never go back after 30 years and is telling everyone he sees about the lost of  his money.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b4242329453:0xaf13e57fcb31a1d7"}

The service was very poor (despite not being particularly busy, in the ~2 hours of our being there, the server only voluntarily visited our table 3-4 times).\n\nAs for the meal itself, the iced tea I was served tasted funny. The dish I ordered had a choice of New York Strip or Filet Mignon and, despite not indicating a preference, the server never asked me which I\u2019d like. The Caesar salad had maybe 3-5 shavings of parmesan on it and the lettuce was rather limp and not crisp. The shrimp scampi was fine; it tasted of garlic and not much else. The wood-grilled shrimp was meh; it was lackluster in terms of flavor, due in part to its complete lack of seasoning. In general everything was pretty bland.The \u201csteamed\u201d broccoli was instead maybe half-steamed, i.e. it was half-raw, therefore rather crunchy. And even the ~$11 Lobster Tail was over-cooked, dry, and bland (also it wasn\u2019t served with butter).\n\nBased on this experience, I would recommend going to a different location or, if you find that the quality does not improve elsewhere, pick a different restaurant altogether. 3/10.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b4242329453:0xaf13e57fcb31a1d7"}

There weren't that many people there. Stopped at the hostess stand and she was on the phone talking to someone about a lost article. No big deal so we waited several minutes while she finished her phone conversation. There was also a male employee who was stacking menus who just ignored us. The female hostess gets off the phone and seats us. We look through the menu and make our selections. I realized that we still had not even been greeted even though 3 other tables had been seated after us and were approached by their waiters and were given drinks and biscuits. Still no waiter even though there were two waiters standing by our booth right behind my husband. Our booth was at the end so they were just a couple of feet from us and I am sure that they could hear our conversation wondering why we didn't have a waiter. At that point I pulled out my cellphone to keep track of the time. We had been sitting there for almost fifteen minutes when a female waiter passed us and said our waiter would be there in just a minute. A few minutes more went by before a female waiter who had an order of food to deliver paused at our table and asked if we knew what we wanted to drink. I told her that we had been sitting there for quite some time and already knew what we wanted to order to eat. She said okay that she would be right back and would take good care of us. I saw her deliver the food and then go to another table to take their order. My husband and I just looked at each other and got up and left. I can't believe that there were waiters standing around and nobody had waited on us in all that time. It was inexcusable and I will be sure to let everyone we know what poor service we were given.

This time, Niadja, our waitress was caring; but she gave us dinner pricing when our visit was at lunchtime. Is it legal to charge dinner prices at lunch claiming that the sizes are larger without notice or consent from the customer? We never got the towelettes we requested until the end, either.  In Japan, for instance, a nice hot cloth towel is afforded to the patrons prior to eating. On the same note, Japanese peeps don\u2019t wear shoes indoors either so why would we expect for an American restaurant to provide us hand wipes prior to eating? Our seats were too close together, so we moved. But, the table we moved to wobbled and caused damages to us as well as to our belongings. Thomas, the manager was rude and indifferent. Niadja was to apply a $4.00 coupon which led to our finding out about the pricing deceit. Our hot-spot was being used; but Thomas wouldn't let us use their DSL to get the $4.00 coupon from our Trash. Thank GOD $4.00 won't break us since GOD has given us so much. It's the principal of the matter, though. On our visit previously, a man came in seeking stuff and it was not until he started to bother other guests did management ask him to leave. Plus $1000 was stolen from an acquaintance of ours from her purse while she and her friends were eating there a while ago. On second thought, the people there are very unhappy, the waitresses never smile and purposely catch your eye only to give you a mean look.

I had the fried seafood platter, which came with a mix of their best sellers, and I was beyond disappointed. The fry itself has absolutely no flavor and/or seasoning, so all of the seafood tasted incredibly bland. The side item I ordered, beans and rice, was the only thing on my platter that had any flavor, but it wasn't anything to write home about. My wife had the jalape\u00f1o burger, which was also majorly lacking in flavor as well (definitely a frozen patty), but I kind of expected that, being that this is a seafood joint. The 2 best things about the experience was the service and the dessert, funnel cake fries. Im giving it 2 stars because the food wasn't served raw, or spoiled, but I will never go back.

Our drinks were not served for a long time and the appetizer we ordered took very long. We had 7 small children with us and thankfully they were extremely patient but for some reason it took a very long time for our food to come out. We noticed that other people had received food prior to us and the server made it clear to us that he knew we had been waiting a long time. Not sure if our order was misplaced or not put in but we were not given any explanation. By the time our food came out we were missing multiple items and sides. My husband had to go into the bar area for a refill of his drink and I had to go in another time to get tartar sauce and cocktail sauce which we asked for but never came out. We were never checked on by the wait staff. We finally received our final two meals but at that point it had been over 1.5 hours and we needed to leave so we did not get to enjoy the food. The waiter offered to bring a box and mentioned the meals would not be included on the check. As you can imagine at this point, we did not receive a box nor did we get the check. This was even after asking for the check multiple times. My brother finally went in to discuss the check so we could get going. One of the waitresses called a manager to discuss the situation but the manager only took 10% off the bill because they said we received all of our meals. This didn\u2019t even cover the two meals that were so late we were not able to eat nor take home because they did not give us a box. In my opinion, the \u201csolution\u201d was seriously lacking given the situation. This is by far the worst service I have ever received at a restaurant and the only time I have not left a tip. Every time we asked for something it felt like it was never going to come unless we took action by tracking someone down. The only reason I wrote this review was because of the lack of follow through by management to come up with a solution to a terrible experience.

I had the salad with cajun/creole spiced balsamic vinaigrette, and that is probably the best dressing I've ever had. The garlic bread toast was delicious.

It wasn't crowded since we were early enough to beat the dinner rush. I ordered the crab and shrimp quesadillas. Unfortunately there was a good amount of crab and shrimp shell in the dish. Difficult to enjoy something that you were tentative to try to chew. Hubs ordered the royal reds. Disappointed that they were cooked insufficiently so that they couldn't be peeled properly. He said they were bland as well.  On the upside,  our daughter thoroughly enjoyed her blackened mahi mahi. However, she had to ask for butter for her baked potato.  I gave her the sour cream I had for the quesadillas.  Slow service and poor food prep left our experience lacking. The 2 star rating I'm giving is simply explained by 2 of the 3 entrees being less than favorable. High prices. Food that lacked several essentials. Poor service.

Had tried to get in on other visits to Gulf Shores, but it was always too busy.  The atmosphere was laid back, not super loud music or t-shirts.  Ordered the baked oysters with parm-cheese and garlic butter and they were awesome (wish I had some now).  Then had shrimp and grits (good).  Son had popcorn shrimp(good)  Wife had seafood casserole (fair).  Service was outstanding.  Prices were about average for the area.  I will definitely be back and recommend the oysters here.  4 stars only because I save the 5-star rating for the perfect meal experience.  Maybe on the next trip.\n\nUPDATE:  Ate at Neptunes again (Dec.31), around 1pm, the place was packed, but we were able to get a booth.  Service was a bit slow, but looked like they were a bit overwhelmed.  I ordered the corn and crab bisque (which I had never had before) and instantly added it to my favorite foods list.  Wish I had cancelled the crab and shrimp quesidilla cause it was a disappointment after that bisque.  Wife ordered the Greek Fish and Salad and she said it was excellent.\nI visit Gulf Shores 3-4 times a year.  I will be back for more Corn and Crab Bisque!\nUPDATE:  Another visit 12/26/17  arrived shortly after they opened, so not busy at all.  Ordered Corn and Crab Bisque (5-stars again) as well as soft-shell crab sandwich (excellent).  Food and service was 5-star!  Can't wait to go back and order this again!

I ordered it and it was the absolute worst etouffee I've ever tasted.  Not sure what happened but somebody dropped the ball on the new recipe.  It tasted like they used Campbell's soup out of the can as their base and just dumped in some sea food in.  I could only get about 1/2 of it down and I was really hungry.  We also ordered the fried mushrooms and they were soggy and very undercooked.  We asked the mushrooms to be removed from our bill, which they were.  My wife was only able to eat a few bites of her meal.  She ordered the baked spinach Florentine tilapia which was extremely fishy due to the brown meat being left on the bottom half of the fish.  One of my kids burgers had a section that appeared to be undercooked as the meat was still red.\n\nAll in all, not a good experience for us at all.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1434125367069, "text": "Thank you, Lorrie for reaching out to us and letting us know about your recent experience.

There was so much grease in the bag and on the food I was afraid to try it!
