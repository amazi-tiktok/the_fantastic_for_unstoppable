I received one of their bouquets as a gift from my son who lives in Huntsville.  When I visited him this past June, I wanted to go to their store and arrange another bouquet for my home and have it shipped.  They were so friendly, helpful and talented in helping me arrange the perfect bouquet and having it shipped to my home in California.  Upon my return home, I received my package and unfortunately, the Post Office was a little rough with my package and damaged some of the flowers.  Anthony at Paper Petals assured me they would take care of me and that they did!  They replaced the damaged flowers in a very timely manner with great communication throughout the process.  Awesome customer service and I will not hesitate to use them again.  Their flowers are incredible, life like and beautiful.  Best part, I don't have to water or worry about dying.
