Jordan and Randall showed up before they were supposed to be there! They discovered that the supply line on my Diesel motor home was cracked. It wasn\u2019t repairable on the side of the road. It had to be replaced.They called SEVERAL tow truck companies to bring our coach to their shop for service. They were so good that they disconnected our trailer that we tow our car in and brought it to their shop after making sure the tow truck made it to us. Cummins didn\u2019t have the part in stock and no local shops had it either. Luckily , David Burns from Pirtek Huntsville was able to fabricate a connection tube and we were able to go on our way. This was a VERY stressful situation and luckily we were fortunate enough to find really good and honest people that got us on our way!

Great staff and professional work. A++", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1621439693561, "text": "Thank you for the glowing recommendation.

As you all know, many businesses won't even take the time to contact a lost customer.  Marc not only reached out but followed up with us to confirm we were taken care of, even though we had to pull our truck.  He made no excuses and stated that the communication errors were taken seriously and will be addressed.  Ultimately our repair had to been completed elsewhere but Williams still followed up and showed accountability.  I would be comfortable continuing to use W.W. Williams as I have at various locations.  However, I would advise that you seek assistance from Management if communication is lacking.  I wish we had done so sooner.\n\nBe aware that every experience isn't the same.  We had a truck towed in to this location due to the good reviews and communication with the tech on our call.  We were told that our truck would be looked at first thing the following day.  Day 1, truck not looked at, we were told someone went home sick.  This was after we called to get an update.  We were told it would be looked at the following a.m.\nDay 2,  I we provided the potential location of the issue after speaking with our home mechanic.  We asked how pics could be sent to get things rolling.  We emailed a pic of the part and diagnostic which was from a recent repair of another unit with the same problem.  We followed back up after not hearing anything mid day.  The truck was not looked at by mid-day we were told this time 2 people were out.\nDay 3, Calls and face to face contact again resulted in no action, the truck was not looked at.\nDay 4, We went to location to try to nail down a realistic expectation of when the truck would be touched.  We were told they would try by late afternoon but could not say for sure, this came from advisement with the shop supervisor.\n\nThis has been the worst experience we have had with a WW Williams which we use often locally.  Our confidence in towing the truck was due to the quality of work and professionalism we experienced in the past.  This location has not met the standard exemplified by the WW Williams name.  Truitt has not followed up with us nor provided a realistic time table to address the misinformation provided prior to the town in.  We understand staff issues occur, especially in the current pandemic climate.  However, there is no excuse for not providing updates nor treating all customers with the same level of priority.  The business is open, there are technicians present, and trucks being worked on.  Yet, we have not been serviced nor updated with an expected diagnostic date.  The cost of being out of service has been extended due to the poor service standard.  Beware before taking your truck here.  Sitting and no communication is not a reasonable expectation and very costly in trucking.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1610485566188, "text": "Thank you so much for updating this and we do hope that we can do better for you in the future!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888e82757537d6dd:0x704f734fd94a65f7"}

AAA got us in touch with W. W. Williams. I described our problem over the phone to W. W. Williams. The front seal was leaking badly, our transmission was functioning normally as long as it had fluid in it, however was leaking too rapidly to drive. The mechanic on call nearly insisted that he come out and have a look at it on site, however I told him there was nothing that could be done on the side of the road. We decided we would spend the night on the side of the road and have it towed to W. W. Williams the next day.\n\nThe next day we had the RV towed to W. W. Williams. The mechanic on call insisted that we let him come out and put the RV inside the gates, even though we were not worried about it as it was a very industrial area. The mechanic came out and was nice and spent about 10 minutes installing the driveshaft since it had been removed by the towing company. We again explained and showed him the problem and he assured us that it would be no big deal for them to repair. The shop was very nice and appeared to be well equipped. The mechanic estimated 8-10 hours labor for the repair. He waited another 20 minutes for our ride home to arrive and we left.\n\nA few days later W. W. Williams called to say that they could not repair our RV. They said that since it was leaking from the front seal, they wouldn't have the tooling. They charged $600 to tell us this, which is very upsetting because I told them that was what the problem was from square one and several more times after that. They justified their price by a minimum 4 hour charge for the guy to meet us to put it behind the gate, and then a inspection fee on top of that to glance underneath the camper. Their seasoned mechanic should have been able to make that call right away, and charging for an inspection is ridiculous as this could and should have been done by the mechanic while we were paying for his 4hr service call, he had plenty of time for that as he was with us for an hour or less. The tooling is also a very lame excuse.\n\nThis company clearly took advantage of us, and figured they could make an easy profit without having to touch our RV. Life is expensive enough as it is, we don't need to gouge each other. I am really upset that I told them our problem from the very beginning and they still put us through all of this.\ncall right awaycl", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e82757537d6dd:0x704f734fd94a65f7"}

NOT TODAY!!! So I did a Google search and came across HESCO, the reviews were great, I spoke with Joe Molina and he arranged to have it tower to HESCO \"DESPITE being in the middle of changing locations\", they got it in checked it out, started it up, \"No white smoke from the tail pipe\", turned out to be the water pump, THAT's ALL. I can't recommend Joe Molina and the guys at HESCO Automotive highly enough, they are highly professional, extremely efficient, keep you informed at every juncture of the process, and very reasonable.

Was given a 12 month warranty on engine but at 14 months and 127,000 miles later my engine went down. I had it towed to a shop for inspection of fault. Mechanic told and showed me the two head bolts nearest the fire wall that were not torqued properly. I paid their price for rebuild but did not receive in return what I paid for because head bolts that are \u201cproperly \u201c torqued do not just back off.

Dropped off on 2/11. Initially returned even worse on 2/26 (left car to be fixed) and picked up on 3/1)\n2) Transmission cooler was damaged by mechanic in the process of fixing a dripping leak in the O ring/transmission line  (initial problem). Mechanic CLAMIED that the damage to the transmission cooler WAS the cause of the initial problem (dripping leak in transmission line).\n3) Husband wanted to fix the transmission cooler himself. Mechanic said that there was a small leak in the cooler. Picture below tells a different story. Leak went from a few drops every few minutes to gushing all over the engine with the entire fluid contents of the transmission basin on the ground within a minute.\n4) Had to pay for full price for parts/labor for their \"mistake\" to my transmission cooler  (that is no longer manufactured) on top of the parts/cost to fix the initial problem.\n5) Mechanic took my orange funnel from my engine and left trash in my engine.\n6) Mechanic also damaged my engine somehow. The engine made a horrible high pitched noise when I turned on my car (3/2) this morning to go to work.\n\nI NOW have to take the car back to this mechanic so they can AGAIN fix the damage THEY have caused to my vehicle. Unacceptable as my husband has known the owner for 20+ years and the company he works for takes their company vehicles here for maintenance and repair.

I do not have any record of any transaction and we keep great records.  On the off chance that this is a real review under a pseudonym we keep excellent records and have a good warranty policy and any engine repair we did would be covered by warranty.   I would be happy to sit down with you and go over what was replaced and what warranty options you have.  Of course this would require this to be a legitimate review that has actually done business with us. Having only 3 reviews all of them one star and hundreds if not thousands of miles apart seems suspicious.  In the future I would recommend a more convincing fake name and maybe use a different profile for reviews in New York  and Alabama when you are leaving fictitious reviews."}, "gmap_id": "0x886284fc24084d2d:0x43d078e4239c6b69"}
