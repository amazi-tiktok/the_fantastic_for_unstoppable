However, as I communicated to you in our conversation last night which you neglected to include in your response, I have waited for a return call to my non-urgent issue way longer than 24-48 hours. My first follow-up appointment where the biopsy was taken was on June 13th, where I was told by a clinician that I would know the results before I left for vacation. I called for results initially 1 or 2 days before I left town June 23rd. I then called back on the 28th, where I was told once again that I would be called back before close of business, yet I was not. I was never informed by any of your staff that I spoke with (both clinical and non-clinical - I have spoken with both) of the 10-14 day timeframe for biopsy results. In speaking with you last night is the first I have heard of the 10-14 day waiting period for results and the results not being discussed until the scheduled follow-up visit. Perhaps some form of training refresher would be useful in ensuring that all of the staff, both clinical and non-clinical are relaying uniform information and setting the proper expectations to the patients.

But the nurse who welcomed me in apologized for that and said it\u2019s not normal. Then I had a little incident with my baby who was with me and everyone was so kind and understanding and helpful! And then the main reason I was there was for my acne and the doctor prescribed me things that were safe while breastfeeding. She explained what was going on, too. I\u2019m about 2 weeks in with her suggestions and my skin has significantly improved. I will definitely continue to come here for my skin health needs.\n\nUpdate: I have been to this location 3 times now and each time I have had an hour + wait. So the first time was not an isolated experience. Today is July 13th, 2020. Jefferson county has put a message out saying masks are required to help stop the spread until there is a vaccine. Unfortunately, this location is subject to this \u201crequirement\u201d and after asking if I had to even with the recent announcement that the WHO has come out and said in a press conference that \u201cit is rare for an asymptomatic person to spread COVID. \u201c So now we are in an era where counties and the businesses in them will pander to fear that is unfounded as of today with the death rate of Covid well below 1%. We will see what the future holds for Covid. If it mutates into a more dangerous strand, I will re-assess my frustration with businesses like this. But in the mean time, I will speak my mind and spread truth about what Covid is. I\u2019m sick and tired of being forced to wear a mask that will spike my carbon dioxide intake that has been proven to lower my immune system along with many other side effects. And all in the name of waiting for a vaccine that will still not have a long term trial study under its belt to make sure that there are not any severe long term side effects. And in case you are not aware, there are plenty of vaccines that have side effects that do not show up right away. One example of this is thimerosal (Mercury) was removed or reduced from vaccine use. Heck, Johnson and Johnson just settled with plaintiffs who experienced many different cancers decades after the use of JJ baby powder. BABY POWDER!! So I have serious concern with an inoculation that will most likely be required, like the masks are, to \u201cstop the spread\u201d (of a disease that is recording low death rates) that will not have long term testing to make sure that we aren\u2019t doing more harm than good. But that\u2019s my two cents.  I will most likely end up moving my derm needs to an office that not only can figure out how to not have hour waits for their patients but is brave enough to look the stats and facts in the face and take a stand against the current overstep we are seeing all over the country.\n\nAll in all, the people here are very kind, and the doctor I\u2019ve been seeing seriously helped with my adult acne. So  I will give them 4 stars. I recongize it\u2019s hard to stand against the grain. But the hour plus waits have been very hard since I bring my infant with me to these appointments.\n\nLastly, they also require hand sanitizer and temp check. These are things that do not bother me personally, and I still complied with all that was asked of me.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888602aacce729c9:0x135bb203d88babc6"}

It was my first appointment with Cahaba Dermatology the day I went it must have been a busy day for them, I waited that day about 45 min and people\nwere getting called into see her while I was still sitting out in the waiting room it ended up being me & one other lady that day which she was there before I was , I finally got called in and left her sitting there.\nI met Dr. Groysman and we proceeded with my appointment she biopsied a place on my ear I was having problems with.  My results came back and everything was okay. I still have problems\nwith my ear from time to time was the reason I made the 2nd appointment \u2013 fast forward to May 2018 and I called and made an appointment with her Nurse Practitioner& was told when I called in that I had a balance from 2016 that would have to be paid \u2013 Im not sure about their billing department but I didn\u2019t know about the balance & I told her that I would pay it. If I had known about a past due  and call to make an appointment is that someone that is trying not to pay? So we made the appointment went in today 6/7 my appointment was at 11:00 I get to my appointment she collects my co-pay I go sit down and she calls me back to the front desk and proceeds to tell me that she collected the co-pay not realizing there was the balance due and I would need to pay or I\ncouldnt go thru with my  appointment. I told her I couldn\u2019t pay it all today \u2013 that I could pay it tomorrow and she said she would have to speak with someone in billing \u2013 so this other young lady  comes out and says basically the same thing the other one  did with the exception -she said that someone had called me and left a voice mail for me & did I not get the voice mail? & on that VW stated I had to pay this. Which I said no  & I told her the same thing  - I get paid tomorrow and I would pay it then -  she says I couldn\u2019t keep the appointment if I didn\u2019t pay today. So I had to leave.   This review is not about whether I got to keep my appointment or not, its not about the balance I owe, its about how people are treated, all this was handled out at the front desk instead of asking me to step to the side, step into the 2nd  young ladies office , or go stand out front and wait for the police to arrive to hand cuff me is the way I felt  Just as the 1st appointment  was not good , my 2nd time there was even worse. I was so humiliated that other people could hear what was going on. I owe the money - but I would rather other people not know that I owe that money. I wish I would have paid more attention to the girls names, but I do remember faces. I had not intentions of not paying the balance due.\n\nMy cousin goes to Dr. Groysman - he has all great things to say about her as a Doctor & as a person. He thinks very highly of her & her practice. He is the reason I made the 2nd appointment -he said I should try again.\nMy cousin's name is Don Amick. He was also surprised that I couldn't keep my appointment today. BTW they took my co-pay and took it off my past due amount. My balance was 125.00 and not I only owe 95.00. That's right 95.00 not 200.00, not 300.00, not 500.00. It was 125.00. I've never written a review, while I know this is a long review - I just couldn't let this go.

After about a year Dr finally came to the room to examine her because after months of antibiotics, creams and numerous other meds her face stayed the same. She personally promised my daughter it would get better with another prescriptions.... you can imagine what it means for a teenager! Several months later still no change. I felt like my daughter was a Guinie pig! So the last resort was Accutane and after a week my daughter could not move or get out of bed that's how poisonous it was. We stopped it immediately and I took her to another Dr who diagnosed her w policystic ovaries... all she needed was a simple blood test. her face is a lot better now. I don't know how much harm all the meds she took for months did to her body. I'm just furious that nobody even suggested a blood test, they just treated the face, not the whole body. Hope our bad experience will help someone.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888602aacce729c9:0x135bb203d88babc6"}
