Covid shutdowns last year and his baby brother having to have heart surgery in Palo Alto the year prior. We told him that this year, for the big 1-0, he can go all out. Whatever he wanted. As many people, whatever cake, whatever venue. He searched for weeks online as to what he wanted to do. In January, he visited this place with a friend and came home raving about it. He found his spot. He invited a bunch of people, picked out the perfect cake and we reserved our time. When we got there, the two young men working it were EXTREMELY helpful in getting everyone set up, explained everything great and got us ready to roll. The barn for the party was more than big enough to host everyone in a welcoming environment and the paintball was excellent. Pricing was great, and even when we had to purchase more ammo, they were on top of it and it was reasonably priced. We will definitely be back and I would STRONGLY recommend this for anyone looking for a birthday party venue!!!

While one employee was checking everyone's paintball gun we were all sweating profusely in the heat. If this is something that is necessary which I can understand, then for a large group have more than one employee checking the guns to hurry the process. Everyone was complaining. Three people's paintball guns, including my own, had some sort of fault so we waited an extended amount of time to get replacements and checked again. Shade in that area would be a huge plus.\nAnother negative was all the busted paintballs in the pavilion area. I understand that happens but maybe someone could come through with a broom or provide one for guests to use. Kids and dogs had paint all over them.\nLastly the lack of a proper restroom.

Got a woodsball field and a speedball/airball field that keeps things mixed up a bit. The staff and the refs are great and nice and helpful.\n\nHad an issue with my paintball marker, and a person that doesn't even work there, but shows up often helped me get it working great. That's just the kind of people that show up there. Makes for a great atmosphere and a good time at Bob's.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb1500a7eb437:0xd277b9b95b024199"}
