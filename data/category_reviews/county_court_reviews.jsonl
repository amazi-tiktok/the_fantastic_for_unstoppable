Alabama tells people what they can and cannot do but also refuses to help pay for what they control.

After traveling for years I have learned that this so-called \"Courthouse\" is a freaking JOKE! Actually they are the ONLY courthouse I have ever seen that had a constantly leaky roof, everyone else fixes their roofs. With as much money as Mobile Co Courts steal from people you would think they could afford repairs instead of more buckets to places under the leaks. Not only that, everything they do is pretty much incorrect. The way they keep records, they way they handle contact with out of state lawyers, they way they keep false charges on peoples records when the cases were thrown out, the way they communicate with all the other Mobile Co court system branches like probation and traffic violations all of it is a mess. They are so disorganized that even they mix stuff up causing issues for everyone else. Ive seen innocent people's lives ruined because Mobile Co Courts will charge people with false crimes, take money, arrest, jail for weeks, when trial comes the case is dropped but they leave the charges pinned on to those innocent people's records. When people want those fake charges removed the state of Alabama will allow them to hire an attorney and correct everything starting at a tiny fee of $10,000. If you're innocent and Mobile pulls fake charges on you, then you are better off fleeing the country because Mobile with try to ruin your life and steal every single penny you have for years on end.\nTHATS JUST INNOCENT PEOPLE\nThey let the real criminals go free. Repeat offender of 25+ times for drug charges thrift and everything else? Oh you're good, you will be home to see your woman by weekend in time to commit more crimes over the weekend, get picked up again on Monday, then back out again that same week. Oh your a politician's kid? Then you can be arrested 8 times in 5 years for drug charges then just be sent off to Colorado when you can smoke legally.\nJudges, lawyers, DA, sheriffs, Mobile PD, all of them are just terrible and it all leads back to this one location full of many offices and people who hate their lives.\nNot only is Alabama ranked #1 for worst state in the US, Mobile should be listed as #1 worst city, #1 most corrupt cops, #1 most corrupt government (haha Im laughing at you Roy Moore and Sandy Stimpson), #1 worst health care, #1 most greedy city, #1 worst compassionate city, and so on. Shall I start making the trophies?\nIf you live in Mobile and have not got caught in the web of the Court there, leave, just leave. If you dont get out now something will change and Mobile will try to own you for the rest of their lives (not yours, you can die and they can care less).\nPS: Ive never been arrested, never had a court date, never had a lawyer, never had a ticket, never had a charge on my record, nothing. My history is 100% squeaky clean. I just know that courthouse that well.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fd0f2594a1f:0xef30cb144dc3f8cd"}
