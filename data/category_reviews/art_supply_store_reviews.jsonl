I had purchased a gorgeous fixer upper corner cabinet with carved wood curved front and curved doors made of leaded glass.  Little did I know the difficulty of finding someone to replace broken panes!  Then I met Josh...he is the owner of the company and he changed everything.  He created beautiful curved pieces, took apart and replaced all the lead between the glass and then reinstalled it back onto the doors.  He even gave me choices if i wanted to update a color on certain sections.  He had great attention to detail, took his time to get it done the right way and was worth every penny.
