I brought the car back in on Monday the 4th and told them the service engine light came on and something under the car was rattling. I was told by the owners son that he didnt know anything about standard shift cars and they would not be responsible for anything wrong with it. Almost 3 weeks later the car starts running hot. When my husband got to me to check it out he opened up the radiator to find that it is full of J.B block seal he runs over 80 gallons of water through the radiator trying to clean it out to no avail. We replaced the thermostat that was so coroded with block seal it was rusted up. I called and left a message with Pierce auto sales telling them that the car was running hot and because someone was trying to cover up a cracked block or blown head gasket and there was so much block seal in the radiator and engine that I didn't know if the car was going to make it home and that I really needed someone to call me back because I had no way to get it home. I never recieved a call back.It cost me $60 to rent a car dolly to drag it home. Now the car came with an outside warranty but because \"whoever\" filled the motor up with block seal to hide a major problem until they could find an idiot \"me\" to take the car off of there hands the warranty will not cover the car. So now I have a blown up car sitting in my yard that I drove less then a month and repo men knocking on my door because they want there car back and still after all this time I have yet to recieve a call from anyone at Pierce Auto Sales.  I recieved more help and sympathy from the repo man in 10 minutes then I have from Pierce in 2 months. I paid $1500 down for a car that didn't even last until the first payment was due. I dont bash people or businesses but i have tried every other way to get them to talk to me. I just want my money back so I can get a car that runs and won't leave me on the side of the road less then a month after purchase.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a56497104639d:0x842e60c3c94517bb"}

He said ownership was changing and his dad was going to be leaving and to give him a couple weeks and he would give us an awesome deal on it which was fine because we needed to sell our vehicle to purchase that one. After 2 weeks we had a buyer for ours and was told to call the following week and set up time to do the deal on the vehicle I wanted so bad. Well I called 2 days ago and left message for him and told them it was about the blazer, she said ok he will call you back. Never heard anything. My husband calls up there today and he isn't in so my husband asked if blazer was still there. Guy says no we sold it back last week.\ud83d\ude21 Well good damn thing we told guy that was buying ours that we couldn't do deal until the day we was able to get other one.
