However they did mentioned that my car needed 2 more repairs and quoted me $563 for one and $440 for the other. The $440 repair was for a hose that was damaged while they were changing the pump. The hose cost $40 from the BMW dealership and they said it would be 4 hours of labor, which didn't sound right for a hose. I called 3 other independent shops and was quoted $130 for the same repair parts and labor. The $563 was for a hood latch and cable, the parts at dealer are $80. Yvonne also said it would be 4 hours labor. I called several independent shops and was quoted $200 for parts and labor. I guess 4 is there magic number.

I was told to come back that Saturday; May 2nd so that a mechanic can look at it. I went that Saturday and had the lights repaired. That same Saturday night my entire driver side taillight went out. I knew they were closed Sunday but I called just in case I could leave a voicemail to give them a heads up about me coming in on Monday; May 4th regarding the taillight. May 4th they tried to repair the issue however ALL of my lights started malfunctioning. They tell me to come back that Wednesday; May 6th so that their mechanic can look at it. They gave me a work order stating that they are working on diagnosing the problem in case I got pulled over for no brake lights, reverse lights, headlights or turn signal. They proceeded to pull my vehicle through the shop and when I got inside it I noticed an airbag sensor that was not there before. I asked John if he could have it cleared out and he said that he would have the mechanic do it on Wednesday and that it should be no problem. I then attempted to turn my AC on (which was on while they were working on it but John said that he had turned it off) but the AC wouldn't come on. I get out of my vehicle and ask John if he could have the code cleared because I felt that it was messing with the operation of my AC and it's been 90\u00b0 lately. John then tells another employee named Skyler to come clear the code however the code does not clear. During this time the owner comes and introduces himself and asked me and another customer if we were being tended to, the other customer stated that he was already tended to then I stated that I was being tended to and pointed to my vehicle. The owner then leaves to never return again. They then proceeded to turn the vehicle off in hopes of resetting it however at that point the vehicle would no longer start. John then told me that I needed to leave and that I could return Wednesday to have their mechanic look at it but at this point, I had no dash lights, interior lights, exterior lights, no AC, no radio, no power steering, and sensors going off. The vehicle would no longer start up. I started to get upset, John claims I brought my vehicle in like that which is 100% untrue, I drove it in with no issues other than the driver taillight but I was unable to drive it away. I defended myself and vehicle over that statement then John pulled their doors closed while several employees including a manager/ assistant manager watched. I ended up having to call the police (because I had no clue what else I could or should do). The shop then claimed that I had a bad battery and that was the result of all of this however when they put a brand new battery in there it did NOT fix all the problems, the vehicle did start up and it did have headlights but that was it. After me refusing to tow my vehicle away and almost 2 hours later Mitch (I believe the manager or assistant manager) then offered to let the vehicle stay and have their mechanic look at it on Wednesday May 6th. May 6th, I went to go pick up my vehicle and John was working the front desk, they tried to hand me my keys in the lot hoping I would just leave immediately but when I asked for a full detail work order on what all had been done to my vehicle, I received attitude and was told that I should be happy that they fixed it for free and that they don't document all the work that's done on vehicles. I sat up there until I received a work order (over 30mins later) but when I received the \"work order\" it stated, \"gave customer a battery and replaced 10 fuse\". I told the mechanic that that was not a detailed work order but I was told that was all I was going to get. I do not believe that they would have fixed the damages their employee, John, caused to my vehicle if I did not have 4years of documentation from the one and only other mechanic I've been to, video footage from my own vehicle and computer readings from my Vivint smart security proving the condition of my vehicle.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e9b414671032d:0x29e4a24dd6f16484"}

NOT TODAY!!! So I did a Google search and came across HESCO, the reviews were great, I spoke with Joe Molina and he arranged to have it tower to HESCO \"DESPITE being in the middle of changing locations\", they got it in checked it out, started it up, \"No white smoke from the tail pipe\", turned out to be the water pump, THAT's ALL. I can't recommend Joe Molina and the guys at HESCO Automotive highly enough, they are highly professional, extremely efficient, keep you informed at every juncture of the process, and very reasonable.

So I called them up. For the same repair they were going to have to charge close to $900. It was better but still hurt. Took my car up and waited. Got a call from Mike and he said that he wanted to check over the car before I spent all that money. He discovered what the dealership didn't, that something was just unplugged. Only charged the diagnostic fee! He could have charged me fully, but he and this business have been ethical. I take my car to them anytime I have issues, and they've been precise and sure every time.

Had been told by two regular customers that they do really good work. The office attendant (Mike, I think was his name), was straight-forward, respectful, patient, gave me a phone quote, had the work done timely, with the final bill ending up being a little less than the original quote, even after adding the tow bill & taxes. It was a very welcomed change from the experience I'd had at another local shop I'd been referred to (but later warned about from several other past customers) where I repeatedly had to endure rudeness from the know-it-all mechanic, immediate breakdowns from same issue I'd just paid to have repaired, & ignored voicemails asking to speak to the owner. Guthrie's owner followed-up the very next day to make sure everything was going well with the work on my car. I would much rather pay for a job well done the first time than a little less and keep breaking down, having my car towed, finding another way to work at the last minute to keep my job, and then constantly being talked down to in person & over the phone (while the owner justifies it as him \"being from New York\",... to which I reminded them both that he's now n ALABAMA, & that cocky attitude won't do here, especially with me!!... 3 different types of repairs... never fixed after being told they were!).

Firstly my car was not correctly diagnosed I spent over 500$ here and still having the same issue. When I picked it up drove toward Wal-Mart it immediately got hot so the looked at it again right before closing then i leave again same thing finally I park in publix to let it cool down. Again in the morning I take it back. Again they check it send me on my way 30 minutes later car hot again. I call and was pretty much brushed off and was told that they fixed what they thought was the problem. So as of right now I've been charged all this money car still running hot n they acting like it's cool I came in with 1 problem which has still not to be resolved. I will I'm so disappointed I travel alot for work and I'm in Alabama all alone no family I came here expecting a1 service seeing that it's connected to a napa but to spend this type of money and my issue not be fixed I'm so disappointed.

Purchased a used vehicle from this dealership in May of 2020. I was sold when I was told that my vehicle had an Auto Nation warranty of \"90 days or 4,000 miles.\" Sounds great doesn't it? Well after being hurried along in signing paperwork so the vehicle could be mine I was very happy with my purchase. However, less than a month later, and still well within my \"warranty\" coverage period I got a Christmas tree of lights on my dashboard. I was told to take it to its dealership and from there I could then make the claim. When I called to make the claim, Auto Nation's warranty service said there was no vehicle with my VIN in the system. I then called the manager there who told me, \"I never signed any contract stating I had a warranty and it doesn't matter what I was told because it isn't in writing.\" I realized the manager was right about this however, I was being told one thing then they intentionally rushed me through signing paperwork so that I wouldn't catch that I never signed anything for my \"warranty\".

I know it's all to protect them from liability suits. What ever happened to trust, recommendations, honest opinions? Every answer to every question seemed will rehearsed. Two days later my alternator goes out! Maybe a coincidence, but it seems like everyone I put my trust in the professionals, things start going wrong with my car. Don't trust mechanics, lawyers, maintenance individuals, had one of them tell me, \"if we fix it too well, we'll be out of a job, always have to leave something for another day.\" There's no real honest people in this area, not anymore. Bureaucrats have got their fingers into everything. Law suits are the \"American Way!\" So you can't really blame them to avoid taking responsibility for their actions. I know what my part costs, they were going to charge me nearly $500 in labor to loosen and tighten bout 6 bolts? A little extreme, they did an estimate but I never got to see it, I asked to see the defective part, but was given the excuse we would have to put it back on the lift. Since it wasn't on the lift, they had no plans to fix it!\n\nAllen from Phenix Firestone called, his only concern was why I was so critical of him. I thought that was clear, but this was the second time I took this vehicle there for the same issue, the first time I was told nothing was wrong with it. In any case in order to resolve the problem Allen stated, \"we're not working in your cars anymore!\" I guess I hurt his feelings?\n\nI used to love taking a vehicle to Phenix Firestone, always felt like they were looking out for me, always trusted them!

There I was told that it would be at least three hours to change my tire.  They referred me to this location--8873 Highway 72, Huntsville--several miles away.\n\nUpon entering I was greeted by the General Manager, Tyler Thurmond, who assessed the tire, and notified me that they did not have my tire in stock.  (They did have it in stock at the first place, but they had never checked.)  Tyler told me that it would take an hour and a half to get the tire there, but that once they had it, it could be put on very quickly.\n\nTyler had the delivery of the tire expedited for us, because we mentioned that we had to get up north by a set time.  The entire visit took about 45 minutes, including the delivery of the tire.\n\nThank you so much, Tyler Thurmond, for your exceptional customer service.

Here is what happened.  Called got a verbal quote of $139-189 per axle for a brake job with rotor's turned which is fair they are just below the dealer which was $200 per axle.  Went the next day to have services done to my car.  Before they began work they inspected it and determine I needed pads all the way and rotor's on the rear and a brake fluid exchange.  Estimate price was over $700.  I declined the brake fluid exchange and they offered some \"competitive\" discounts brought my total down to about $580.  Still more than it should be.  Asked for a printed estimate when I saw the estimate I knew something was up.  They had part numbers and prices on the estimate.  Quick Google search confirmed the part numbers and prices from a local part supply store that they would be getting the parts from.  They are marking up parts pricing 100+%.  Industry standard is between 10-25%.  Then they told me that the estimate was nearly at cost and if he went any lower he would lose his job.  Nothing but scam and scare tactics were used with me and I didn't take the bait.  Tried to email the address on the general managers card it wouldn't ever go through.  Called the corporate office gave them the info and the pictures I have attached here and they said a regional manager would get back with me still have not heard from that person either.
