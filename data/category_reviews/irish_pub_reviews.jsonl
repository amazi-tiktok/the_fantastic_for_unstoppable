All I've heard about for 2 months before coming here is about the burgers at Callaghan's and how amazing they are and it's his tradition to eat there as soon as he arrives in Mobile.\n\nThe location was great. To get there you drive through local streets with homes not stores. It was tucked nicely into a neighborhood. That gave it a nice authentic neighborhood bar(/family restaurant*) feel.\n\nWe went for lunch around 11:15 and I expected to be one of the first tables to sit since they open at 11:00. Nope! When we walked in they already had a steady flow of patrons coming in and full tables.\n\nBut getting down to business and what you really need to know:\n\n**THE BURGERS WERE AMAZING!**\n\nI let my friend guide me as to what I should get. It was very simple though, he said order the bacon cheese burger with everything and pick your cheese. I got it with cheddar. And I have to say I was hesitant about having mustard on the burger but i took his advice and it was so perfect. It blended the flavors so well. There was so much flavor, and I don't mean seasoning, I mean, my first bite and every one after was such a mouth watering burst of juicy burger goodness.  My friend also had the chicken club which he recommends as well. And their sweet tea was great, just the right amount of sweet with plenty of tea flavor.\n\nThe burgers do not come with Fries but you have options for a few items. I tried the coleslaw, I personally like a creamier coleslaw but their's was still very good.\n\nI absolutely will be returning for another burger before I leave.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1hjpnrToROoAkULWirIZFXZuJZEG6cse841gW=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4e33b659a3ad:0x14b5eadc618134a"}
