I detailed my experience with them below.....\n\n2015:  I took my vehicle to them to have a trailer hitch installed.  I scheduled an appointment and dropped my vehicle off at 7:00 am on my way to work and was assured that it would be completed by 4:00 pm when I came back.  It was almost 7:00 pm before they were complete, so I sat there for 3 hours waiting.  When they were complete they told me that I would need to come back and get a ball for the hitch since they didn't have an that fit the hitch in stock.  This defeated the purpose of needing a hitch before the weekend, but I borrowed a ball from a neighbor.  When I hooked the trailer up, I noticed the lights were not coming on. Something was wrong with the electrical.\n\n3 days later I called and they said to come in and pick up the ball.  When I arrived they said that they were mistaken and did not have one.  I mentioned that the electrical was faulty, but they could not look at it that day since the trailer hitch guy was not there.\n\n1 month later I called(they never called me back) and was told they had a ball that fit and I picked it up.  Once again, they said no one was there to look at my electrical issue.\n\nA few months later I called to make an appointment to have the hitch fixed.  Their phone disconnected me three times and I gave up after wasting 30 minutes on hold.\n\nWhen I go by the location and finally make an appointment, i'm told it will cost me upwards of $100 to have it repaired since it only had a 30 day warranty.  They said there was no record of me having ever mentioned the issue before.\n\nOverall, this location has awful customer service.  More should have been done to fix my issues instead of kicking the can down the road until they could say it was out of warranty.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889197e84af1c55:0xf5fc42f4ad17911e"}

Now when I moved from this area I picked up my UHaul from Quality Used Automotive and I would not recommend picking up from that location but I had to unfortunately and the UHaul equipment dolly and pads were not in the truck and it was incredibly dirty. So I took the truck and drove only 4 minutes back to this initial UHaul location where I had another amazing experience. The General Manager, Clay Reed JR, met me in the store and I told him what was going on. He helped me get a dolly and pads as well as offered to clean my truck for me free of charge.

It was such a bad experience that I will never use U-Haul again.  On Dec. 30, 2015 I reserved a pickup truck for rental the following day at the location at 3713 Governor's Drive in Huntsville.  I was scheduled to pick this vehicle up at 11:30am.  I showed up a few minutes early and the location was empty.  A few minutes later, Tammy, the General Manager comes in from the back and informs me that my reservation has been moved to the location across town at 4400 University Drive in Huntsville.  I needed to have the truck in a certain location to pick up some furniture by noon of that day and this was already placing me behind schedule considering that I was never notified in advance of this change.  A few minutes later I arrive at the location on University Drive to attempt my pick up.  While waiting in a line of 5 people, I start to become stressed because it is already 11:45am.  The General Manager at this location, Paulette Boehlke, informs me that it doesn't matter when I was scheduled to pick up this truck.  She states, that I will have to wait in line while she continues taking peoples orders and then going outside to fit them for their truck.  I am a bit in a panic because this is not what I expected considering that I had reserved the truck for a specific pick up time for a reason.  I finally left the location because I could not see it fit to pay U-Haul for the poor job they had done with having my reservation ready for pick up that morning.  All this especially considering they have a sign in office guaranteeing that they will have the truck you order at the right location at the right time available for you.  I cancelled my order with U-Haul and was able to reserve a truck with another moving company.  Tammy, from the first location called while I was on the way to pick up the new truck and tried to get me to come by and pick up a truck that was now there at her location on Governor's Drive.  She claimed that the reason I couldn't pick up the truck at the scheduled time and scheduled location was because the call center had double booked that time.  The pick up that was sitting outside her location when I was their earlier, she said, had been left by someone that had not left their keys with her.  Either way, the whole thing was crap.

I had to call and get someone at 1:30 to pick me up after the installation couldn't be completed in time and had to get another ride back to your establishment. During the install a bracket was removed that was not part of the written instructions. Three factory bolts were removed from that bracket and only one was reinstalled. I picked the bolts up off the floor. The manager Mr. Hall ended up giving me $50 off the price but, made sure the shop got the full install money thus rewarding themselves for a job poorly done. He accused me of raising my voice and I apologized telling him I am hard or hearing and wear hearing aids showing him one. He then stated he was done talking with me and tried to charge me for priority shipping when another clerk had removed the shipping because of late delivery. I informed him of that and he decided he'd best call his employee at home to verify. So, more time waiting... I am very unhappy with your operation. It took an hour and a half to finally settle with Mr. Hall and get out the door with him going into his office and refusing to come out after it had been finished and was waiting on me to pick it up...

It was such a bad experience that I will never use U-Haul again.  On Dec. 30, 2015 I reserved a pickup truck for rental the following day at the location at 3713 Governor's Drive in Huntsville.  I was scheduled to pick this vehicle up at 11:30am.  I showed up a few minutes early and the location was empty.  A few minutes later, Tammy, the General Manager comes in from the back and informs me that my reservation has been moved to the location across town at 4400 University Drive in Huntsville.  I needed to have the truck in a certain location to pick up some furniture by noon of that day and this was already placing me behind schedule considering that I was never notified in advance of this change.  A few minutes later I arrive at the location on University Drive to attempt my pick up.  While waiting in a line of 5 people, I start to become stressed because it is already 11:45am.  The General Manager at this location, Paulette Boehlke, informs me that it doesn't matter when I was scheduled to pick up this truck.  She states, that I will have to wait in line while she continues taking peoples orders and then going outside to fit them for their truck.  I am a bit in a panic because this is not what I expected considering that I had reserved the truck for a specific pick up time for a reason.  I finally left the location because I could not see it fit to pay U-Haul for the poor job they had done with having my reservation ready for pick up that morning.  All this especially considering they have a sign in office guaranteeing that they will have the truck you order at the right location at the right time available for you.  I cancelled my order with U-Haul and was able to reserve a truck with another moving company.  Tammy, from the first location called while I was on the way to pick up the new truck and tried to get me to come by and pick up a truck that was now there at her location on Governor's Drive.  She claimed that the reason I couldn't pick up the truck at the scheduled time and scheduled location was because the call center had double booked that time.  The pick up that was sitting outside her location when I was their earlier, she said, had been left by someone that had not left their keys with her.  Either way, the whole thing was crap.

Today, I took my vehicle in for a tow hitch at 8am.  It was only supposed to take a few hours.  It ended up taking them until 2pm to finish it, because they kept taking the installer off the job to handle the crowd.  You should have a separation of concerns when running a business.  That installer should've been able to focus on his work instead of having constant distractions.  In that time, he managed to somehow run my battery dead.  After I finally hooked a 5x8 trailer up, I found out that the hitch was slanted towards the ground, making it impossible to use a trailer.  I ended up having to have the movers who were moving most of my stuff take everything, but the stuff they couldn't take (i.e. aerosols, propane, gas cans, etc) which caused my move to take longer and cost more.  My muffler also was rattling against the hitch which was very annoying.  I finally got to my destination and had the hitch uninstalled, and and a full refund was made.  However, the installer at my new destination found damages made to my vehicle from the initial install.  So, now I\"m going to have to take it to my dealership for repairs, which will be getting paid for by UHaul's claim agency.  If only all the time that I put into this whole ordeal could be compensated too!\n\nMy 2nd issue was that my calls to check the status were being routed to their corporate office who kept claiming they were unable to give any status on my install, and they discouraged me from directing my call to the location, claiming they probably wouldn't answer.  Corporate customer service sucks basically.  What they should've done was figure out what was going on with it instead of just leaving me out in the dark, which basically forced me to drive back down there and wait on it.\n\nAlso, don't buy boxes from these people.  In order to get the \"discounted\" rate, you have to buy them by the bundle.  I put quotes on \"discounted\", because Home Depot sells them individually for the same price...actually, cheaper.  Plus you can get an additional 5% discount if you have a Home Depot credit card.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b6847403349:0x2e03344eb6e6a43e"}

We have had several challenges with the existing company over the past few years. We felt that it was just easier to stay with them than to go through all the hassle of changing. We had two owed tanks and one rental. Yesterday after not getting phone calls returned I had contacted Thompson because we were out of gas to our house generator. This was no fault of ours I contacted them 2 months ago when I believe we were out and was told if the Gauge showed full no need to get gas. Sunday we lost power. Our generator would not start after checking it was out of gas as we thought. When I called Thompson gas I was told it would be 5 days before they could come out. This meant that we will be without a generator and our food would spoil that was purchased to shelter in place for covid-19. The long-term effect would be devastating. It's already difficult now to buy food and you're limited on how much you can buy. I negotiated explained what happened they said it would be three days and the earliest I could do but would talk to her manager and see if there was any way they could get out earlier. I waited all day no return call I called them back and they said that it would be tomorrow being Tuesday before they can try to work me in. This was their fault. In addition they were going to charge me more than what previously was quoted a few months ago I was told would be a locked in price. The girl corrected herself was very friendly but the fact is is a loyal customer the manager was not willing to correct an issue that was theirs in a timely manner.I Googled and called the first one that popped up which was Suburban Gas. They acted quickly at 4:55 p.m. and had someone out here that morning and was going to deliver gas shortly after the inspection before any time Thompson could offer. Everyone was beyond friendly respectful and we're very proactive at Suburban  and I wasn't even existing customer. They recognized I was in a dire situation and found a way to assist. Matt the gentleman that came out to do the inspection was super friendly and the very first thing he did was check the tank and verify there were no issues other than the gauge appear to be stuck reading incorrectly and even Rock the tank and said it's empty. I had spoken with Anita in the office she did a wonderful job the first time I called. She escalated it to Brad and they coordinated to find a way to help someone that wasn't even their customer. Everybody in the office that I've called has been amazingly friendly and supportive. I am moving all my business to Suburban Propane because of their actions. I'm very thankful and appreciative that they have such amazing staff. Thank you Suburban propane for taking care of us. I gave Thompson Gas 2 stars. 1 because the lady in the office was friendly and tried within what I believe to be her allowable parameters. When I had called back was told it was escalated and the manager said would try to work in next day. The manager did call back after I asked to speak with him and said could get me worked in 1st thing next day but I had already called Suburban and they made that commitment already to me first call. The manager only response was I'm sorry that's typically not how we do business. Sorry but this was not first time had it been other issues and then not coming out 2 months ago and then this I would have maybe given them the chance.

Hunter K. was knowledgeable, patient, and extremely helpful in getting the reservation squared away again and even helped add an extra day to my reservation so I could get the truck immediately.\n\n11/10 recommend this store because of the employees Megan, Hunter K., and Hugh.\n\nI say everything here to show you how much of a hassle it can be to reserve online.

The mileage out should be the odometer mileage when the truck is handed to the customer, not the mileage that may be on their records when the truck was returned by a previous customer.\n\nAlso, unknown to me, there was a dolly in the back that I had not even reserved.  I saw it only when I opened the back to load my stuff.  I was surprised, to say the least and wondered if I will be billed for it. Guess what?  I was billed for it even though I had not used it. And how did he know that I had used it? When I called this morning, he told me that the plastic tab that was attached to the dolly was broken. When I try to assure him that I had not even touched the dolly, his response was rude and something like \"we have a lot of customers who say they didn't use the dolly but they actually did.\" In short, he had just accused me of lying!  My question is: why was the dolly even there in the first place? I had not reserved it!  And if there was something in the back of the truck, he should have opened the back and shown it to me.  I would have asked for the dolly to be taken out. Further, how do I know that tab wasn't broken before the truck keys were handed to me? So, this was a clear case of an attempt to cheat a customer.  I wonder how many people this store rep has cheated.  Next time, if I ever rent again from this location (which I very much doubt) or any other, I will make certain to open the back and have them remove any extra stuff I did not order!\n\nAny attempts at talking with the rep over the phone was met with rude, curt, and insulting responses.

This information was not even gathered until they second attempt to receive help from the desk, for the first time we spoke to their general manager, Tavon Scott, who was at the moment in no mood to do his job. As soon as he saw that our last name did not come up in the computer, he looked at us as if we were crazy and then proceeded to profusely rid himself of all blame (\"it was the call center\") and yelled at us for becoming frustrated at the fact that we seemingly had no storage. He was completely unwilling to make up for the fault of his company in any capacity and did nothing but sit there and act annoyed at our frustration. I dropped by one last time to use the restroom and I could hear them quoting us and laughing at our situation until they saw I had come in. I was so disgusted at their attitude about their job that I marched up to the desk to get Mr. Scott's full name to write in this report, to which he replied, laughing \"You can just look up my name if you need it.\" I replied \"take care\" and he replied \"oh I will take care\" and continued to murmur something under his breath to the amusement of his coworkers. I've never held an official job to this date, but if I talked half as rudely to any customer as they did to us, I'd expect to be canned on the spot, and that's exactly what I wish upon this man, Mr. Scott. I'd equate this crew to a group of shiftless, gawky teenagers who are too immature to own up to their own shortcomings.
