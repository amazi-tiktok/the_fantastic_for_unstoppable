It did seem as if the pizzas didn't have much toppings, co suffering the other locations put WAY more toppings.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1531370413559, "text": "Customer satisfaction is our most important value!

I ordered the veggie calzone and added pepperoni. This is one of my favorite dishes there. When it came, the outside was cooked perfectly, but the pepperoni was raw and cold. Not room temperature, refrigerator cold. I told my server and she asked if I wanted it remade. I did. The second one came to the table in the same condition. At this point, I was done. I told her to just take it back and I would go. She brought the manager over,  who said yes it was cold, thier oven must not be working properly and took it off the bill and then presented me with a check for my soda.\nI have been in the service industry all my life and I have never seen a customer charged for a fountain drink when thier order was botched. I rarely complain in restaurants because I understand how demanding the job is and I tip well because I appreciate good service.  Charging me 2.69 for a soda I drank a quarter of after failing to cook my order twice seems cheap and passive agressive. I know that fountain drinks are considered a throwaway and if I had ordered an alcoholic drink I would not have thought twice about paying for it. This just seems like poor customer service and almost punitive. I am very unhappy with the Mellow for the first time.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1568920524445, "text": "Oh no!

Let me start by saying the food was great, as expected from eating at this chain in other locations. The food deserves 5 stars in my book and I'm very picky about pizza. Now for the bad. The restaurant was packed , understandably due to it just opening however, with over 50 tables you would think they would have more parking. We ended up parking in a dirt lot between it's parking lot and the place next to it. We spent between 2 and 2 and a half hours there a hour waiting for our pizza and 15 minutes eating. The remainder of the 45 minutes spent waiting for whatever we requested from our waitress who was slow and forgetful. She also brought my 3 yr old sons drink in a bar glass then proceeded to say she wasn't sure if it could be transferred to a to go cup but was willing to bring me a cup to pour it in. After 30 minutes of waiting and asking multiple times I gave up and asked a different waitress for a cup. She didn't take our menus till the end of the meal. She took our orders and we waited 15minutes  for them after already being their and seated for a minimum of 10minutes she brought out the appetizers and still had not brought any of us the water we asked for when we first sat down. This is not acceptable service in my book. I will be eating their again bc the food was so good however I will be requesting a different server if sat in her section.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1493270679443, "text": "Hey Kameron!

We asked our server if our pizza was ready and she went to check. She brought out a large pizza and placed it on the table. I looked at it and said, that's not our pizza. She took it back. My wife at this point was pretty frustrated because we were both pretty hungry. Almost 5 mins later she brings out our pizza. She explained that they put our pizza into a to-go box and got it mixed up with someone else's order. I can tell the pizza was probably sitting in the to-go box awhile because our pizza didn't taste fresh. At this point, we were not going to wait longer to get another fresh pizza. The food was good but they need to work on the kitchen and service of this restaurant. No one wants to wait almost an hour for pizza.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1526266393570, "text": "Jeff we are so sorry to hear about your most recent experience with us!

We do offer a unique assortment of pizza combinations, but do not fret, you do have the option to build your own pizza as well! Please be aware that we encourage creativity, and you are able to build a pizza HOWEVER you'd like! So if a pizza that we have already designed does not sound appetizing to you, we are perfectly ok with you building your own :) As of now a pizza buffet is not something that we offer, due to our standard of baking. Every order is made to order, and having them on a buffet would only make them less fresh, less up to our standards, and more soggy.

The waitress, however never checked on us again after we asked to speak to the manager... until we had already eaten and my husband had to get up to go to the bar and have his drink refilled. At that time he asked for the check and a box for the leftovers. After this is when the waitress finally came by and oblivious to everything that had happened in the past 30 minutes, asked if we were still doing alright.. this is the 2nd bad visit we have had there. I am not sure we will go back to this location.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e856ea43b91d5:0x8137de843540196c"}

I\u2019ve had the misfortune of frequenting this establishment 7 times since it opened up. And every single time was extremely negative. The first problem is every single time I\u2019ve went was during a week day around 2-3 in the afternoon and the place was nearly empty and we were seated and promptly forgotten about every single time I\u2019ve ever been there. I could possibly understand that if there was ever any more than 3-4 other couples in the establishment besides us but no the place has been absolutely almost empty every single time (of the 7) I\u2019ve been there. The last time was around a couple of years ago. I went with my cousins wife and we ordered some of that humus bread she ordered a small pizza I ordered a sandwich. Well the humus came a couple minutes later her pizza came but my sandwich never did so I wound up eating the humus. When we were ready to go (waiter was nowhere to be found as usual there in a empty restaurant) I stood up and said hey we decided we do not want the sandwich can we just get the check for the rest we need to go. Well they tried to rapidly make the sandwich and give it to me with me telling them I did not want it. I didn\u2019t want it because we were going several places and I didn\u2019t want the food rotting and stinking up my car. Then they shoved the unwanted sandwich at me basically forcing me to take it and the waiter proceeded to start saying don\u2019t blame him cause he isn\u2019t the cook. Now he said to this to me and I worked in the restaurant business for 15 years and I knew they were having the chit chat hour and possibly doing side work. I told him well you should have asked the cook why your entire order wasn\u2019t up. In a nutshell he actually started cussing me etc. Me and my my cousins wife left the childish pathetic situation threw the sandwich in the nearest garbage can and I\u2019ve never went back to that establishment again and never will. From the 7 incidents I\u2019ve had there frankly I\u2019m amazed they have any clientele at all. I should have written this a long time ago but I had a lot of things going on in life and just now got the opportunity when the subject was brought back up in a conversation last night. This is NOT a fake review before the owner wants to chime in and claim so I\u2019ll happily provide my receipts. If I could give this establishment negative stars I would. I do not recommend this establishment to anyone of any age group for any reason. Unfortunately this is the second negative review I\u2019ve felt obligated to give and I\u2019m upset with myself for not addressing the last incident back when it happened", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e856ea43b91d5:0x8137de843540196c"}

I wasn't.\n- Second, they were understaffed so we had to awkwardly stand there and wait while one guy did at least 4 jobs (poor guy).\n- Finally, the food. Very underwhelmed. Very meh.\nWe got a large meaty meat pizza (or whatever it's called). There was barely any meat on it and the meat that was on it was placed only in the center of the pizza. There was barely any sauce (i'm a sauce person) and the pizza tasted very bland. A frozen pizza would have been so much better. For that price, I could have gotten much more and much better pizza from any of the other pizza places.\nThe hummus was fine. It came in a plastic container with some veggies. It was only about 2 spoonfuls, but I didn't pay much for it so I didn't expect much.\n\nOverall, just a very underwhelming, disappointing, and meh experience.

This is a review specifically for the female manager on shift 9 March 2019 at 6:30 pm.  She was very rude and I figured I should share.\n\nI ordered pizza for take out and went to pick it up.  I got to the restaurant about 6:30 and went to the bar area to pick it up.  The lady behind the bar asked my name and immediately told me my pizza wasn't ready yet.  I said that's fine and sat where I could see the take out orders sitting on top of the oven.  I noticed a take out order matching my size boxes sitting there, but figured they weren't mine, as that's what the lady said.  None the less, I happened to notice they weren't going anywhere and began to figure they were mine.  After 20 mins of waiting, the lady went and picked up those very same boxes from on top of the oven and brought them to me.  I mentioned that they had been sitting there since before she told me that my order wasn't ready and that I wasnt pleased with that.\n\nShe began to tell me I was a liar and that it was impossible.  That I had confused those boxes with other take out.  She then told me to feel how hot the pizzas were and I mentioned that they were warm because they had been sitting on top of the oven for the last 20 minutes.  It was quite a weird feeling to be told i was crazy and listen to several complete lies about my pizza that i had been watching for the last 20 mins.  long story short, it was a super uncomfortable situation and the lying manager should probably be disciplined.\n\nI will continue to frequent mellow mushroom, cause the pizza is delicous.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e856ea43b91d5:0x8137de843540196c"}

This is a review specifically for the female manager on shift 9 March 2019 at 6:30 pm.  She was very rude and I figured I should share.\n\nI ordered pizza for take out and went to pick it up.  I got to the restaurant about 6:30 and went to the bar area to pick it up.  The lady behind the bar asked my name and immediately told me my pizza wasn't ready yet.  I said that's fine and sat where I could see the take out orders sitting on top of the oven.  I noticed a take out order matching my size boxes sitting there, but figured they weren't mine, as that's what the lady said.  None the less, I happened to notice they weren't going anywhere and began to figure they were mine.  After 20 mins of waiting, the lady went and picked up those very same boxes from on top of the oven and brought them to me.  I mentioned that they had been sitting there since before she told me that my order wasn't ready and that I wasnt pleased with that.\n\nShe began to tell me I was a liar and that it was impossible.  That I had confused those boxes with other take out.  She then told me to feel how hot the pizzas were and I mentioned that they were warm because they had been sitting on top of the oven for the last 20 minutes.  It was quite a weird feeling to be told i was crazy and listen to several complete lies about my pizza that i had been watching for the last 20 mins.  long story short, it was a super uncomfortable situation and the lying manager should probably be disciplined.\n\nI will continue to frequent mellow mushroom, cause the pizza is delicous.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e856ea43b91d5:0x8137de843540196c"}

Then another 15 minutes for me to get a salad. Now the waitress did not bring me my salad the hostess did. Who also was very nice to bring me silverware. Ok then my son got his little cheese pizza and apples. That meal was perfect. My salad wasnt even great. I had the wrong lettuce. Ok 30 minutes later my daughter gets her pretzel dippers and they were almost as big as her and hard as all get out. You could have broken a glass with it. Ok about another 30-35 minutes past and my husband still has not gotten his calzone. It finally arrives and its cold. The waitress has not even checked on us since we got our drinks. The hostess again was nice enough to bring him silverware after we tried to get the attention of our server for about 10 minutes. They said they would take off my daughters meal bc it was an aweful meal and she didnt even get her apple slices then they still charge us for it.
