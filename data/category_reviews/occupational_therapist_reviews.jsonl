In many instances, those with handicaps and disabilities are unable to work with little to no income to support themselves or rely on their families for support; families in these situations are already under intense financial strain. Additionally, based on my conversation, test results are not given until a year long payment plan concludes (imagine an oncologist having this policy). A year, when it comes to a child\u2019s development, is a long time to wait.\n\nAfter hearing the pricing, I had no interest in further details or clarification; however, I suppose it\u2019s a good thing they offer a payment plan, if you\u2019re willing to pay their high fees and do not want to take out a personal loan. It is likely they do not contract with Medicaid because the state will not pay anywhere close to their high fees.\n\nI have no interest in supporting a clinic more interested in lining their pockets than genuinely helping the community in which they aim to serve.

You would of thought that anyone in their right mind wanting to only pay the 25 co-pay would not want each session to start costing over $130 dollars a session.\n\nI know I am partly to blame, but I just stopped paying waiting for the insurance to clear on the sessions, UN-knowing she was not even running it on Insurance.

Being an active person who likes to hike and lives on a farm, I immediately went to the doctor and was referred for physical therapy. It didn't help at all. Over the last five years, I have tried different doctors who have referred me to different physical therapists, with no change in pain level.\nAt my last doctor's appointment, my primary doctor asked if anything was bothering me and I told him I still had plantar fasciitis. We talked through my experience and he suggested I try a different podiatrist, Dr. Stark. Dr. Stark immediately referred me to Therapy South and asked that I see Robert Harris. I went to the appointment not expecting any different outcome but I am so glad I went! Robert was encouraging, saying he had a plan and he felt confident he could help me. We started with therapy three times a week, addressing first the plantar problem but then working backward to involve the parts of the leg and hip that caused the injury in the first place. Robert gave me four exercises to do twice daily at home and I logged exercise sessions through an easy to use app. Each appointment has been a teaching experience. Robert asks how I'm doing, I tell him how I'm progressing or having problems and he immediately explains and teaches me a stretch or exercise that will help. Robert's goal is to teach me strategies to address problems independently in the future. Each week finds me feeling better, my plantar fasciitis pain now almost completely gone.

Nine months later, I am able to do most activities that I want/need/love to do without ANY pain and I have gained muscle strength and flexibility that I so desperately needed.\n\nI really don't know what I would have done without the physical therapists Robert and Emily, their interns, and the wonderful staff at TherapySouth-Auburn.

A year and a half ago, I could no longer live with my shoulder pain, both sides due to torn rotator cuffs.  My orthopedist said surgery was likely the only way to successfully heal.  I did not want that and asked for a PT referral.  I began therapy at TherapySouth in January 2018 and was surprised at how thorough and caring the folks were.  I was asked detailed questions throughout my initial evaluation and follow-up questions during each exercise.  Robert and Dreher would adjust exercises according to my limits and evaluate my ongoing recovery at each session.  By April, I had almost full motion in my arms/shoulders, pain was gone, and I even could reach around back to scratch my shoulder blades!  All without any NSAIDS or other drugs.\n\nSo when I began having elbow pain this year, I asked my doctor for a referral to TherapySouth.  Once again a thorough evaluation of my pain and its source was done by Robert.  By the second session I was already experiencing significant relief from pain that was serious enough to keep me awake at night.  And no drugs!  During my last session, I menbtioned that I also suffered from occipital neuralgia.  Robert did not seem surprised and showed me how complex the relationship with all the tendons, muscles, etc in the back and neck can end up causing pain and trigger points.  Here I am two days later with reduced pain throughout my neck, back, shoulders.\n\nIf you are injured, TherapySouth is the place to go for Physical Therapy.  I've literally been to dozens of therapists over a lifetime.  No one comes close to these folks.  If I could give them 10 stars instead of 5 I would do that.
