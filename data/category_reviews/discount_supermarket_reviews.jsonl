Cashier rudely told me this after canceling my request just say rude hitting the buttons hard to stop it. I don\u2019t care what the demographics are. I am a general manager to be clear. Non of these actions are justified because not all customers should be given the issue because of color or the area.

I won't say all I have seen in there, but it is a very dirty, and unkempt store.  The current manager has to only be there for a paycheck.  When it first opened, the guy who ran that store would get rid of anyone who had nasty attitudes, and he kept that store clean and looking good.  This new manager, not a chance.  It is nothing to be making a purchase and the cashiers are on the phones arguing with their boyfriends.  There is another Family Dollar down the road and I will pass this one to instead shop at that one.  Family Dollar places these stores in mostly black neighborhoods, and does just enough, which is deplorable.  I should never go in a store where I am purchasing any foodstuffs and see rodents running across the floor.  Let me be clear however, there are one or two of the young ladies on staff there who do all they can to make this store better, but they are not manager, so they can only do so much.

This is a serious problem because most people use their debit cards and a lot of people are members of the smart spin club such as myself which you have to input your phone number in order to receive your coupons that you've clipped and some earned by free spins!!! By the machine being down this is not possible. I spend$50 plus dollars a week in Family Dollar and I want to use my coupons. This really is an outrage how corporate the district manager or whomever has let this problem linger so long. I spent almost$80 yesterday and the cashier was really sweet because she manually gave me the smart spin coupons but the rude store manager gets upset because it was a long line behind me. How about you get on the other register and take care of the guests because I wanted my coupons and she was only doing her job... The nerve of her. Take that anger and frustration out on corporate or whomever is responsible for taking care of this issue. You're already losing money don't due to something you can't control but don't lose more customers because of your terrible attitude.
