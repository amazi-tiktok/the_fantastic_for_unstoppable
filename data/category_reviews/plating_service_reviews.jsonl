They had my firearm for a little over two months. The only time I got told anything was when I called and the excuses for what was taking so long were always changing. It\u2019s is the lack of customer service that is receiving this company a one star rating specifically the owner who\u2019s name is bob. I did nothing but try to communicate with them and then when expressing my frustrations I\u2019m yelled at when I never once raised my voice at them. Now not only am I retired military but I still work for the military here in Alabama as a contractor and I can honestly say that with the way I was treated as a customer I will be speaking with jag about having this company blacklisted for their customer service. All I had asked for was simply some custom engraving work done to represent the school I teach at which initially I was told would not be an issue. Then this became an issue and I had it thrown in my face that it should have costed way more when they quoted me a price based off of their price list. I have still not picked up my firearm yet and it was dropped off March 14th. It should be ready today and I\u2019m curious to see the quality of workmanship considering this was a brand new firearm that had never been fired there should be no excuse for why it should not feel the same as I have read from some of the other reviews. All in all, after him telling me he hopes he never does business with me again and adding an extra hundred dollars to my bill above and beyond the original negotiated price I\u2019m OK with never doing business with this company again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892a2116b64a051:0x33d33224e0944cfb"}
