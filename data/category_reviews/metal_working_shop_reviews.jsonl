We had a lawn tractor wheel and hinge break off a cutting deck. I called this service and spoke with Ken the shop foreman and he told me they could make the repair. I drove to the shop with trailer and mower in tow. Ken welded the wheel hinge back onto the cutting deck within minutes! Great service and very nice welding work!\nThank you to Ken and Valley Repair Service!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88896dbe8894868b:0xcb76626134c1d485"}
