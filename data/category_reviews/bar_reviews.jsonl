When I arrived, (5 minutes late and we called to say so) we had to wait an additional 15-20 to have our table which gave me the impression that they were busy. There was nobody in the PLACE and we had to wait! Olive Garden, Outback does this too: They make you wait and the place is only half full! They purposely make it seem as if they are busy when in fact out of 16 tables in the back room, only 3 were occupied.

We ordered different wines and she never identified to us which wines they were. She just placed them in front of us and proceeded to take our order. She incorrectly took our order by not remembering. Did not write it down either. I ordered the 14 oz. rib eye grilled Pittsburg style, med-rare. She returned to our table telling me that they gave me the next size steak for the same price of the 14 oz. because she did not remember the order. We\u2019ll  guess that was OK. When it came it was not P-Burg style. I asked for sour cream for the mashed potatoes and she did not bring that as well. I noticed the lack of friendliness to me and my GF compared to her report w/ the other American-African couples. She just did not care,\nWhen I commented to her about the experience, I tried to do so in a kindly fashion. She never listened to my advice. Her response was \u201cyou don\u2019t have to tip me\u201d. Well I still tipped , but only 10% for the service.

When we arrived the lady taking our order told us they were out of basically half the menu and the menu is not very big to begin with.  I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and mashed potatoes, they were extremely plain tasting, not enough seasoning...But edible.  My friend ordered a salad which she paid $8.99 for, and all she got was a small bowl of lettuce, a little bit of chicken, some crutons, and some dressing.  I felt really bad for her, because when she was finished she was still very hungry, but didn't have time to go anywhere else and get anything before going back to work.

She damn near snatched my glass of water away from me and continued to harrass me throughout the night. Now it was obvious to everyone at the table she was a bully. The crazy thing about this whole situation is that SHE WASNT EVEN MY SERVER!!!!  there was no reason for her to come to our table in the first place and the fact she continued to come back and harass me was. Crazy.   When i told the manager about this server he chumped me off as if i was just complaining to complain. I am a bartender so i know all about customer service. And This place is the worst.

On Tuesday July 6, 2018 we stopped by Buck Wild Saloon to check out their version of karaoke. We were a little surprised that there were no cars in the parking lot but considering this was the day before a major holiday it wasn't too much of a surprise. We checked to see if the venue was open and it was. Venturing in, the building was completely devoid of customers. Great! No waiting in a long queue to sing karaoke. We were informed by the very nice bartender that they didn't have a KJ and she was the one doing karaoke at the bar. The TV/video monitor was behind the bar..ok. Also, we would have to listen to the audio through the TV as she didn't know how to get audio working to the sound system across the room. I offered to help and after tracing the audio cables to the mixer, I deduced it was a laptop issue and corrected it for her. I showed her how to fix it in case she ever needed to do so in the future since there was no KJ.\nMy friend and I sang a few songs, chatted a bit, drank a few sodas and was informed that the owner had ordered the bar to be closed early so we said our goodbyes and left.\nVery nice bartender/employees. Come for the conversation but not karaoke.\nThree stars for the bar, one star for karaoke.\nWill review again in the future for band/general bar on a busier night", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889292be2d127f91:0xab962048d58628d4"}

There's also something oddly satisfying about the fact that there's somewhere around here that isn't afraid to promote sexy male dancer events.\n\nCons: ventilation is bad to nonexistent, so you leave reeking like ashtray to your bones even if you're not smoking; the infused liquors and cocktails are overly sweet and they don't offer regular whiskey; the music was extremely loud and unsettlingly all over the place (She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy, D*ck in a Box, I Believe in a Thing Called Love, P*ssy Control as a sampling) which was funny honestly but, you know. You have to walk through a long line of dart players to get to the bar, which felt hazardous; literal debris on tables.

I had been planning to visit ROE for quite a while (I do not live in Calera) and was looking forward to visiting both their bar and game store. According to Google Maps, ROE identifies itself as Black-owned, veteran-led, and women-led; three things I would normally go out of my way to support. However, the following sign greeted me upon arrival, prominently featured in ROE's store-front window: \"Guns are welcome on premises. Please keep all weapons holstered unless need arises. In such cases, judicious marksmanship is appreciated.\" So despite making a special trip to Calera specifically to visit ROE, I turned around and never plan to visit so long as this ridiculous and dangerous policy remains in place. As a university professor, I believe in evidence-based reasoning, and data shows that the \"good guy with a gun myth\" is just that -- a myth. I prefer to keep my tavern interactions with folks armed with deadly weapons to the realm of fantasy, where they belong; NOT my not-so-local hobby shop.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1628094336334, "text": "As the owner, I would like to say I am sorry that you felt that way about our store without speaking with us about it.  My husband is a combat arms vet and I am military raised, and so we have a slightly different humor.  I agree that our store is not for everyone, just like not every shop is for us.  That being said, spending any time in our store with our regulars would show that while we allow carry (and only a small amount actually carry), misbehavior with such items is NOT TOLERATED.  We have found that those that stay with us, stay because they feel welcomed and accepted for who they are without judgement; and we have ALL types here.  No one here gets away with bullying or criticizing others for their various believes as long as said believes bring no harm to self or others.  We consciously monitor the behavior and body language of everyone that visits as should be done no matter the type of shop.  Once again, I am sorry you felt your trip a waste of time, and hope that you do find a shop where you feel comfortable and happy, because end the end, that is what is important."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889240e48ac29ef:0xc41581582d3a19c2"}

My problem was that the owner Billy is some kind of a I'm really not sure but he has trophies all over the place even from a Las Vegas tournament and he apparently never loses and as the owner of the bar and sponsor of the tournament my friends and I don't feel that is appropriate that he is playing in the tournament which he usually does and always wins the major cut of the pot. my friend was second place being beaten by Billy who did not lose as usual I personally was third place and receive no cut. I've talked to other people around at other bars and for the same reason they don't play at these bar tournaments anymore. there's something just wrong with that, there are just as good of places you can play for a dollar. The owner of the bar is supposed to be setting up entertainment and challenges for the customers not for himself. if he wants to play pool which obviously he enjoys he should do that on the side.  we had a good time and I guess that's what it's all about when you go out to play some pool. But nobody enjoys being taken. Don't fall into the Trap don't play the open tournament if Billy's playing Unless you feel you're just really damn good if so go for it! The key is to have fun and if you think you're that good you might just have one of the best damn nights of your life. I only mention all this in all fairness in case you're not, I don't like to see anyone get taken and my friend and I are pretty damn good. Otherwise it seems to be a great place. By the way it's sort of a dive nothing fancy, but it's clean friendly and trouble free and that's hard to find nowadays. So in all honesty kudos to Billy for that and he has Diamond pool tables with a very fast bumpers in case you're not used to that.... And Billy is a really a very nice fellow I like him personally as well as all the rest of his employees I'm not trying to disrespect anyone here. I just think people should know what they're getting into I actually wish a lot of good players would go there and somebody would actually beat him maybe one day I can but I don't know when that day will come oh hell of a lot more practice I guess,  just go there kick some ass if you can, like I said this all for fun and entertainment and if you can't afford to lose 15 bucks you probably should stay home.

I\u2019ve been to a few places claiming to be speakeasies before but this was by far the most authentic.\nI see a lot of reviews complaining about the smoke.\nI can\u2019t understand what people were expecting when they walked in. The cocktails have a smoked option and it\u2019s a small intimate venue with limited seating, hence the reservation necessity. Why the surprise? IT\u2019S A SPEAKEASY!! Speaks WERE smoky, cozy hideouts and thankfully, this time around it\u2019s not cigarette or cigar smoke, it\u2019s a light, fragrant smoke that adds a little authenticity to the experience. Yes it got stuck in my hair too but shampoo works folks!\nStop whining!\n\nIf you want your standard IBA cocktails and modern day atmosphere then visit any other bar in Huntsville.\nAnd finally, the cocktails are made to order and this would be the main reason I return. Know your tastebuds and ask if you\u2019re not sure. For the best experience, try to be open-minded and push the envelope when choosing flavors. Trust the bartender\u2019s recommendations.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b9d0090e851:0x5770df1b503f9839"}

A lot smaller than expected. We were directed away from the couches and cushioned chairs in the middle by the male bartender. The other seating available was not very comfortable. We later found out it was for a party of 5 (actually 3) that were friends of the male bartender. Once they showed up, for every 1 drink everyone else around the room got, they easily got 3. The male bartender likes to light a lot of things on fire so it gets smokey in there pretty quickly. The drinks tasted great, light on alcohol, heavy on flavor. We only received drinks made by the female bartender because, like I said, the other was a bit busy. In the end, we spent about 3 times more than we would somewhere else for 4 drinks. Yes, you read that right, 4 drinks. That is as many as we could get out of them in 2 1/2 hours. Good to bring some out of town clients to entertain while you talk, maybe.

After speaking with Ms. Carla of Church Street Family properties, as prompted by the reservation contact for Catacomb 435, it was conveyed that my party of 6 had a reservation at 10:45p for that evening. Upon reaching the entrance to the speakeasy, we were informed that there was no reservation on the books and Carla was unable to be reached; however, the bartender answering the door contact service informed us that there was no space available due to Covid-19 social distancing regardless of reservations booked. Interesting enough, 4 guests exited the speakeasy moments prior to our reservation time.  Carla later called and stated there was no availability which is why we did not have a reservation. Note that Carla quoted us a specific time earlier that same day for our reservation.\n\nOverall, extremely disappointed in Catacomb 435 and their inability to communicate  effectively and/or uphold reservations committed. After 20 minutes of standing in the rain for the reservation attempting to reach Carla to confirm the reservation she had previously scheduled the very same day, I can\u2019t say that Catacomb 435 is worth the effort.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b9d0090e851:0x5770df1b503f9839"}

First of all the club is small compared to what I'm use to in Atlanta but expected because it wasn't overly packed like I'm again use to. My problem with the club is the bartender. He politely tipped himself an extra $6 that I didn't authorize. I ordered two drinks, gave him my card, and he just gave my card back with no receipt. Now I know it's partly my fault for not asking for a receipt but at this point I'm drunk and the bartender knows this so he takes advantage of the situation. I would have given him a tip had it been clear that he needed one but don't just take money from someone knowing that I know nothing about it.

The party was scheduled 1:00-3:00. We showed up around 12:50 assuming it was going to take 10-15 minutes to get all 6 kids setup and ready to play. Unfortunately that wasn\u2019t the case. The kids didn\u2019t get setup and playing until around 1:40 (leaving only an hour to play).  At 2:40 the kids we sent into the party room to eat pizza and open presents.  At 2:50 the guy came in to inform us that we had to be out of there within 10 minutes.  Keep in mind that we paid for 2 hours of playing for the kids and it took 45+ minutes before they all could start playing. The guy that was working informed us that it normally isn\u2019t this troublesome and he wasn\u2019t sure what was wrong  ( we even had a PC crash in the middle of a game within 5 minutes after we finally got it up and running). I will say the only positive to the experience was how nice the staff was but for $275 I expected to at least get an hour and 40 minutes of playing time before eating and we only received maybe an hours worth.  Not worth the money that was spent.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1612139209891, "text": "We are so sorry to hear this.

Love the roasted brussel sprouts and the art. Kinda overpriced for what you get. VERY salty. Hostess needs more training, to allow customers in wheelchairs to sit where they need to sit. Many of the square tables have a large chunky round center pedestal, which disallow getting under the table very far, and when I pointed this out, she did not seem too concerned, so I had to ask for another table and I remembered being seated at a certain table previously. I mentioned that. She was reluctant. I nudged. We went in that direction and I pointed out the ideal table. She offered a booth with a post at the end and I pointed out the problem, and declined. I again pointed to the table that would work, and she said that section has been cleaned and I said I see that, but...Would you like me to clear it with a manager? So she offered the table beside it, same section, because it was smaller, for our party of two. The larger table did not have a center round pedestal. I gave in, because by this time it was feeling like an argument, making my dining companion uncomfortable, and the table offered was better than the first of the three.

We were seated immediately after entering the restaurant. We waited twenty minutes for someone to take our drink order(at this point we should have left). Drinks arrived quickly. We placed our food order and waited thirty five minutes for, a burger, two fish tacos, mini corn dogs, chicken Alfredo and chicken tenders. When the food arrived they forgot to cook the tenders. So as I sat patiently across from my daughter who had not received her food I realized that everyone's beverages were empty, we never receiveda refill until the tenders arrived. We finally received ALL our food 46 min after placing our order. Food was not that great. All this would have been understandable if they were busy, but the place was practically empty.

Our \"1st\" waiter left our table without saying a word to us 3 times to answer questions such as (1) can happy hour prices be given to us since we did not sit in the bar area; (2) if the restaurant carried Flat Tire beer; (Excuse me but isn't this restaurant a brewhouse?); and (3)  does the restaurant have diet tonic, diet sprite or any diet drinks.  At one point the waiter told our table that he had just had a long day and was tired.  So, he complained to the manager about us and we were given another waitress.  She (Kayla B.) was great.  At one point since there was only 1 bartender on duty (really when you know you have a group of 50 to 75 women maybe more bartenders would be a good idea!) she ended up preparing our cocktails.  One person in our group ordered double meat pizzas to take home to her family.  She had to send the pizzas back because there was no meat on them!!

Even though on my first visit the food wasn't good, I did give them a second try on another visit, I didn't want to completely write them off so quickly since they did have lots of other items to try on their menu, so the second time I ordered the steak (medium well) with a loaded baked potato and broccoli for sides...When it arrived, I immediately felt like for the price you pay $18, the steak could have been a bit bigger, but the kicker was when I cut into it, it was not cooked medium well like I asked, it was well done and very dry and on top of that, the broccoli taste like it had been microwaved and was not seasoned at all or hot, the only thing that was edible was my loaded baked potato...I have to say I probably won't be back again, the service was fine, but the food honestly is not great and overpriced....I tried. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d72a3b69173:0x29e12dfcee058222"}

They were closing at 1am and we got there about 2hrs prior to them closing. Because we've never been there before we didn't really know what we wanted so it took us about 15mins to decide in between watching the game highlights. In that time the waiter Brian(Tall guy, will make my point in a min)came back 3 separate times once with my drink and by the third time we were ready. I ordered my meal and had to speak loudly for him to hear me instead of him stooping down to hear me(1st star strike). Instead of addressing my date to what he was ordering he kept looking at me expecting me to rely the order(2nd star strike). So Chicken Alfredo was ordered with a request to add shrimp and pizza. When our order came it was obvious the waiter didn't care to do QC because there was no chicken in the \"Chicken\" Alfredo. I went to hand him the plate to take back and he waved me off saying \"no, he can start eating that and I'll bring the chicken back\" and walked away. Please tell me what's the point of ordering a entree to be prepared a specific way and then eating it made incomplete?... Then he comes back and says it will be 10mins for the chicken. Why did he bring back chopped up chicken in a little sauce dip cup. My date said not to worried about it, but I'm like this isn't worth the price. We end up asking for to go boxes and he dropped the check. When he returned with the boxes a couple mins later, he stated he would take the check now and proceed to stand over me as I looked in my purse. I guess I was taking too long for him because he felt to suggest I sit my purse on the table so I can see. I advised I didn't need any assistance and never felt soo rushed to pay the bill(3rd star strike). No we didn't want dessert, my date didn't even eat his meal, but maybe I was going to order another Topical Island(which was fruit juice with a splash of liquor, nope I'll pass). Rude service in a half empty establishment is a no go for me.  Don't worry we won't be back.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d72a3b69173:0x29e12dfcee058222"}

(incompetent means-not having or showing the necessary skills to do something successfully) She did not get our order right, she did not do her job successfully the first time...displaying incompetence.\n\n1st waitress ERROR-My food arrived way before everyone else's so I was eating and no one else had food. My beef: She works there and should understand how things work and how long it takes for different foods to be prepared and common sense says that no one wants to sit and watch everyone else eat. I know you might be thinking-what if she was new? Nope she was not knew. She was not asking anyone questions and she was not shadowing another waiter/waitress.\n\nKITCHEN-It took foreeeeever for the remaining food items to come out and they were not busy. It was not slow, but it was not so busy that a person would look around and think it was going to take a while before the food came. There were many empty parking spaces and we were seated immediately.\n\n2nd waitress ERROR-When the remaining food items FINALLY came out one food order was WRONG. She argued with me about what I asked for and although she took the food back she did so in a huff and grudgingly so.\nKitchen-Again we had to wait a loooooong time for the final food item to come out. When she brought the fixed food back the toppings were sparse in comparison to the first one. Time stamps on our receipts prove that it took forever. The time between placing our order (when the order was put in) and receiving our ticket (shortly after receiving the final sparse food item) was 2 1/2 hours.\n\n3rd waitress ERROR-When she brought the check she \"apologized\", but it was terse, gruff, grudgingly done, and quickly mumbled. The biggest thing is the WAY she worded it to make it seem as though it were my fault that SHE got our order wrong. She said \"sorry for your miscommunication\". I was calm and kept my comments to myself. I was not rude and we tipped her well, because we are Christians and that is what we do. In my head and speaking with my husband my thoughts went more like: Really lady! It is your job, your goal, your mission, the REASON you get PAID = to take the customer's order right and get it right...the FIRST time!\n\n4th waitress ERROR-she did NOT repeat the order back. If she was CONFUSED about my request then she should have clarified BEFORE placing the order. Again part of her job and if she can't do her job properly then she needs to find other work.\n\nThe food was mediocre and overpriced, it took FOREVER for our food to arrive, and our waitress was very rude and incompetent (incompetent means-not having or showing the necessary skills to do something successfully).

This non-smoking venue has a lot going for it.  There's a good beer selection though prices were a little high.  $20 for two local beers and onion rings was a bit steep.  In their defense, the onion were very tasty.\n\nSidetracks has a varied selection of bands (local / traveling, and different styles of music). The venue's sound quality is pretty impressive without being stupidly overwhelming as is common.  My guess is the venue can hold 200 but 60-80 is a comfortable fill with dancing available.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b5a44c182f1:0x60e0e2ea8345b718"}

I feel like this should be posted somewhere on the menu.\nWe tried to order several appetizers and they were out of a lot of them because it was Sunday and the waiter said they were consistently out of food after the weekend. I feel like if this is a big enough problem where your staff knows it\u2019s every weekend then it could be addressed in the kitchen.\nWe tried the Funkdified Fried Brie, the big pretzel, the Dirty Bird chicken sandwich, the chicken and waffle sandwich, the chili chili bang bang burger, and the seared tuna blt, also the fish and chips. All of our food came with sauces on the side and they were amazing. The ranch is the best I\u2019ve had anywhere. The Slap Yo Mama sauce that comes with the Dirty Bird chicken sandwich was really good. The beer cheese for the pretzel was divine. That\u2019s about as good as it got though.

Well we get there a little after three and we're told to sit anywhere and they would get to us in a minute. Well where we sat at we had to asked for it to be cleaned off and we had to ask a different waiter for menus. We order our food and we got an appetizer and two hamburgers. Well we get out drinks in about 7 minutes. So, we sit waiting for our appetizer to come thinking it would get to us in atleast 5-20 minutes but it didn't get to us until 48 minutes later. Well we were ready to leave by then but we decided to stay and wait on our actual food. That took another 30 minutes and we rushed to eat because we were going to see a movie. I really think our waiter didn't know what he was doing because we had to ask another waiter on our food and how much  longer it would take. No one came and really came and checked on us we had to ask if we ever needed anything else. Our waiter also did not wash his hands after handling money in which he went and refilled drinks.  Food was mediocre but the only thing good about this place was the atmosphere and bar. Other than that I don't think I'll be coming back we were there well over an hour just waiting.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfAVA8B9Wu_xj522-zkJ_u0N13z9jiehh6JsSz=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtYxbvweZFK9AkH7oIEY3FZzL8MxYmAfiY0lJy=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3xfGBj7JgpaZuDBFOMWB7mwA3fkvASi9uaQ4j=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fd128ae221d:0x93e28fbb765f143a"}

Well, I normally give an establishment 2-3 times before writing them off.. So, between the wife and I, we have been here at least 3 times. Several people in our group had been multiple times as well..\n\nI'll start with the sever.. While she was definitely nice and friendly, she was just not good at serving people. EVERYTHING TOOK FOREVER .. Drink order (we had water), took 20 minutes.. Then another 10 minutes to get it. All in all, we were there 3 1/2 hours.. Not because we were lounging.. It literally took that long to get our drinks, appetizers and meals, etc.. It took so long , several (about 4-5 people) left our group (started with 12), before we had the cake for the \"birthday\"..\n\nWe sat with empty water glasses until another server saw it and stepped in to help.\n\nThe food: it was okay.. That is about the best I can give it. My wife was there a week before and had a burger and it was very dry.. Just plain out over cooked. Same thing happened the other night to everyone who had a burger. They all said the same thing; over cooked.. I even heard someone say, \"Man, I even like my burgers cooked a little on the well done side, but this is something else\"..\n\nAnother problem; When the food finally came out, it was lukewarm. I also saw a \"chef\" in the back remove the lid off of a small plastic container (looked like dressing) that a server brought to him. He smelled it, dipped his pinky finger in it and tasted. He then proceeded to put the lid on it and hand it back to the server while he was shaking his head in a yes gesture. She then walked out of the kitchen with it and brought it to a table.\n\nI could go on and on.. But I won't. They may have good beer, but I don't drink.. So, there is that.. But if you like loud places, with mediocre food, this is your place..\n\nP.S.... Now, several in our group said the one down town was better, but I wouldn't know.. I have never been down there to that one and I will not go. Especially after this experience.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fd128ae221d:0x93e28fbb765f143a"}

Remarkably, he did and showed me where to find them. That in and of itself was incredibly kind. This guy didn't owe me anything.\n\nSo I find the two 2x4's, carry them around to the front parking lot, and start working to get them under my tires. After about 20 more minutes of this I'm starting to get annoyed. Out of nowhere, this little kid (maybe 5 or 6) runs up and ask if I could use some help, cause his daddy's \"got a big ole truck.\" Sure enough, his dad comes over, offers to pull me out, and goes to get said truck. In the meantime, 4 or 5 more kids materialize and start asking me questions rapid-fire. Do I need any water? What about a coke? How'd I get stuck? Am I hungry? (After crawling around in the mud, I admittedly probably looked homeless).\n\nThe guy pulls his truck around and starts asking. These. Kids. For advice. What do they think we should do? Where on my car should we hook the strap? What blew me away is they knew what they were talking about! They start making comments about axles and the frame of my car. He has them shine a light for me while I'm attaching the strap. He has them guide me back once I'm out of the mud. (Boy, did i feel like a yuppie.)\n\nCome to find out, the guy who pulled me out was the owner's son-in-law and some of the kids were the owner's grandsons. (Backstory: the first kid saw me carrying the 2x4's away from the restaurant and thought I was stealing them \ud83d\ude02)\n\nIf it wasn't for the good folks @ Dority's, I'd still be stuck in the mud.\n\nP.

I never had to wait on a drink and he was polite and I could tell he knew what he was doing. He is the sole reason they even got 2 Stars. The food.....Oh the food. It was absolutely terrible. It was my wife's birthday and she really wanted to go here. It was my first time. I ordered some lobster tails she had the ultimate feast. When I got my food a $40 meal, my lobster was like a rubber band ball it was disgusting. I could barely rip it apart with my fingers. It could literally bounce. I had to cut it with a steak knife. I should have been fluffy, buttery and savory. I know it's not an ocean side restaurant but with a name like Red lobster I figured the lobster would be decent. I was so let down. Please make sure your cooks can at the most cook lobster. How is a place named Red Lobster serving such terribly cooked lobster. Your chef clearly doesn't belong at your store.  My in-laws ordered fish and chips. The fish had to have been dipped and breaded 15 times before it hit the fryer. When they finished they had almost an entire plate of batter that they picked and pealed off their fish. I was so embarrassed taking them here. My kids ordered the sirloin steak, they claimed to like it but they are kids, kids like anything. The steaks looked pretty beaten up and over cooked. Thank you Arthur for offering to replace the meal with a better cooked one,( \"which I turned down\" ) and thank you for being a fantastic server! I know that's a tough job. You were worth the $50 tip I left you. But Red Lobster I beg you to hire some efficient chefs and focus on training your cooks how to properly prepare lobster, steak and even a simple fish and chips. Find people who want to be there and who care weather their food is good. I'm not asking you to fire this person that cooked our food tonight but at the very least spend hours retraining them to cook your food the way it should be. I can't imagine how much money your company wastes throwing away food that was cooked terribly. I'm not sure I'll ever go to another Red lobster again which stinks because my wife raved about it, but it was just upsetting. I hope anyone who reads this doesn't have the same experience. I work too had for my $$$ to have someone not care how their food turns out. I don't blame red Lobster as I don't know their current situation but they have to know that their cook is not very good.

I was taken aback and perhaps this is on me for simply not getting up and walking out or bringing it up real time. This whole situation we all find ourselves in is awkward for all involved.  However, it is not on the customer's shoulders to enforce state rules. I just don't get it since it seemed most if not all of the other employees had appropriate facial covering.  Rationally I can tell myself that the exposure risk was probably low. On the other hand should I be having to go through that because a restaurant/employee couldn't be respectful of their customers?\n\nUpdate 3 weeks later:  Although I never received anything other than a canned response on Yelp in spite of contacting them via their website, I made a visit last night in hopes of finding improvement and dinning. Well, incredulously, it was worse!  The State's mask orders are still in effect. Opening the door and entering this time even the host doesn't have a mask and the first server we see - no mask. We turned and walked out.  You have to ask yourself what kind of corporate/management approach so blatantly violates an obvious and easily implementable order. And if they have this disregard about the things you can see then what about those things you can't even during non-pandemic times.\n\nThis can be done correctly. I've witnessed it at many other both local and chain establishments.

When they are busy service can be lacking and the food portions are different on the weekends only. During the middle of the week or during slow times it's much better. My point of view or opinions come from over 7 visits but take out only, can't tell you how the experience is if you choose to dine in. The fresh catch salmon portion is rather small for $19 plus tax.

The Red Lobster there literally has the same qualities, defects, pros and cons as the one here in Huntsville, AL. Both lack in cleanliness. At peak hours the bathrooms become disgusting. Which seems understandable based on the amount of human traffic one establishment can take, but at the end of the day cleanliness has to come first above all. The food tastes like it came off an assembly line. I have no idea how people who\u2019ve had real seafood, down on the Gulf of Mexico, can stand to come home from vacation and eat this? There\u2019s nothing fresh about it. I have nothing negative to say regarding the staff. They seem like they work extremely hard. Sometimes it seems like they\u2019re just holding on. Much respect.

We had nearly finished our dinner entrees by the time our original server came to check on us, and instead of apologizing for the mistake just said \"yeah I know\" when I said we had ordered a soup and salad. If you know, then where is my food? We both finished our dinner entrees before he brought our soup and salad out and by that point we were already full.

He is 85 and a veteran from World War II, Vietnam, and Korea. He retired to   Huntsville almost 30 years ago. He has been going to the Red Lobster there for 30 years.  We had our meal and he insisted on paying the bill. He handed me his wallet which had 3 crisp 50 dollars bills inside. He asked to take two and put them in with the bill.... he wanted to pay the 47 dollar bill and get change to tip the waiter.  I removed the two bills and he ask that i lay them side by side in the envelope so that they did not get stuck together and so the waiter could see there were two and not just one. The lunch was slow taking almost two hours to complete so he finally asked if we could make our way to the car while my wife stayed and waited for the change.  i brought him to the car and we waited for another 20 minutes but my wife did not come.  Finally she did come out and was blown away.  The waiter came back by the table and through the plastic bill holder on the table and said there was no bill or money inside and that he was reprinting the bill for my wife to pay again. I went back into the restaurant to talk to the waiter, but he wouldn't even talk he left for a bit and the manager came out to talk to me. He said that i must have dropped the money and the bill and asked if it was in my pockets. I explained that I knew for sure the money was there because my dad had asked be to take the money from his wallet and to lay the bills next to each other so not to have a mis understanding and that i had closed the plastic envelope before is left and my wife had not even touched it.. only the waiter had touched it.  The manager did not seem to know what to do, but said if i left my number he would call if it turned up. It was a bad situation for everyone. The lady;s sitting across from us leaned over to my wife and said ' we saw you pay the bill\"...  I finally decided that having my dad at the restaurant for 2 and a half hours was too long for him to be up so I just told them to keep our money and i left.  I guess i was hoping that the manager would say here is your 40 dollars change you asked for and we will find this mis-placed bill and work it out... i understand it is a bad situation but my dad now will never go back after 30 years and is telling everyone he sees about the lost of  his money.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b4242329453:0xaf13e57fcb31a1d7"}

There weren't that many people there. Stopped at the hostess stand and she was on the phone talking to someone about a lost article. No big deal so we waited several minutes while she finished her phone conversation. There was also a male employee who was stacking menus who just ignored us. The female hostess gets off the phone and seats us. We look through the menu and make our selections. I realized that we still had not even been greeted even though 3 other tables had been seated after us and were approached by their waiters and were given drinks and biscuits. Still no waiter even though there were two waiters standing by our booth right behind my husband. Our booth was at the end so they were just a couple of feet from us and I am sure that they could hear our conversation wondering why we didn't have a waiter. At that point I pulled out my cellphone to keep track of the time. We had been sitting there for almost fifteen minutes when a female waiter passed us and said our waiter would be there in just a minute. A few minutes more went by before a female waiter who had an order of food to deliver paused at our table and asked if we knew what we wanted to drink. I told her that we had been sitting there for quite some time and already knew what we wanted to order to eat. She said okay that she would be right back and would take good care of us. I saw her deliver the food and then go to another table to take their order. My husband and I just looked at each other and got up and left. I can't believe that there were waiters standing around and nobody had waited on us in all that time. It was inexcusable and I will be sure to let everyone we know what poor service we were given.

This time, Niadja, our waitress was caring; but she gave us dinner pricing when our visit was at lunchtime. Is it legal to charge dinner prices at lunch claiming that the sizes are larger without notice or consent from the customer? We never got the towelettes we requested until the end, either.  In Japan, for instance, a nice hot cloth towel is afforded to the patrons prior to eating. On the same note, Japanese peeps don\u2019t wear shoes indoors either so why would we expect for an American restaurant to provide us hand wipes prior to eating? Our seats were too close together, so we moved. But, the table we moved to wobbled and caused damages to us as well as to our belongings. Thomas, the manager was rude and indifferent. Niadja was to apply a $4.00 coupon which led to our finding out about the pricing deceit. Our hot-spot was being used; but Thomas wouldn't let us use their DSL to get the $4.00 coupon from our Trash. Thank GOD $4.00 won't break us since GOD has given us so much. It's the principal of the matter, though. On our visit previously, a man came in seeking stuff and it was not until he started to bother other guests did management ask him to leave. Plus $1000 was stolen from an acquaintance of ours from her purse while she and her friends were eating there a while ago. On second thought, the people there are very unhappy, the waitresses never smile and purposely catch your eye only to give you a mean look.

We had a bad experience and hadn't been back. Total transparency: most of the food was pretty good. It's the environment, employees, and lack of customer service that will prevent us from returning for probably another 4 years, if ever.\n\nThe hostess had her mask below her nose the *entire* visit. Our server and at least one other server, also had their masks below their nose most of the time we were there. However admittedly, our server did occasionally pull his up.\n\nWe had to ask for refills, napkins, and our check, as those things were not provided or offered intuitively.\n\nLastly, our sever rang up our order wrong. I ordered a hamburger slider/garden bar combo meal for $12.99 and he rung it up separately, $9.99 for the garden bar and $4.99 for the hamburger sliders.\nWhen I pointed it out (after he'd rung us out, my husband was paying...), he said he'd tell his manager and she'd come handle it.\nInstead he came back with $2 and said his manager said the difference is $2 so here we go.\n\nThe difference was actually $2.18 and let's be real, $0.18 doesn't matter right? I obviously don't NEED 18 cents.\nHowever, the principle of the matter: if a manager is going to ROUND something out in order to avoid the complication of re-ringing things up and refunding money to our card... fine. But don't do it in YOUR favor. Give me $2 and a quarter?\n\nIt just got under my skin... Ruby Tuesday does have to work a little harder than most places because they're fighting off several negative experiences by myself and my husband, even before me.... so they're walking a tighter rope.\n\nBut we won't be back anytime soon.

This is when she mumbled under her breath \"No tip? I guess I work for free.\"  And without stopping to think I said, \"I guess you do when you are rude as hell to everyone at our table.

We were told there was a 1 and a half hour wait, which we were fine with because the location is pleasant enough to just sit, have a drink and look at the water.  It ended up taking about 2 hours to get seated.  The kitchen is a food trailer in the back of the property, where there is lots of sand and open sea air (which I thought was a little odd).  While waiting to be seated we sat and watched the waiters and waitresses come out and smoke cigarettes at the kitchen trailer while checking on their customers food.  I even saw one waiter take a plate of food into the restaurant while smoking his cigarette at the same time.  Once seated we waited 45 minutes for our food, and the food was absolutely horrible.  8 of us ate, no one liked the food other than my 7 year old whose kid's fried shrimp seemed to be pretty good.  I had the chicken strips. . . $15 for 5 tiny pieces of chicken that tasted like they were fried in the same grease as the fish (see attached picture).

This place is huge and had at least two live performance stages and 4-5 bars within it's large rambling structure. It even has a large merchandise store. Across the street is their liquor store as well. It literally straddles the Florida/Alabama line, hence the name, Flora-Bama. They have a somewhat limited menu, but what we had was really good. I highly recommend the oyster sampler platter. We loved every roasted bite of each variety. They are also known for their Bushwhacker drink. The easiest way to describe this  is a Wendy's frosty with liquor. It has three different kinds, I beleive, and it's quite tasty and their strongest drink, even though it's premade. Our bartender Stacy was amazing and had all of the best recommendations.  She's very knowledgeable about the local area as well. One of the unique things about this venue is that they seemingly encourage you to write on virtually everything, and I mean everything, everywhere! Bring your Sharpie! We were they're in early December. I can't imagine how crowded this must be in season!!! All in all a fun place, with good music, good and drink!

It's an amazing venue if you like live music and an indoor/outdoor atmosphere.\nThe place is huge. It almost looks like there was the original place and they decided to add on. Then add on again and again.\nYou can roam inside and outside, upstairs and down all night. Even has a boardwalk to the beach.\nWe went on a Saturday night and they had at least 10 bars open that night that were all over the place.\nThe food they offered is more of appetizers and finger food that I seen. We ordered the nachos, get your choice of beef or chicken. They were out of chicken so obviously we had gotten beef and it was to greasy that we couldn't really eat it. But other than that it was good. They also had a food trailer sitting there but didnt order from it.\nGift shop was great, found lots of stuff for loved ones and ourselves.  Some more adult oriented things that are funny if you are into that sort if thing.\nWe seen that they have what I would call a club/dance hall, another place called the flora-bama yacht club and the old river grill. Didnt get to the yacht club but the old river grill was by far my favorite.\nGreat atmosphere,  neat little bar and grill that u can get to by land or water, had picnic tables and beach chairs set up on the beach. Couple different corn hole games set up for u to play.\nWill definitely be back there on my next trip down.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKqNU3NdZaLrEi2lBT6JdPEkkxEz-McSNVPGWJ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhiKdg2K1HRhK4XR81AOv11WmHL8ADBTQFSQfl=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8890a84997a3ca01:0xb5c7b6fa2bbf6d9e"}

Please let us extend our sincerest apologies for the miscommunication in information regarding our age and cover charge  policy. As of June 3rd, the state of Florida issued a lift on all bar and nightclub operations, therefore we were given less than 48hrs to implement changes across all properties in order to open back up our inside rooms and bars. On Friday, June 5th we began going back to our previous hours of operation with the Flora-Bama being family-friendly until 6PM and after 6PM all those under 21yrs of age must exit the premises. This past Friday, June 12, we began going back to a cover charge after 6PM for all those 21yrs and older. Our website was not updated until Friday, June 12 and I'm so, so very sorry for the inconvenience it caused you. With all changes happening so quickly and no advance warning as to what the state of Florida governor will be announcing on any given day, our staff has been working extremely hard to adapt and we now have all signage regarding age and cover policy covered up so that no one is misinformed. Of course with all recent changes our country has experienced in the last few months, we are all in the same boat and doing our best to push info out as soon as we can in order to keep our patrons informed. If you're not already, give us a follow on our Facebook and Instagram where we post any all updates regarding upcoming events, happenings and operation changes. Again, we apologize for the inconvenience and please know updates have not only been made on the website and all other informational fronts, but your comments have also been passed to upper management for further review.

Not so much a place to grab a bite to eat and have one beer since the menu is limited. The Yaught club and ole river grill across the street have a more full menu and sit down service, while the Flora-Bama has a order window. It was confusing to tell where to go since the main entrance leads into a souvenir shop. Outside of the souvenir shop is a split for the upper level and the oyster bar. I found my way past some tents and found the order window and sat on the lower outside deck. I could hear a band warming up inside the inner bar. Three stars because the service was quick and the food was good. Detractors being the crowds at 12 o'clock and the nondescript signs. The free music was a plus, just this place wasn't what I expected at lunch time with everyone drinking and nobody eating. As others have stated this is more of a roadhouse or honkey tonk with modern music.

It's a process where you submit requests for them, and our request for this weekend's day shifts didn't get picked up by a deputy. Also, the county will not allow us to man the crosswalk on our own. Yes, I know this sounds ridiculous, but it is true. We are very much actively working on this change in process and please know that safety is our number one concern.\n\nRegarding the traffic, we have actively met with Alabama DOT and Florida DOT to get them in the room together to discuss our traffic/road issues, since we do not own the road and cannot fix it without their help. These meetings have been going on for a few years. Thankfully, there is progress being made and Alabama DOT has already completed their part of the road, including the addition of an added turning lane. Florida still has to do their part, and the crosswalk will have a light among other changes.

I am 19 years old and was extremely respectful. I entered as 19 years old and got my wristband and marked as underage. Also paid $15 cover charge to enter. After about an hour and a half I got approached by security and told to leave. They thought I had taken a drink from someone\u2019s alcoholic drink, when I in fact had not. I was cooperative but I immediately asked them to look at the cameras or breathalyze me. They refused to look at cameras but called a county police officer. Robin took me outside and the officer conducted a sobriety test and I passed. The police officer was extremely respectful and said my eyes were smooth and there was no problem but that they probably wouldn\u2019t let me back in. Robin proceeded to tell me I was bad for the establishment and she was extremely accusatory. I was shocked by how she was treating me. I didn\u2019t even know how to respond. The police officer then didn\u2019t feel a breathalyzer was necessary even though I said I wanted to take one. I am extremely frustrated by how I was treated by the establishment in this incident. I had no chance at reentry even though I was being respectful and following the rules. I understand that it\u2019s their job to protect their liquor license and they have to enforce the law.

I can understand your frustrations, but we are extremely grateful for our Military as we host dozens of military events here throughout the year, and majority of our staff are retired or inactive military. In regards to the the Mullet Toss event, and all events that may take place on Friday's, we only allow entry for those who have purchased tickets or those with Flora-Bama Membership Cards. We don't accept S.I.N. Cards or Military ID's for free entry as those specific events are ticket entry only (majority of the money collected we donate to local charities, including military non-profits). These specific ticketed events would be for Mullet Toss, Bulls on the Beach in September, New Years Eve (if falls on a Friday) and any other event that may fall on a Friday. Please know your comments will be passed to upper management for further review and action. I do apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused, but please feel free to email me at the address below with any other comments you have.

I knew that everyone at Flora-Bama was on high alert when we were Immediately questioned about our IDs upon walking in, which are all legitimate and have been used multiple times and have never been an issue. The girl at the front desk called the police to have my Illinois ID verified (which I understand as Illinois has new, very poorly made IDs and I am in Florida- which probably aren't the most commonly seen ID). However, after it was verified by the police, my friends and I went to the bathroom as we had just driven for an hour to get to Flora-Bama. It was then that my underage friend, who was given a permanent marker U and a blue wristband for being underage, was immediately targeted by two employees and interrogated about his age. When he entered the establishment he had presented his military ID which showed that he was 19 (never presented a fake) and told the employees that he was indeed 19 when asked. However, because his permanent marker washed off in the bathroom when washing his hands, he no longer had  the U but still had the blue wristband indicating he was underage. Despite explaining that he just walked in minutes prior and was going to go get a new U drawn on, he was rudely thrown out of the bar, and the rest of us in our party were ejected with him. I am absolutely appalled at how Flora-Bama has treated a member of the armed forces who has broken ZERO rules of this establishment. As a result of this horrific experience, we will no longer be returning to flora-bama and plan to share this information with our friends and coworkers who are interested in attending. We hope that management considers looking into these employees and their poor customer service skills because I imagine that we are not the only customers that Flora-Bama has lost tonight because of them.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8890a84997a3ca01:0xb5c7b6fa2bbf6d9e"}

I knew that everyone at Flora-Bama was on high alert when we were Immediately questioned about our IDs upon walking in, which are all legitimate and have been used multiple times and have never been an issue. The girl at the front desk called the police to have my Illinois ID verified (which I understand as Illinois has new, very poorly made IDs and I am in Florida- which probably aren't the most commonly seen ID). However, after it was verified by the police, my friends and I went to the bathroom as we had just driven for an hour to get to Flora-Bama. It was then that my underage friend, who was given a permanent marker U and a blue wristband for being underage, was immediately targeted by two employees and interrogated about his age. When he entered the establishment he had presented his military ID which showed that he was 19 (never presented a fake) and told the employees that he was indeed 19 when asked. However, because his permanent marker washed off in the bathroom when washing his hands, he no longer had  the U but still had the blue wristband indicating he was underage. Despite explaining that he just walked in minutes prior and was going to go get a new U drawn on, he was rudely thrown out of the bar, and the rest of us in our party were ejected with him. I am absolutely appalled at how Flora-Bama has treated a member of the armed forces who has broken ZERO rules of this establishment. As a result of this horrific experience, we will no longer be returning to flora-bama and plan to share this information with our friends and coworkers who are interested in attending. We hope that management considers looking into these employees and their poor customer service skills because I imagine that we are not the only customers that Flora-Bama has lost tonight because of them.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8890a84997a3ca01:0xb5c7b6fa2bbf6d9e"}

As soon as we got out of the car, slimy guys is cowboy hats were yelling inappropriate comments at women walking by and tryin to start an argument with our group. Then we get to the door, guy says we have to go down stairs to order food so we go down, grab a slightly too small table because all of the others are dirty, and sit and wait. And wait. And wait. Eventually, a server comes over, asks if we're there for food or drinks, we tell them both as he's running around us, not even fully addressing our table. He quickly says \"kitchens closed\" and walks off. (Even though the guy upstairs had just told us to come downstairs if we wanted food and the restaurant didn't close for several hours) Didn't off a drink, apology, or say another word. Obviously just trying to get us out of the restaurant.

I could smell the jalapenos on the nachos wow!!! One more or two more tho us I gotta say their drinks are delicious one of the best Bushwackers.\nLOVED THE FACT YOU CAN WALK TO THE BEACH.

We drove all the way from Minnesota with 4 of us. We first got there (Monday) and it was pretty low key which we understood given the day. The gift shop was very nice. Probably the nicest area in the whole bar. Bought some shirts saw a band and then we headed over to their 2nd bar for dinner. They didn\u2019t have oysters that we ordered and the prime rib that my boyfriend ordered never came along with his drink he ordered. I will give the manger props he did say the truck for oysters should be here any min and said the first round of them were on us. Got them and they were great. We visited the main bar 3 times within 5 days thinking the later in the week it got there the more entertainment there would be. We did listen to a good one man band that sang country the 2nd time we were there, but the 3rd topped my anger level. Which is why I\u2019m writing a bad review. Last Thursday march 31st 2016 we went to the main bar where we saw that they had someone singing (who was on break). Our group of 4 got a front row seat. Than we started chatting with another family behind us and while this was happening our entertainment was setting back up to perform again. I guess I didn\u2019t notice that he had started but he made sure that I knew he did because I guess I was being too loud. A group of locals felt the same way and encouraged his behavior which was to call me out in front of everyone saying he couldn\u2019t play because I was being too distracting (Too LOUD). It\u2019s not like I was screaming or fighting with anyone. I was simply talking with my family and learning more about the area with the new people we had met. I found it extremely inappropriate that he would ever say anything to me. I\u2019m on vacation to see this place and have a good time. We simply just walked out. So to round up my experience here I would say definitely disappointing. I don\u2019t get out of Minnesota often and when I do again I wouldn\u2019t go here. There is nothing special about this place unless you like dark lighting, Smokey rooms, being called out on having fun and an old atmosphere. The Hangout on the other hand was a great place for not only my family but so many others.

As we were leaving the gift shop to meet up with his parents were they were sitting by the band, we were stopped by an older woman with a bad attitude because of our age. I understand how there could be an under age drinking problem due to the amount of intoxicated people running around. How ever the way she spoke to us was incredibly rude and she could have been nicer. She continued to be rude  questioning us as if we were doing something wrong and asked for my id. She tried to make us pay 15 dollars each even though we had already been there for a while. I showed her my i.d then she asked for our hands and put a wrist band and scribbled a huge U on each hand . she grabbed my boyfriends hand taking the permanent marker going back and fourth to make the mark even bigger she did the same on mine, almost in a way to be ignorant. she told us to not take the marker or the wrist band off talking to us like we were stupid.  Later walking out my boyfriend was also accused of drinking which he hadn't been. The least to say we are never coming back .

As an avid bar hopper I've been to a lot of bars, some good...some not so much. I was really looking forward to Flora-Bama, the name alone just exudes fun. The hype was there, the reviews were there, and then i was there...and soooooo let down.\n\nTo be fair, it was a Tuesday night at 1030 in September...but this place was not the spot that I soooo hoped it would be. It was dead, I mean except the over 45 folk that were there with a DJ that resembled a older, not so awesome Ted Nugent. Now, that is not necessarily the bars fault. But this is.. this place is a hodge -podge of bad additions which include multiple bars, a gift shop, outdoor venues, and a wierd staging area for things that don't have a home (grills, coolers,etc.). The building was run down and had no flow from one area to another. There was a wierd smell I and only describe of disel fuel and butt, laced with the waftyness of years of nicotine build up. It was the kinda place that made me want to go shower to excape the smell.\n\nThere were several places for live music, but  was none, except for some guy picking at a guitar. The \"band\", all two members, were to busy mingling and not to worried at all about playing. Did I tell you how high my hopes for this place was!? Now, they did have a awesome liquor distribution room. Every bottle in this large room was piped right into the bars for equal and accurate pours. It was really impressive and on display for you to be in awe. All-in-all, I guess if it was spring break and I was super drunk this place COULD be good. But it still feels a bit dingy. I do hope to revisit, hopefully at a different time of  year. Maybe the embiance changes from season to season, but for a bar that has the reputation that this one does, my group and I was let down..hard and my buzz was killed. In all honesty, I would have given it a 2.5 stars..but that was not a option.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8890a84997a3ca01:0xb5c7b6fa2bbf6d9e"}

The idea of playing various songs and interacting with the crowd is great idea and great response.  BUT the main member of the Band is very crude and disgusting!  Can he not play a song without grabbing his crotch and cussing like that to people!?  One lady even tried to buy him a drink, and he told her, with several vulgar words, he didn't want that!  If she can't bring him  'x', then just get out!\nI've seen this singer before, but don't remember him being that vulgar!  Time for some new entertainment.

Also, on Sundays, they have a great church service, \"Worship on the Water\". There are many singers/songwriters/musicians who play at different times and different places within the Bama Lounges.  Personally, I would book The Perdido Brothers with their current time slot, 4-8 on Tuesdays and Sundays. Why? Ever since they became The Perdido Brothers, they have been drawing in more people.  The locals and snowbirds really enjoy their music and the time slot helps bring in the people.  We stay at Phoenix X and we hear so many people mentioning how much they enjoy The Perdido Brothers. This is not a criticism of the other artists because they are fantastic but I feel people really enjoy the music of Rick Whaley, Jon Cook, Pat McCann and Jose Santiago.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1454428864122, "text": "Thank you for your review!

Again, I'm so very sorry this happened but I would love to try and make things right.

The markers they use to place U's on your hands WILL come off your hand if any water at all comes in contact with the ink. I was rudely stopped by a security guard about having very little markings on my hand, even though you could still see part of them. When showing him my wristband indicating I was under the age of 21 and not having a drink in my hand, I was told to follow him and was kicked out of the resteraunt (I even let him check my wallet to prove I wasn't trying anything sneaky). Was a total waste of $15 and I will never be visiting again. Staff was very unpleasant to deal with and I was threatened to have the cops called on my friends and I when I asked about their policies. Very rude and I was not happy with my experience. I was excited to enjoy live music with a few friends but was not able to do this because of the terribly rude staff.
