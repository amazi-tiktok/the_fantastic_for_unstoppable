I also explained to this doctor that I had been taking meds for migraines but had ran out and needed a refill. Once this doctor found out I was a smoker, he seemed to not even care at all. He blamed everything on smoking. I had my 12 year old son in the room at the time and this doctor literally drew a graph of how long I was going to live on the bed paper. He terrified my son!!! I knew then I'd never see that man again! Instead of checking to see what the pressure was and instead of refilling a med I had been taking for 12 years he put me on Buspar. The first night I took that Buspar the pressure increased so bad I could hardly move! I'm also now having to take bp meds since all of this. I'm 34 years old, I should not have all of this going on and for it to hit like it did all at once. And instead of this doctor trying to help me he terrified my son! He also prescribed me Naproxen which luckily I didn't take because I went to St. Vincent where they done at egd and found I have chronic gastritis as well as reflux esophagitis so the Naproxen could have caused a stomach bleed... I've seen another doctor here who is better than the first but I am still having the same issues. I'm honestly believing a stuck hiatal hernia or something else has been missed. The new doc put me on zantac which didn't help either. I feel no better, in fact I feel worse than when I did when I went to try and get help here about 5 months ago.

To be clear, I have not been to their office... This practice was recommended by my child\u2019s pediatrician for comprehensive developmental testing. Once I finally spoke to someone, I was informed that they only accept BCBS or cash. For the low, low price of $2500-3000, you can have 3-4 appointments (that is for testing only, no treatment).\n\nWhile their website presents this image that they aim to treat a wide array of conditions, including those individuals with disabilities and handicaps, it appears that their primary interest is taking advantage of those most in need. In many instances, those with handicaps and disabilities are unable to work with little to no income to support themselves or rely on their families for support; families in these situations are already under intense financial strain. Additionally, based on my conversation, test results are not given until a year long payment plan concludes (imagine an oncologist having this policy). A year, when it comes to a child\u2019s development, is a long time to wait.\n\nAfter hearing the pricing, I had no interest in further details or clarification; however, I suppose it\u2019s a good thing they offer a payment plan, if you\u2019re willing to pay their high fees and do not want to take out a personal loan. It is likely they do not contract with Medicaid because the state will not pay anywhere close to their high fees.\n\nI have no interest in supporting a clinic more interested in lining their pockets than genuinely helping the community in which they aim to serve. I would not recommend this clinic to anyone and I will be contacting my pediatrician\u2019s office to advocate removing this office from their list of recommendations.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1600811761271, "text": "Terin,\n\nI am very sorry for the communication difficulties.

You would of thought that anyone in their right mind wanting to only pay the 25 co-pay would not want each session to start costing over $130 dollars a session.\n\nI know I am partly to blame, but I just stopped paying waiting for the insurance to clear on the sessions, UN-knowing she was not even running it on Insurance. Silver Linings kinda screwed me over.\n\nOn top of that, my wife is a bit forgetful but we were stuck with $400 dollars in Cancellation fees for 4 missed appointments. Pretty stiff. I never even knew that policy existed, because they never told me. And dont say well I told Jane, because I am Bob and not Jane. Tell me the one paying the bills.\n\nWell as things are now, we are not putting our son back at Silver Linings because I feel like I was screwed over and they are not willing to work with me at all.  They will take their money over time sure, but work with me getting screwed over and making things right, no they wont.\n\nIf they decide to work something out with me, I will edit my review.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1539793482702, "text": "Mr. Skillman,\n\nWe are deeply sorry that you feel less than pleased with the encounters your family has had with Silver Linings.

Definitely not who you want to trust with your issues and problems. THEY DONT CARE!\n\nBack story: First appointment, my fiances mother wanted to make sure I gave them the right insurance cards in order because she said they got misfiled in incorrect order last time and it took them over a year to fix so I told that to the receptionist when I got there and she snarkly responded \"I doubt that\". To which I responded... \"No it wasn't a question \"if\" ...it did..\". Then I was filling out the paperwork for my fianc\u00e9 and she said that he needed to fill it out hisself . With his condition he can't do that so I told her that was the whole reason we were there in the first place, and that he couldn't. She was super rude and snarky and judgemental the whole time. So we had to leave to find him an appropriate writing utensil he would use and he finally signed the papers. Fast forward to this time:\nHe has a 2:00 appointment, we arrive at 1:40... we sit all the way til 2:30 thinking Dr. Schwartz was just running behind. Then he comes out at 2:30 and calls a different patient back... so I ask Dr. Schwartz when my fianc\u00e9's appointment time is to which he says he doesn't know, so I go to the desk and ask and she tells me it was at two... but that he was running behind.. but she neglected to mention any of this for the fifty minutes we waited. So then my fianc\u00e9 asked how much longer it will be for him then, and she said thirty minutes.. so we decided to leave and go get coffee.. We come back in only twenty minutes and see the previous client leaving when we walk in. She came out the door and said \" Dr. Schwartz came out after he finished with his client and you weren't here and I was \"unsure\" if you were coming back so I went ahead and gave him his next patient. To which I responded... No you told us it was thirty minutes til he would be seen.. so we left and came back in twenty. She just kept blaming it all on Dr. Schwartz when all of it was literally her lack of professionalism that caused this whole scene. She never told us he was running late, nor apologized. She never told Dr. Schwartz what she told us about him being able to see him in another thirty minutes... like I have never in my life witnessed such carelessness and unprofessional from a \"professional\" practice. So Dr. Schwartz didn't even end up seeing my fianc\u00e9 even though we waited approximately an hour and a half. And he missed work to not even get his appointment due to the vendetta this receptionist had against him. Take your time and money elsewhere!\n* She is the receptionist with box colored black hair btw.

I can truly say, it saved my life, taught me so many life skills and helped mend a very broken family. I have read the reviews that some have left bashing this program. I am honestly in shock that some people would make up so many lies. Not only was I a resident there, I worked there several years ago after I received my college degree. Take it from me, someone who has seen both sides of this program, it WORKS. And the staff truly and genuinely care. That is really rare and hard to find these days. I\u2019ve seen staff put in so much work and so many hours just for the benefit of the children. Elk river is not a luxury resort. But let\u2019s be honest, troubled teenagers and children don\u2019t need a luxury resort. They need a place that will teach them structure, discipline, accountability, hard work, and then and only then will they see the positive and rewarding outcome. If you want a place to teach them these things and want them to get better and act responsibly, this is the place. If you want your child to be pampered and go off learn nothing and get nothing out of it, keep them at home with you or send them somewhere else. I\u2019ve read some reviews that say that their child was starved, I just had to laugh. That is bogus. I gained 30 pounds when I was there because of how much I ate. And I NEEDED to gain that weight. If some people need to lose weight, then the program and staff will cater to that as well. Each resident there has their own treatment plan, a lot of thought and time goes into developing and determining the best plan for each child. I can say this and know that it\u2019s true because once again, I was a resident there and later on an employee. The best part about the treatment plan is that the parents are extremely involved. Parents don\u2019t get to call ALL the shots, because obviously that doesn\u2019t work. But they do have their own input for their child. I can\u2019t say enough wonderful things about this place. I am writing this because I know how much it helped me. I have nothing to gain from writing this, I no longer work there. I just felt the need to share after reading some of these reviews that are just completely untrue and made up. As a parent myself, if my child was expressing negative behavior and needed a place to go for help, there is no doubt that I would 100% send him to Elk River. It is 2021, kids are smart. Kids are manipulative and unfortunately sometimes lie to their parents so that they can come home from treatment. And after reading some of these reviews, there is no doubt in my mind that this has taken place with some of the parents and children who have chosen to bash this place online. It\u2019s bogus. Elk River staff, I love you guys and appreciate all of your hard work! I love the program and most importantly I believe in the program with everything in me. I will be forever grateful for this place. If I hadn\u2019t gone and gotten help, I wouldn\u2019t be the successful and happy adult that I am today. So, thank you.

This program did nothing for my mental health or drug addiction problems. There was little to no actual therapy other than occasional group sessions, and residents rarely received one on one therapy with counselors. However, that is not the reason for my low rating. While nothing about my time there was tolerable or helpful, my major problem with this facility is the way residents were treated there. We were not allowed to speak to anyone, including the staff, without nonverbally asking for permission, and if we were given permission, it had to be \"treatment related\". We were not allowed to converse with other residents or get to know them personally. While I was there, mushrooms and mold grew in the showers. The \"domes\" we slept in had several holes and were placed on top of a rotting wooden platform that I watched an employee fall through, and we slept there even when there was dangerous weather. At one point, the water we drank and bathed with was brown. Even though we spent most of our time inside, we were only given sunscreen two times that I can recall, regardless of the fact that it was the middle of summer.  If the staff decided the rules were not being sufficiently followed, there was use of solitary confinement (which they called separation). The only form of communication we had with the outside world was through letters to our parents, but they were censored, and they frequently refused to send letters they didn't agree with. My last complaint is that I personally watched employees cause intentional physical harm to patients, and even heard them brag about it. The people in charge of the facility knew about these incidents and did absolutely nothing to stop them from happening again. I could go into much more detail, but this experience is one I would prefer to just not think about. I genuinely believe this facility has caused me trauma and I often find myself wondering if what I experienced there is legal.

Due to our respect for your privacy, we will not discuss a client\u2019s mental health in a public arena. However, our Clinical Director invites you to call at 866-906-8336 for an opportunity to discuss your concerns. We are always surprised when a negative review appears from a client who worked hard to graduate the program, seemed to be doing very well, and even submits a satisfaction survey at discharge ranking the services at Elk River Treatment Program as good or great in every category. We have examples from clients who state that they would recommend the program and claim \u201cthis program saved my life,\u201d then years later appear extremely disgruntled in a public forum.\n\nDuring the course of our program, we often discuss the importance of accountability, integrity, and responsibility. In keeping with the philosophy that we teach and role model, we want to clarify some of your comments. Regarding the website: we work diligently to keep our website up-to-date but sometimes things get overlooked. Upon review of your comments, we checked and the website is current. We agree that we have excellent staff - some have moved on to advance their careers elsewhere and others have continued the mission of Elk River Treatment Program to provide for our clients an environment of respect, acceptance, skill development, and challenge.\n\nAs for clothing, we can only assume you are ridiculing clothing items purchased at Walmart. We disagree with your opinion. We do not issue an abundance of clothing and gear. Clients are responsible for caring for their clothing including the laundry of it. This can present a challenge for someone who hasn\u2019t had those responsibilities in the past. The sleeping gear is certified to accommodate weather below 30 degrees although it rarely gets that cold in Alabama. We have an inclement weather shelter that is provided should the temperature drop too low, get too high or if storms are predicted.\n\nAs many clients attend treatment due to unsafe behaviors that place them or someone else in harm\u2019s way, we are very serious about safety, which includes monitoring supervision. We also want structured communication to take place where a positive peer culture model can be implemented that teaches active listening and conflict resolution in a safe space. This accountability for yourself and holding others accountable in the positive peer culture is one of the most challenging skills that residents learn. If a resident is issued \u201crain boots,\u201d it means that they were at risk for running away, and as a safety precaution the boots help deter someone from running, as it is more difficult to run in rain boots as compared to hiking boots. Similarly, if a resident is at risk for running away or harming themselves, they do have to stand next to staff within arm\u2019s length. We hope that you will consider contacting us to discuss your grievances. We take all reviews seriously."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626caeb6cf22e5:0xb2de456bea1e1b61"}

There is very little therapy involved, and it is basically child abuse. Two years later and I still have nightmares. Think twice before sending your child here. I got in trouble for passing notes and talking in the tipi, and I was sent to \"level 3\" which consisted of never going inside in the middle of winter, and they put my food in the FRIDGE before they fed it to me (again- it was FREEZING outside). One of my meals was just a hot dog- not even a bun- and some other side dish. I was also made to sleep outside the tipi IN THE RAIN. Prisoners get treated better. I needed mental help, yet we only had one group therapy session a week, and there was barely any time to talk. I'm surprised nobody has sued them yet. This is not helpful. at all. don't send your kid here. I came out more depressed and anxious than I went in, and all my family problems just got worse. I can only hope this review saves one child from having to endure this boot camp disguised as treatment. If my own parents tried to punish me the way these people did, they'd be in jail. it's ridiculous. A lot of people don't believe the kids that come out of there when we say how horrible it is, but I am drug free and happy now- no thanks to them. Also, don't be fooled by the pictures! You only get to use the horse therapy a few times during courseweek (at the very end), and they never once let us rock climb.

Additionally, there are unscrupulous individuals who profit from writing negative reviews so verifying the legitimacy of a review is important to us. We take all comments very seriously. If you were indeed a client at Elk River Treatment Program, you would have completed a survey after discharge that would give us an opportunity to address any negative experience that you had while placed in the care of Elk River Treatment Program. There are several post-discharge reviews with parents/guardians/probation officers. It is impossible to address the accusations that you made in this review without knowing your identity or when you were a patient in the program.
