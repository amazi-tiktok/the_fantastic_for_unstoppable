I have tried to describe what it's like and it is like nothing I've experienced. They want to help. The most powerful comment I heard there was the acknowledgement that the healing that was done in other countries could be done in the states.\nThey do their best to encourage healing, growth in faith and shifting of the mindset toward the Kingdom of God.\nAttend a service. There are many wise teachers who cooperate well to uplift and teach. I look forward to my next visit and seeing what mighty works they will be a part of.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886214d30c5a2c61:0x65dbee61e04e4e9b"}
