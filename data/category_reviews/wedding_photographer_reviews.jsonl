Nothing was destroyed, she just realized that she was doing more eating, smoking and drinking and didn't have enough pictures.  Thank god family and friends were there to help capture the moments.

Nothing was destroyed, she just realized that she was doing more eating, smoking and drinking and didn't have enough pictures.  Thank god family and friends were there to help capture the moments.

At the time, there were 9 of us, one of the couples being my brother and his wife whom we hadn't seen in quite a few years (and had no family pictures with). The photographer was very nice, however when we received our pictures, every single picture was in soft focus -- we could only order 2 pictures and were very disappointed. THIS IS WHERE THEY EARN THEIR 5 STARS. The manager and then owner worked with me and was very apologetic. They offered to accommodate us for a family shoot if we were ever in the area again. Luckily, 2 years later we were (this past July). I contacted them in January. They booked us with April, who was amazing. She drove all the way from Gulf Shores (2+ hours) for our shoot. The pictures turned out amazing. She was relaxed and fun. We could not be happier with the way this whole situation evolved and turned out.

We were a little nervous taking a gamble on an online appointment, but as soon as we met our photographer Dannie, as well as the owner, we were excited and ready to have fun.  It is obvious all the team members enjoy their work and give each family a special experience. Dannie was wonderful, he is kind and funny, and recommended several things for us to check out on our trip.  He had a great plan of locations and poses, but also let our children come up with ideas of their own, and those photos wound up being some of my favorites. I purchased the package with the flash drive, our photos were mailed within 48 hours and the drive was in our mailbox when we arrived home just as advertised. The photos came out just as I hoped, Dannie really did a great job of taking great shots that captured our family having fun, which was exactly what I wanted.

When I got engaged the two most important vendors to me were photography and videography because they would be the ones capturing my memories while I was present in my day. I knew from the beginning Leslie was one of my favorites, but you get so overwhelmed with decisions you sometimes find yourself as a bride saying \"how do I choose?!\" With Leslie I never struggled with that question. Besides her gorgeous photography talent, what really separated Leslie from the rest of the photographers was that she went above and beyond, some would call this customer service, but I would just call it Leslie. She treats every client as if you were already a dear friend. When Leslie called me on the phone to chat about her packages, she wanted to get to know me, wanted to know about how Chris and I met, laughed with me over the phone, answered my anxious questions about other vendors or bridal decisions, she truly went above and beyond and when I got off the phone I felt like I had made a friend. Y'all this is so important because from that moment on, I knew I wasn't just another Client, I felt like she knew us,  she was so real and sincere, I knew I could trust my day with her. I call Leslie my fairy god-photographer.... she's unbelievable. Best of all, my husband who HATES pictures, really enjoyed working with Leslie and her team, they made him feel so comfortable in front of the camera. Our photos are absolutely breathtaking.

During that time, I texted him to gain an understanding of what the cost would be. He asked a few questions and then never got back with me. Since I had used him on 2 other occasions (most recently 9 months ago) and his prices were reasonable... and this session would be no more work than the previous sessions, I didn't press the issue and figured we would just discuss it later. Well..when I texted him a month before the event to confirm my date, he mentioned he noticed he had never responded to my text regarding the price.  After asking a few more questions he came back with a price of $800?!?!?!??? This is almost as much as I paid for my wedding pictures and they were ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS with tons of editing (much better than any session that we had with Joel). I have spoken with several licensed photographers since this time and NONE of them charge anywhere near this high. Going price for this type of session was $150-450 for a 1-2 hr session and digital photos (Max). Unfortunately this put me in a real bind because now it was extremely hard to find another photographer that was available for my date. Joel mentioned he would come down to $550...but this was still higher than \"average\". This high pricing also was not in line with the pricing on his website. Although he did not have Maternity specifically listed, he had Engagement Sessions for the same length of time (2 hr session and digital photos) for $400 and this was synonymous to my requested session since it would be only me and my husband for a couple of hours. Given that he put me in such a stressful bind at an already stressful time in my life, I would definitely NOT recommend him. I tried to work out the pricing with him to be more reasonable and even explained my issue of having troubles finding someone else this late...but he was unwilling to work with me...even though he knew that it was his fault because he never answered my text regarding pricing 3+ months ago. Do yourself a favor...use someone who responds to text messages and honors pricing listed on their website. At a minimum,  select someone who is willing to take responsibility when they make a mistake...that unfortunately does not appear to be Joel at Yellowhammer. :(", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1562982443833, "text": "Thanks for taking the time to share your feedback.

I have looked at hundreds of photographers all varying in prices, and none of them had the quality of images, consistency in editing, and photography style that she has. She was so organized, on top of every detail, and there for every moment I needed her. She also led me to several of my other vendors, who were all fantastic as well. I honestly just feel so overwhelmed with happiness looking at my wedding album! She also delivered my wedding album four weeks early. This woman is a saint- and so is Benjamin, her wonderful husband. Do yourself a big favor and hire these two. I will use them for every event in our lives go forward. Family pictures, future weddings and events, birthdays, you name it.

They seriously made the wedding experience.\n\nWe reached out and had consultations with a few photographers. Joel and Amber made a huge impact from the first conversation. They were friendly and engaging, and they\u2019ve been doing this for a long time so they know what they\u2019re doing. They were familiar with our ceremony and reception venues, which made us feel comfortable. They emailed us galleries from our venues and we loved their work! My husband and I are tech nerds, and we LOVED their online client portal and interface. All of our invoices, emails, questionnaires, etc. were so organized (trust me, organization is appreciated during the crazy wedding planning process!). Joel and Amber were so flexible with our meeting times. I currently don\u2019t live in the area, and COVID has really complicated when and where we could meet. Also, when there were issues with my wedding dress, Joel and Amber were flexible in rescheduling my bridal shoot. During the whole planning period, they sent us emails checking in, asking for details a little bit at a time so we never felt overwhelmed, and they even sent us gifts along the way! They are so kind and it showed in every single interaction. Fast forward to the day of the wedding. Joel and Amber showed up (with gifts \u2013 of course!) and had learned the names of our parents, siblings, and wedding party. They were timely and helped keep us on schedule without ever feeling pushy. Their experience was crucial here. They made the events of the day flow seamlessly. They took all the pressure off my husband and me and kept reminding us to savor the special moments. They were polite and unobtrusive. What really stood out is when we told other vendors that Joel and Amber were our photographers, the other vendors were excited! Joel and Amber are so respected in this area and field that other vendors feel more confident when they\u2019re working together. Post wedding, we got to see our pictures so quickly!! We saw highlights that night and got all of the photos back the day we returned from the honeymoon. We didn\u2019t have to wait months like a lot of my friends have had to do. Joel and Amber have offered us printing and album options, but have not been pushy or made us feel like we had to buy from them. All of my wedding party and guests who have had weddings commented on how amazing our photographers were. They were so surprised because their experiences with photographers was all over the map.

We LOVED working with Joel and Amber, and the final product they gave us was amazing! Many people have commented on the excellent photos. Furthermore it wasn't just my bride and I who loved working with Joel and Amber. Our entire wedding party had only good things to say about them. They were so professional, and also so much fun to be around and work with. From the moment we hired them, they were really helpful in planning our special day. From suggestions for the photo schedule, to working with you to figure out what will work best to capture every special moment of the day, they had great ideas for moments to capture that I wouldn't have thought of to do, but I'm so glad we did. They also do small but special things to make you feel like part of the joel and amber photography family. I really appreciated the small things they said and did even during our engagement to make sure my bride and i were still thinking about each other and not just our wedding day. And of course they were amazing on the wedding day itself and helped both my bride and I keep calm and not stress about anything so that our day would be perfect. They were very quick in preparing our pictures and getting them to us, and everything looked great. They let you keep the rights to your pictures and provide an online gallery so that it is easy for your friends and family to see your pics. All of this was done for a great price. Most people say a wedding photographer is one of the most important things to choose to invest for your wedding celebration because you want every moment captured well. Look no further than Joel and Amber Photography. I assure you that you will be soooo happy that you did, and will not have any buyer's remorse.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862440d438b41f1:0x8b1f4aed4bb49605"}

I cannot say enough good things about Joel and Amber Photography. They went above and beyond to make my Husband and I's wedding experience perfection. They were more than just photographers, they were friends. They know what they are doing and they make you feel so comfortable and so confident when they are taking all the pictures :). Their image quality is amazing! They respond to emails and all questions you have extremely quickly. They answer questions that aren't even photography related, they spend time getting to know you. They definitely have the business down and you can tell they work nonstop to provide you with the best quality and experience that they can. They do everything they can to make you feel special too. They send you packages and cute little gifts (I won\u2019t give anything away) and they make sure you\u2019re provided with everything you need. On our wedding day they were more than just photographers. They were our friends, they calmed us down, and they provided us water when it was hot, they adjusted my hair piece, they put my veil on, they were creative with the photos, they even made all my family and friends feel comfortable. They were in all the right places for all the right times and photos, but at the same time did a fantastic job of being \u201cout of the way\u201d almost like you didn\u2019t know they were there. I would highly suggest getting the engagement pictures as well as bridal pictures. It makes you feel super comfortable and you just get even more high quality pictures. Oh, did I mention they are QUICK. I\u2019ve never known for a photographer to deliver pictures any faster. They had our wedding pictures to us within a week and a half, like what?! Typically it takes over a month. If you\u2019re on the fence about a photographer, I promise you will not regret choosing Joel and Amber to be a part of your special day.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1535402406494, "text": "Aww!

We had approximately 125 guests in attendance, and we fit well in both the ceremony and reception areas. While the weather was sunny and hot, they cranked up the AC in the barn. Also, my granddaughter had fans printed up and passed out, so people were fanning themselves throughout the service in true Southern style. After the ceremony, we walked across the gravel road to the reception area, and dined under the wide open blue skies. Fireflies danced among the rose bushes as evening softly surrounded us, and the stars and twinkle lights added to our celebration. Of course, my granddaughter\u2019s father-daughter dance music selection was the opening theme song of the movie, \u201cPride and Prejudice.\u201d Then, the DJ put on the latest dance music, and the crowd of twenty-somethings danced the night away. The food and bar offerings were greedily devoured. I found the J and D staff kept our needs met unobtrusively but also with a sweet spirit.

It was very hot, though I obviously don't knock the location for that. My main complaint would be that they had to move the chairs from the ceremony area to the reception area. This took about 20 minutes, and left all the guests standing confused in heat. No one came to tell us when they were finished setting up, and we eventually meandered up to the barn where the reception was held. There were also quite a few chiggers (red bugs), at the barn as well. Perhaps this all wasn't to their fault and was resultant of poor planning, though it seemed as though it was.\n\nThe parking was also odd, it was about a quarter of a mile from the venue. They had transportation between places in the form of what was basically a golf cart. Though they took forever to come back and forth, resulting in my girlfriend walking up the hill in heels.\n\nOverall the place was quite beautiful, I hate to give this sort of review to such a lovely place, but this was my experience.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1572798023395, "text": "Hi John,\nThanks so much for your review and the kind words about the overall beauty of our venue. In regards to the seating in the orchard... we actually have multiple seating options available that do not require seating to be moved from ceremony to the reception. We have over 300 chairs, vintage church pews as well as custom made wood benches. In this case it was requested that the same chairs be utilized at both, ceremony and reception, so we did in fact have to move them... which is a job that  requires about 20 minutes and 6 staff members. We do strongly discourage this option, but ultimately it\u2019s the decision of the bride. :-) As far as instructing guest to make their way to the barn, this would fall under the job of a wedding planner or coordinator, not the venue itself. In regards to chiggars, we do keep all gathering areas around the barn and reception area mowed and well maintained, however we do have 40 acres of Bermuda surrounding the barn, so if you got in any of these areas, a chigger or two is very likely :-). Finally, our parking lot is located on site but 600 feet from the barn. We do this as an effort to keep the ceremony & reception area safe, as well as clear of vehicles for photography purposes. A 6 seater electric (2017 Polaris Gem) shuttle is available for all weddings. The round trip for this takes only 90 seconds, of course that time does vary..  Especially when exiting, as we make every effort to drop guest directly at their car.  Again thank you for the very kind words. We hope you get the opportunity to attend another wedding soon!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888a30d338f76721:0xf2771ad745e07a53"}

We wanted to avoid the \"wedding nightmares\" you hear about with vendors falling through or ripping you off or all of the above and we chose wisely. We visited the venue and after meeting Yolanda, we immediately said \u201cthis is the one\u201d. We looked no further and this is the only venue we visited. It is as beautiful in person as you see in the many photos on their website and in other bride's pictures. I cannot wait to get our pictures/videos back. It is a family owned business and quite reasonable in the grand scheme of average wedding costs. We had unlimited contact and visits with all staff. We moved to the south a year before getting engaged and decided to have everyone come down to us for a good ol\u2019 southern wedding. The logistics were overwhelming and Yolanda, Candace and Terri were wonderful in making sure everyone was picked up, transported and generally accommodated. They take care of all the major details so for a detail-oriented person like me, it was great because I had time to craft my own little personal touches. We rented out the mansion for the immediate families and wedding party to spend the night with their guests and when we pulled up, we got nothing less than Ooos and Ahhs about how beautiful and serene it all is. Every vendor Yolanda has in her arsenal is remarkable and a joy to work with - she wouldn't have it any other way and that is how you know you're looking at the right venue/planner. The day-of coordinator (Terri) is a MUST-DO for Brides. We actually ate at our wedding! We had our first meal as husband and wife and no one even knew and just assumed the wedding norm ( that you don\u2019t get to eat the delicious food you hand-selected!) It was absolutely incredible. Everyone was so surprised that she answered all of their questions, let them do whatever they wanted within reason and even partied and had a blast with us. You will not find a more flexible venue/planner anywhere. There were bridesmaid's guests that were not a part of the wedding party and while we were off taking pictures or getting ready, she let them hang out, swim in the pool and generally do whatever as if they were at their own homes. In terms of the wedding, she was willing to go above and beyond to make the day special for us. She found us the perfect officiant who let us do a cultural element as part of our ceremony \u2013 something they were equally as excited to see executed. We wanted to light off lanterns at the end of the night and she said absolutely. Nothing was out of the realm of possibilities or \"against the rules\" and that is how your wedding day should be - exactly as you want. Everywhere else we looked there was a \u201cNo-no\u201d list of things you cannot do \u2013 be out by 11, no open flames, no loud music, etc etc. That list does not exist at Oak Island and they will try to accommodate all of your requests within reason.\n\nIf you are looking for a one of a kind wedding experience with seasoned professionals, listen to their advice (they've done way more weddings than you!) and go with Oak Island Weddings. We could not have been happier with our choice.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888948c6f31e0777:0x7dbfd474cbd2c867"}
