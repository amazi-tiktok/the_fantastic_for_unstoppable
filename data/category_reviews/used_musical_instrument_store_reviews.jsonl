It didn't make any sense to me if they said the clarinet was off brand, etc. You'd think they'd ask if we wanted to spend that much to fix it. We only paid  $50 for her new clarinet on Craigslist and would have put the  $200 into buying her a nicer one instead of paying to fix the one she has.

I asked other parents and had received the same answer. My son took lessons from Nancy Hallman and Phyllis Peterson over a period of seven years. Both instructors were excellent. He went from being a sub-par beginning musician to making district band in a few months and made superior ratings every year there after. It was an astonishing change.\nI had a co-worked who had a junior in high school and she was at the bottom of the barrel musically, she was in the schools \"C\" band as the only upper class man. I called Nancy Hallman and handed my co-worker the phone and told her to set up lessons. She set up lessons and her daughter took lessons from Mr. Peterson, two months later she made district band. The next school year she made the school jazz band after 5 months of lessons. This young lady is now a music major at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. Hallmans transformed this student that had no passion for music into a musician.\nMy son played the alto sax, I noticed year after year that 7 of the 8 sax players in district band members were Hallman's students, both at the middle school level and high school levels. State honor bands were the same way, Hallman's students. One of my son's peers was awarded the top musician in the state his senior year in high school.\nAfter reading some of the other reviews here I would make the following observations:\nIf you want to put a pacifier in your kid's mouth buy a $50 instrument off Craig's list and have your kids dissatisfied and frustrated from playing an unplayable instrument, then this is probably not the place for you.\nIf Hallmans replace additional pads, it was because they presumed that you wanted an instrument that could actually be played by a student. My experience is when you think a pad or two is leaking and you fix it, you will find the next pad leaking and it was not particularity identifiable until you fix the two pads with the more significant leak.\nIf you want to raise a kid with skilled music instruction and the self esteem from being a good musician, then you have found the right place. The instructors are phenomenal.\nI was always treated fairly with the sales and service and I ended up with a highly skilled musician who I am very proud of.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626bbf454edaef:0x7eab6ee1903e8f2b"}

Purchasing a piano is a matter of very personal taste and preference...what matters most to David Ellis and his sons is quite simply whatever matters most to you.  My husband recently surprised me by taking me to Ellis to pick out the piano of my dreams.  While they could have pushed me to purchase on the spot, they did exactly the opposite and accommodated me on multiple visits to make certain I went home with the instrument I not only liked....but with which I fell in love (as did my husband).  They went out of their way to educate us about the instruments and encouraged me not to settle.  Not once did I feel pushed to make a purchase.  David and his sons knew this was a very special gift from my husband and they went above and beyond to make sure it was all he wanted for me...and all I wanted as well.  The Ellis family knows pianos, they know the value of a good investment, they know the value of superior customer service, they are approachable and meet every pianist on their level - from the young child just beginning lessons to the most accomplished world-renown performers and everyone in between and they treat them all with the same utmost care and respect.  When you select a piano from Ellis, you receive not only a stellar instrument suited just for you, but also the benefit of a family legacy based on fulfilling musicians\u2019 dreams.  If you\u2019re in the market for a piano, question no further where you should go...Ellis Piano is your answer.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a3544961c1:0x4e608e6bb337b439"}
