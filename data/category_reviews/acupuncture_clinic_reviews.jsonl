After finding his contact information on the A.R.T. providers page, I decided to schedule an appointment.  I was initially hesitant, as I live in Pensacola and would need to drive almost an hour to get to Fairhope.  I can say that each and every trip I make down for an appointment is absolutely worth it.  Unlike other practitioners that I've seen, Dr. Justin took the time to listen to my concerns and give me feedback.  I didn't feel like another patient on the assembly line.\n\nI was also impressed with his ability to provide me with some immediate relief.  Using A.R.T., Dr. Justin was able to help me alleviate some nagging hip flexor pain, and also give me more range of motion in my knee, in one visit.  While some follow-up visits are required to completely alleviate certain issues, I was impressed with how quickly I felt relief.  It was also helpful to know that Dr. Justin was involved in the same workout program as me, so he really understood the nature of my pain.  It's nice to be treated someone who appears to \"practice what they preach\" in terms of living a healthful life.\n\nAnd lastly, the staff at Eastern Shore Chiropractic & Sports Clinic is outstanding.  I'm always greeted by friendly faces when I walk in the door and have never had an issue getting an appointment at a time that is convenient for me.

The last time I can remember going to a chiropractor was in 2004 and I honestly never had a bad experience, however, I also never had an experience that  benefited me enough to continue the care.  I became skeptical of chiropractors, skeptical of orthopedic practices, and skeptical of the health industry in some respects.  After unsuccessfully managing my pain due to a shoulder injury, arthritis, and degenerative issues, which all became more acute within the last 15 months, I decided to seek out an alternative to surgery and medications.  Chiropractic care resurfaced as a suggestion to me by a co-worker and I begin to search the local area for a destination to try to combat my persistent and nagging pain and discomfort.   I chose to meet Dr. Kristoffer Johnson based on the hundreds of successful reviews, his experience, and the overwhelming positive welcoming by team members, Bethany and Amy.    They are truly a team that works in unison.  They are truly invested into their patients health improvements and well-being.  They are truly honest, caring people that serve and make a difference in many, many lives.   Another MOST wonderful experience with Back on Track is that a planned number or subscription of visits was not prescribed to me like so many outlets build their potential success around.  \"Let's get you better.\"   I can tell you Dr. Johnson, Bethany, and Amy, more than once, have iterated this as their focus and I am truly blessed and thankful to report that my health has improved.   The combination of therapy services and adjustments is not only beneficial to my physical well-being, it is mentally enabling as well!   On top of that,  I enjoy reading the blog posts on the website and educating myself with what Dr. Johnson's shares through his many years of experience.   After the first week of therapy and adjustments the agony of my discomfort started to go in a different direction.  Halleluiah!   Several weeks of consistent therapy and adjustments is proving to be the best thing I could have invested in for my overall health.   I am confident and positive that I am now \"Back on Track!\"   Thank you Dr. Johnson, Bethany, and Amy!!   I am very much encouraged and looking forward to continuing this health building relationship!  Many Blessings!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b904fa1de3d:0x5fb457de0a99f9ec"}

The location is perfect and within minutes from my job.  I contacted them via email and got a response and appointment very promptly.  When I arrived for my first visit, I was in so much pain and couldn't turn my head to the left side. The staff (Amy and Beth) always greets you with a smile, warm conversations and pleasantries making you feel super special... they are absolutely outstanding professionals.. Also the atmosphere is pleasant, friendly and welcoming...almost heavenly.  Dr. Kris Johnson is an awesome guy!! The fact that you're not waiting around all day to be seen..  He takes time to explains your conditions/situations/issues and recommends a plan of action as to how he will work to get you some relief and feeling better.  See, I took a nasty fall down my basement stairs that resulted in several vertebrae out of alignment. By my third visit, the pain was down 2 scales (from 10 to 8) and now, after my 8th visit, I'm down to 5 more scales with some occasionally shoulder pain but no more numbness in arm or tingling in left hand.  I'm able to turn my head all the way to the left side with no pain and move my neck up and down freely. On top that, I'm  not having to pop pain pills...icing the area once or twice a day does the trick. I didn't intend to write such long review but I am reminded that the Word of God tells us to give honor where honor is due.  I 100% believe Dr. Johnson and his staff really deserve such worthy praises and recognition for what they're doing not only in my life but others everyday.  My prayer is that God continues to bless and prosper them and this wonderful Chiropractic office for many, many years to come.\n\nThank you,\n\nCindi Smith", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b904fa1de3d:0x5fb457de0a99f9ec"}

I'm a 30-year old, active female that had never experienced back pain! I had been experiencing a sudden onset of sharp pain in my lower back that became debilitating (a few hours after moving my Christmas tree, or so I thought). I'm a RN, so i knew to do the basics of applying ice/heat, resting, numbing creams, OTC pain meds, massage, etc. Although these methods provided some relief, it was temporarily. I was regaining some mobility, but nowhere near my baseline! I was having pain upon bending, walking, lying on my stomach and back, and even sitting. My coworker recommended that I come to Dr.Johnson at Back on Track. I decided to give it a try because my methods were not working. What a great decision! The customer service i received  was EXCELLENT and the atmosphere in the office was very inviting and calming!  I received my services with little to no wait time, which is very rare for visiting a doctor's office. The ENTIRE staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and encouraging! I received a tour of the facility and how each product/machine worked, education on what to expect, what to do to assist with my treatment upon leaving, and most importantly a remarkable service. I literally went from requiring assistance because of extreme pain and discomfort when sitting up to sitting up without assistance, IN MINUTES!!! Although I do have to return to the office for continued therapy, I immediately felt the benefits of my visit. I'm so thankful I decided to come to this office.

Your input is appreciated.\nYour perspective on the first visit is different than most of our patients but significant. The intake paperwork asks the patient to list all their symptoms and quantify their health complaints and instructs the patients to quantify their level of improvement over the next 12 treatments.... That is correct. The reason the paperwork addresses a treatment plan is so patients are aware from the beginning that holistic treatment is not a one treatment panacea, it's not a pill and it's not magic. It is a healing process and the specifics are handled individually with each patient.\nA 20 minutes face to face with a physician is unheard of these days and if you feel that was a short visit so be it. In a 20-minute visit we addressed the entire human frame above and beyond the chief complaint plus acupuncture and tongue analysis. The process didn't stop when you left the office but it continued as the tongue analysis was performed by OUM physicians in California and THERE WERE THREE EMAIL CONVERSATIONS REGARDING THE SPECIFICS. That was a step I take out of true concern for the health and well-being of my patients but it's cases like these that make excellent physicians become callus.\nBest of luck on your journey and next time find something to praise about the next person that gives a damn about your health and well-being"}, "gmap_id": "0x8892927a6c918d1b:0x6fa1927cce21bd5d"}

No recommendation at all.\nIf you are looking for medical treatment for your recent accident and pursuing insurance claim,\nthis place will be your worst nightmare.\n\nMy wife had an accident and got treatments (paid out of our pocket first - over $700) and delayed almost two months!\nInsurance company can not confirm their business info anywhere.\nTheir info that they gave me and insurance company never came up with correct return, when insurance company ran their info to government website.\nEven I, personally visit and ask, it take 2-3 weeks to get the right tax report info.\n\nThe old man, sitting at the front desk, always says\n\n\"I already sent all info they asked\"\n\nbut if I asked when he sent, and where he sent, he never gave me answer.\neven what he sent, !!!!!!!\n\nalways saying these\n\"I don't remember.\"\n\"I sent it in the pre-addressed envelope.\"\n\"I don't know, anyway I sent it.\"\n\"Maybe you need to find a lawyer.\"\n\nI am telling you this because they (Dr and husband) are not saying these until they get paid.\nBefore starting your treatment, they will tell you that they have had no problem with any insurance company to be reimbursed.\nAfter treatments, after delayed payment  over months, then they will not care.\nbecause they get paid all out of your pocket first.\n\nHey, for my case, all I experience is rack of professionalism.\nThey don't even know under what information, they are running their business.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1445107836750, "text": "We understand that the patient is having a hard time getting an reimbursement from their auto insurance carrier. It is stated on a sign at our reception area that we do not file insurance at our clinic. Some insurance company may not understand the value of Acupuncture and Chinese medicine yet.  For patients who has acupuncture benefits with their insurance company, we try our best to assist them by providing forms with medical coding and other information needed. Patient needs to contact their insurance carrier to find out their coverage and it is never guaranteed on our part if insurance will cover.\n\nNote that CMS-1500 form, a superbill, and patient's medical record are the common types of documents for insurance company to proceed the claim. This patient's company has requested tax documents, which is out of  our responsibility to provide. knowing it contains many personal information on the documents, no doctor office would give out copies of this kind.  But because we had wanted to help our patient to receive payment we cooperated fully with Mr. Kim and the representative at Geico. We have provided the insurance representative with our tax return information, our tax ID number, all of the business names we have used, all of the business addresses we have used in the last 10 years, and our NPI number. In addition, we filled out a W9 form from the IRS and returned it to Geico in their return envelope. We do not know what additional information they need. It seems that their problem is with GEICO not us. GEICO refuses to recognize us as a legitimate business even though we have a tax id number, have filed income tax returns for 12 years, have state and city business licenses, have a website, telephone listing and Facebook page.\n\nWe thank the patient for taking time to notify us of the complaint. Patient satisfaction is a critical component of quality patient care in our practice."}, "gmap_id": "0x888c2c07a778db77:0x11ea5ec9fa09e191"}
