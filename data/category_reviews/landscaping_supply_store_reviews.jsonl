After 20 minutes of running the saw broke and needed a new head.\n\nFirst Stihl gave me a hard time about the saw, made me take pictures of an obviously brand new saw and after a lot of hull-a-ba-loo agreed to fix the saw.\n\nThen they had Electrical Outlet fix it.  It took Electrical Outlet six months to fix the saw.\n\nWent back into Electrical Outlet today (a year later after the saw fiasco) and put $300 dollars worth of material into my buggy.\n\nI went to get a log chain and requested help from the owner, a Mr. Alexander.\n\nHe helped me get the chain and I requested help obtaining hooks to put on the end of the chain.\n\nI had some reservations about the eye hooks, such as would they be as sturdy as the chain itself.  What type was better, etc.\n\nDuring this question session three men came up to us and interrupted our conversation.  Mr. Alexander then just left me standing there with a couple of different hooks in my hand and walked away to discuss college football with what were apparently his friends.\n\nSo, I shopped a bit more, patiently waited at the front desk while these four people gabbed about college football.\n\nWhen Mr. Alexander finally decided to check me out I indicated I was not happy with his leaving me standing there.\n\nWhile explaining this I did not raise my voice or act rudely, I simply told him I wasn't happy with the service level provided.\n\nIt was at this time that Mr. Alexander decided to go ballistic on me.\n\nI got a good reaming out by him.  For good measure he also tossed in a few choice four letter words.\n\nI told him that I was having a difficult time being calm with him.\n\nTo that he pointed at the door and told me to get out.\n\nI then told him about my chain saw experience and that I had refrained from criticizing the store about the poor service because one of his young employees had been very nice to me during a weather emergency we had April 27th, 2011.\n\nOnce again I got told where the door was and to use it.\n\nSo, I proceeded to do so.\n\nAs I was opening the door he shouted at me \"You must be another one of those Terry's\".  I promptly told him who I was and spelled my name out for him.\n\nI try to support local businesses, but he effectively sent me next door to Tractor Supply (where I got everything I came to town for anyway).  Guess it will be Tractor Supply or Lowes in the big city from here on out.\n\nGood luck with your attitude Mr. Alexander.

Trevor replied that he gave me several referrals, with the implication that choosing five star was my decision.  I'm willing to take PART of the blame, but my contention is that if you don't know the quality of work of the people that you refer would- be customers to, then you shouldn't refer them.  Trevor's name and reputation is behind his referrals, no matter how you look at it.  I would not have considered the referrals seriously if I had known that Trevor didn't know anything about these people from Five Star Landscaping.  The only other possibility is that Trevor DID know the lack of honesty, deliberate fraudulent words and actions, and basic dishonesty of the 5 Star rogues.  Is there a third possibility?  Help me out here.  When I was in practice, I never made referrals to anyone who's quality of work I wasn't aware of... Am I missing something here?  I don't think so.\nADDENDUM 04/06/21.\nApparently, the five star crook talked with Trevor because now he knows ALL?... of the details.  Let me fill you in.  Trevor says that this shouldn't be a public issue.  REALLY??  This SHOULD be a public issue.  The one that doesn't want a public issue is the one who has something to cover up.  The photos below show the tearing up of my irrigation system and electrical controls of the gates for the irrigation. Also, the pix show the  excavation within 16\" of my wall. I'd asked for the path to be at LEAST 36\" from the wall.  So, they wiped out all of my wisteria roots.  Also, I did NOT get a 100% refund.  The only way I got $9000 was to threaten them with my recording of the exit meeting.  Until then, they were gonna keep $9800, fully half of the project price.  After my disclosure of the recording of the exit meeting, they sent me $9000.  Does anyone feel that they deserve $800 for the mess shown in the photos below. THAT'S WHAT THEY LEFT ME WITH.  The photos below tell the real story.  Would anyone pay $800 for this mess?.  The materials I \"received\" was a pile of \"mulch\" that they were gonna use instead of removing the grass sod that I had requested be removed.  The two \"employees\" either didn't know how to use a shovel or were too lazy to dig out the turn in the pix.  So, they ran their 36\" powered bucket down the projected path and didn't bother to turn when they should have turned, destroying my  three year old wisteria roots.  See photo.  I'd have paid $800 just to leave my yard alone.  So, I had to pay to have my irrigation system repaired, and talk someone else into doing the actual project I wanted done in the first place.  No one likes to come in and finish a project that is screwed up from the get-go. NO ONE WILL ADMIT IT WHEN THEY SCREW UP A JOB!\nSo, Trevor, what I want you to do is to BE HONEST..", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvnFUJfYHCrEIGjCRtMXfIT4aklXLZF8mtdWk=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYWELJseMT5dd6oVAc3XvDHt_y5Iz2QezHOlg=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPg1zIFCM63wCwC8whjg2eayZyfYd3SCkXoIDs=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOG8HtzqrvDEbDdn6Kmhxhtw_rcVX8Nfr9nqmE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbkyvLqlcfllruxTOdV5pyKuZjzIs06lakWDU=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1617466824924, "text": "Robert this should not be a public argument.

There are two separate businesses in Green Valley: the market and flowers and the landscaping.  You can judge the flowers for yourself and should get a good quality product.  I would recommend Porters just across the river for a much larger selection.\nNow the BEWARE.  I hired Ken Irby to do my landscaping.  His crew did a good job.  As soon as the job was done and the sod laid I was very satisfied.  THEN IT RAINED.  I took pictures of the washed-out sod to the business and showed it to one of the landscapers.  He immediately said they did not put pins in the sod so it washed away.  I then went into the office and showed MR. IRBY.  He said he could fix it for over $1000.\nI stated that since it was his workers' error it should not be that much.  He and I agreed to $800 to fix.  I know.  Why should I have to pay anything? As of today, November 4, 2020, I have not gotten responses from e-mails or calls.  I still have a mess and have waited too late to resod because MR. IRBY did not keep his word.  IF YOU DEAL WITH THIS MAN GET IT IN WRITING AS HE IS NOT TO BE TRUSTED.\n\nIn response to Mr. Irby.\nYou try and make yourself look like you will take care of a problem you created.

He (Green Valley Nursery & Landscape) never showed up that day. I questioned him, & he acted like he was doing me a favor by fitting me into his busy schedule. Told me he\u2019d send a bobcat over to finish the job right then... I asked if the gravel was even at the job site, & he replied, \u201cI have no idea! Guess I better check.\u201d Wow! If that doesn\u2019t tell you how unprofessional they are, I don\u2019t know what does? Said he might be able to get the job done on Tuesday. I finally had him nail down a time for Friday, because I like a guaranteed job when I am paying for it. I felt like I had to babysit them to make sure the job would actually get done. Finally, the driveway was installed by people who are supposedly professionals. They literally just dropped off gravel & spread it out a bit. I\u2019m not a professional landscaper, but all the research we found said that the gravel needed to be plate compacted through the process. He said they don\u2019t do that, & he never promised me that. I only expected him to professionally & properly install a driveway... sorry, that\u2019s what I thought they were. Professionals. Nope. He refused to fix the job, even though I was promised I wouldn\u2019t have to pay until I was happy, & he would make it right. He told me he wanted to wash his hands of me, & wished I\u2019d never bothered him. The gravel in this driveway is so loose that the first rain will wash it all out, it\u2019s uneven, has a poorly graded slope that makes it hard to enter the drive without scraping the bottom of your car, & my husband couldn\u2019t fit his Jeep in the carport anymore because there was so much gravel under it. They refused to fix it at the present cost, & said they would plate compact it for another $500. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll bill you, don\u2019t pay it, & I\u2019ll send you to collections. We\u2019ll let the law handle it.\u201d Unbelievable & awful experience. My husband & I could\u2019ve done this job properly for as little as $700, but we decided to hire \u201cpros\u201d instead, & now, we are out $950, & it\u2019s not even done right... meaning more expenses for us now.
