I explained to your husband during drop off, it might be around closing time before he would be ready, and he was fine with that.\nWe try our best to accommodate all of our clients accordingly, and provide loving care for your pets as if they were our own. Sometimes that means we have to spend a little more time with nervous or scared ones, which often means we are working past closing. We apologize for the confusion, but what our staff was trying to say when you called was that even though we technically close at 5pm, we stay until the job is done. We always tell our clients to feel free to call and check in, however we will text when ready finished. We have several clients that travel from different areas and if we know at check in, we can get those pups done first.\n\nShaggy Chic operates differently than most other salons. We allow for a fun and enjoyable experience for the pets that come in, instead of sitting in kennels all day. Because of this unique service, and our goal of providing a high quality groom for each individual pet, our finishing time varies.

Our goal is to provide the best experience possible for each pet and their family when coming to Shaggy Chic. With this being said, when you first started coming to Shaggy Chic, I remember going above and beyond to configure a special discounted rate based on you bringing all 15 dogs in for grooming. After agreeing on this price, we have only ever seen 6 out of 15. Out of the 6, only 4 were brought in more than once. No other client has received special discounted rates for having multiple pets,  however, I made an exception for your family. I simply can not be expected hand out discounts for owning multiple pets. We are still doing the same amount of high quality care to each individual pet, and I still have to pay my staff. Let me also say that we have never given any client a hard time when asked if we could change something about their pet's hair cut. Every client has their own vision of how they want their pet groomed, and we always do our best to comply with each unique style...  As for me not returning phone calls, I am a very busy person running a small business and also grooming dogs full time. This is why I have a receptionist to answer the phones and schedule appointments. It is unfair to say that just because I have not had a moment to return a phone call, that means we have \"bad business ethics\". My receptionist has been more than willing to answer any question you may have, as well as schedule a grooming appointment. However, you have refused to discuss with her. We try our best to please every client that comes through our door. Nevertheless, we are only human. If you are not happy with our services, then I recommend finding another salon to take your pets to."}, "gmap_id": "0x888925e1d6c994c5:0x5d740e58fa9ff3d0"}

If by settled your mean the check your insurance paid out 4 weeks later that covered the em regency vet and ONE of many of our vet follow ups than yeah guess \u201csettled\u201d in eyes of the law. Also by Alabama state law you would have been better off killing him in your carebecause unfortunately as of now Alabama state law classified him as a possession and worth retail price. But we just want to know WHAT HAPPENED!!!  I\u2019ve done my research this will go away once I find out what happened to our sweet baby. And everything I have stated is factual. Did happen and have all the proof. Contact me and tell me what happened and I\u2019ll remove review. Even though you should be shut down for allowing something like this to happen on YOUR watch.\n\nAdded a photo of him leaving emergency vet.\nStill no idea how it happened.\n\nUpdate: 8 months later our dog still having comlpications from injuries sustained here. Hope she\u2019s done something to help protect little dogs because we still have no idea what happened. It not about the money tonya. We want to know what happened to our little guy. I pray this never happens again to another dog.\n\nDogs stayed 8 hours. Got back with 3 broken ribs!!!!\nWe dropped off our pups on 9-19-18. Dropped them off at 8:30 am. Well finally at 6 pm we go to get them and one is acting weird. Took him to emergency vet. Long story short he had 3 broke ribs on left side and trauma to eye and face on right side. Nicely asked Tonya about what happened and I don\u2019t know is the only answer we got. She has cameras but of course apparently did not work on that day but they do now. Spoke with her nicely multiple times. Well her insurance paid our claim but only for medical expenses and denied the reimbursement for the groom because Tonya the owner denied to them anything had happened. So when I got frustrated 3 weeks later I went to the place and let her know I was frustrated without yelling or cussing like I wanted to do from day one but did not. Next thing I know cops are there bc her helper called saying she was scared for her life. I have all of this on audio record. If anything Tonya yelled at me when I calmly stated would go public if did not give me my money back bc something happened to my dog in her care. Today is oct 15. We got ins check but no reimbursement from Tonya. Just asked her about it and was told to quit harassing her. Well to this day we still don\u2019t know what happened. But something did because when we left the dog was fine at 8:30 A.M. and picked up at 6pm he was not. Dog was in constant agonizing pain for over week and half. Our vet is the only reason he got any relief until healed because she would sedate him for us. If he wasn\u2019t sedated he laid down staring off in space constantly crying. We\u2019ve used this groomer for 3 years. Don\u2019t think she would intentionally hurt any animal but the fact is he got hurt while in her care and this whole process is completely unprofessional and cannot believe we are getting treated how we are when it\u2019s my dog that has had something happen to him under someone\u2019s else\u2019s care. I\u2019m sorry Tonya but \u201c I don\u2019t know\u201d is not acceptable when you are dealing with people\u2019s animals. Even though apparently I\u2019ll recieve a law suit for writing this. People need to be aware of what dangers could happen. An animal is a piece of property in the eyes of Alabama state law. Unless you have video evidence you are lucky to get medical bills paid back to you. Never leave your animal at any groomer. Especially a big chain. Thought we were safe dealing with someone we thought we could trust. Will never make that mistake again.\nThank you Tonya for a wonderful experience.

The owners at Infinity listened to what we had to say (the place near home said he was an aggressive dog) and wanted to charge accordingly. Infinity had us being Bailey in FIRST to gauge how he acts.

He is more relaxed around strangers and doesnt jump straight to 10. Today was the 1st time we introduced another dog and he was anxious but did better than expected. We are glad we found them.

The workers leave dogs in pee and poop filled kennels for hours before they are cleaned.\nThe dogs don't go outside from 4pm to 7am the next day.\nThey have had 2 cases of kennel cough since spring break, and have still been using the same sponge to clean all of the dog bowls.\nIf your dog is having a health issue while boarding, the workers will not tell you about it if they don't think it's serious. There are dogs who get incredibly sick either from stress or other health problems that result in blood in the vomit and/or stool. The only thing they do is take the dogs food and water away and don't let them outside.\nThe dogs water bowls are only checked at 7am and then again at 4pm. So your dog may be going without water for any number of hours between those times and the workers will ignore it. The bowls are only cleaned once per day, so if your dog is boarding for several days, there's a very good chance that they'll have the same bowl of water over the course of their stay. They have a major rat problem there, so often times there is rat feces in the water bowls.\nThe dogs are left alone all night with the rats, which your dogs could be eating over night, making them very sick and possibly catching diseases.\nThe workers do not have first aid training, so if your dog chokes on the mulch that is outside in the play area, then they are told to \"look up an instructional video\" to help the choking dog.\nThey don't pay attention to what the dogs are doing because they're too busy on their phones to care. So if your dog poops mulch (very bad for his digestive system) then it's because they were eating it from the play area. There are also several dogs who eat poop, so if your dog has that habit, it's probably only getting worse because they think they're allowed to do it while staying there.\nWhen the dogs are playing outside, they are sometimes not given water for several hours due to certain dogs not liking the water hose.\nI have witnessed a coworker giving the wrong dog her medicine. Once that realization was made, still nothing was done about it.\nIf your dog is not good with other dogs, they are set as \"individuals\" where they play by themselves. These dogs are only getting 10 minutes outside to play, and then they get 10 minutes inside to play. They are supposed to have another 10 minutes to play but are usually skipped because the workers want to go home early. So if your dog is boarding over the weekend and they're not good with other dogs, then they're only getting about 20 minutes of outside time every day while the other dogs get over 2 hours.\nThe weekend hours are different, so all of the play groups are shortened and the dogs are left alone for a lot longer than they normally would be.\nTheir medicine is put in pill pockets in their food. If the dog doesn't voluntarily eat the pill pockets, then that dog will not be getting their medicine that day.\nThe dogs only have access to their food for a couple hours a day. So if your dog is a grazer and doesn't eat all of their food at once then they will be eating very little over the course of their stay.\nThe kennels are painted very poorly, paint is always chipping off the walls, usually because dogs are chewing it off.\nWorkers regularly spray dogs in the face with Bitter Apple spray. This spray is supposed to be used for dogs that have problems chewing their fur, and is not meant to be sprayed in the eyes or nose of the dogs, but they are regularly sprayed in the face if they are barking in their kennels.\nIf you request for your dog to be given a bath, they will usually bathe the dogs very early in the day to get it out of the way. Once they're bathed, they are not allowed back outside and their food and water bowls are taken away. So if you dropped your dog off at 8am to be picked up around 5pm, there's a good chance that your dog hasn't been outside or had food or water since about 10am.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1519324162478, "text": "Hi Lori, I wanted to reply here as well since I did not hear back from you regarding this same review you left on Facebook.\nI'm truly sorry this is how you felt about working at CDT.\n\nAs one of the owners, and the person responsible for systems management in the locations I am very upset to hear these things. I'm also very concerned that not once had myself or any of the owners been contacted or told any of these things throughout the course of your employment there.\n\nBecause I can assure you, that not one thing you have said is company policy or are reflective of our systems we've built over 40 years.\n\nThere's nothing I can say to refute your claims because you cannot prove a negative, all I can say is that if you truly felt this way you should have come directly to myself, Margaret or Damian the multiple times we are all there per day whether helping out, working on things or just leaving our own dogs there for boarding or daycare.\n\nAt the end of the day, I'm sorry you feel this way about CDT.

The owner of this facility and the manager were told on multiple occasions by employees and were aware of the following: Fire extinguishers (they only have 2) being extremely out of date, last checked back in 2015\u2014 also no evacuation plan, or safety drills, air vent maintenance doesn\u2019t take place\u2014 vents/filters not properly maintained can easily catch fire, this company works with LIVE animals, the safety of your dogs are not being considered as you can tell from the images.... everything is layered with years of dog dander and hair.\nWhen the heater gets turned on the smell of burning hair lasts for days and the company uses wax melts up front to mask the smells. They also stuff the vents they don\u2019t clean with smell good beads to mask the smell.\nEven daycare dogs are kenneled. Employees hang around upfront until around 9 when they decide to start putting dogs in daycare\u2014- this means if you\u2019re paying for a full day or even a half day of doggie daycare starting in the morning your furbabies are missing out on 2+ hours of socialization. This facility doesn\u2019t properly clean the daycare room. And weeks worth of hair is noticeable near the drains in the daycare play areas, this is extremely unsafe for your animals/the employees. The smell in this building that\u2019s separate from the building your drop off your dog is horrific. Dogs are left unsupervised in daycare, and the daycare supervision in maintained outside of the daycare rooms- so instead of dogs getting that one-on-one attention they are only monitored when barking has increased. Because of that, rooms aren\u2019t cleaned right away causing burns on paw pads from dogs playing around in urine. Most dogs have to be ran through Grooming to be spot cleaned before leaving. Bored dogs have started eating the walls of this establishment because of the lack of social interaction they receive. This facility illegally mentioned to employees that they can not pay overtime to them when they have worked 40+ hrs. Because of this, I believe the care of the animals that go there are being affected.\nDuring the recent snow storm an employee managed to chase a already nervous dog around the front lobby of this establishment causing him to run out of the front door. This dog was missing for a week and found with his hip shattered, and he had ate an entire toe off of himself.. this establishment paid his vet bill which included the cost of utilization. Clearly the proper training of employees is not being conducted. This facility also does not clean kennels often and when they do they use a dirty mop to wipe out the kennels. This is probably a factor to the outbreak of kennel cough they are currently battling.\nMany times employees just feed  dogs breakfast without even bothering to clean the kennel first or move the dog to a clean kennel.. that means that they were eating breakfast in their own filth and kenneled with it until daycare started up. In It\u2019s hard enough trusting someone, let along finding out an establishment you\u2019re paying LOTS of money to is neglecting your animal. This establishment recently caused the death of a small 4 lb dog, and they are trying to cover it up. By deleting comments and blocking any negativity they receive. I refuse to be silent. This facility is anything but transparent!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb344b45a6c63:0x685d3a5c7b681a37"}

When I first boarded @ Piper's 2 years ago I requested that he be kenneled at night with only little dogs and was shown a room off the hall on the right where I was told the small dogs stayed. When I asked why he was put in the big room this time with the big dogs she said \"well, you didn't request that he be separated\". If my file had been consulted I'm sure it would reflect my wishes. There was no I'm sorry we didn't contact you about his injury, etc. He literally had to be carried that night and Christmas day every time to potty, to food bowl, etc. While I understand this may not be the norm @ Piper's, ( had never happened to me before) since it happened this time, I'll be making other arrangements next time. Beware. Things are not always as they seem. Ask to see where your dog will be put at night. I was told they  NEVER allow tours! That's shocking! I've ALWAYS toured where I board my dog.

I can not say enough about how amazing Dr Myers is!  You can't fake how much she truly cares for animals and has their best interest in mind.  I have been through everything from new puppy care, stomach trouble, spay and neuter to kidney disease and having to let go of one of my babies. Dr Myers would not give up on my dog with a rear condition, even calling Auburn several times to confer with other veterinaries. When it was time to let my baby go she was so caring and hugged me while i cried, reassuring me that we  had done all we could. Just this past weekend one of my babies had to be hospitalized at another clinic with 24 hour care, Dr Myers called the staff there to make sure they had all the information on my dog as well as called me to check in. Above and beyond, even on her weekend off. Dr Myers will always be straight with you about your pet. Yes, some people don't like this but i would much rather have a doctor, people or animal,  tell me the truth no matter how hard it is to hear. I respect this about her.

They prescribed medicine that I had to pay for, but he developed Kennel cough at their facility.  He\u2019s 8 years old and never had this happen before.  (2) Took my dog in for grooming at 7 am.  Told it would take 3 hours, after not receiving a phone call I followed up at 1pm, only to be told my dog was groomed, except nails.  He would be ready after groomer retuned from lunch.  Why not finish him, nails take 5 mins???  Well then I go pick him up a hour later and he still not ready.  So the person working the front counter goes back and cuts his nails and now he is bleeding from that experience as I take him home.  (3). While I\u2019m waiting at front counter for my dog another gentleman brings his dog in who is barking quite a bit.  I happen to look back at the Counter Rep and catch her look of disgust of having to deal with this dog. (4) I call on Weekend because my dog has ear infection, Doc calls me back after second message and says it will have to wait till Monday.  Gives me remedies I had already looked up, but no option to get medicine after hours.  I brought my dog in Germany and he has lived in and been cared for Vets on Turkey, Tucson Arizona, Chicago, and Alaska.  Never have we had any of these experiences, and I have all these in 3 short months..  Time to move on and I tried to give benefit of doubt.

Although I should have taken heed, I did not and my dog continued to attend day care regularly. I began noticing that my dog was very timid of the staff. In particular, she was called by one of the managers/trainers and immediately backed up, tail between her legs, and laid down in a submissive position behind me. This time I took note and my dog never returned to the facility. I still have pre-paid day care days that will go unused. When I inquired about my dog\u2019s reaction, it was explained to me by staff that my dog was regularly kept separate in a kennel in the back during the day. AND, that her \u201ctraining\u201d involved being taken into the yard, on a leash, while other dogs were allowed to approach her and she was given commands to obey. THIS RUINED MY DOG.

I moved to Birmingham a few months ago and did not know a soul. I came for graduate school with my best friend (Oliver) and the center of my world. I shopped around for daycares like my peers do for their human children. I chose Just Happy Hounds because the staff was friendly and I loved how my dog was always playing. He does not spend hours alone in a kennel like he would at home. They have far exceeded my expectation for customer service and outright exceptional care for my puppy. Oliver had a scratched cornea from playing a little hard and required surgery. I was stressed about what to do. I thought I could not take him to daycare while he recovered for surgery. He required extensive medications and needed to watched more closely in the cone of shame. The JHH team took care of Oliver post-op just as well as I would have at home. I never have to worry about my best friend while I am at work/class all day. I know he is being loved and played with as he is at home. I could not be more thankful for such incredible care of Oliver during his time of extra need. As a nurse, I am always caring for everyone else. I have been incredibly thankful to have someone help me out and give me peace of mind. Never bring your baby somewhere else! Sarah and her team are incredible. JHH is the best home away from home you can bring you furry friend to.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4WS7O5ToitlaW1kn5jGIWJEntUSyvkh2RrBux=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bbf43e944c7:0xc6636238acb27662"}

You spoke with me the owner.  As I remember our conversation it was several days after your appointment you called to make another one.

That is a huge deal to a small business, being that we had a hole of 2.5 blocked off hours in our schedule due to your dogs not coming in. Businesses cannot operate that way! And it was an appointment blocked off for 2 dogs... not one.   Our business model requires a prepayment deposit to be make after 2 missed appointments, that will be credited to the following appointment. Two dogs no showing is 2 appointments missed and lost revenue for us. We are not always able to fill those appointments last minute, as was the case.

The business is located in the downstairs of a building which you access from behind the building. There is no sign indicating this at the front of the building. When I arrived I parked up front and opened the front door to find an abandoned filthy building. I quickly closed the door and ran back to my car. I almost left then, but decided to drive around behind the building. That is when I saw the downstairs door. The upstairs door should be locked with a sign instructing you to go around back. When you get inside everything looks dated, but that's not the problem. I dropped my dog off at 1030. I was told that she would be done around 2 possibly 3 but that I would receive a call 30 minutes before she was ready. I was also told that she would be taken out of the kennel to walk and for a potty break (although there's no grass for this that I saw). At 1:30 I called to check and was told that it would definitely be 3 but that she would call 30 minutes before she was done and she sounded aggravated that I called. At 230 my husband and I decided to leave to pick up some lunch before picking the dog up, and at 309 I still hadn't heard from her. At that point my dog had been there almost 5 hours so I just headed straight there. I got there and she was still working on my dog but only for about 5-10 more minutes after I got there even though I hadn't received a call that she was 30 minutes from being done. Almost as soon as my dog was on the floor she peed which leads me to believe she was never walked or taken out to potty. She was shaved WAY shorter than I asked for her to be. I asked for a simple trim and instead she was shaved with a #5 blade. The lady argued with me and told me that I told her to cut her short, which I did not do. I was also told that it would be 50$ and I was charged 55$. We will not be back here.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1532658787294, "text": "Hi Kendra!  Gee.. if you had a problem I wish you would have taken it up with me before you proceeded to write many inconsistencies!  First.... the upstairs building does not belong to me..... and Lorna Music just moved out with in a weeks time... and is in the process of cleaning it up! Our sign clearly shows the entrance to our business is the bottom level!   Secondly.... we were nice enough to take your Maltese withOUT an appointment and work it in around our other regular customers.  Our regular price for our small dogs is $55.00 and I usually charge a bit more for people without appointments .. so thats what we get for being nice to first time customers! Thirdly.... your dog was the LAST to come in... so it was the LAST to go out. It wouldn't have been fair to the other owners now.... would it?  Lastly... your dog was not in good shape so it had to be taken down short as I explained when you picked her up. Your dog also pee pee'd and poo poo'd in her cage as soon as you  dropped  her off so yes... she was walked thoroughly after that..... and Yes.... we have a very large dog run right next to the shop which you again did not observe... and plenty of grass out back!

Apparently they KNEW my dog wasn\u2019t eligible for grooming YESTERDAY but never told me last night when they confirmed his appointment.

At least, because I saw that review, I was not so shocked when they brought her out within less than two minutes and said \u201cshe failed.\u201d The test, as the ranch dude explained, involved taking her into a room, on a leash, where there was already a dog; so she did what I could\u2019ve told you she would do\u2014she barked & cried at the dog.  You definitely have to know what you\u2019re doing if you\u2019re going to introduce dogs on a leash. These guys certainly don\u2019t. When I got there, he just called over the loud speaker \u201cBring Jackson [their test dog] into room [blah, blah, blah];\u201d then he took my dog on a leash all the sudden and in approximately two minutes he came back out saying that my dog just \u201csnapped at the other dog the whole time.\u201d\n\nMy dog definitely barks and cries when on a leash when she sees other dogs\u2014she wants to do what\u2019s natural to her (sniff the other dog\u2019s butt and go play). However, she does well, on or off the leash, meeting other dogs if properly introduced.  I\u2019ve boarded my dog before in several places; she\u2019s had dog sitters and even walkers that come to pick her up with other dogs;  I\u2019ve have always been told how sweet she is with other dogs\u2014those other places probably know more about dog behavior than these guys.  I take my dog to different dog parks regularly and I see myself that she does well with other dogs in her own terms or with me guiding her if needed.\n\nI didn\u2019t really care in the end whether they accepted or not.  It\u2019s their loss in the end. They turned away a perfectly sweet dog and loss hundreds of dollars plus future business. I was looking to board for 11 days while I\u2019ll be in Europe and then again later this summer for a shorter trip.  It\u2019s their loss, not mine.

When Jackson attempted to approach she snapped at him. Due to the fact that she was anxious and reacted in an aggressive manner shows that this environment would be too stressful for her.

Sorry she cannot board here, we have lots of big dogs.\" So I said \"let me get this straight, you immediately (in an unfriendly way) take a young dog away from its owner, walk down the hall, open a door where a large Doberman is waiting and because she gets scared you won't take her?\" I also explained that she has boarded plenty of times and does great. I even offered the phone number of the place she boards. The woman says \"Sir, your dog failed the temperament test.\"  All I can say in summary is that NO person or place that knows ANYTHING about dogs would design THAT as it's temperament test.

Everything you have described seems off. The Dog Ranch Resort is a very dog social environment and it is suited for active social dogs. All of our dogs are out in separate groups socializing with one another and they are supervised by our ranch hands. We do not just throw dogs in a dog run or a crate. Our Temperament Test Dog is a Chocolate Lab and not a Doberman. Everyone who meets him sees how calm, easy going, and sweet he is. The way our temperament test works is we want to make sure that your dog is good with a new person, a new dog, in a new place while the parents are away. Since you will be leaving your dog in our care we want to make sure that they are okay without you. What we look for is any signs of aggression, anxiety, and overall temperament of your dog. If they show any signs of aggression then our facility can not accommodate a dog that could be potentially dangerous to the other dogs. If we see a lot of fear and anxiety we always suggest a trial day to allow your dog to get acclimated to our environment. We want to make sure your dog is as comfortable as possible prior to boarding. It is also our policy that a \"Temp Test\" be done at least 2 days prior to boarding in order to allow for a trial day if necessary. Boarding your dog in a new place is very stressful for a lot of dogs so we try to take all of the necessary precautions to make sure that they aren't too overwhelmed. Before jumping in a pool most people test the water, that is the way our temperament test is designed.

We boarded our 18 month old golden doodle for 10 days. He was supposed to be groomed the last day he was there. We keep his hair long so he was only supposed to be washed and trimmed.\n\nWhen I dropped him off, the receptionist was nice enough but the place smelled very bad. I've used several dog care facilities since we're new to Montgomery and the Bakery was by far the worst in cleanliness.  The dogs and the administration area are all in one. This created a very unorganized check-in since the receptionist was moving, picking up and pushing dogs off the counter the entire check-in. I looked over this because we were literally flying out of town the same day.\n\n10 days later, I called to the Barkery know I was headed to pick my dog up. They told me that they had to cut his hair down low because he had a few matted areas on his legs. I didn't like that but its understandable. I arrive to the counter and the owner hands me a bag of hair to \"prove\" how bad the matts were! They brought my dog out and he was literally shaved down to skin\ud83d\ude25 It was so sad! They didn't even grind or clip his nails. It was clear that they had no clue what they were doing. They couldn't find his collar and leash. They said that I must have taken it with me. I usually take them with me at my normal grooming place but I thought I remembered leaving them. I didn't take the time to debate the point because I was almost numb at the sight of my dog. I just kept telling myself, \"This is your fault for waiting too long to make an appointment and taking him to the ONLY place that had an opening\" Now I know why they had an opening. For the life of me, I can not figure out how people are giving this place good reviews.\n\nWhen I get home and the family and I console each other, lol.....I find my dogs collar and flea collar buried in his door food that I had left with the Barkery. My dog also wouldn't eat for days after we got him back and he was sick for at least a week. He sneezing and vomiting. Btw, he smelled horrible. I was trying to figure out what they used to wash him and if they actually bathed him the day before I picked him up.\n\nThis was the worst experience ever and I would learn to groom my own dog if this was the only place open. On top of all of this, the receptionist and owner never apologized for the haircut. They basically blamed me because I let him get matts.\n\nWorst experience ever!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81ba3e5eea13:0x87de1146e68cc888"}

Kimberly ran inside the building, never spoke, never apologized and sent Jake, who is not an owner of The Barkery,  to \"deal\" with us. Apparently, Kimberly had lied to Jake and told him that she was threatened by myself on the phone and was called a b****h, which was untrue, I was actually quite pleasant all considered. When Kimberly finally came outside, I asked her was she ever threaten or called any obscenity and she said no that never happened. Jake went off to smoke his KOOL cigarette, because the whole reason he came was because of her lie.Why Kimberly would make herself to be the victim when she lost my dog is beyond me. Kimberly yelled us, blamed us,  cursed, and never once apologized. I understand that things happen, but if you're a dog sitter and you lose the dog, you need to take some form of responsibility and at least be sorry and try to help. Instead of being concerned,  Kimberly(owner) and her daughter, and another staff member keep screaming about their \"Livelihood\".  Thankfully, me and my family were able to go out looking at 6:00 am and posting lost posters and found Midnight near Huntingdon College. The staff members saw us looking for our dog, offered no help, and still no apology.  Today is July 9, and The Barkery has never followed up, or showed any concern for their negligence.

I know that you mentioned Lunita sees lots of people all the time, but a daycare situation can be a very different environment for a dog. She was clearly overwhelmed and nervous from the beginning and even with more time to adjust it was clear that she would not thrive in a group play environment. Our temperament test is designed to not only ensure that a dog does not pose a risk to the rest of the pack but it also helps us determine if this type of daycare/boarding is the best environment for your pup. Just like people, some dogs find different situations more stressful or enjoyable than others.\n\nWhen we determine that a pup might not be a good fit, we generally have a manager call to provide a thorough explanation and offer recommendations. With the additional protocols currently in place to protect our clients and staff, it sometimes it gets a little more hectic and we apologize that you did not feel assured in our assessment.\n\nI am so glad that you found a place to board Lunita!

To my dismay and disappointment, more than one request to have him groomed has been denied by other businesses in the area, so I did what I could with my own \"custom\" scissor cut. But, \"We Talk Dog\" didn't give a second thought; they took him right away and their groomer did a superb job. He looks great!!! Typically, Ted has some anxiety at being handed to someone for care. Not a whimper! He knew he was in good hands.\n\nThe staff flocked around him (all of which he soaked up like a furry sponge) - even the owner makes the point of greeting Teddy whenever he goes for grooming.

I eventually started to work there and found that the people there not only care for your dogs but have a true passion in doing so. Though I do not work there now, which a large part of me still wants to be, I have absolutely no hesitation in leaving my dog with the wonderful people here who insure that she is well fed, healthy, and plenty of time to play with her friends.

Adam is amazing and his facility is the best around.  I live over 20 miles away from his facility, but any time I need to board my dog, I take her to We Talk Dog. Even though there are five vets that offer boarding within 5 miles of my house, his facility is the only one I trust.\n\nThe thing I love most about WTD, is the fact that he has someone on site 24/7.  Your dog will never be left unattended or just \u201clocked up\u201d in kennel all day.  They are always playing and socializing with a great amount of supervision during the day, and at night, they have spacious kennels and someone is always staying with them.\n\nAs far as training goes, Adam helped us tremendously.  We have a German Shepherd that was starting to become fear aggressive until Adam worked with her.  He spent hours walking us through the steps to get her back on track and left us with a plan.  It was hard work, but we did everything he said.  Now, three years later, we have the most amazing dog we could have ever hoped for.  Adam is still one of our dog's favorite people in the world, and she gets so excited every time we pull in his parking lot she can barely stand it!\n\nOverall, We Talk Dog is an amazing, clean, organized and well looked after facility, and the training is outstanding.  I think some people want a trainer to come out and \"fix\" their dog for them, but that can't be done.  The owner of the dog must be trained how to train the dog, and no one does this better than Adam and his staff.\nI would recommend We Talk Dog's boarding and training to anyone.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88893d529c0176db:0x3436b80342c70748"}

One of the things WTD is known for is putting dog safety as our number 1 priority. During peak boarding times such as Spring Break, we unfortunately have to close daycare to ensure the health and happiness of all the dogs in our care. We hate to do this but are unwilling to compromise our strict standards of care. When we know that daycare will be closed we send out an email blast, post flyers around WTD, and share it on Facebook weeks in advance. We hope that this helps people plan accordingly, and we are sorry that you did not receive those notifications. We will definitely be looking into additional ways to keep folks in the loop as we never want someone to feel frustrated with our services.\n\nWe are sorry that WTD was not the right fit in the end for you and your pup!

My little boxer dog, Tilley, was initially timid about going and was appropriately placed with the small dog pack group even though her sister, Gunner, was in the \"big dog\" group. Knowing TIlley wanted to be with Gunner, WTD carefully observed Tilley and transitioned her gradually to play with the \"big dogs\". And on those days when the big dogs seemed really big, WTD would place TIlley back with the little dogs. My third dog, Roman, is an 80 pound VOCAL red bone coon hound. His happy howling bay can get annoying, but all staff at WTD take delight when Roman vocalizes his joy.

We called about enrolling our rescue dog in daycare and getting some training to help integrate her into the world. Our message was taken and they never called back. so I figured I would just take her down there and have a talk with these folks. I grabbed her vet papers. I had the day off so I threw on my t-shirt and flip flops since it was a hot summer day and upon arrival we were greeted by poo on the floor of the foyer and were looked up and down by the woman standing there who promptly frowned. She talked with the peson in front of me for a bit longer while studying us with that same frown on her face and after they finished their conversation asked \"May I help you?\". So a little back story on this dog. She is a boston terrier who we are fostering for a local rescue. She came from a puppy mill situation and she has a scar on one eye and at the point of writing this is still pretty malnourished. She is not the prettiest dog in the world but she is sweet and everyone who knows her loves her, Except this person apparently. SO, I told her what we were interested in and the best she would offer up was a piece of paper to sign up that she never actually gave me. She then launched into the fact that we would have to schedule a temperament assessment and that the next available appointment was several weeks out. I told her we had called several weeks ago and no-one called us back. She said that she had seen my message and that their trainers were \"Very busy\" and that they simply could not afford the time to contact me. I explained to her the situation with this dog being a rescue and that being a foster home we were not likely to have her too very long to which she simply stuff the paper back in the manilla envelope from which it came and gave me that tilted head, high pitched, insincere, \"Sorry\". So we left. Precious, our rescue dog, seemed to be a little down about it so I went by our local bagel shop who makes dog treats and picked us both up a little something for the rejection. All in all though, after thinking about it, I would not take any of my dogs to this place. Between the poo on the floor, the bad attitude, and the inability to return a phone call I don't know that I would trust these folks with my family. We had hoped to get this poor little dog some extra socialization and training to help her get along with her permanent home. I guess the search continues. I may send my spouse by in work garb with one of our fluffier dogs to see how she is treated just as an experiment.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88893d529c0176db:0x3436b80342c70748"}

We asked for our doodle to be cut to about 1/2 inch without sacrificing his curls. Everytime Johnathon would cut him he would always take time to walk him back gently and today our doodle was roughly pulled to the back, and when we picked him up he was shaved down with no curls in sight. I called to express my frustration and try to process a remedy to the problem and the receptionist was extremely defensive, condenscing, and rude. As if we were the problem.

I debated on not going back after that but decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. A few weeks later, my puppy contracts Kennel Cough from there which ultimately developed into pneumonia. As any other pet parent, I was angry because every dog is supposed to be fully vaccinated in order to attend there. $250 later, thankfully, he made a full recovery. I didn\u2019t take him back for weeks because I was paranoid. However, I moved closer to the area and decided to give it another shot. Took him back on a Friday. A few days later, I notice he isn\u2019t feeling well & end up having to take him to the emergency vet at 2:30 am. What have you know, Kennel Cough AGAIN.

Our COVID Care protocols have definitely made it much more difficult for our staff to interact with our clients with conversations.  We have really missed these interactions too!  We do feel strongly that our curbside dropoff/pickup services as well as our staff wearing full PPE is in the best interest of our community, our clients, and our staff - but it has definitely left us missing those close interactions and relationship building with our clients.  I'm sorry you missed that too.  We are definitely learning how to best create relationships with our clients in the climate of COVID safety.  Your feedback will be very helpful as we continue to grow and change with these new and ever changing restrictions.\n\nI'm also sorry to hear your pup got cough while he was participating in our services.  This particular strain of cough this year has actually made several national news stories as it has shown up all over the country.  It's been a nasty strain.  We worked very closely with our veterinary advisory team to be sure we were utilizing the absolute best practices in cleanliness and disinfectant protocols throughout our facility.  We also did our best to inform all clients honestly and openly about the outbreak.  We feel very fortunate that we were able to get it under control so quickly because of our amazing veterinary advisory team.  Just like childcare, dog daycare does pose a slightly higher risk of dogs getting upper respiratory infections and sometimes GI upset in group play.  We do our very best to inform our clients of this by having it clearly stated in several places on our General Client Agreement all clients receive and sign before their first day of daycare with us.  While we sincerely wish the bordatella vaccine required by our facility was able to protect against all cough, just like the human flu vaccine, it does not.\n\nAgain, we appreciate your feedback and wish you and your dog well and that you are able to find another facility that suits your needs.  Please let us know if we can help you with any pet care needs in the future."}, "gmap_id": "0x888923bd8bf81a99:0xf88dcba01a8213d"}

However, I found the classes to be ridiculously unprofessional. They charge the going rate, $20 per 1 hour class session for 4 sessions. However, the classes never start on time, the instructor is rarely prepared with her materials, generally she is looking at her phone several times per lesson and disappearing into another room, and 2 of 4 classes ended early. The instructor clearly knows how to train a dog, however this place has a business model based on you dropping your dog off for several weeks and a thousand or more dollars later they train the dog for you. I have no doubt she is exceptionally effective in that environment, but these classes where you learn to train your dog yourself are over complicated, incoherent, and lack any kind of structure. I feel like mostly they are used to get you to admit you need to drop your dog off with them, because that is the only way the dog will get trained. I've had better experiences with a big box store training, and that isn't saying much. There are significantly better training places for the same money with a whole lot less agenda. Hint: look for a non-profit dog obedience and training club.<P>\n\nResponse to the owner:\nFirst off, it's labelled a rolling class. You don't need to offer \"a missed class at no extra charge\", that's part of it being rolling. You show up for 4 classes, whether they are consecutive or not, and I checked ahead of time to make sure that was the case. Second, in 3 of the 4 classes there was no socialization time unless you count the period of time we all waited in the office while the instructor was running late. Ending the class early twice ensured no socialization time. You offer 14 days of board and train for $1100 and 28 days for $2100. Both of those cost more than the thousand dollars I put in my review. So yes, you offer both cheaper and more expensive options, personally I think I hit the middle pretty well with my review. I put in my review you charge the going rate. I don't dispute that. I also said the trainer knows how to train dogs, the trainer simply didn't do much to help people learn to train their own dogs in this one class.

I have called the other puppies in your class period and they have all been exceptionally pleased and have all signed up for additional group classes for continuing education, so I am a bit confused.  I would be more than happy to talk with you about your experience.  I do know that your dog missed a week of Puppy Kindergarten and we were very happy to accommodate your schedule and allow you to makeup your missed class at no additional charge.     Puppy Kindergarten is a socialization and basic manners class and not a true \"training skills\" course.  This is very clear in the description of our class on our website as well as the materials given in each class period.  As mentioned previously, I would be more than happy to speak with you about your experience, please feel free to call the front office at 205-332-0203 and ask for Abigail.  Also, as a note, our day-training program is our most popular program but it is hardly \"thousands of dollars.\"  Most of our clients spend between $250-450 for four weeks of all day training where they drop their dog of several times a week each week.  This is hardly \"thousands of dollars\" and is, in fact, some of the best prices is town.  Our Puppy Kindergarten class is also priced competitively with \"the big box store\" but you are taking this class from one of the most highly experienced and certified canine behavioral consultants in the city.  As an additional note, our prices are less expensive then the Obedience Club in our town, which is not non-profit.

Aidan did a great job and took time to work on things that I specifically was having trouble with when there was not a big class. I took my dog to daycare and the owner, Abigail, stated that he was having trouble and recommended a behaviorist that comes to Roverchase every Thursday and Saturday. The price was $400 dollars which I was happy to pay because I really wanted the best for Blue (my dog). We talked with the behaviorist for about an hour and that was the end of the session. The behaviorist did not really teach or show me anything that I did not already know. The behaviorist did not even see the behavior that I was having trouble with but yet she was quick to write out a treatment plan. The behaviorist did say that I would need to do private lessons with Abigail which is not included in the cost. So for $400 dollars I talked to a lady for an hour. This is a big scam and I am really troubled that Roverchase would be a part of it.\n\nMy appointment lasted 1 hour. We left right after 5 and the appointment started at 4. So go back and check your cameras again. Yes, I was happy to pay the $400 dollars which I stated previously. But I was under the impression that I would get useful information and more than just talking to a \"Behaviorist\" for an hour. Again, how can she, the behaviorist, tell me what is the cause and real problem without even seeing the behavior. I even emailed the behaviorist trying to get a refund because that was not what I was expecting. Not even wanting a full refund because I understand that she did take time out of her day to meet with me. But I think she can keep the $80 dollars deposit and refund the $320 since I do not need her \"expertise\" any longer. But she has not responded to my email which she specifically stated was the best/fastest way to communicate with her. And as far as reviews need to be left honestly and in good faith...I did that. You decided to lie on your response by saying that you checked the cameras and that I was there for a little under 2 hours. Your cameras times are off or you lied. I told you that I actually loved Roverchase. I even recommended people go to y'all which only one of them did but one is better than none. But I do still think that I was scammed.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1525838804535, "text": "Dear Mr. Auer,\nI\u2019m so surprised to read your review regarding your experience with Blue and Dr. Beihunko, Roverchase, and the chain of events you described.  I appreciate you giving me the opportunity on this public platform to respond.\nFirstly, I\u2019m so glad you were pleased with your group classes at Roverchase with our trainer Aidan.  He\u2019s so talented and our clients just adore him.  I\u2019ll be sure to pass on your praise.  Thank you.\nTo address your concerns regarding your experience with Dr. Biehunko, I will do my best to address them in an organized fashion.\n-  I recommended Blue see Dr. Biehunko when Blue presented to daycare last week after a 5 month absence from Roverchase.  Prior to Blue\u2019s absence, we had discussed at length Blue\u2019s increase reactivity and dog related aggression and you indicated you did not want to address it with us at that time but wanted to work with it on your own.  We advised against it.  When you presented last week, Blue came for a day of daycare and was significantly worse in all behaviors.  I recommended a consultation with Alabama\u2019s only Veterinary Behaviorist, Dr. Biehunko.  I thoroughly explained how Dr. Beihunko\u2019s consultations worked, that they were $400 and for that price you received a 1.5-2hr consultation with her expertise and she would make a diagnosis, a treatment plan, and then have 6 months of medical management and follow up.  I was very clear with you that there was no doubt that Blue would need additional lessons with me and that it would be at additional cost.  You remarked that you felt this price was fair for her experience and expertise and made your appointment for later in the week\n- I do rounds with Dr. Biehunko each day for our shared clients.  She had already been thoroughly briefed on Blue\u2019s behavior at Roverchase the day he returned as well as my notes from his behavior in December when we last saw him.\n- Your consultation with Dr. Biehunko was just barely under 2hrs.  I checked the time stamp on our cameras\n- In your consultation with Dr. Biehunko we were all very surprised to hear that you insisted that Blue has received no training outside of his training at Roverchase.  In fact, you insisted this was true even when specifically questioned about this by Dr. Biehunko and the Roverchase trainers who sat in on the session with you.  As I\u2019m sure you know, it\u2019s extremely difficult for any doctor to communicate effectively and efficiently with a client when that client willfully withholds pertinent information from that doctor that impedes the treatment plan.  As you can see from the attached screen shots, not only has Blue been in training with another trainer, but it was for the very issue he was presenting for.\n- Finally, since your consultation was just over 72 hours ago, and we are very clear that treatment plans can take 2-4 weeks to become effective, it\u2019s hard to understand how you can already be so unhappy with your results.\nI certainly believe that pet owners are allowed to train and handle their pets as they see fit and that there are many fits available for many different preferences.  However, I hope we can both agree that reviews need to be left honestly and in good faith and this one has some glaring issues.  I hope, in light of this, and in light of you many months of happiness with Roverchase, you will consider removing it.  We certainly wish you and Blue only the very best and much success in all of your endeavors.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nAbigail Witthauer\nRoverchase\n\nEDIT::  attachment will not post.\nDescription of photo attachment:  Blue the dog on a trainers business page looking at the screen wl a clearly visible electronic training collar, caption from the trainer, \u201cBlue the Australian Cattle Dog rocked his first lesson.

Yesterday, her amniotic fluid broke at about 1:35 pm. We called you around 5:30 pm to find out if her condition is normal. Your doctor is very sure to tell us not to worry. It will be around 1:30 in the evening. It \u2019s been 12 hours. When I called your doctor again and left a phone number for us, we called for a long time before contacting your doctor, but he still said everything was normal. He only helped to find the contact method of the pet emergency room, but during the two prenatal inspections of iris before, we twice asked you to help us find a contact method for the emergency room. You said that even if there is a problem, you can do it at night Calling you, you also have an emergency room at night, saying that she will have no problems with the second production. Even if there is a problem, you can help me at night. I believe you, because Iris has been here to check with you . But last night when we needed you most, I took a long time to contact you. I also thank you for helping me find the emergency room contact method at the end, but just when we were going to see the emergency department When Iris left us, I always wondered why during the two prenatal check-ups, we asked for an emergency room contact method. You only gave me your outpatient phone number, and I remember I told you that It \u2019s just that Iris can contact the doctor who can help her when the 1% you said needs the doctor \u2019s help. You said you can help her even at night, but when Iris needs the doctor \u2019s help most, where are you , Did you know that because we spent the time to rescue her in the most urgent time, if you can help me find the emergency room contact method, at least Iris still has the hope of survival, and May continue to be with us. Do you know that iris is like our daughter in our hearts? Do you know how helpless we are when we watch iris walk away in front of us? I want to ask you Where is the night emergency? I want to ask if your commitment is really so worth mentioning? Iris just had her two-year-old birthday last month. She is still so young, and the baby in her stomach has a total of 9 lives. Just say that it is gone? ?\n\n(Original)\n\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u4f60\u4eec\u8fd8\u8bb0\u5f97iris\u5417\uff1f\u6628\u59291:35pm\u5de6\u53f3\u5979\u7684\u7f8a\u6c34\u7834\u4e86\uff0c\u57285:30pm\u5de6\u53f3\u6211\u4eec\u6253\u7535\u8bdd\u7ed9\u4f60\u4eec\uff0c\u60f3\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u5979\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u6b63\u5e38\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u533b\u751f\u5f88\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u7528\u62c5\u5fc3\uff0c\u7b49\u5230\u4e86\u665a\u4e0a1:30\u5de6\u53f3\u5df2\u7ecf12\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u4e86\u5f53\u6211\u518d\u4e00\u6b21\u6253\u7ed9\u4f60\u4eec\u533b\u751f\u7559\u4e2a\u6211\u7684\u7535\u8bdd\u53f7\u7801\u6211\u4eec\u6253\u4e86\u597d\u51e0\u4e45\u624d\u8054\u7cfb\u5230\u4f60\u4eec\u7684\u533b\u751f\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4ed6\u8fd8\u662f\u8bf4\u4e00\u5207\u6b63\u5e38\uff0c\u90a3\u65f6\u6211\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u975e\u5e38\u7684\u62c5\u5fc3\u7684\u8bf4\u4e86iris\u7684\u72b6\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ed6\u624d\u5e2e\u5fd9\u627e\u5ba0\u7269\u6025\u8bca\u5ba4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u4e4b\u524diris\u7684\u4e24\u6b21\u4ea7\u524d\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e24\u6b21\u8981\u6c42\u4f60\u4eec\u5e2e\u6211\u4eec\u627e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6025\u8bca\u5ba4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u8bf4\u5c31\u7b97\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u665a\u4e0a\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6253\u7535\u8bdd\u7ed9\u4f60\u4eec\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u4e5f\u6709\u665a\u4e0a\u6025\u8bca\uff0c\u8bf4\u5979\u662f\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u751f\u4ea7\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u7684\uff0c\u5c31\u7b97\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u4f60\u4eec\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u5230\u6211\u5728\u665a\u4e0a\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u6211\u76f8\u4fe1\u4f60\u4eec\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3airis\u4e00\u76f4\u5230\u5728\u4f60\u4eec\u8fd9\u91cc\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u6628\u665a\u6211\u4eec\u6700\u9700\u8981\u4f60\u4eec\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u6211\u5374\u82b1\u4e86\u5f88\u957f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6765\u8054\u7cfb\u5230\u4f60\u4eec\uff0c\u6211\u4e5f\u611f\u8c22\u4f60\u5728\u6700\u540e\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5e2e\u6211\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u6025\u8bca\u5ba4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5c31\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u51c6\u5907\u53bb\u770b\u6025\u8bca\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0ciris\u79bb\u5f00\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\uff0c\u6211\u4e00\u76f4\u60f3\u4e0d\u660e\u767d\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5728\u4e24\u6b21\u4ea7\u524d\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8981\u6c42\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u6025\u8bca\u5ba4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u53ea\u7ed9\u6211\u4f60\u4eec\u95e8\u8bca\u7684\u7535\u8bdd\u53f7\u7801\uff0c\u6211\u4e5f\u8bb0\u5f97\u6211\u544a\u8bc9\u4f60\u4eec\u6211\u53ea\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86iris\u5728\u90a3\u4e2a\u4f60\u8bf4\u76841%\u9700\u8981\u533b\u751f\u5e2e\u5fd9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u53ef\u4ee5\u53ca\u65f6\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u5230\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u5979\u7684\u533b\u751f\uff0c\u4f60\u8bf4\u4f60\u4eec\u5c31\u7b97\u665a\u4e0a\u4e5f\u80fd\u5e2e\u52a9\u5979\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728iris\u6700\u9700\u8981\u533b\u751f\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u5728\u54ea\u91cc\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u77e5\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u5c31\u56e0\u4e3a\u5728\u6700\u7d27\u6025\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u6211\u4eec\u5374\u628a\u6551\u5979\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u82b1\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u4f60\u4eec\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5f53\u521d\u4f60\u4eec\u80fd\u5e2e\u6211\u627e\u5230\u6025\u8bca\u5ba4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6700\u8d77\u7801iris\u8fd8\u6709\u8fd8\u6709\u751f\u8fd8\u7684\u5e0c\u671b\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u7ee7\u7eed\u966a\u7740\u6211\u4eec\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u77e5\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053iris\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u5fc3\u91cc\u5c31\u50cf\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5973\u513f\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u77e5\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u5f53\u6211\u4eec\u770b\u7740iris\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u9762\u524d\u8d70\u6389\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6709\u591a\u4e48\u7684\u65e0\u52a9\uff0c\u6211\u60f3\u95ee\u4e00\u4e0b\u4f60\u4eec\u7684\u591c\u95f4\u6025\u8bca\u5728\u54ea\u91cc\uff1f\u6211\u60f3\u95ee\u4e00\u4e0b\u4f60\u4eec\u7684\u627f\u8bfa\u771f\u7684\u90a3\u4e48\u7684\u4e0d\u503c\u4e00\u63d0\u5417\uff1firis\u4e0a\u4e2a\u6708\u624d\u521a\u521a\u8fc7\u5b8c\u4e24\u5c81\u751f\u65e5\uff0c\u5979\u8fd8\u90a3\u4e48\u7684\u5e74\u8f7b\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u5979\u809a\u5b50\u7684\u5b9d\u5b9d\u4e00\u51719\u4e2a\u751f\u547d\u5c31\u8fd9\u6837\u8bf4\u6ca1\u5c31\u6ca1\u4e86\uff1f\uff1f", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqrw1lZDy-F6zdTa1maPazMceFDAxwqT7gPmwE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5cnLAoRvm1zfI4SsQ3oea6mmJVfLImXA6YSWC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQHxQbvSB4xAyHGvmP21FN8NAZUoyTLfAs9sCn=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2c721ffc03fb:0xd9657e4b494a3bd3"}

Prince even threw up soon as he got inside of the car once I picked him up from the groomers. He seemed so out of it yesterday ! Not sure if this place gives dogs anything to sedate them but that should definitely be discussed if so! Especially on an empty stomach! I was told to bring him him at 10:30 am but was told that he had 15 dogs in front of him so he\u2019ll be ready by 6 pm (closing) which is definitely no problem but That\u2019s a very long time to go without food or water.
