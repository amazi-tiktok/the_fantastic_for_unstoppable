His estimate was very reasonable, so we asked him to perform the work. To say that we were thrilled with the finished product is an extreme understatement. The set looked better than brand new. We then asked him to do a much harder job, refinishing a hard maple dining room pedestal table and four unmatching chairs (in finish and type of wood) in a stain to match a dining room china cabinet. To make matters even worse, one of the leg bases had been chewed on quite vigorously by a new puppy. Once again, Nick's work was unsurpassed and his estimate was right on.
