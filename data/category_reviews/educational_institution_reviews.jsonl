I had a scheduled meeting with the admissions office to get information about their vet program since they were unable to send information through the mail. When I first arrived, I had to fill out a life questionnaire and turn it in. Once I got in my meeting, 95% of the meeting was asking rather personal questions about my personal life rather than going over what the school had to offer me. I was told I would need 2 vehicles to attend. Within 10 minutes of my scheduled meeting, the advisor asked me to hold on so she can go consult another \"potential student\" who had a meeting. After waiting in my scheduled meeting for several minutes while she talks to another potential student (which made me feel like I wasn't important) she returns to finally start reviewing about the program. About 5 minutes in, she left the meeting again to talk to a different \"potential\" student. I was told they do not hire teachers, they hire professionals that only require 3 years of training. I asked several times about financial aid options and was given no information. I then inquired about how I could use this program as a bridge to become a future vet and the lady told me that being a vet was hard work and lots of money and it probably wont happen for me. She mentioned that once I graduate, they could not guarantee me a job. Then when she realized that I was only there for information and not immediately ready to start, she shut the whole meeting down and told me that there are people waiting in the lobby who want to start classes now and require her attention more than I and to return when I am ready. She quickly handed me a brochure and I left. I would not recommended this school to anyone. Very unprofessional!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626957c65de5f1:0x352012e0212f404d"}

Not even a fridge or microwave to bring our lunch. i would bring my lunch if i had a way to keep it cold or heat it up. If your thirsty and need something to drink we have to walk next door.

I had a scheduled meeting with the admissions office to get information about their vet program since they were unable to send information through the mail. When I first arrived, I had to fill out a life questionnaire and turn it in. Once I got in my meeting, 95% of the meeting was asking rather personal questions about my personal life rather than going over what the school had to offer me. I was told I would need 2 vehicles to attend. Within 10 minutes of my scheduled meeting, the advisor asked me to hold on so she can go consult another \"potential student\" who had a meeting. After waiting in my scheduled meeting for several minutes while she talks to another potential student (which made me feel like I wasn't important) she returns to finally start reviewing about the program. About 5 minutes in, she left the meeting again to talk to a different \"potential\" student. I was told they do not hire teachers, they hire professionals that only require 3 years of training. I asked several times about financial aid options and was given no information. I then inquired about how I could use this program as a bridge to become a future vet and the lady told me that being a vet was hard work and lots of money and it probably wont happen for me. She mentioned that once I graduate, they could not guarantee me a job. Then when she realized that I was only there for information and not immediately ready to start, she shut the whole meeting down and told me that there are people waiting in the lobby who want to start classes now and require her attention more than I and to return when I am ready. She quickly handed me a brochure and I left. I would not recommended this school to anyone. Very unprofessional!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626957c65de5f1:0x352012e0212f404d"}

Then on top of that the higher up people want to say it is important to eat but we have no machines for food , or drinks for our breaks. Not even a fridge or microwave to bring our lunch. i would bring my lunch if i had a way to keep it cold or heat it up. If your thirsty and need something to drink we have to walk next door.

Mrs. B is the same way and is very helpful as well. The Only DOWNFALL is our break.  i understand time management and everything else but how do you expect people to go get lunch and eat it within TEN MINUTES. Then on top of that the higher up people want to say it is important to eat but we have no machines for food , or drinks for our breaks. Not even a fridge or microwave to bring our lunch. i would bring my lunch if i had a way to keep it cold or heat it up. If your thirsty and need something to drink we have to walk next door. If we had a fridge or a microwave it would probably cut down on money for everyone and stop students being out of the classroom longer than the scheduled ten minutes.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626957c65de5f1:0x352012e0212f404d"}

After waiting in my scheduled meeting for several minutes while she talks to another potential student (which made me feel like I wasn't important) she returns to finally start reviewing about the program. About 5 minutes in, she left the meeting again to talk to a different \"potential\" student. I was told they do not hire teachers, they hire professionals that only require 3 years of training. I asked several times about financial aid options and was given no information. I then inquired about how I could use this program as a bridge to become a future vet and the lady told me that being a vet was hard work and lots of money and it probably wont happen for me. She mentioned that once I graduate, they could not guarantee me a job. Then when she realized that I was only there for information and not immediately ready to start, she shut the whole meeting down and told me that there are people waiting in the lobby who want to start classes now and require her attention more than I and to return when I am ready.
