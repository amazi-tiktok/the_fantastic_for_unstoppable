The staff helped at the front with changing my membership from another location. There seemed to be plenty of space. I didn't have to wait on anyone, which is number one for me at any fitness center. Social distance measures were decent, as can be expected. The only real issue that bothered me was that one employee was talking to a customer waiting to go into the spa while I was trying to leave, and he walked in front of me three times going back and forth from the other customer and the counter, as if he couldn't see me. He didn't speak to me at all. I didn't find it very professional to be cutting customers off repeatedly and not saying excuse me or anything, just expecting me to continue to move and go around after already changing directions without even acknowledging me there. It would've been much better if he had the conversation with the customer at the counter, at the table, said \"excuse me,\" or even \"sorry about that,\" anything really to let me know I was valued as much as the person he was talking to and not just in his way. Things like that irk me, especially as a customer. Other than that though, pretty great first-time experience. If it doesn't get too much busier without being expanded, then I'll plan on this being my main gym. Oh, one more thing, I wish they had the treadmills like Midtown.
