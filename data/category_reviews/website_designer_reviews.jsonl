They did no work to the computer. I found this shady to say the least given the fact they did no work. I called and after being passed off to four different people I questioned the deposit. I was told by all four people that the deposit was necessary because people bring their computers there and never come to pick them up. I pointed out that was not the case here. I then asked if I could come there and purchase the power supply for $80 minus the $35 that had already been paid. At first the answer was yes you can do that but we won\u2019t guarantee the part. I said I was fine with that. As the conversation progressed and I pressed for a solid answer on the purchase person number four (apparently the top of the ladder there) he began to to fish tail. He said power supplies can range in price. I reminded him the technician actually showed the power supply to my son that was needed for his computer. The price tag said $80. He said you can bring the computer back and we will look at it before the EOB today. At this point I wouldn\u2019t trust these people to hold a penny. Person number four hung up me. It\u2019s a scam.

This did not satisfy you either.  Services have been offered multiple times.  The bench fee is clearly covered at drop off and with signs on the counter at drop off.

You know how much I appreciate you and your kind words. It pains me that small business owners spend their advertising and marketing dollars where they are ineffective. I hear horror stories like these from potential clients on a regular basis. I always advise them, whether they hire me or not, to \"do this and do that\" and \"ask this and ask that\" BEFORE selecting their next marketing agency. There are simply too many marketing service providers that over promise and under deliver, selling services that they know are not in the best interest of their clients. Even worse, many so-called \"web marketing\" agencies are experienced only with \"traditional\" marketing such as print, radio, or television, but expanded their services into the web arena in order to survive (or be more profitable). While most of these agencies are excellent at providing \"traditional\" marketing services, many of them are wholly unqualified to provide any type of online marketing services. They might be able to produce a \"pretty\" website, but that is a far cry from what is required to implement a successful, comprehensive web marketing campaign.

So, I contacted Eric Hughes because I had seen some of his work and asked him if he would be interested in looking this over and give me an idea of what it might cost for a makeover. It needed a special something to make it look more interesting.  Eric reviewed what I had and gave me a cost that I could handle, and then he asked to give him a couple of weeks to work with it. When he got back to me (a little sooner that a couple of weeks), it looked very much better. He also created some spots that needed content, which I found and forwarded to him. He plugged them in and the website looked very much nicer than before and he did it within the budget figure, too, so we ran with it. I sent a note to my friend in NYC to critique it.

I built my PC and I know what I'm doing, I only took it to them because i hoped the actual professionals could find the problem. I dropped it off and told them a little about the problem and they told me they shoot for 24-48hr repairs and there was a $30 minimum diagnostics fee. I agreed and left. They did the same troubleshooting things that I did and came to the same conclusion I did: a new motherboard would fix the problem. I accepted my fate. That was on Friday. On Monday I called and asked if there were anymore developments. They said the motherboard was the issue and that I could pick it up. I asked if the 30 dollars included tax. They said because it was an extended diagnostics period that the fee was now 45, to which I never agreed. I paid it anyway and when I got home I realized a fan was disconnected and so was my RGB LED strip. They didnt put them back the way I left it. On top of that, the pin header for the strip was bent and it snapped off when I tried putting it back in. I booted my system up using a different CPU and it worked fine, only I kept getting some error that wasn't there before. The broken pin and the error wasn't their fault, but they should've plugged the fan and strip back in and properly informed me  about the price hike from 30 to 45 dollars before I agreed to their terms. 3 stars because of the problems mentioned but I wont drop it down worse because I dont know how they could have fixed my computer. They certainly didn't make it better, though. The customer service was good.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889243d635c14c5:0x94dae1d420dfda8d"}
