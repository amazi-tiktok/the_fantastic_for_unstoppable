After 20 minutes of running the saw broke and needed a new head.\n\nFirst Stihl gave me a hard time about the saw, made me take pictures of an obviously brand new saw and after a lot of hull-a-ba-loo agreed to fix the saw.\n\nThen they had Electrical Outlet fix it.  It took Electrical Outlet six months to fix the saw.\n\nWent back into Electrical Outlet today (a year later after the saw fiasco) and put $300 dollars worth of material into my buggy.\n\nI went to get a log chain and requested help from the owner, a Mr. Alexander.\n\nHe helped me get the chain and I requested help obtaining hooks to put on the end of the chain.\n\nI had some reservations about the eye hooks, such as would they be as sturdy as the chain itself.  What type was better, etc.\n\nDuring this question session three men came up to us and interrupted our conversation.  Mr. Alexander then just left me standing there with a couple of different hooks in my hand and walked away to discuss college football with what were apparently his friends.\n\nSo, I shopped a bit more, patiently waited at the front desk while these four people gabbed about college football.\n\nWhen Mr. Alexander finally decided to check me out I indicated I was not happy with his leaving me standing there.\n\nWhile explaining this I did not raise my voice or act rudely, I simply told him I wasn't happy with the service level provided.\n\nIt was at this time that Mr. Alexander decided to go ballistic on me.\n\nI got a good reaming out by him.  For good measure he also tossed in a few choice four letter words.\n\nI told him that I was having a difficult time being calm with him.\n\nTo that he pointed at the door and told me to get out.\n\nI then told him about my chain saw experience and that I had refrained from criticizing the store about the poor service because one of his young employees had been very nice to me during a weather emergency we had April 27th, 2011.\n\nOnce again I got told where the door was and to use it.\n\nSo, I proceeded to do so.\n\nAs I was opening the door he shouted at me \"You must be another one of those Terry's\".  I promptly told him who I was and spelled my name out for him.\n\nI try to support local businesses, but he effectively sent me next door to Tractor Supply (where I got everything I came to town for anyway).  Guess it will be Tractor Supply or Lowes in the big city from here on out.\n\nGood luck with your attitude Mr. Alexander.

When arriving the owner approached us and apologized for it being disorderly. Another nice gentleman approached us and informed us of all the areas available to be seen. While speaking to both men we informed him of the interest we had in the reclaimed lumber and that we custom make them ourselves back home. He gave us pricing on what he had and told us to check out the shop area and to let him know if we needed help with any lumber. We also refinish furniture for a living and are on the look out for good fixer uppers to refinish and resell. So we walked around the top and bottom floor. They had nothing of good quality to choose from. We then made our way out to the \"OPEN TO THE PUBLIC COME ON IN\" shop area. The craftsmanship done by his employees was great and we were simply admiring the work done. NO PHONE, NO CAMERA simply looking and out of no where the owner comes up to my husband and tells him \"IF YOU ARENT HERE TO BUY YOU NEED TO LEAVE\" \"WE BUILD CUSTOM TABLES FOR CLIENTS\" \"WE ARE A CHRISTIAN BASED COMPANY AND WE DONT NEED ANYONE STEALING OUR DESIGNS\" Now if I was taking pictures of this mans work I could understand his hostility but we weren't we were simply browsing his shop, custom tables, painted furniture and doors as we were told to do. Then he approaches me and tells me if I'm not here to buy anything from him to leave right now and never come back. He turns back around to my husband who was holding our 1 year old in his arms and leans in like he is about to grab him and yells to my husband to walk faster and to get out. While this place looks great in pictures it is not what they display online. How this man stays in business talking to customers the way he does is unreal to me. Christian business?!?

Marquez was extremely helpful!  I can't rave about him enough.  My issue came when I was told my dishwasher was in stock in Bham but due to the holidays their 1 installer wouldn't be able to install until after all the holidays.  Okay, I understood the desire to take a break and be with family.  After January 4th I still never heard from anyone to schedule my install.  I finally called on January on January 8th to track down someone to help get this installed.  They were able to come install my dishwasher on the 13th.  The gentlemen that installed my NEW Bosch dishwasher made me aware that the 3rd row was shipped with broken clips so it wouldn't work but that's okay they would have someone come right back out to fix the issue.  After several days of no communication I once again called the store and was told oh yea Shane can come out on January 25th.  Great! Finally I will be able to use my new dishwasher properly.  Shane arrives on the 25th with a 3rd row for the dishwasher.  He was NOT informed properly of the problem and only had the drawer itself.  So once again Im left with a dishwasher that can not be utilized to the fullest.  Shane tells me he will go back to the shop and grab the clips off of another dishwasher and be back to fix the issue.  I wait and wait.  I finally get a hold of Mike on February 5th.  He informs me that the job has been listed as complete!!!  There was no order to get new clips there was nothing listed as needing to still be fixed.  Mike tells me that he will call me back before the end of day OR call me on Monday February 8th to tell me what can be done.  Again, I wait!  I called today the 12th a FULL MONTH after my dishwasher was installed.  Mike tells me oh those clips are on back order.  I asked for some type of date as to expect them he states could be end of February.\nMy issue is the POOR COMMUNICATION!!!!   1st. the installer NEVER reported the correct issue with my dishwasher had he done so properly Shane would never have come to my house with the wrong part.  2nd Shane completed the job.  This is a HUGE FAIL!!!  3rd. Mike never contacted me to let me know there is no part readily available and it will be back ordered.  When I reached out as I've had to do every since they took my money back in December Mike acted a little confused to why I would be calling.\n\nI expect better when paying for a top of the line appliance.  I've gotten better service from a big box store!  I understand parts get broken in the box and no one is aware but this should've been taken care of in January! This was NOT a warranty issue as it was delivered to me broken!!! The product was not ever used.  I am NOT happy that I will have to wait until March to fully use my dishwasher the proper way.  The whole reason I came to All South was the earliest Bob Wallace could get the dishwasher installed was March 4th!!!  If I had known I would be stuck until March to begin with I would've gave Bob Wallace my money!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b91b8998ea1:0x1c5adc2f08bde249"}

All they had to do was install three appliances.  THREE.  The only thing these jag-offs got right was the delivery of the appliances and *sliding in* our new oven.  The dishwasher and microwave were both dropped.  This was obvious because (a) we saw the palette in our garage prior to installation, (b) one side of the palette was \"injured\", (c) the corresponding sides of the appliances from that side of the palette were both broken.\n\nTo add insult to injury, they didn't use the granite counter installation kit for the dishwasher.  This would help considering they don't want to fix the broken feet.  Now, when you open a loaded dishwasher, the whole machine rotates thereby \"dishcharging\" the bottom rack of dishes out onto your floor.  This is entertaining to guests.\n\nThe microwave is also fun.  The plate does not rotate properly so you can always tell when it's in use because of the \"thump-thump\" made by the turntable, much like a broken record but without the repetitive music.  Also, the clock is crooked so you can't tell if it's AM or PM (which actually matters during the winter when it's dark at 5AM and 5PM).  And the oven vent built into the microwave is broken so it slides right out after only unfastening two screws when it should be held together by four screws.  The other two take bits of the broken plastic housing with them.\n\nNormally I wouldn't care because these appliances are \"builder grade\" but it's the principle of the matter.  Allsouth is not interested in fixing or replacing the appliances which can be done EXTREMELY EASILY when you're a flippin' vendor.  They're only interested in minimalist work, single trips, and offering to \"send out an inspector\" which was already been done by the builder who verified that the pieces are indeed broken.  We're guessing Allsouth doesn't trust the builder that hired them in the first place.  They also will not come out on your time, only their time, so if you work and are busy from 8am to 5pm, you can bet you'll never see nor hear from them again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b91b8998ea1:0x1c5adc2f08bde249"}

I took time off from work to be here and now will have to do it again for when they are able to come and make the repair.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b91b8998ea1:0x1c5adc2f08bde249"}

I called 11/20/19 to get a lumber package delivered to save some time. I knew it would be a bit more expensive but more convenient.

Second call was about 12:30 pm, third call was at 3:00 I was told he was still with a customer. I asked the person on the phone to please tell him so that I could hear him answer I needed a call back today, and he did. 3:30 pm Dino calls I explain 15 boards were to be pressure treated and the delivery was in the wrong spot (address) I was then argued with that I didn\u2019t order pressure treated I wrote down the prices quoted and if it wasn\u2019t p.t it was expensive white wood. He put me on hold when he came back to the phone he said the contractor that came in and paid told him the location. I explained it was all done over the phone and there was only me. Where he described is exactly where I told him to put it. Unfortunately that\u2019s not where it was put. He said he would call me back and get it straightened out. No call back, so 11/22/19 I called and left a message with a nice young lady for the sales manager.(I was told his name is Jason).No call back!! I go to see if the package has been moved that afternoon. I have pressure treated wood but package not moved. So much for convenience. Now I will have to pay someone to move the wood.

I counted that I needed 144 planks for my front fence and about 15 additional to complete the side fence for a total of 161 planks.

SHe called the owners daughter and I was told she would allow me to purchase but  100 planks. Do what? No sign that says there is a limit, she never mentioned it to me on the phone when I called so she just decided that she would :\"allow\" me to purchase 100 because she wanted to save the others she had just in case a contractor of hers needed them..

While the two employees working the office could not provide a solution to my issue they asked for me to leave my contact information with them, and provided the business card for a coworker that might be able to help. I was told they would have that person give me a call to set up an appointment to have someone come out to my house to see if they can troubleshoot my issue and possibly come up with a solution. After nearly a week there has been no communication from them. Instead, I had to call the person on the business card only to then be told he was not the right person and that he needed to have someone else call me back instead. Still waiting on that call back. My problem is that I bought a set of glass fireplace doors for my fireplace that I should be able to easily install myself, but they do not fit by just a few millimeters in height. I have double checked that I got the correct doors. I know the manufacturer and model number of my fireplace, so I bought the coordinating doors for my fireplace. I am worried that the fireplace and/or tile surround was not done properly and therefore might be the cause of my issue.
