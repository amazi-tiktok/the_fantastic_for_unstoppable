But today my fryer don\u2019t work again, I called up there and ask for service, they just told me can\u2019t do any service for us no more, I asked why is there any reason to make y\u2019all to do this to me? They just kept saying sorry we can\u2019t do any service for you no more. I don\u2019t really understand so I questioning him why? He told me he don\u2019t want to argue with me, just they don\u2019t service us no more. Wow..\n\nThat\u2019s ridiculous. First, we never yelled out anybody . Second we gave you guys credit card info to trust you guys to charge us for service. Third the last time service which is couple days ago he couldn\u2019t find the problem for the fryer So I asked him before he leave what if the fryer stop working again, he told me just call office for service. Then I ask him how about the charge? He answered he will not charge me this time but he doesn\u2019t know if his boss going to charge or not. So I will just say thanks to him because I knew there is a fee for came out.  But I don\u2019t think I will have a problem with you guys to collet the bills.

Our rates were explained in advance and the technician clearly explained what was needed to repair the equipment prior to doing the repair. We were given the go ahead to proceed with the repair, but when the repair was complete the technician was told he would not be paid for the parts or service. Therefore we can no longer provide service to you. We will not send our technicians into that environment again."}, "gmap_id": "0x888c2bb81677b8e1:0xfb06d9389264bcb7"}

My refrigerator stopped cooling and the freezer stopped working. I was unable to reach the company on the phone and did not get a callback from the message I left, so I scheduled an appointment online. This was on 11/30/20. Tech came out on 12/4/20 and determined that the compressor was bad and needed to be replaced. they had to order parts. After finally getting the parts, a different tech came out on 1/20/21. He said the compressor was working and some boards needed to be replaced. Again, parts had to be ordered. A while after the expected parts delivery date, I called for an update and was told the parts were in.  An appointment was scheduled for the following week on 3/1/21. On the morning of the appointment, the tech called me and said that the parts were not in and cancelled the appointment. At this point, I was livid and called Kitchen Aid directly to complain. They called S&S and basically were told that the parts were never ordered. So again, I had to wait for parts. On 4/2/21, I received an email that the parts were in and a link to schedule an appointment. I tried calling, but again, got no one and I left a message. I never received a call back. I tried again the following day, but still could not get anyone on the phone. I went ahead and scheduled an appointment for 4/15/21.

When I called It was an extremely long wait, but after 30 min of waiting and I was finally connected to Natoshia she was very professional and understanding and got me moved up by a day. So finally the man John came and looked at the dryer he said it was the timer and door switch and that he would have to order the parts and it would take a week.\n\nAfter he left they ordered the part and scheduled me for another two weeks out.\nThe day of the appointment arrived and I got an email saying my appointment was canceled because part was on back order and so they rescheduled me for another two weeks out.\nThey had the part in a week before my actual appointment. So on the date of my appointment he called and told me it was miss-boxed so it\u2019s the wrong part and would take another 4weeks to get the part in!!!!!\n\nI stayed calm and called whirlpool and told them what was going on and they shipped the part out to me within 2 weeks.\nHe came yesterday put it on and now he says the dryer needs a new start button and a fan is broken\nSo he couldn\u2019t see all the problems when he first came in NOVEMBER and looked at the dryer?\nSo now I\u2019m stuck waiting AGAIN! But before John left he said he found the parts local in Birmingham and that he would try to get someone to go get them so he can come back the next day and install it.\n\nI called today and got connected with a woman named Tammy and I explained the situation to her and she responded \u201cwell there\u2019s nothing we can do, we\u2019re ordering the part and we\u2019ll schedule you for feb 3. Maybe you\u2019ll get lucky and get it in on time\u201d I told her what John said to me and she said \u201cwell ma\u2019am we have to order them so you\u2019ll have to wait\u201d I replied to her that I can call whirlpool and get the parts sent within 5days that way they can come install it she said \u201cno ma\u2019am and if you get the parts yourself (from the manufacture) that it will void my warranty!\n\nBut That\u2019s what I did with the other part and he came and installed it so I don\u2019t know what the difference is.\n\nI understand COVID has put a strain on a lot of things right now and I\u2019ve been very patient and understanding with this company but it shouldn\u2019t take 5months to fix a dryer!!! And today after the way that lady\u2019s treated me I am furious. I will never use this company again and have called whirlpool and made them very aware of what\u2019s happened and how I was treated they completely agreed it was unacceptable and after they finish this job they will no longer match me with S&S for my repair needs.\n\nIf nothing is done by February 3rd they will schedule me with another company.\n\nThe only reason I give this company two starts is because of Natoshia, she understands how hard and costly it is not having your appliances when having a large family and tried her best to help.\n\nCovid  can\u2019t be an excuse for everything, I suggest you hire some more technicians so customers aren\u2019t waiting two weeks just to get their appliances looked at and I also suggest you hire more professional people to answer your phones.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888df132a70994f:0xdc635790045d61d7"}

With warranty covered service calls, we don't collect ANY money until the job is complete (with customer pay calls we collect the service call fee on the front end but don't collect parts and labor until the job is complete). In fact, we have to spend money to send a tech out to the house to diagnose (salary for tech and office staff, gas, time, etc.) and we pay for the parts on the front end. So until the job is complete and we are able to bill the warranty provider for it, we are in the hole financially on a job while we are waiting for parts. Manufacturing disruptions and distribution delays are a real thing we're dealing with- Google \"appliance parts shortage\" and there are many articles done by national publications regarding it. We cant just order parts from \"any company\", we have to order genuine parts from the manufacturer or an approved distributor. the parts shortage has had ripple effect throughout our business that has been an incredible challenge to deal with. Calls that would normally take a week from start to finish are now taking months, customers appointments get pushed back again and again because a date we were told a part would be in gets changed at the last minute and we have to call or email the customer to reschedule, more phone traffic to schedule/reschedule/update customers has led to much longer than normal wait times when calling our office, the list is almost endless of how it has affected our business this year.\n\nMs. Lewis, I just want to say that our company doesn't \"suck\". We are a family owned business that has been in operating for 60 years, and we didn't do that by \"scamming\" customers. Everyone that works here has a home and a family and knows what it is like for a major appliance to go out- it stinks and we want it to be fixed for you. We truly do care about our customers and are doing out best to get everyone taken care of but we are absolutely going though a really challenging time right now trying to overcome this obstacle with parts. I really do hate that it has caused you to have a bad experience but I hope that you will keep this in mind and show patience and empathy towards businesses in a time when there are so many small businesses going though challenges that they could have never prepared for and that you might not be aware of."}, "gmap_id": "0x8888df132a70994f:0xdc635790045d61d7"}

Got someone else to come out and a bearing had to be replaced.\nAlso complained my fridge was too new and didn\u2019t know how to work on it.\nThen after having service for years with my extended warranty all they had to do was come in and repair the appliance and leave and collect their check. They went out of their way to report back to the warranty provider that there is a business in the home, that in no way uses the appliances, just to get my warranty canceled. Who does that?! They intentionally set out to get all my warranties canceled that I had been carrying and renewing for years. The warranty provider said it would have been fine if they hadn\u2019t known but technically they can\u2019t honor warranties if there is a business in the home. They didn\u2019t know why the repairman took the time to report me. This repair man took the time to get my warranties voided even though it had nothing to do with the business. Biggest bunch of jerks I\u2019ve ever met. I hope they go bankrupt tomorrow. Avoid at all possible costs.

I read the reviews and thought Oh great-here we go.  I was pleasantly surprised that they called when they were on their way, the customer service people were quite nice and the service guy seemed knowledgeable. He arrived on time, and upon inspection of the stove, found a wire that had shorted out.  The previous week, out of nowhere the stove flipped the breaker and blew sparks all over my kitchen.  He fixed that and left-after ensuring the stove could be turned on without the breaker flipping again.  After he left, I kept noticing that something smelled like it was getting hot so I checked on the stove.  The oven was fine and no smell was coming from it.  However, when I stood in front of the stove to check the oven, I immediately felt heat coming from the warming drawer-even though it was off.  Somehow, either the original problem that the tech didn't find or something he did bypassed the off button on the warming drawer and had it on high all the time with no way to turn it off.  Had I not been home, in all likelihood, we would have had a house fire.  I tried to call him back on his cell and he didn't answer and the company had closed and doesn't have an after hours/emergency number (it was a Saturday when they came and they must close at noon).  DON'T use this company or if you do, make sure you are home the rest of the day in case something like this happens to you.\n\nThe home warranty dispatched a different company after I let the have it and the second guy found the problem-when the stove flipped the breaker and blew sparks everywhere, apparently it fused part of the circuit board so the warming drawer was on-and on high-all the time.  The guy from S and S didn't even look at the circuit boards and didn't stick around long enough to tell there was a problem.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888df132a70994f:0xdc635790045d61d7"}

He could not remember which wire went to what...  he was so short that I had to give him a chair to stand on to service the fridge...  I tried to explain to him that certain wires did not belong in that area but he was a know it all and put the fridge back together in the way that he wanted...  he then told a family member that was at the home that he could keep the old door at my home to use the door for fishing and to scale fish with the door.  I then asked him to take the door with him because I did not need trash in my home and I am not a hoarder....  he rudely ask my family member if he wanted to keep the door my family said it doesn\u2019t matter to him so the repair guy left the door in my home!!!!!! I tried  explaining to the repair guy that the  door open indicator light should go off instantly when the door is closed.  He continued to work on the light and became very frustrated with me because the indicator light stayed on at least three minutes with the door closed completely..... indicating that the door was still open. I tried to FURTHER explain to the repair guy that  The doors were not aligned properly.  He insisted that the indicator light was to stay on two minutes at most and he was pleased after the light went off and he went home.... I was Livid!!!!!!!!!!  LONG STORY SHORT..... the fridge is now broken!!!! The motor hasn\u2019t turned on I since Monday and the fridge is like a Sona. The ice maker has leaked water all over the floor about 2 weeks after the repair.... the opened door light indicator never worked properly after his repair. and no lights come on other than the interior... and the entire fridge QUIT on Monday....... an 8months NEW fridge...... THANKS REPAIR MAN...... for nothing...!!!!!!!... water on the floor and soaked through floor....... 200 dollars in fresh food RUINED!!!!!

He did not do anything to the washer and just said that he would not be able to come back for another week. He needed to order parts.

Their website says you can schedule a service within two days, it took us weeks before someone was able to come out.  I own a WhirlPool front loading washing machine and the bearing is slowly fading and it makes a lot of noise.  It's loud but it works.  Today, I was told someone will show up between 8am and 12pm.  He did not show up until 2pm.  During the next hour, he disassembled the washing machine.  After about an hour, he told me that headquarters needed him to finish his other jobs, so he left my washing machine disassembled and started his next jobs.  About 530pm he called and said he had one more stop and then will be over.  At 645PM he called again saying he will come back but only to put the washing machine back together.  Around this time I was hungry and went to get food where I noticed he did not turn off the water and it had slowly leaked on the floor.  I cleaned this up and turned off the nozzle.  When he finally returned, he did not clean up any of the water on the floor and started to put the washing machine back together.  Once it was back together, he told me it will work just like it did before where it worked but was noisy.  So once he left, I started a load of wet towels, which I used to clean up the floor.  During the first 30 seconds, while I was gone getting a fan to help dry the floor, I heard what can only be described as a waterfall.  The front of the washing machine was leaking water profusely.  I quickly turned it off. Needless to say that I waited weeks for them to come repair a working washing machine for them to flood my floor and make the washing machine unusable.  Not only that I missed a day of work waiting for 12 hours when if they just did not come it would have been all the same and possibly better.  Throughout this experience, I did not feel like a customer getting any type of good treatment.

I have a Bosch Dishwasher that had an issue under manufacture warranty and unfortunately the closest authorized Bosch repair vendors was this one (who has an auxiliary service center in Huntsville), and another company in Birmingham (The Birmingham place seemed very nice on the phone, but I didn't want to wait a couple weeks for a tech to fix it... so I called S&S).\n\nFirst off after calling the other repair place in Birmingham, I found the lady on the phone at S&S very rushy - just wanted name, address, payment method got me off the phone quick... the other repair place took down all my info, make/model, serial #, everything and was going to preorder potential parts so they could do one visit and be done. Dispite my initial impression of calling S&S I went with them anyway since they could come out in 2-3 days vice 1-2 weeks. (when your used to having a dishwasher it's not fun when it's broken...)\n\nSo the first guy comes out, looks at the dishwasher, deems we need a new sump pump, leaves. 2nd visit he comes by installs the new part does a really quick test and deems its fixed and leaves.  My wife goes to run the dishwasher on a full cycle and the draining error code comes up again.\n\nI called the company and was informed someone was coming out the next day to check it. This time we get a guy who didn't even know how to spell Bosch (OK I'm exagerating, but in his words he never seen this kind of dishwasher... had no clue how to work it, fix it, nothing...), treated my wife horribley, he had to call Bosch to walk him through troubleshooting, then proceeds to berate my wife saying it's our plumbing get a plumber the dishwasher is fine, and threatens to charge us if we call for warranty purposes again since it is our plumbing.\n\nJust to give this jerk the benefit of the doubt I took apart the piping under my sink and found no blockages (cleaned it a bit anyway), the sink the dishwasher was hooked to for drainage has never had issues... as far as the intall it was professionally installed by Lowe's and has worked flawless for 11 months so how the heck can it be my plumbing?\n\nAfter fooling with it more myself I found out when the 1st guy replaced our pump it ajared the door that covers the sump pump from the inside of the dishwasher, and some food was caught in there. After I cleaned it and reseated the door correctly it worked fine again...\n\nIn summary my experience: Curt, rushy phone operator; experienced, but in a hurry repair tech (1st and 2nd visit same guy); and lastly rude and unknowledgeable repair tech (3rd visit).\n\nNext time if I had to choose between this place and the Birmingham repair place I'll take my chances with how long it takes the Birmingham folks to come out.... I'd rather wait a week longer and have someone take the time to fix it right then some half fast job, but you know it's all about the $$ the more jobs they cram into a day the more $$ they take in so this is what you get.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888df132a70994f:0xdc635790045d61d7"}

I was desperate so I paid half and was told it would be in Tuesday am.  Get a quote on Monday from another place for half what I was charged here.

Cristy says she won't be there because it's Halloween but I can drop off my phone and pick it up if I want to come in.  Although I had plans for Halloween,  I cancel so I can get my phone  fixed.  It took longer than expected but was repaired and by looking at the reviews, I am lucky my phone  is working properly.  I was told I would receive a free screen protector but when I picked up my phone was told they didn't have any in stock.  Overall it was not a positive experience and I am pretty sure I paid a lot more than I should have.

The screen alone will cost $299.00!\"\n4a.--The above is NOT true--the screen even at the most expensive offering is $180.\n4b.--It is NOT hard to get\n4c.--If you go to a true Apple store (i.e. Summit Birmingham)--they will replace your screen while you wait for $149.00. CPR with their prices could literally take your phone to B-ham and have lunch and still earn over $200 per phone (when you include labor). Wouldn't be surprised if that is what they do. The guy that waited on me knew the price at the Apple Store when I mentioned it. That is pure speculation on my part; but, this CPR place is a mess and totally unprofessional.\n\nMy advice--take a trip to the Apple Store (get an appointment first) and the folks there will make your phone like new for $149. The money you'll save will more than pay for the trip and you'll have enough left over to enjoy a nice lunch at all the great restaurants at \"The Summit.\"\n\nIf you MUST get your phone repaired in Montgomery--I suggest \"Total Cell Phone Repair.\" They charge parts + $55 labor--or $235. That's still expensive; but, at least they are honest on the price of the screen. CPR charges $299 JUST FOR THE SCREEN alone--Absolute \"Rip-Off\" If there labor charges are the same as most--$55.00/hour--that would be $350.00 price tag!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2aff2bb6f42d:0x58cd2a6eddd97f48"}

I have never in my life dealt with such an unprofessional group of people. Before I brought my phone to these people, every single thing on it worked perfectly. The only issue I had is that there was a scratch on the left side of the screen that irritated me. So I tried to do the right thing and support a local business (or at least a business in the area). On August 5, 2015, I prepaid $161.49 for a screen and service for an iPhone 6. I was told that I would be notified when the parts arrived.\n\nDays go by, and I don't hear from them. I had to call on the 11th and finally ask what exactly was going on. They had an excuse about how their delivery of parts was delayed. Either way, they'd have it the next day. So I'm pretty understanding, and I agree that'd be fine. I take the phone in on August 12. Again, they do not call me - I had to turn up and see whether it was done. I wait approximately 10 minutes after arriving since they were apparently still working on it. Everything looked good initially when I got it back, but I started noticing problems almost right away on the phone.\n\nThere was an absolutely immense battery drain on the phone, but more importantly than even that was the ambient light sensor not working, the backlighting at the top of the phone was WAY off, (and they should have noticed that if nothing else if they repair phones for a living) and the proximity sensor wasn't working. If you don't know what a proximity sensor is, when you hold a smartphone up to your head to talk, it shuts the screen off so it doesn't register contact with the screen. It makes it very difficult to use your phone as a phone when it isn't working. The next day, on August 13, I call them back and explain the issue. They agree to take a look at it again and see if there's something they missed. I understand that sometimes, these things happen.\n\nCan't make it there before close on August 14, but I do arrive on August 15th. Another employee looks at the phone, and says that there's just an issue with the screen at this point. They'll have to order another screen to resolve these issues. It's frustrating, but I understand, and I agree, and ask them to contact me when it is in. I waited 10 days, and heard nothing from them. Called a little late in the day on August 25th, and I was told that they got the part in either the day before or that day. So, I mean, thanks for the heads up, right? Can't make it there that day, so I take it in on August 26th.\n\nOn August 26th, I drop the phone off yet again around 12:00. The employee says they're a little backed up, but they should hopefully have it ready in about 2 1/2 hours. I told him it was fine. Close to that time later, I got a call saying the screen was on the phone, and they were going to test the other functions. Got another call later, and they told me that the screen was working fine, but that they could not get the proximity sensor to work. They claimed to have tested different parts, but they simply could not get the proximity sensor to work on the phone. I asked how we intended to resolve this issue, especially since it worked when I brought it to them.\n\nI was told that they could either place a damaged screen on the phone (not my original screen in this case, but one that was much, much more damaged) and get a refund, or that basically, I'd have to live with it. This is literally three weeks to this point, and I absolutely need that telephone. Time I don't have it almost always translates to lost productivity. So essentially, my choice was to get my phone back in worse shape than I brought it in, and get my money back, or to keep the screen and they don't fix an issue they caused. I essentially had no real choice in the matter. I am contacting my credit card company to get my money back. They are a terrible business, and your money would be better spent anywhere else. They should be ashamed, but they're not.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2aff2bb6f42d:0x58cd2a6eddd97f48"}

My goal was to take it to Florida and have it street legal. Although I knew I should buy from another dealer and probably in a Florida, the owner, Blake, assured me that he would make it legal and promised on at least 3 occasions that if it didn\u2019t pass inspection that he would take the cart back and refund all of my money. I knew I should have gone with my gut, but instead I tried to help the little guy out and go with the small business owner.\n\nI rented a trailer and drove two hours from Atlanta to pick up the cart. Although we had agreed Exactly what would be put on the cart, when I showed up only about half of the items were on the cart. I should have left then, but I had already put down a $1000 deposit for the work. An argument ensued with Blake and when he got there his workers started to put items on the golf cart. However, even though he told me he had them, all of the necessary items were not even in his possession. Many of the nuts and bolts had rust on them. It\u2019s obvious that he just piece meals things together. If you are spending $50 it\u2019s one thing, but when you are spending $5000 things should be right.  However , because I drove all that way  I elected to take the cart anyway and purchase the necessary missing items.\n\nWhen the final purchase was made, Blake also guranteed the golf cart would run for one year. Well, two weeks after purchasing the cart it started to have trouble. After not passing inspection in Florida, I called Blake and he somehow claimed amnesia about offfering to take the golf cart back- just as I had predicted. So, now I have a golf cart that doesn\u2019t run and I have to take to a reputable dealer to have it repaired.\n\nSo, if you are consider purchasing a cart from Infinity Golf Carts, go over every inch of the cart before you accept and pay for it. Blale is Not a man of his word, so make sure that Everything is in writing. Even then, if you have a problem do not expect him to be a man of his word.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb3b432a6556d:0xfeb121d6fbc9df14"}

SInce then I have had multiple leaks and cannot get them to return my phone calls or come out and look at it. I have hired another company after trying to get several roofers to come out because no one wants to touch someone else's work. FInally I got a highly rated company to come out and they took pictures and showed me where the metal was cut short in several places and patched, most all of the screws are halfway or more out, the edges are patched together causing leaks and overall the work after seeing pictures is very poor. What is really sad is that the original company is not willing to look or stand by their work. so after spending the money and putting a metal roof I now am going to have to replace the whole thing not to mention the wood in several places from the leak. They put screws in the flat part of the metal instead of in the ridges which means water is constantly running over them and slowly leaking into my house. I could understand the metal needing to be rescrewed but because they did not screw it on properly the first time in order for it to be correctly done it will have to be replaced. This company has been around a long time which is one of the reasons we chose to use them in the first place but apparently they have so much business they no longer care about the quality of their work.

So I called Charles this morning and asked if he came out and looked at the roof.  He said the took a ride out and then said that they were covered up and could not get to my repair.

What a COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT!  Bryant Darby came for the initial consultation and was very thorough and detail oriented, so I could only assume the painters would follow suit. Long story short, the painters were absolutely terrible! The crew dripped paint EVERYWHERE.  Inside and outside of my house were covered in drips of white paint.  **UPDATE:  The paint drips were on a brand new deck (less than 2 years old); a new rug (less than 2 years old) and newly installed flowerbeds/rocks less than a month before the paint job.  THIS WAS NOT FROM A PREVIOUS PAINT JOB!!!!   Every time they returned to fix something, they'd leave their mark on something else.  It finally got to the point that I didn't even want them on my property any longer.  The lame attempt they made to clean up after themselves was laughable and I was ready to cut my losses** The house wasn't prepped correctly and I have fresh paint peeling already!   They broke bulbs on my string lights and not only didn't tell me, but didn't bother to clean it up!   This crew was completely lazy and careless.

The painters did come back to the house to clean off any drips and as we discussed with you onsite many of the drips were from the previous times the house was painted and could not be cleaned.  To my knowledge any drips or spills we were responsible for were cleaned from the house.  If you do have peeling paint from the current job we did for you please remember you have a 3 year warranty that covers any peeling, flaking, or fading. Likely this is not a product of incorrect prep but the conditions in which the paint was applied.  If any moisture gets trapped between the paint and the wood it will peel no matter how well the house was prepped.  This is why we offer the warranty we do.  Please feel free to contact us to schedule any necessary warranty work.  We are happy to fix anything we are responsible for."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889166f758133e3:0xb2e24817cff76e0b"}

Sometimes a unit is too old, and has too many problems, to justify repair. We issued a refund after the customer decided to buy a new unit rather than approve further repairs. -- Initially we traced her leak to a clogged condensate drain, but she continued to have the leak. After the drain was found clogged again and cleared, it continued to leak. Further investigation found that that her drawer was not closing perfectly because of a defective gear, which was allowing moist room air into the freezer which was building up high levels of frost, which was also causing her drain to clog.

This is one of the companies LG forces you to use. Even with LG covering the expense of the compressor, about 350.00 the quote was 800.00 for then to spend 2-3 hours to repair.  The worst part was the tech told me it was a 50/50 chance it would last. The reason behind the ridiculous price, the tech explained that there was a strong possibility that multiple service calls would be made in the first year and they dont get paid for those, meaning the price hike was to help cover their possible future expense  The going rate from several other companies not affiliated with LG was approximately 400.00 to swap out the compressor, vacume to 5 microns and refill with r134.  Today, I am having another company come to my home and swapping the compressor to the non linear compressor, all paid out of my pocket, the entire job cost me 595.00. So how can it possibly be so much for the LG compressor swap if LG is covering the cost due to warranty? Another noteworthy mentioning is that I told the tech I would mount the compressor myself and would sweat on the copper connections myself, but that wouldn't change the price according to the tech. It's called price gouging and its pathetic. Be very cautious when dealing with this company, there are much better options out there, thankfully I found one, thanks Appliance Service LLC.

When the technician came to evaluate my abnormally noisy dryer I was quoted and shown an invoice for parts/labor totaling over $560. I reluctantly chose to have my dryer repaired because buying a new dryer would cost several hundred more dollars. I was also required to pay half of the service fee before Service Care would come out to complete the repair\u2014I assumed so that the very expensive parts could be ordered. When *my technician arrived I was surprised to see him carrying a very small bag of parts and was finished with the repair in less than 30 mins\u2014I was expecting a little bit more for a repair costing well over $500 dollars. Come to find out when I researched the actual cost of parts I found out the parts cost around $35 which means service care charged me nearly 1000k an hr for labor. Please do not use this company. A total scam. Buy the parts yourself, watch a  tutorial YouTube video, and save yourself literally HUNDREDS of dollars.\n\nHeard back from customer service. Per their customer service rep my technician mistakenly charged me for the parts 4 times resulting in a quote that was over $200 dollars more than what it should have been. The invoice I received from the tech clearly states that only one was ordered for a parts/installation fee of $560.11 which alerted my spider sense. Customer service offered me an ultimatum of either $200+ refund because of tech\u2019s alleged mistake (meaning I still paid over $300 dollars to replace a $35 dollar part that took 30 mins to replace) or they would come out to take out the $35 part for a full refund. Despite having been charged a fee of $80+ for an in-home quote which by their own admission was inaccurate they refused to refund that. I only agreed to the repair because based on the description of what needed to be done to repair the unit seemed extensive and beyond my skill set. If I didn\u2019t have to take another day off wrk (on top of the 2 I already had to for the quote and the repair) for them to come out to take back what they put in I would have gladly had them come out and take it out. Found a step by step tutorial video on YouTube and the repair is actually quite simple.\n\nService Care this type of business practice is shameful to charge such ridiculous amounts of money for simple repairs. This is flat out fraudulent and predatory. Their excuse for such high pricing basically boils down to \u201cWe use nationally recognized software to provide quotes...\u201d Translation: We do it because we CAN. Not because it\u2019s RIGHT. They knowingly charge SEVERAL hundred dollars an hr for labor for relatively simple repairs. Buyer beware and be sure to do your research first. This repair could have been easily DIY and done for $35 bucks in parts and a Phillips head screwdriver.\n\nThe owner himself discourages buying parts off Amazon in his response but the Service Care website  actually contains a link that customers can use to buy \u201ccheap\u201d OEM replacement parts...from Amazon. :l\nAgain, a total scam, folks. Stay clear of this place.  Had I not questioned my order I would have been duped.  This is supposed to be a repair that the company does \u201chundreds\u201d of times but no one from company realized I was over charged by several hundred dollars (not a few dollars but several HUNDRED dollars) until I said something about it. Had I went to Publix to buy a gallon of milk and it rang up for $50, the cashier would have instantly thought, \u201cHuh...it\u2019s usually $3.99. Something must be wrong.\u201d Not Service Care. They will take your money and run without thinking twice about it. They still refuse to refund my in-home quote fee for a quote that was inaccurate.\n\n*Technician\u2019s name removed from review at the request of the owner", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1559075893140, "text": "Hi, I'm sorry you were so unhappy with your experience, and I can see why. The technician made a technical error while building your quote. Instead of quoting for a pack of 4 rollers, he quoted for four 4-packs of rollers. The pricing software that we use thought we were replacing those parts 4 times, which increased the quote. (We would be happy to send you a copy of the original quote, which included the 4 rollers, not one). I feel certain that we would have caught that during our billing process, but we appreciate you calling us so soon after your repair to let us know. We're issuing you a refund for the difference. We stand behind our repairs with a one-year warranty which requires us to use OEM manufacturer parts which are usually more expensive than the cheap ones you find on Amazon.

The first service call for the dryer was submitted via our online portal on August 18th at 10pm for a Frigidaire dryer, and scheduled for August 23rd. -- First thing Monday morning, we left a message for the customer to call us to verify the address (and so we could explain what will happen during service visit). -- 10 minutes later, we received a call back and were told that there was another dryer, a Samsung, and would also like that one to be serviced at the same time. A ticket was created at that time, and both were scheduled for the 24th. (Probably because it was now two calls, not just one). -- The initial email confirming the service call would have been sent Friday after the one unit was scheduled online, which is I think the source of the confusion. I'm not sure why the system did not send a followup email with the new information, and I apologize deeply for that. -- We wouldn't claim that the customer called and changed the service date unless we had received a call from someone, and we certainly wouldn't have created a new ticket for this customer unless we had communicated with someone. That just wouldn't make sense for us to do that. -- We're terribly sorry that the experience was confusing, and that you spent time waiting for a call that never came. We take great care to meet and exceed customer expectations, and we will examine our processes in detail to see what could be improved so that this does not happen again."}, "gmap_id": "0x888911b060a81061:0xa56ad5c7f3ce4c5a"}

She's not only rude to the customers, but she cant keep her nose out of her phone long enough to make eye contact. The numerous times I've been in there along with  my colleagues, I've never actually seen her do a repair let along do actual work. Not to mention repairs she has done she has messed up. What kind of manager doesn't know how to do her job and do it well. I refuse to walk in this store for business and will take my devices else where as long as she's working and if the Tech guy isn't there. She seems very withdrawn from her work, an lacks motivation skills! Also very hard to take someone serious working on my devices with a big piece of metal sticking out of their lip.\n\nNow as for the ACTUAL TECHS, I've had nothing but great customer service, devices done an ready when they are said to be ready. And always courteous and professional. Very helpful when it comes to explaining what's wrong with the devices. For someone who has done several reviews for several stores on their performances and what they can do to fix it to welcome more business, The manager needs to get some Professional act right, this is a Booming business all over the country not many people can handle this kind of work and all it takes is ONE person to make it to be a bad place of business.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1462910907186, "text": "Hello Kayla I\u2019m sorry to hear about your bad experience.

In particular, the manager at this location.\n\nI work for a phone carrier in the same mall and I had a customer approach my stand, asking if the \u201cApple Airpods\u201d you just sold her were really a legit Apple product. From a few feet away, they looked legit, but upon further inspection, they were definitely a counterfeit. I sell plenty of Apple products out of my store on a daily basis and have for 5+ years. I can tell just by the fit/finish, packaging, font, etc that these are definitely not a real Apple product, or even a refurbished unit.\n\nFrom what your customer told me, you reassured her that they were a legitimate product, and refused to offer her a refund, only store credit until she threatened to get mall management and the police involved.\n\nShame on you for preying on elderly and unknowing customers trying to get Christmas gifts for their families. She told me she spent the last $90 of her fixed income to get these for her daughter as a late Christmas gift.\n\nYou are selling items under false pretenses and not disclosing the authenticity of the products. Makes me wonder how many other people you have ripped off with this same scam. This is some shady business practices and unfortunately it can tarnish the customer\u2019s trust in cellular/mobile vendors and repair companies alike.\n\nPictured is the \u201cApple AirPods\u201d you sold her and the last picture is a stock image of the legitimate product from Google from a trusted device review source.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889292125aff38e7:0x6260c591fe0e3f11"}

A week or so passed and they called and said the part was in. I took my tablet in for repair they said they may not get to it that day because they were busy... understandable. Well I came back late the next day and they said they still haven't got to it and they would leave a note to do it first thing the next day. Well the next afternoon I called and they still didn't have it ready. So a few more days passed and they called and said they had broken the screen and had to order a whole new screen. Told us we had to wait for the tech to get paid because he had to pay for the new replacement parts. It took more than 1 month to get the new parts and for them to finally call us and say it's ready. We get to the store and ask to pick up the tablet and it is in horrible condition the back panel wasn't even put back on properly and had spots where it was raised up enough I could see the internals on the tablet. We refused to take it that time because it was not repaired. We also learned the the money we origanally paid them to fix it was refunded to the tech who had broken the tablet. The employee/tech refused to try to repair the tablet saying \"I'm not going to try to press that together and break that tablet.\" She was referring the the back panel I mentioned was raised up in places. We told her to contact the manager and she pulled out her cell phone called the manager and said \"These people are refusing to take the tablet and I'm so mad I'm about to just walk out\" the manager told her to tell us she would take a look at it tomorrow. A few days passed they called again and said it was ready so we went to get it and it was better condition but still it is very scuffed up on the trim all the way around the screen and the back is still slightly raised up in a few places. We took it anyway out of pure frustration with the employees and the manager. This place is a joke DO NOT take anything here to be fixed or you will regret it.

She tore the conductive ribbon strip from the home button that lets it depress and click the dome switch underneath. She claimed that it was not her fault did not offer any kind of apology and told me it was unfixable.

The individual clearly had no idea how to repair the phone and would not admit it prior to damaging the phone beyond repair. First the \"manager who has so much experience\" proceeds to pry the back of the custom bamboo backing on my wife's phone warping it where it will not lay flat. Then when doesn't know how to take the last screw out and breaks the ribbon cable that powers the phone. While she did offer to order the part that she broke she did not disclose that she had already damaged the back of the phone and then when confront just casually says well I have to get it off and it is just a piece of plastic. It was fine when it left here. Clearly there was no real concern for damaging someone else's property when she order a $12.00 part \"out of her own pocket\" and act like that makes up for damaging the phone without recourse", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889292125aff38e7:0x6260c591fe0e3f11"}

If I could give less than 1 star, I would.  We took an iPad 3 to iFix on December 20th to have a broken screen replaced.  We called later that evening and went to pick it up after they said it was complete.  We tested the iPad while at the store in front of Tyler, an iFix employee, and the power button wouldn't work, the magnetic closure to put the iPad to sleep wouldn't work, and you couldn't lock/unlock the iPad.  They also scratched the body of the iPad around the edges when they replaced the screen.  Tyler made a note of the issues and agreed we could bring the iPad back for repair after the Christmas holiday.  While we had it, the screen detached from the iPad body.\n\nWe took it back to iFix on or about January 9th.  We had to swipe (erase all content) off the iPad for them to repair it, so we had to buy a new one to replace this one in the interim.  We have received NO communication from anyone with iFix since that time unless we've called for a status.  We have called numerous times to speak with the manager, David and Tyler the original employee dealing with us on this.  Each time it's the same story...they're working on it and since that time, David is no longer with them.  I emailed all of the contacts on the Corporate iFix website and never received a response.  The employee we were dealing with, Tyler, can't tell us anything and he said the district manager was now handling our case.\n\nAmber Wells, the District Manager with iFix, and they would not agree to refund the $196.19 we paid for the screen replacement and she said they can't repair it.  I filed a Better Business Bureau complaint in March and iFix never responded to it.  The leasing manager, Rhonda Clark, at Wiregrass Commons Mall has attempted to get this resolved with the owner but has not been successful.  Apparently there are other customers who have complained to the mall management because iFix won't stand behind their work, lack of work, or whatever you wish to call their shoddy attempt at service.\n\nAt the very minimum, they should have refunded what I paid for the repair.  Unfortunately now, I have no confidence that the iPad will ever work the same even if someone else replaces the screen.  PLEASE don't make the mistake of taking any devices to this store.\n\nAs of September 24, 2014 they STILL have my iPad.  Nearly 9 months later and nothing from them...no attempt at resolution at all.  iFixandrepair has yet to contact me.  Apparently they have no interest in resolving the issue.  I'm taking them to small claims court to try to get this resolved.  Again, I would NOT recommend them for repairs of any sort based on my personal experience and the lack of concern of their staff.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1462910926173, "text": "Hello Donna I\u2019m sorry to hear about your bad experience.

The Garage door tech came and was very pleasant and helpful. I paid $95 for him to come and measure my garage door space. He then asked me to check a website and order doors. First the hand written webpage was difficult to find as it had an error when written out. Then when I went to the website all my choices were in black and white drawings. I had no idea how this was supposed to look on my house and called the main office. First I received a voicemail and left a message which was never returned, I called a second time basically pleading for help, the woman who called me back sounded aggravated I had interrupted her and had no desire in helping me. I told her that we are a small business as well and we would like to support another family run small business and I would like to pay her and support her company, yet she still did not change her demeanor. Needless to say they came out in November, no help has been provided to ensure we get the doors we want and here we are in January and we still have no doors and none are ordered, and so far all I paid for is someone to measure my doors, and frankly I could have done that for free. I gave them 4 stars though that isnt my honest rating as it is much less, only because I have no desire in hurting their business by a bad review. If you can order garage doors and know what you are getting from a black and white hand sketching then maybe your experience will be better than mine, however, you have to be fully responsible for knowing you are making the right order with little help from my experience. With so many garage door companies online, I could have done the equivalent,  ordered random doors online for a fraction of the cost myself without paying someone nearly $100 to measure my doors for me. I sure wish the office lady would have helped with the order, otherwise what did I hire them for? to measure my doors? really?????", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a418c4c6c45c7:0x85a8f18f65594d69"}

I was at work so my wife had to handle the situation. She kept me in the loop play by play and was so impressed with Brandon beyond words! His professionalism, kind demeanor and knowledge was more than she expected. He repaired my issue, and replaced my door sensors I had on hand, reset the motor settings, oiled the chains.

Unfortunately, the spring on my garage door broke rendering the door totally inoperable, even to lift manually. What a nightmare for a household with 4 vehicles. I anticipated that I would have to call and make a repair appointment for a time days away and then be trapped at home with that dreaded \u201cwindow\u201d of time, crossing my fingers that someone would eventually show up to fix it during which time our family would have to do the \u201ccar shuffle morning, noon and night. I found recommendations on our neighborhood website for Garage Door Reacue. I called at 8:54am to schedule an appointment and was shocked when the ever so pleasant woman said she could have someone out within the hour. At 9:07, Brandon rang my doorbell with ladder in hand and tools at the ready. He explained exactly what he was going to do and gave me an estimate, which I found to be very reasonable, and within 1 hour I not only had a fully functioning garage door but he had corrected some previous installation issues and did the oiling maintenance on the entire track and door. He was efficient, pleasant and personable. As he pulled out of my driveway having completed the repair at 10:19, I was compelled to write this review (something I don\u2019t normally do) to give praise to a great local company with fantastic customer service for a reasonable price.

My SUV was more difficult. I asked for good quality glass and I'm not exactly sure what I got.\nI wanted the glass installed following the instructions spelled out in the factory Service Manual. When I would explain to the installers how it NEEDED to be done they pushed back by saying that was not necessary. My SUV has a specific way to install the windshield that is out of the ordinary. If steps aren't followed then its going to leak. They assured me that it wouldn't leak the way they did it and I really did not want to put that to the test with their way of doing it. I supplied my own new factory gasket for the job. If I had not had that they would have reused the 20 year old gasket that was glued to the old windshield. The manual says to use a NEW gasket.\n\nAll the glass installers I have delt with to get this done have just about all been the same. They are payed by they job and want to get done and on to the next job. I care about my car and if I'm gong to pay to have this done I want it done right. As the customer they need to consider that I probably have a good idea what I'm talking about and should listen and absorb what I'm telling them because I didn't want it to leak and I know they didn't want to have to come back and fix it.\n\nMy experience with the installers that came today was the reason for the bad rating. I don't appreciate their attitude towards my instructions I had for them.  I walked inside to get cash to pay them while they were working and quietly came back outside to hear them talking about me and how I was trying to micromanage them.  One of the guys actually told me he could see why they other companies didn't want to do the job. Which was a rude thing to say. He couldn't handle I wanted things done a certain way (the correct way).\n\nI'm sure most windshields are simple and easy to replace.
