The plantains reminded me very much of sweet potatoes in both taste and texture. The goat was spicy enough that one could enjoy the heat without being overwhelmed. I opted for the beans and rice to go with it as well as the french fries. Fries were perfect and the rice with beans were everything I expected and more. Tried two different sodas the Koala Champagne had an interesting flavor. All in all looking forward to my next outing here want to eat jerk chicken next.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a6d4535cf62d7:0xeba607dae015457a"}
