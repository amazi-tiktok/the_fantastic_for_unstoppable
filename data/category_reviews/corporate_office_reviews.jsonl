I have called and emailed their customer service department dozens if not hundreds of times, to no avail. I had to have my implant completely redone by a different dentist.

In my opinion Biohorizon is not a reliable company - shouldn't an implant that's supposed to last a lifetime last more than 2 and a half years.

I ordered a personalized necklace, after the first day the chain broke, I never received a new necklace. I also ordered a purse that is now falling a part.

I cancelled my account & they continued to charge my account saying I did not cancel! The lady said they had no proof & basically called me a liar & hung up on me.

I didn't say anything about that first charge I just let it go & cancelled my account but when I get charged twice after I cancelled there has to be issues with this so called faith club! I have never expiericed worse customer service in my life! Read the scam reviews & DO NOT sign up. There are so many negative reviews about this company not to mention some weird phone number is listed on my bank statement for then which isn't even their phone number. That's SCAM 101 right there. Waiting for them to call me back because I didn't even get my shipment for the months they were still charging my card & they don't believe me about that either their so their tracking my order & the lady that hung up on me says \"well if you would of told us you didn't get your order we could of taken care of it\" Seriously I didn't tell you all because I didn't think I was getting shipments anymore because I called & CANCELLED!!!!!

Brittany had signed up for our FairHope Notes Christian greeting card continuity program through an online offer where the first shipment was free and she only had to pay the $4.95 shipping and handling charge.  The agreement copy clearly states that future shipments will be billed at the regular rate of $14.95 plus shipping and handling.  Brittany called after her third shipment, saying she had previously cancelled the account.  As a small, family owned business with just a handful of Customer Service Reps, we are very careful to record every customer interaction.  We told her we had no record of her previously contacting us, but would cancel her account immediately.  This angered Brittany and she accused us of calling her a liar.  Then, adding fuel to the fire, our call was inadvertently disconnected.  We tried to call her back but our call was never answered.  Regarding her comment that \u201csome weird phone number is listed on my bank statement for them which isn\u2019t even their number\u201d, the number listed (251-544-6600) does happen to be our phone number, which we answer from 8:00am to 5:00pm (Central) Monday through Friday.  We also return as soon as possible any calls that come in after hours.  We are very disappointed (and alarmed!) that Brittany would characterize us as a \u201cscam\u201d and encourage her to give our continuity program of Christian greeting cards a second chance.  I think she will find that our cards are very meaningful for everything from \u201cbirthdays\u201d to \u201cget well\u201d to \u201cpraying for you.\u201d  Please Brittany, give us a second chance!"}, "gmap_id": "0x889bb2e964ca93d7:0x2d243ae7aaf9ab15"}

I was lied to & told i would receive my rx meds as well as pain meds timely & he would get on it asap. Then hours later after taken to icu; whose dating who & whose doing who conversation going on when i was taken from er to the icu. Was given 1 pain pill hours after being there. Didn't get my rx for several hours either. Never got my am med until day i left and only 1/2 the dose of that i have prescribed to me. Told i had to take Tylenol before i could get pain med after given a norco (hours before) already. No heflin shot(s) to prevent blood clots; which i already have. No leg things to put on my legs to prevent blood clots either. They were ordered for me but i only got to look @ them because the leg things for blood clot prevention were not to be used on me but were ordered for me to look at. Was treated like a drug addict instead of an ER patient with late onset type 1 diabetes headed into dka as well as cervical problems so bad i am in physical therapy (again but;) to prepare for neurosurgery in 2 months or less. I had to tell them I'm an x-performing artist from the projects & i didn't need them to get drugs if that's all i wanted.  Because one of the doctors (resident) immediately said to me in icu, when he saw me & how tiny i am, Trump & opiate crisis & take the Tylenol first. Funny cuz the run away resident dr had already given me 1 norco. but  the i needed them to do their job. Help me. Then a pain pill every 6 hours. The one, or all, of the resident doctors didn't have any education on diabetes (ie. \"Not eating makes sugar drop\" is what he said. My blood sugar was over 800. I replied \"not eating and not being able to eat right will also make your blood sugar high as well.\" he looked @ me like i was stupid but maybe he will look at google & find out I'm right. I've never NOT had morphine in that situation anywhere I've been in ICU for same thing. Neuropathy alone is so painful i wake up and have to put shoes on to try to sleep. I didn't rest how or get the care or attention or respect as another human i should've . i had to call for supervisor but only able to increase frequency of norco & nothing more. I was called a liar & asked why i was even there by one of attending resident Drs (not taking my insulin). The resident doctor who made false promises ran out of the room when he and the dr who clearly needs Endocrinology education for the emergency room were in the room with the residents that these resident doctors they were EDUCATING when i mentioned his initial promises. Not only did I have to call a nurse out for a missing Xanax in my med cup, a friend who is a retired dr, just happened to be there for her sister, who had a major surgery, had to say something about how one of her sister's two 5mg oxycodone pills wouldn't be in her medicine cup more than once and saw them drop the pill in their scrubs. We are supposed to be able to trust, talk, receive appropriate care accordingly & not worry about a negative experience that's got more negative to it than I've explained. Emergency care shouldn't be a battle for justice. Scares me to think what woulda happened if i couldn't speak for myself & for those who can't and don't have anyone to advocate for them. Very scary. Before, when it was @ trinity. I took myself out of pain clinic because of same treatment as far as being a human. Because i didn't want to be wasted all the time and loose another year as i already had and asked for a much less potent drug & was told if i didn't want to continue the drug they had me on (a drug they made money writing rx for (a lot of $)) i could self withdrawal.  I did & still have my letter. I ever get better & get $ i pray i can help change these things for those who need help.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888917991c680b41:0xe10dcda6551efcc3"}

At that time, the Wren team set a schedule for the walkthroughs, home inspection, and new home presentation. The goal was to have everything buttoned up on January 8, 2020, in time for the January 11th closing.  The builder did not meet any of the promised dates.  I came down to Alabama the weekend of December 12, 2020, to do a house walkthrough. That inspection produced a long list of visual deficiencies that I provided to my realtor and the builder\u2019s realtor. After that initial walkthrough, we had our home inspection and our blue tape to finalize the long list of repairs.  In short, 75% of the repairs did not happen until January 10th and the morning of the 11th.\nOur closing was pushed back to allow the builder time to fix items that were identified in December.  The builder was not even aware of the remaining items until I showed up with my family on January 9th and pointed out the laundry list of issues remaining. In the end, we were left to accept a home with five official items remaining to be fixed. However, because we only had an hour between the final home presentation and closing, I felt pressured to accepted several other low craftsmanship items. The paint on the kitchen cabinets is cracking, an unsafe installation of an outside light switch, improper repair of the fireplace,  large scratch on the front door, residual mortar all over the bathroom floor and fireplace, sprinklers buried in the ground,  and the outside of the house was left filthy.\nI give the construction team credit for getting a bunch of the issues fixed the day prior/to the closing. However, it should never come down to the last minute when they had a month lead time. In 2013, I purchased a new home back in Massachusetts, and the experience was ultimately the opposite of this purchase.  I had zero stress, and the process was a pleasure from start to finish. In contrast, my experience with Wren home was the most stressful financial transaction of my life. In the end, I needed a way to put all of the stress I experienced buying this house behind me so I can move forward. I pray this helps another family make the right decision when selecting a builder.  I can 100% relate to Corey\u2019s experience, as I felt like reading my own story.  When the same information comes from two people who\u2019ve never met, there might be some truth to the experience.\n\nUpdate:\nThe Project Management team and the owner came out and went through the house. We came up with a list of repair work that would happen on a Friday and Monday. The cabinet company, painter, and fan contractor came out on Friday. The fan guy put weight on and was gone in 5 minutes without fixing the issue. The painter painted 1/4 of the side of my house the wrong color. Now I have a brand new house with multi color siding.  As far as I can see there is zero oversight on the contractors that are making the repairs.  More to follow.\n\nSafety Update: My closet started falling apart last night because they didn't sink anchors in the wall. Instead, they used nails. Yes, they used nails to fix a shelf with hanger bar to the wall. Check you closest if you have kids. It's been 3 weeks since my closets started falling apart and they still haven't fixed it. The same thing happened to my neighbor and he said it took months of badgering them to get it fixed. Buyer beware, Wren Homes will fight and bully you every step of the way on repairs.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-iw5ebeixUGl8pyroYPHj5kyOSAq_Yo0eKj53=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1614016586256, "text": "Mr. Bishop we sincerely apologize for your issues, but we have checked your file and we found no warranty claims, your New Home Presentation was signed off by you and the final inspection was signed with only 5 outstanding items remaining to be repaired.

We look forward to meeting you on Friday, a day you chose.  We are available to meet earlier if you can work us in your schedule.    Thank you for buying one of our homes.   Please know - we stand behind what we build.   Have a great week.  We will see you soon.  Thanks again.\n\nUpdate - we are speaking with you now.  Communication is truly the key here  - seems like there has been a mixup of phone numbers, communication, etc...  We are dealing with these miscommunication issues now.  We sincerely apologize for these issues - we will get them completed to your satisfaction.  We would not have built thousands of homes in the area if we did not take care of our clients.  We will followup with you at week's end to ensure everything has been done.  Again, we are sincerely sorry for all of the miscommunication.  Please know we will handle all your issues that are outstanding.  Thank you again !"}, "gmap_id": "0x886213eb4550a8e5:0xb0b00662e1986745"}

Ultimately, I feel I should forewarn others by sharing my experiences with Wren so buyers can make better informed decisions than we did.\n\nSince signing our contract to buy, we have not received any resemblance of timely communication. Every time we asked about dates, walkthroughs, etc. it would take a week or more to hear back from them. We were told all throughout the final stages of the build that everything was \"on time\" and then 6 days before close, they attempted to force us to move our walkthrough back because they weren't ready. At that time, we had already sold our other house, loaded our belongings on a moving truck, so we were essentially homeless and under threat of not closing on time because they didn't realize how far behind they were until the last possible minute. We decided we were coming to do a walkthrough anyways and realized they were not completing several things on time for us to close.\n\nAfter closing, I have since found several items that Wren Home's quality control did not catch (cut HDMI cable, garage door opener not working, Carrier unit freezing over, mount in shower not attached properly, our blue tape touch ups were not finished, shoddy framing had to be corrected around our bathroom mirrors, and most of our hardware is still covered in paint) and continue to find things almost daily that are indicative of shoddy craftsmanship. At one point, I had put in several calls to try and get a status update on the warranty issues and was told that \"everyone has been very busy\" and that the VP who oversaw the last week of our construction \"doesn't typically talk to buyers so you won't likely hear from him\", indicating that once a purchase is complete, a customer is no longer a priority. I have been promised several call-backs and responses and have yet to receive a single one. When I call their personnel to try and reach someone...anyone, and express my frustration, I am the one that is called \"rude\".\n\nWe spent 100s of thousands of dollars on a house from Wren Homes and the experience we have received has been dismissive and neglectful. It is a sellers market and Wren Homes appears to be taking full advantage of that in their treatment of customers. My wife and I have collectively purchased 9 homes throughout our lives so I can speak from a level of experience that buying from Wren Homes has been the most painful buying experience we have ever had. We have experienced a laundry list of unprofessional and alarming acts from them so we would strongly caution other prospective home buyers to look elsewhere when choosing a homebuilder.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1615841644867, "text": "Mr. Williams - to our knowledge, we have taken care of all of your items.

The attention to detail is immaculate. Your house comes with a alarm panel and door sensors. If you start the process from the beginning you get to custom build your house(you just can't change outer walls).\nCon's: Once cabinets go in you can not make any changes, these even includes paint options. I wish that someone on the staff would call the respective internet service providers that are all ready in the developed subdivisions, once the side walks are laid to ask them to come and run internet lines. As of now, I have a pooling of water on the left side of my under contract house.

I had no idea my gas was off until my apartment started to get extremely cold and I thought my unit went out. I thought I would at least have my stove to keep warm until I could get maintenance out to fix my unit. It wasn't that, because my stove wouldn't light either. That's how I figured out my gas was off completely. Mind you, this is how I cook and shower also. I called customer service, and they told me that someone else had called in with an issue they needed to fix, so they turned the gas off, and the only way to get my gas back on a technician needed to come out and re-light my pilot.  I guess it never occurred to them that people may be elderly, sick, or have children, and their gas would be needed on a night like tonight. Customer Service then informed me that they could get someone out, but it would be a while. Excuse me? It's almost 1:00 a.m. What do you mean? You think I'm waiting up for a stranger to come to my apartment, arrival time unknown, and said person possibly won't get here until until 2 or 3 in the morning or better. On top of that, I'll have to shower or wash up with freezing water in a few hours. Who treats their customers like this? If I had known, I could have made arrangements to sleep and shower with family. At least I would've been warm. Now, since it's my time of the month, and going without a shower or washing is not optional for me, I'm stuck having to microwave water in the morning to have water warm enough to wash up with. I can't go to someone's house at 1 in the morning. I guess I can forget cooking breakfast and/or possibly lunch and dinner, depending on when they can get someone out here tomorrow. That's great!

When trying to get them my transcript they constantly lost my military transcripts and high school. I had to track down who saw my military transcripts and the person who saw them to get all of the counselors to realize it is already in the system. Next thing that happened was losing my high school transcript and leaving it in a on campus post office for over a week not even processing it in time. Days after the deadline the counselors want to contact me saying they are finally trying but with little to no effort. Finally when everything is in they want to tell me that they won't recognize all of the courses that I had to take part in in the Marine corps for the last eight years. By far the worst experience being told that even though i spent my time actually serving my country that I'm not good enough to be accepted in to this college when I was accepted in many others is just humiliating. Clearly non of the counselors or even the university of Alabama at Birmingham appreciate any of there veterans when not just myself but multiple of my fellow Marines have been turned away.

I have always been treated very well from them so, NO I did not want to change. After a while of thinking about it SEVERAL MONTHS and my Son hammering me with the RJ YOUNG name, I did it. I purchased a machine from RJ YOUNG.\nAt first I was skeptical and to be honest I really didn't want to give it a chance (The Machine), but I did and after several months and barely using the machine I starting coming more around it and using it a little more & more. Then I began to really like it because it really printed so nice and pretty fast. It only took me  8 to 10 months to like it but you have to understand I WAS A XEROX Man and I thought there was NOTHING out there but Xerox. The Xerox machine has ALWAYS  performed outstanding and the SERVICE was the best, I was spoiled from that. However, I found out that there was more out there than XEROX! I found out that RJ YOUNG was REAL and believe me they have made a believer out of me. The Service that I thought would not compare to XEROX, has showed me they are just as good and if not BETTER. I never thought I would say that but it is so true. I can not believe how fast the Service Technicians reply to the service calls. They are always polite, and get me back up and running in a very quickly manner. They have such good personalities and a smile! As for the Ladies at the Home Office, Oh My How can you NOT like them. They are AMAZING. They always tell me they will have my supplies on the way or a Technician asap. IT IS JUST SO HARD TO PUT IN WORDS what RJ Young has done for my business. This is a very caring company and to be honest I am so glad that I have some of their product and that I was introduced to the World outside of XEROX. RICO machines have made my life SO MUCH Better and I am so happy that I have changed.

While this is all in a days work for the staff it was a life changing, life altering event for us that day. We were trying to wrap our minds around the fact that he needs the oxygen when we were told that his insurance would not pay for a b-pap machine or supplies, nor would it pay for his oxygen (it would pay at some level for oxygen but not at the level he is at currently, however, he still has to have it.)  Later he was, thankfully, able to get a donated b-pap machine (cost is over $1,000) but had to purchase the mask. The mask was over $200. When we purchased the mask, the staff person was not friendly, she sold us a mask that was too small and did not try to fit it on him. We did not know how to use the machine and we had trouble using the mask.  We took the mask back and asked for help. They exchanged it for another size mask and sent us on our way. Today we went back because he was still having trouble with the mask fitting correctly and were told their policy was 30 days for return and also that we could only return one and would have to purchase another one. We did not have over $200 to buy another mask. We were upset that policy was not explained to us at the beginning and we were upset because they said they could not find a record of the exchange but wouldn't exchange this one because we could only exchange once and we had already done that (but they still had no record of it).  The staff was not caring, not compassionate at all, and actually rude. When we said something about it we were told we should have  complained the first day if we were unhappy.

Their internet help department apologized and transferred me back to her and the phones had been switched off saying that they were closed.  After successfully giving me the runaround for nearly 30 minutes she was able to just switch the phone off and be on her merry way.   I left Century Link due to poor internet speed and piss poor customer service.  It appears Riviera isn't much better.  I understand things happen with technological items and speeds vary.
