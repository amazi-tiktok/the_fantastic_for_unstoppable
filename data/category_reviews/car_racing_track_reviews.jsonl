Last time my family came to watch was when Brian got killed in the go kart crash. The races were canceled immediately that day which I agree with. An announcement was made for a makeup race but never heard another thing about it.\n\nMy wife, 7yr old son, & I visit today to ask if this could be our makeup since the Baby Grands were running the cancellation day as well. We were told, \"No it was too long ago.\" Really? I have always heard that this place takes care of it's people but that obviously was not on show today...\n\nMy son was excited to see some racing so we paid anyway. I can see why they did not want to honor it though because this place needs all the money they can get! All classes had at most 5 cars with the exception of the Baby Grands (special group out of Tennessee) and karts.\n\nBuzz MIGHT have had 6 start with 3 actually finishing the race, but there was only 2 Pony stock cars. Seriously? 2? If Jody and his dad didn't show up, there would have been ZERO.\n\nIt was a pitiful showing for Buzz, Street Stock, Pony, Renegade, Roadrunner.. you know, the most popular classes at all other tracks.\n\nThe only race worth watching was the Baby Grands which were entertaining. Qualifying started a little after 2pm and the whole show was over by 4:30pm! Had it not been for some extended cleanups, we probably would have been out of there by 4.\n\nSpeaking of extended cleanups, a whole car burned to the ground in turn 1 last weekend. Today the #1 car catches fire and at least they used an extinguisher on it. Someone did throw a piece of the hot car over the wall though, which the fire crew had to hurry and go get before it caught the hillside on fire. Seriously, this is more of a circus than a race track.\n\nIt's sad too because this used to be a fun place to come. The hillside would be covered with racecars and spectators, now it's just laughable. My kart will never run here and my car's tires will never touch the pavement again, I can guarantee that.\n\nIf you are looking for good racing, my advice is to visit Sayre, ECM, or just roll 2 quarters down a 2x4. Even that would be better than what we witnessed today.\n\nI hope you frame that $25. It's the last money you will see from us. Sorry to post this Kenny. I'm not sure if you are still running this or not but it has went downhill.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888605df696bf27:0xe0c6581863814c65"}
