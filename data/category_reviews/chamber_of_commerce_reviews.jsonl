Throughout the game, I noticed we actually had to open the escape room door to ask if anyone was there to help us\u2014we had multiple hints. Even received extra with beverage purchases... the hint providing service was slow. Secondly, before the game started we were informed that the room had a tough lock to open where every group struggled... understandable... we received the hint to open the tough lock but failed to open so we called for assistance. Hilariously enough, even the game master struggled to open the lock... this whole process of opening one, tough lock took approximately 15 minutes\u20141/4 of our game time. With the intention of completing destroying the lock and my foot on the wall, I had to pull that one lock off with all my force after the game master left. But the game master assured that the time would get frozen\u2014cool.\nThirdly, when time was up... the game master does not hesitate to end the entire game by punching in the last code spoiling everything. There was not a single thought in the game master\u2019s mind to ask us whether we desired just a bit more time to crack the room... Game master simply walked in, punched the code, and we all stood there awkwardly, confused, & disappointed.\nWe complained about the lock... their response was there was prior information given before the game\u2014true. We recommended them to please replace it immediately\nWe asked if there was anything that could be done to remedy our dissatisfaction with the room and the fact we paid $200 for one hour to elapse so unfortunately. They informed us that it was up to the owner to perform refunds, but the manager informed us with a possible discount sent through our email. It\u2019s been a week... nothing. Obviously, their customer service skills need to be reevaluated.\nWas a real tragic end to a group\u2019s Friday night honestly. We went in expecting to have fun whether we escaped or not... but we felt robbed.

The 1 min issue you mentioned is a feature where games are no longer bookable within 60 minutes of the start time--this protects us from someone booking the 4:00 room at 3:55 and we're not prepared--once that time has passed the room 'falls off' of the website.  As for you having trouble reaching someone we are rarely in the building during the week (unless a room is booked Wed or Thurs) and we're there answering calls during business hours Fri-Sun when it's busy.  Beyond that we check our voicemails X2 daily and respond to calls as quickly as possible.  We're so glad you enjoyed our rooms and would love to host you again, I recommend email or FB messenger if you don't reach anyone on the landline (if we're there we'll answer!).

It was challenging in a good way!!!\n\nThis was a blast.  It was very good for me to build connections and work with a group.
