During this time our discussion turned to military divorce with myself being a 22 year veteran and having experienced a divorce while on active duty. The short conversation made me wish Mitchell had been my divorce attorney. Some of our discussion topics were SSCRA, mandatory DFAS verbiage, and the 20/20 rule. These are topics I learned the hard way and discovered not every lawyer who professes to be a military divorce expert is familiar with (for the record I can immediately name 3 locally). I did a lot of research during and after my divorce and can tell you that Michell has a firm grasp of the intricacies of military divorces (and he's even written a book further demonstrating his understanding). After conversing with him and reading his book, I would fully recommend Mitchell Howie as a military divorce attorney and suggest hiring him so your spouse doesn't.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1580534496427, "text": "Richard I am very happy we were able to help you with your general legal consult and thank you so much for the kind review!

During this time our discussion turned to military divorce with myself being a 22 year veteran and having experienced a divorce while on active duty. The short conversation made me wish Mitchell had been my divorce attorney. Some of our discussion topics were SSCRA, mandatory DFAS verbiage, and the 20/20 rule. These are topics I learned the hard way and discovered not every lawyer who professes to be a military divorce expert is familiar with (for the record I can immediately name 3 locally). I did a lot of research during and after my divorce and can tell you that Michell has a firm grasp of the intricacies of military divorces (and he's even written a book further demonstrating his understanding). After conversing with him and reading his book, I would fully recommend Mitchell Howie as a military divorce attorney and suggest hiring him so your spouse doesn't.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1580534496427, "text": "Richard I am very happy we were able to help you with your general legal consult and thank you so much for the kind review!

It was an uncontested divorce except for the fact that my ex wanted child support. Well, I didn't know any better, and I knew she wouldn't sign the papers if there was no child support so I agreed to give her what Mr. Campbell had come up with: $400. My ex originally wanted something like $650 per month so I looked at that as a win. Well, after talking with different people who have joint legal and physical custody like I do, they wonder why in the hell am I paying my ex ANY child support, since I have her week on and week off. And, after talking with two different lawyers, they wonder the same thing. The lawyer I have now told me if I'd taken our case to court, the judge would NOT have awarded child support to my ex. We will be going back to court needless to say, will definitely not be using Mr. Campbell who screwed me over.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1450297464686, "text": "Dear Mr. Kemp, I appreciate the opportunity to have assisted with your case, but I do wish you had taken an opportunity to follow up with me about these concerns.  I did leave a message for you to call me concerning this matter, but I have not heard back from you.  I can address your concerns here.  As you might recall, you came to me to fix the agreement that you had tried to file on your own and that the court had rejected.  Without going into the details of the numbers involved with your case (which details are a matter of record) I can confidently say that you would likely have been ordered to pay around $400 per month in child support if you were awarded true joint physical custody after a trial.  If you had tried your case and been awarded joint legal custody, with your wife being awarded sole physical custody, you would have likely been ordered to pay around $650 per month.  Note that there is a difference between joint physical, versus joint legal, custody.  In Alabama, child support must still be calculated, and the judge still must state whether or not Rule 32 has been followed, even in joint physical custody situations.  This means that one party who makes significantly more than the other may still have to pay an amount of child support, and the method used to calculate $400 per month in your case is one that is accepted by the courts.  If two people make the same income, or have an agreement to deviate from guidelines, it is possible to have an order without child support.  Those conditions were not present in your situation.  The alternative would have been to pay me (or another lawyer) much more money to take your case to trial, and make an argument for custody and support, the result of which would not have been a certainty (and could result in less favorable terms of custody and having to pay more support than your agreement).  I'll be glad to explain this to the other persons that have provided feedback to you, as I fear that they must be either misinformed as to the facts or the law.  I am glad to have had the opportunity to assist you, and I will be happy to follow up with you concerning any questions that you have about this matter."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626b54406e816d:0xec1834fe93991c53"}

I am a very satisfied client and I would highly recommend Mr. Neil to anyone based on my own experience to people needing to file bankruptcy or other legal matters like closing on a home etc.. I didn't know him before I walked into his office. I simply did a web search and he was one of several that came up in the search results. I had already called several Attorneys before I got to him but no one answered at those offices. Not even a receptionist. They all sent me to an answering machines. When I got to Mr. Neil's number he personally answered (that was a good sign) I told him I was nervous about filing bankruptcy due to my financial situation had taken a dive and now I make a lot less than I use to. Yes, I even tried consolidation and refinancing but even with a great credit score of 720 the banks still turned me down because my debt to income was too high which was weird because that's the whole point or refinancing is to get your interest rate cost down so you can keep paying. Plus the government said I owed them $10k in back taxes which forced me into Mr. Neils office. After talking with him, I wasn't nervous anymore. He explained everything so clearly and plainly that even a bird-brain could understand. I learned more in 30 minutes from Mr. Neil than I did from several weeks of internet research. I came in his office thinking (incorrectly) that I would be filing chapter 13 because I wanted to keep all my valuables requiring me to make 5 years worth of payments to the court. That sucks! I also incorrectly thought I didn't want to file chapter 7 because from my research, I incorrectly concluded they take most of your stuff of value and liquidate it and give the money to the creditors when you file chapter 7. Well, all that turned out to be wrong. Mr. Neil gave me great legal advice informing me that based on my situation, I could actually file chapter 7 and still keep everything including my Turbo Porsche and be completely discharged in 60 days and never have to make any payments to the court. I extended trust to him while hoping I wouldn't regret it and in the end he proved to be ligit. He saved me from 5 years of bankruptcy payments and I kept all my property. Why would anyone in my situation file chapter 13? Answer: They went to the wrong attorney!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862842b2ae7bdff:0x230e37fd810d1e12"}

He refuses to return phone calls. He called me ONE TIME during my divorce, the day before the hearing. He never even bothered to send me the final divorce decree. I had no idea what my divorce papers said until his secretary emailed them to me, after the THIRD request. I know all of his secretaries because they are the only ones I could ever talk to. Half the time, they didn't return phone calls either. Halfway through the 'mediation' I got the distinct feeling that he was working for the other side. He obviously thinks he can make a living by gaining clients, screwing them over, and going on to the next victim. He must be too young and immature to grasp the concept that most people will need an attorney more than ONCE in their lifetime, and if he thinks he can be successful without the benefit of repeat clients, he is delusional. If he was the last attorney on earth, I would never hire him again. My divorce is final; I'm still missing half my belongings; he's promised me a refund twice and never delivered. On top of that, he suggested we file a contempt motion because of the fact that I was not given all the belongings I was entitled to. He didn't mention at the time that he planned on charging me an additional $1500 to do what I'd already paid him to do. In my opinion, the reason all his pictures on FB look like gangster photos is because he is a crook. He will stand there and 'listen' to you, but he is just pretending to hear you. You'd have more luck talking to a brick wall. Plus the brick wall might return your calls. I read a bad review of his, and I should have heeded it.

It was astounding to read the words on that paper. Elizabeth greeted me with open arms and understanding words. She explained to me how to best proceed. Her rates were very reasonable especially since I had to hire her on the spot for a hearing in 3 days. She was fantastic in the court room.

Without her I don't know where I would be - probably without my children. It was very overwhelming. Her retainer was a no brainer. My family helped me but it was worth every penny. My former husband was way too confident which worked on every single nerve in my body. She told me what was going to happen and every single thing she said happened. It was great to see her work. She stopped the other attorney from running all over me. She straightened out each lie. She worked methodically to get the truth out. I highly recommend her and her team.

In addition, when she did not get all the information she wanted about the case--attorney client privilege exists to protect the client--she asserted defamatory statements in a public forum.

When I was faced with mine in 2019, I was referred to Dani Bone through a coworker and friend that I trusted. I initially hired Dani because I heard he was the very best and he would fight for me. I called and even though they were extremely busy, they saw me right away. After hearing my situation, Dani was honest with me and said, \"You need Sam. \" My case was very complicated having both personal and business issues, assets and properties to divide, custody and other court issues . Sam took it as a challenge. He stayed with me and guided me through the whole divorce process. It was not easy, it was extremely tough but Sam knew how to handle every situation that came up. When going through a 2 yr battle, you need to know and  feel confident that your attorney has your back and has your best interest at heart. I emotionally fell apart many times and he helped me to learn to stand up for myself and it made me a stronger person through this process. All I wanted was what was fair- he got me exactly what I asked for! I was extremly pleased with services of Sam, Dani and their dedicated and caring staff. Amanda, Fredrick and Osha were just wonderful to work with. The whole staff made me feel comfortable and at ease through a very uncomfortable life circumstance.  While the other party had 5 attorneys through the process , I had one.  I only needed the one team- I had The Best with Sam & Dani Bone. Sam was honest, upfront, bold and encouraging. He never had to be ugly or raise his voice in court or trial and never once belittled anyone. I recall him saying, \"It doesn't have to be ugly\". Being a Christian, a professional, a self employed woman, a Realtor and a mother of 2, this was imperative to me. Sam treated both parties with total RESPECT always . That was very important to me.  I did my part and provided the true facts, evidence and proof- he did his part and presented my case with true professionalism , Integrity and no one was disrespected in the process. I would \ud83d\udcaf percent recommend Sam & Dani Bone if you want to be represented by someone who will always have your back and is not afraid to fight for your best interest.

Sam will be honest about your case, talk with you about the possibilities, and develop a plan to protect your best interests. Phone calls/emails are answered promptly and you are made aware of appointments and court actions. Even though my case was regular family law issues, it was treated as a priority.\n\nWhen emotions run high and people play dirty, you need an attorney that will keep you focused. It was nothing short of a blessing to have Sam\u2019s counsel during this time. Sam will listen and use what will benefit your case most, helping you to make the best decisions.\n\nThrough my experience, I learned that Sam is wise beyond his years and holds a unique combination of qualities that make him an excellent attorney. He is a younger lawyer in comparison to many of the veterans in the area, but his expertise speaks through shrewd discernment, both in and outside the courtroom.\n\nIn retrospect, I know that employing a professional, well-versed attorney who gave honest legal advice was a valuable asset to me.

We chose Tim since he was  a member of our legal plan to represent us in a civil case. After telling us that the plan would not cover our case, we paid Tim a $2500 retainer. During this time Tim would be proactive and mail us copies of whatever documents he would send or file with the courts. I looked over our legal plan and found that his charges should have, in fact, been covered by our plan.Our legal plan's counse determined that this was so and advised Tim of the same. Since being notified that his time would be covered by the plan and  to not use my retainer for covered charges, I stopped getting any correspondence from his office. No copies of any documents,  no phone calls, no more updates, nothing. Tim never even told us that there was a hearing for summary judgement. The  only reason we found out was from a copy of the order from the  court, itself.  After the hearing, we found out that Tim didn't even argue our case as we had discussed. We eventually lost our case. Tim didn't even bother to notify us until over a week later. When asked about our options, Tim determined that he no longer wanted to represent us and referred us to another attorney who wouldn't even return our calls. When asked about the refund of the $2500 retainer, Tim put us off for over 6 weeks until he finally acknowledged he was trying to \"come up\" with the money. Our legal plan counsel had also been contacting him to return our retainer without further delay. Throughout this time and during our case Tim would never initiate contact with us. We had to initiate contact with him. Even then, it would take anywhere from a week and a half to a month before he would respond.  Tim eventually decided after 46 days that he was no longer going to refund our money despite knowing that his charges were covered by our plan. I have yet to get a breakdown of how my retainer was spent, much less anything else. I would never refer him to anyone. Now he is running for circuit court judge.

I asked how much I had left in my retainer so I would have proof, since I didn't trust her at all at this point. She wouldn't give me a number but claimed I had plenty left that she doesn't charge much for anything. After I fired her she sent an itemized statement claiming I only had a couple hundred left and it would be mailed to me. I have filed a BBB complaint and a dispute with credit card company.

First, after we settled with Mom on visitation and ect.. we got the paper work and she had omitted an entire year of child visitation, she filed to have it corrected and filed it wrong, then we discovered she omitted another VERY important agreement that was made between them. I emailed her about it and she told me to email the Mom's attorney (unprofessional), I did so and copied her. A few days past and I never heard anything back so I emailed her again, she then told me it was not on the agreement made between them and sent the paper work I had sent her and the Mom's attorney. I told her I was confused, it was at the bottom right of the 2nd page, to which she replied oh I see now-ok, I will get an amendment filed. The next day, I asked her if she had reached out to Mom's attorney and she replied: Respectfully, there is no need to send ongoing emails, she said she would only communicate with my son going forward. She never even said she was sorry for messing up the papers 3 separate times. When we hired her, I explained that we knew we were not her only clients but this was very important to us. At first things seemed ok but once I paid the final bill and we discovered she left stuff out of the papers her attitude changed. When you make a mistake you apologize for the mistake and correct it, not make the client feel guilty for asking for it to be corrected.In addition to all of this, we were having my son added to the birth certificate, Margret told us to give it 2 months after the judge signed off on it and we could just get a copy at the Health Dept, when my son went to get it Vital Records had the birth certificate on hold because \"our attorney\" did not pay the $49.50 fee to have it changed nor were we EVER told about the fee. It took him 3 hours to get it straightened out. I would NOT recommend her to ANYONE. Respect goes both ways. When we met with her, I told her I knew we were not her only clients but this was VERY important to us.

While my charges were from 2017, I was not arrested until 2019 because I was sent to the hospital on the date of the offense instead of jail and diagnosed with Sudden Traumatic Shock exasperated by alcohol.  Being arrested was completely out of the norm for me.  I did not know where to begin, what to expect, and was consistently imagining the worst possible outcomes and scenarios.  Based off my charges, my bail agent highly recommended that I contact Mr. Crumbly for counsel.  I had an initial meeting with Mr. Crumbly within a week from the first time I contacted him.  The initial meeting did not take longer then an hour and during that time Mr. Crumbly was able to explain all my available options to include representation options, payment options, court expectations, and expected timelines.  Perhaps the most beneficial thing Mr. Crumbly discussed in the initial meeting was the overall stress of the situation.  He told me that it was human nature to imagine the worst possible outcomes and to not worry about that as it was him and his teams job to make sure those outcomes don\u2019t happen.  He was absolutely right and ,during the entire course of my case, I constantly imagined the worst possible scenarios; however, I always made myself think back to that initial conversation with Mr. Crumbly and remembered that is why he is there.  After that initial meeting, Mr. Crumbly and his team handled everything for 6 months up until my court date with the Judge.  Before I even had to go before the Judge, Mr. Crumbly had secured a deal with the DA for me to enter the Pre-Trial Intervention Program (PTIP) and have charges dropped following the completion of the program.  I was more than happy to enter PTIP as it took all uncertainty and stress off the table and I was able to hold everything going forward in my own hands.

He takes his work very seriously, and has a huge heart that most attorneys just make you feel like a number and only care about your money, but he is not at all that way.  He really cares about his clients,and appreciates each and every one.  There is no one that I know that has the heart and knowledge of law that he does. He is genuine, kind, ambitious and most of all caring.  He is a family man with kids, and he knows how important it is that he takes care of you.  My words are only from my heart about this man.  You have to give him a chance to understand for yourself that what I say about him is nothing but honest and loyal.  But I do want and need to add something to my review about Russell..he is not only caring, ambitious, and knowledgeable, he is also very direct, will always be truthful to you and you need to be truthful with him.  He can not help you if you are not.  He is humble and kind...but he can not help if you will not open up to him, because how can he help you if you are not giving your all to him.

His office has been helpful and detail oriented to ensure that we knew everything that was going on and kept me up to date every step of the way.  They were always friendly and accommodating.  Even while not representing me, he was able to give me some great advice about my father's will and estate after my father had passed away.  He took the time out of his busy day to tell me what I needed to do and who it would be that I needed to find and contact once it went to probate.  This is not his area of expertise, he was just helping me know where to start.  He explained to me the process.   Since it was a large city that my father lived in, it was a while before the estate went to probate and I assumed I had been written out due to my father's controlling sister so I didn't bother looking into it until 2 years later when I was found by a life insurance company and received a letter explaining that I was the beneficiary of a policy.  I then took Mr. Crumbley's advice by finding the attorney through the probate court and found that I had many savings bonds, which the sister told me had been spent 10 years prior.

The DA will lie straight to your face.  The DA will threaten you with the highest jail terms to get you to plead guilty so they don't have to take it to trial.  Their in house legal assistants that are there to help guide defendants will tell you that if you don't take the plea \"deal\" that you wont win.  They are only there to help the DA, not you.  It's very difficult, especially when it's your word against law enforcement officers, many who have no problem lying in court and they're buddies with the judge.  You need someone who knows the law and knows how the courts work.  It wont be free, but it's worth it to not have to go to jail and/or have a record haunting you.  For more serious crimes, you may get a public defender, but your life is on the line with someone who may not care about you or what happens to you.

His office has been helpful and detail oriented to ensure that we knew everything that was going on and kept me up to date every step of the way.  They were always friendly and accommodating.  Even while not representing me, he was able to give me some great advice about my father's will and estate after my father had passed away.  He took the time out of his busy day to tell me what I needed to do and who it would be that I needed to find and contact once it went to probate.  This is not his area of expertise, he was just helping me know where to start.  He explained to me the process.   Since it was a large city that my father lived in, it was a while before the estate went to probate and I assumed I had been written out due to my father's controlling sister so I didn't bother looking into it until 2 years later when I was found by a life insurance company and received a letter explaining that I was the beneficiary of a policy.  I then took Mr. Crumbley's advice by finding the attorney through the probate court and found that I had many savings bonds, which the sister told me had been spent 10 years prior.  The executrix allegedly told the attorney that she tried to contact me, but she did not  Thanks to these cushions I have been able to go back to school.\n\nI want to add, if anyone is in legal trouble, please seek counsel.  The DA will lie straight to your face.  The DA will threaten you with the highest jail terms to get you to plead guilty so they don't have to take it to trial.  Their in house legal assistants that are there to help guide defendants will tell you that if you don't take the plea \"deal\" that you wont win.  They are only there to help the DA, not you.  It's very difficult, especially when it's your word against law enforcement officers, many who have no problem lying in court and they're buddies with the judge.  You need someone who knows the law and knows how the courts work.  It wont be free, but it's worth it to not have to go to jail and/or have a record haunting you.  For more serious crimes, you may get a public defender, but your life is on the line with someone who may not care about you or what happens to you.  It's a dangerous risk to take and once you are convicted, it's harder to find people to listen to you.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1541428090094, "text": "How kind of you. Thank you.

When I explained I was busy I was asked if I would speak with him over the phone. I agreed and I was transfered to Mr. Crumbley.  After listening to me explain my why I left the review and my account of my interactions with Mr. Matt Wisda, Mr. Crumbley asked me several questions.\n1. Would I consider removing my review?\n2. Would I consider moving it to Mr. Wisda\u2019s webpage?\n3. If he (Crumbley) were to fire Mr. Wisda would I then delete my review! I said no.\n4. Was there ANYTHING he (Crumbley) could say or do that would result in me removing the review? To which I responded \u201cNot ethically\u201d, because I felt he was trying to \u201clead me\u201d into asking for a monetary resolution.\n\nDuring our discussion Mr. Crumbley stated he was not at all happy about Mr. Wisda\u2019s conduct. And that he was considering actions (including termination).  He asked once more if there was anything he could do To get me to retract the review against \u201cCrumbley, Blackwell, & Wisda Lawfirm\u201d.  I explained to him that when I researched Divorce Attorneys/Firms I based my decision in part on the reviews of his Firms website and information regarding the lawyers and therefore would not consider removing the review. We said goodbye and I hung up.\n\nI spent that day wondering if he would call again. I just knew \u201cIT\u201d wasn\u2019t over.\nSo this evening I checked on my review out of curiosity...and wouldn\u2019t you know it there is this long drawn out explanation that it was I who was misinformed etc.  Never once mentioning any unethical behavior on behalf of Mr. Wisda!\nI want to SHOUT from the highest rooftops what a sleazy slimeball you are! Shall I post more? Shall I post information Mr. Wisda freely disclosed to me about a clearly VERY SENSITIVE divorce and custody battle where the children involved had been...!\nYou disgust me!\n\nI retained Matt Wisda to represent me for my divorce.  I feel he acted unethically.\nI contacted his office after receiving an invoice for services that were not rendered. When I followed up with an appointment a few days later not only did he begin by talking about another case he had been working on (this was the 2nd time he mentioned details of this other party's case!) but he also presented me with an official Settlement Agreement\" that clearly stated me and my spouse had both agreed to - WHICH NEITHER OF US HAD!\n\nWe never went through discovery at all! No mediation - nothing!\nThe entire document looked copy and pasted, and all of the assets and then some were to be awarded to me!\n\nMr. Wisda was trying to fool me into thinking he had been hard at work on my case and that I was entitled to everything when in fact he hadn't done anything. Additionally It was never my intention to try take my husband to the proverbial cleaners. I just wanted a fair settlement.\n\nI didn't even look at the \"Settlement Agreement\" he'd drawn up while at his office. I had already decided to sever our business agreement and told him so.  I asked when I could pick up my remaining retainer and he said it would be about a week.\n\nWhen I went to pick up the monies, enclosed with my check was an invoice of almost $700 for the bogus \"Settlement Agreement\" that had been drawn up without consultation or discovery.  Coincidentally the new invoice showed just one line item for the preparing of said agreement which was dated after the phone call I mentioned above.\n\nI immediately drew up a letter refusing to pay and insisting I be refunded.  Additionally in the letter I called him out for trying to fool me and get paid for it. I emailed this letter and received a response early the next morning stating they would immediately refund the that money, which they did.\n\nI am leaving this review to make others aware.  In our consultation meeting he told me his practice \"is like a game to me.\"  And because  conducting his business in such a way, I feel, is an abuse of his power as an attorney and is extremely unethical.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1528493792927, "text": "We deeply regret that your experience with our office did not meet your expectation. We work very hard to not let that happen. Having said that, you say that you received a \u201csettlement agreement\u201d that indicated you and your husband had agreed to the settlement terms when, in fact, you had not agreed. You also say that this agreement was put together without doing any \u201cdiscovery\u201d or any \u201cmediation\u201d. You initially hired Mr. Wisda to assist you in negotiating an uncontested divorce with your husband\u2019s lawyer. In fact, you produced, for us, a \u201csettlement agreement\u201d created by your husband\u2019s lawyer when you hired Mr. Wisda. That settlement agreement had already been prepared absent any \u201cdiscovery\u201d or attempt to \u201cmediate\u201d. It was clearly the intentions of both parties (and their lawyers) to settle this matter, if possible, without costly litigation. This type divorce typically does not involve \u201cdiscovery\u201d (in the traditional sense) and most certainly doesn\u2019t involve \u201cmediation\u201d. In these type matters we simply go with settlement negotiations to the extent we are able, which necessarily includes \u201csettlement proposals\u201d. Also, in this type situation, both parties tend to agree that they know what the assets are and their values are not in dispute.\n\nThe \u201csettlement agreement\u201d your husband\u2019s attorney prepared, and gave you, was just like the one Mr. Wisda gave you. In reviewing your husband\u2019s proposal it is noted that it also includes language stating that the two of you \u201cacknowledged and agreed\u201d to things that you had not already agreed upon. In other words, both lawyers settlement agreements included the very same language in that regard. In fact, most paragraphs in all settlement agreements are full of language such as \u201cthe parties acknowledge and agree \u2026\u201d. This language is included to satisfy legal requirements and applies to you ONLY AFTER you have actually read it, agreed to it and signed it. It is not intended to mean that you have already seen it and agreed to it. And, it is NEVER INTENDED to deceive. Your attorney, Matt Wisda, did exactly what your husband\u2019s lawyer did with respect to that language.\n\nAs far as the \u201cattempt to fool you\u201d is concerned: you received an itemized statement of the charges. You received two billing statements. The second of those two seems to be where you objected. That statement involves the \u201csettlement agreement\u201d. You were dissatisfied with that charge and objected to that bill and, although you had NOT notified him of your desire to terminate him until after that work was done, we refunded every penny to you of that part of the bill. And your objection, as much as any we can tell, is founded on your belief that it included the \u201cbogus\u201d settlement language indicating that you and your husband had agreed to the terms that you had not agreed to.\n\nWe strive to handle cases the way our clients direct us. And, while the services you received were not satisfactory to you, Mr. Wisda DID NOT bill you for services not rendered. His conduct was not unethical. His ability to communicate effectively with you, I will agree, must have missed the mark. For example, we are not sure how, exactly, you did not understand that the \u201cacknowledged and agreed\u201d language in the settlement agreement did not mean you had both already agreed to that agreement. That was no more the intent of what Mr. Wisda provided you than it was the intent of what your husband\u2019s attorney provided him. It was merely two lawyers doing their jobs and adding the language that was going to be necessary at some point, in advance. Perhaps THAT is why it looked copied and pasted.\n\nWe would encourage ANYONE who is dissatisfied in ANY way, with ANYONE in our office, to meet with any of us. WE ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE to meet with that person and do everything we can to alleviate their concern and fight for your cause. Your case matters to us. And, YOU matter to us. Best wishes moving forward during this trying time.\n\n~ Russell Crumbley & Matt Wisda"}, "gmap_id": "0x886214b5eb6aa54b:0x60d777fdf93ee41a"}

Mr. Crumbley is the most exceptional, top notch attorney in the area and will exceed your expectations each and every time under his representation. He has represented me on 4 separate cases (3 misdemeanor and 1 felony) and has impressed me more and more each time with his results with all 4 of the cases being dismissed with NOT GUILTY verdicts when I was very GUILTY as a matter of fact. As soon as he walks in the courtroom you should know that you will be taken care of. This mans representation is like the results of having the combination of Peyton Manning in the regular season and Tom Brady in the playoffs which in other words is about as good as is gets when in comes to criminal defense representation. I honestly do not have enough words or ways that I can use to describe how high level of an attorney he is and worth every dollar of the premium cost to afford him to represent you because you get what you pay for so you won\u2019t be disappointed no matter how guilty you are of your charges. Don\u2019t hesitate to call his office as they are more than happy to assist you with whatever questions or concerns you may have in regards to your case. Mr. Crumbley is hands down the best attorney in our area for any criminal matters. Do yourself a favor and make sure you hire him to take care of yourself because I\u2019d honestly be hesitant to have anybody else to represent me in a potential criminal defense situation besides Mr. Crumbley. To Teles Walker, you won\u2019t find a better attorney or receive a better result than having Mr. Crumbley by your side and am sure you received a contract as Mr. Crumbley is always sure to provide one so everyone out there should disregard any negative reviews because those folks are more than likely either trolls or generally unhappy with their own lives and you can tell the literacy of the individual by reading their review from a grammatical standpoint. To the rest of the folks out there, be sure to disregard the ignorant individuals reviews as that is a false representation of Mr. Crumbleys services. As GUILTY as any individual may be, I can guarantee that you will receive the best possible legal result with Mr. Crumbley by your side and I say that with no doubt in mind. There is a good reason as to why you see his billboards all around our area and it\u2019s for his consistently exceptional results.

EVERYTHING must be ALWAYS viewed with the proper perspective. I appreciate your strong, heartfelt words but they weren't necessary. We take cases all across the board and that includes cases that are very difficult and filled with a multitude of considerations, possibilities and opportunities - even for failure.

They also had a video you could watch & it really impressed me because they were so family oriented.  I made an appointment for a free consultation.  I was very impressed by the attention I got & the answers I received so I retained them.  They told me I could call any time I had a question or didn\u2019t understand something.  Well believe me I called with questions all the time (early in the morning or in the evenings) and even sent emails, lots of emails and they had answers for me & quickly.  If they didn\u2019t have an answer they researched it and got back to me.  They fought for my case and fought hard.  They were very thorough and knew what questions to ask the opposing attorney.  I received everything I asked for and more.  I couldn\u2019t be happier.  The whole staff at The Rose Law Firm, LLC was there for me.

Our goal is always to minimize your stress as much as possible by completing cases as quickly, efficiently, and painless as possible under any given circumstance, and though we did try to do just that, I can understand your frustration at the entire situation you were put in to begin with by the opposing party. Unfortunately, as you witnessed, we do occasionally run into an extremely uncooperative opposing party who wants nothing more than to make the process more painful for everyone and who is intent on dragging the process out by any means necessary even if that means making serious allegations that we have to defend the client from. Although I really hated to lose you as a client right at the very end of your case, I\u2019m happy that we were able to take care of almost all necessary litigation for you including depositions, temporary hearings, the entire discovery process, and a settlement conference. I\u2019m glad to hear that someone else was able to pick right up where we left off and take care of the last steps for you in order to finish up your case. We have also been in the position many times wherein we\u2019ve taken over for another attorney and have been able to finish things relatively quickly due to most of the work already having been done, as it was in your particular situation.  Again, I\u2019m very sorry that the process was made so unnecessarily painful for you by the opposing party. That said, if you ever need support, if we can help you in any other way, or you just want to talk about all of this in more detail, please feel free to call us on our cell phones as we\u2019re always more than happy to answer your call.

Although we\u2019re all human, I personally would not easily excuse or have faith in any attorney that forgot a file even if it didn\u2019t have any outcome on your final case disposition. I have very high standards for myself and anyone that works for me and I can assure you I would have dealt with this former associate had you made me aware at the time. Regardless, I sincerely apologize. Although forgetting a file was totally out of character for him, I hope you can take some solace in the fact that he is no longer with the firm and has not been for over 5 years.  Although many years have passed since your case, you might recall that I was dealing with a life-threatening medical issue when you hired the firm and was not able to take your case on myself and thus the reason you used my associate at that time.  As far as multiple attorneys are concerned, I assume you are referring to our collaborative approach to law. We often have a primary and second chair attorney on a case working together. While this doesn\u2019t affect the overall cost of your case, the benefits to you can be immense. For instance, though all our attorneys are great we will use each attorney\u2019s greatest strengths to your advantage, so if someone is a better writer or researcher they might be assigned to that portion of your case. In addition, when it comes time to strategize on your case, instead of one attorney coming up with a strategy, you might have three or four working out the best strategy though you will only get billed for the time of one. In effect, you get the knowledge and expertise of multiple full-time family law attorneys for the price of one. This is something most firms can\u2019t offer. I apologize if this process wasn\u2019t clearly explained at the outset of your retaining of the firm. I will make sure that going forward we outline the process in writing to make it easier for clients to understand.

I will start with not being notified of canceled meetings and court dates. Actually I got a call one time canceling a meeting that I wasn't even told I had. Was informed by the defendant about a court cancelation and then a few days later received the letter from my attorney with a post marked date after my court date. The firm had to postpone my last court date because my attorney had another client that had a case to carry over from the previous week. When I questioned Mrs. Rose about hiring a new attorney and putting her on my case she told me I hired the Rose Law Firm not her.  With invoices showing her reviewing my case and me being charged for it I asked her why there was nobody from the firm there to represent me instead of me having to postpone again and her answer to me was \u201cyour case may not have been tried anyways \". You are charged for each email to and from as .10 of an hour unless there is an attachment and then it is .20. If you have a meeting scheduled and they have to cancel then you are charged for them to call and tell you. You are charged for them to park for court. Over a year and a half and all that has been done is cases postponed, deposition, emails, phone calls, 4 or 5 subpoenas, and a temporary order  that had to let my son live with his mother until another court date could be scheduled and I promise people would not believe what  I have paid for this service. Was told I would get a special setting for my case in order to get this done and now have found out the court  date scheduled for 4 months later is not a special setting and will most likely be pushed back further and cost me several thousand more dollars. I could go over the 4000 characters very easily with the way my case has been handled by this firm but if I can save one person from this problem then the $20,000+ will not have been ifor nothing.\n\nPS.....the firm has withdrawn from my case without letting me know and now I am just out those many thousands of dollars and have to start over with a new attorney which proves this firm cares about one thing and it is not your family.

False advertisement Really!! My true story: My now ex husband and I went through a chaotic divorce and his lawyer was Mr. McGhee. My experience is based on what I dealt with in phone and email conversations as well as what was told to me by my ex husband and McGhee's  Secretary and how the divorce was handled. First Mr. Mcghee, does not like to speak to people that are \"Pro Se\" (representing yourself) so even though you worked for over 10 years in the law field as a paralegal and you can easily save your money by doing the settlement and divorce yourself, Shawn McGhee will make sure to give you a hard time. Not only does he lie and says there is a conflict of interest, which is why he won't speak to you which by the way, THAT IS NOT TRUE, but he will not answer any of the calls. For whatever reason he was not able to speak to me which to me seems very unprofessional, he would often have his secretary let me know what was needed for the divorce to be settled. I think because I do know what I needed to do legally, and trust me lawyers hate people that have worked in law fields you cant pull a sheet over legal assistants or paralegals eyes easily, we know all the tricks.  Now his secretary had given me some information that had holes in what she said that included the discovery process and hearings as well as the laws. Because of the communication between me and her and then what she told my ex husband of what I said, which were twisted, this made the divorce messy and long . And I believe the reason was for trial which is very expensive, but lawyers love expensive. Now one thing which is grounds for a grievance is that Mr. McGhee gave advice on the amount of payments for child support that should be paid which is unethical and should only be done by a referee. Mr. Mcghee, has no compassion for children as he informs his clients that they don't need to be responsible parents and pay for the kids until a judge says so, which to me makes me wonder about his character. Being out of state I was not able to do much, and my ex did not even live in Alabama as law requires in order to file but as usual somehow McGhee got around that. I have worked for law firms since I was 16 years old I could never work for someone that does things that are unethical, shady and down right wrong  he has no moral character, and I would be scared if my papers would be questioned by a judge with the amount of lies that my ex and his lawyer gave to me.  Please look at other Law firms that will look at your case and care enough to not control your decisions and won't run up your bill for no reason. Me and my ex husband  managed to settle together without the hearsay talk of his lawyer. The issue I have is there are amazing lawyers out there and Mr. Mcghee is the reason that lawyers have such a bad reputation. Make sure you chose a lawyer that will care about your interests and especially the kids, don't let the kids get lost in the divorce they are the most important thing, don't let the lawyer stress you or the other party or you will cause more harm and extend something that is not good for anyone. And make sure to hold your ground. Research on your lawyer don't chose someone because they are cheap eventually they will show you why they are cheap, Mr. Mcghee was affordable for my ex-husband until hearings and trial came around and then up goes his hourly.

Involved in a case that had never been before the Alabama Courts, we had no idea if we should fight or roll over and (pay)dead.  I am far from being a quitter but sometimes you feel that there is nothing or no one that can help you and the ones you care for. Sometimes it seems that the Justice system is anything but just. This is exactly how we felt all the way up to our final hearing. We new we were going to need an intelligent and thorough attorney. We researched and asked people who we should use and was referred to Mark. We went and talked with him and he took our case, but told us he couldn't promise anything. He told us that he would do the best he could, and that was all we could ask for. We just wanted what was fair and felt it was worth the fight. After trying to go to court without an attorney and seeing how that was going we just knew we had to have representation. Our finances were extremely tight and we worried that it might just all be for naught. It seemed the law just didn't have anything to protect us. Mark Gober searched and searched and found cases in several other states that supported our side, and gave us some hope. Still we were concerned that it could go either way. We even were concerned that the truth was not going to come out because everyone kept saying that it was all irrelevant. Even with all of the negative things we were hearing  we stuck it out and kept fighting because we felt that it mattered. We wanted our case to maybe help someone else in the future. Mark surpassed anything that we could have expected when we got in the courtroom for our final hearing. We were amazed by how thorough he was without even having to bring every detail into it (which could have taken a lot more time and cost us a whole lot more money). I could not believe it when he actually got them to admit things on the stand that showed exactly what was going on. Justice was truly done as much as it could possibly be thanks to Mark.
