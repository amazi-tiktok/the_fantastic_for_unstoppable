She then came over near where I was and turned her back to me while I was holding the shoe in my hand and fixed some other shoes on the wall. So I them place the shoe back and left the store I\u2019ll never go I.

Found the cutest two dresses and proceeded to the check to ask if I could leave them there for ten mins while I walk literally two stores down. I\u2019ve done this time and time before we always eat at the local restaurant connected to the strip mall. I was quickly told NO sorry we can\u2019t hold anything. I was a little shocked and explained she was two doors down and I wanted to make sure they were a good fit due to them being final sale. The two looked at each other and said sorry because you can go online 24 hours and order we aren\u2019t allowed to hold anything. Now if I\u2019d previously not held something before maybe I\u2019d believe them. One proceeded to say I\u2019ll put it in the fitting room and we can just say she\u2019s waiting on the fitting room!! Which means YOUR HOLDING IT. I smiled and told them that was ok and walked out needless to say I will only order from online or if I see the manager ( can\u2019t remeber her name but she\u2019s awesome) I\u2019ll only shop then. These two youngsters possible need a lesson on customer service!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cb171d4f769:0xad3f59ee2c264cd2"}

But if I\u2019m about to buy something & I\u2019m trying it on why is the staff asking how long I got in the dressing room she knocked on door more than once , like was there a time limit or something? she kept asking me other people need to try on stuff I\u2019m thinking like it\u2019s about 4 other rooms & then they told me once I go in I can\u2019t go in but once.  With that being said I made sure that I took in all what I could & wanted to purchase. Like don\u2019t rush I\u2019m trying multiple pieces, come out it\u2019s like one person with two other people sitting including a man, which he is not trying on stuff waiting. Manager kept making small comments to staff hardly spoke when I came in....I wanted to give them a piece of my mind but wasn\u2019t worth my time,  hence store was only open about 45 mins when I arrived so I don\u2019t want to hear anything about a long day.

I forgot to ask when I was checking out because she'd left for the day heading to the UAB library (I overheard her talking).  I called this morning to get her name but April (who said she was a manager) told me that she couldn't give me her name. The young lady this review is about is  African American and wears her hair in a natural afro type style. This young lady is a determent to your establishment.  Upon me arriving, I walked to the rear to inquire about a restroom.  In a very annoyed tone, she says \"Ma'am is there something I can help you with back there?\"  I walked from the dressing room and said \"I was looking for a bathroom.\" I've visited the NYCO at the Summit and familiar with the bathroom being located near the dressing room.  Very snippy, she said \"our bathroom is not open to the public try The Children's Place\".  I said thank you and she begin to talk very sternly to another customer about a coupon that she could NOT accept.  So I left to head to the Children's place, and returned to hear this lady now talking to another customer about the mis-placement of a blouse/shirt.  I was eavesdropping, but I didn't have to try hard because the cashier has a loud, stern, firm voice and it echoed thru the building.  She pretty much was telling the patron that she would not give her a shirt for a price just because it was located in an area that had a sign for a less expensive cost. The message she conveyed may have been true, but again, her TONE and ATTITUDE were horrible.  The customer left quielty.  But that was not the end of the convo for your cashier.  Two other cashiers were talking in whispered voices with the young lady and they seemed to be trying to calm her down.  In her overly loud voice the cashier (again I think her name is Shelby but I do not recall), this young lady repeatedly yelled \"she doesnt know who I AM!  I could be the regional manager!  I could have really shown her who I was, but I'm trying to be professional.  She and her mother...and she is this, and she is that....\"  I was shopping in your store and there were at least 4 other customers inside the store at the time.  So her tone definitely disturbed our shopping experience. I just needed this to be known because it appears that this young lady thinks that her behavior is appropriate.   I was happy to see her go because I did not want her to check me out at the cash register. I hope the lady she was rude to reports her as well. It was inappropriate and lacked professionalism.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890dc81b7d769f:0x1410983c41984a82"}

The girls got me right back. Shelby was my stylist & she was awesome. I told her exactly what I wanted; which was a dress with sleeves.  I showed her pictures from online & she found all the dresses. I'm a plus size bride so I was scared; I wouldn't have a lot of selections. I was very wrong; they had dresses in stock for any size bride. Shelby found me three great dresses. There was a dress online that had short sleeves. Shelby let me try on the same dress in strapless & told me she could order it for me with sleeves. Shelby explained payment arrangements & credit options to pay for the dress. Shelby broke everything down in detail for me. Which was very helpful for a new bride with a budget. I was very close to ordering that dress. But, I really wanted to try it on with the sleeves. I was so impressed with David's Bridal in Tuscaloosa; I made an appointment the same day at the David's Bridal in Hoover. I was thinking Hoover would have more dresses with sleeves & possibly have that dress with sleeves to try on. That was the worst idea ever. The store in Hoover is a huge disappointment for David's Bridal. The customer service needs to be reviewed at the Hoover store. The employees at that store are very unprofessional. After the bad experience at the Hoover store; I started reading reviews & asking friends. Apparently that is common for the David's Bridal in Hoover. If I decide to order through David's Bridal, it will definitely be with the Tuscaloosa David's Bridal. Great job David's Bridal in Tuscaloosa.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a8363211ca3b:0xc839cac2cd80b238"}

The manager then accused her of shoplifting and admitted to following them around the store. After my daughter willingly allowed her to look in her purse, finding nothing, the manager still called the police. My daughter stayed and waited on the police asking to see any video showing her shoplifting. The police officer then examined her purse and found nothing.The police officer asked them to leave and said that the manager did not want them to return to the store. I'm a little confused because I did not know that you could be banned from a store for trying to spend money, because my silly daughter was still wanting to purchase the costume.The manager never apologized or admitted to being mistaken, but she did say \"that she know what \"you people\" do and that she was going to jail and told my 9 year old that she and her niece were going to DHR.\" I'm glad that the people that had these great  experiences were not the \"you people\"  that steal.

At the start, I had expert advice and help from Ben who fashioned two outfits for the preceding parties. The styling, the fit, and the attention to detail was superb. If you like things done right, go to Shaia's. But the story continues, for the actual wedding day we had a tuxedo picked out that was being made in Italy. The factory had to shut down due to the virus and in the few weeks leading up to the wedding, I was facing quite the dilemma. Ben called me for a special appointment to come in and see what could be done from what was on hand at the store. Ben and Ken went far beyond the extra mile to make sure I was not only clothed for my wedding, but the tuxedo was classy, comfortable, and contained the right amount of original. I cannot recommend Shaia's any higher. There were even a few other minor disasters with needing a haircut and my brides' dress needing last minute alterations that we took to Ken because he just got things done. This is where you can truly see Ken's kindness. He helped us in a huge way during our time of need.

But those are the only positive things that I can say about my experience.  The sales lady immediately asked what I was looking for and I told her that I would just like to look around for a few minutes if that was ok because this was my first time in the store.  Well, I guess that wasn\u2019t ok because she started asking me all of these questions.  I told her that I wanted to look at a pair of Birkenstock but that I had never had a pair before so I needed help with the sizing and no one in my area carried them and I had driven over an hour to come and look at them.  She immediately tried to get me to look at another name brand and told me she liked them better but I told her that I was there to look at Birkenstock.  I guess I got the wrong idea about this store, since I didn\u2019t know my size I thought maybe they would measure my feet and actually try to help with a size but I left just as about confused as I did when I went in.  She kept changing her mind about what size she thought I needed.  She ended up telling me they didn\u2019t have my size and color in stock which is ok because by this point I probably would have not bought them anyway and I don\u2019t know how she even knew about the size when she kept changing her mind.  She told me that since I had never had Birkenstock before that there was going to be a break in period and that I still needed to look at the other name brand that she was trying to push.  I told her that I wasn\u2019t stupid enough to pay $135 for a pair of shoes without reading up on them and doing a little research and that was exactly what I had done with the Birkenstock that I was interested in.  I wasn\u2019t wanting to spend that kind of money that day just because I had nothing better to do, I knew exactly what I was wanting to look at.  She told me that she didn\u2019t like Birkenstock because they hurt her feet but before I could get out of the store, she told me that she had two pairs that she loved.  What???  And if this was not already bad enough, at one point she left me standing barefoot in the middle of the store next to the Birkenstock display so she could go follow some lady around that was making a return that she had apparently helped a day or two before.  There was another associate that could have helped her.  And my sales lady was walking around with the shoe that I was needing to try on.  Needless to say, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be back and I would much rather shop at the small locally owned stores and with the craziness of the last year, you think they would appreciate your business but this store doesn\u2019t need to count on me to keep them in business.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862132dc5e388db:0x4a2c43068782f22b"}

The salesperson lit up and mentioned that I have to try something...not that over the years, I've gone to local running stores and was offered several inserts that have been just OK.  And trust me, I've tried them all.  However, at Valley Sole I was introduced to BirkoSport inserts, which are very different...they essentially make any shoe feel like a Birkenstock.  Even if you don't suffer from any foot ailments, I'd try these, they are excellent and have several variations which would appear to meet any foot size/ shape etc.  I like these so much that I\"m going to invest in several pairs and upgrade all of my shoes, dress, running, work boots, skates, etc.  Also, while I was at Valley Sole I was introduced to several very high quality brands and purchased 2 other pairs of casual shoes.

On January 2, about 12:00pm, I went back with the unworn product, in the original box, receipt still in the box, to return the item.  (Note: A time lapse of less than 6 hours as they were closed on the 1st.)\nI was told that I could not return it because it was sale merchandize.\nThe communication of that policy was extremely poor- it is not posted, the sale items are not marked, individually or as a group, and the sales people do not tell you verbally.\nThe only place that policy is communicated is on the sales receipt.  In addition, there are no prices on anything: sale or regular price items.\n\nThe store manager told the sales girl that she would take care of me, asked me to wait while she checked on something.  Returning to take care of me, she informed me that she had checked store records and since I was a regular customer I knew  about the \"no return on sales merchandize\" policy and therefore she could not help me.  (This should give you cause for concern, regular customers are given no preferential treatment.)\nShe offered for me to leave the item with her and said that if I did and walked out, she had no further obligation.\nI continued to try to convince her that I was a new customer and had no idea about the policy.  I asked where it was posted, etc.  Her response was that in the state of Alabama it is \"Buyer Beware\".  I agreed that she could enforce that policy.\n\nI asked if she typically opened the shoe box to read the receipt before she left stores so she could find \"no return\" policies, because that is the only way I could have discovered theirs. (I use the word 'discover' intentionally because this store seems to hide everything: prices, policies...)\nI told her that reputation is important these days with internet data accessibility and that she left me with no alternative but to blog this occurrence.\nThen she wrote me a receipt stating the amount I was owed I could spend in cash with that piece of paper and if I lost it there would be no effort of correction.\n\nAs if all of this, and the fact that I was now required to return, was not bad enough, when I turned to leave she told me that had I behaved differently she could have resolved this another way.  Basically, she did not like me (subjective) so she chose not to return my money.\nTHIS IS A HORRIBLE WAY TO RUN A BUSINESS!!  She just admitted to me that she could have given me what I asked for.  God forbid we do what the customer wants.\nMy thoughts are that their business model is failing.  The only reason to go in this store is to try on the shoes you want to purchase for a fit check and then go and purchase them at a discounted price on the internet.\nThe manager's justification from the other blogs--that it is a service oriented store is untrue.  The sales staff is so immature and inexperienced that they are a bother.  If you ask a price you are told, \"oh it is about...\"  About?  When I am shopping and spending these amounts of money, I want to know the exact price.\nThey seem to have lost sight of the personal aspect of the business and are overly concerned with money.  As an example, did they not think that the sales person (blogged earlier) could also be a customer?  Can they not relate that his experience, and mine, will be publicized for other people's benefit?\nI have never been so poorly treated, ever.\nWhat a shame I have to go back.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1359382495176, "text": "Dear Sophia,\n\nThanks for your feedback.

Not very good business hours for a Friday evening and how can they cater to the working woman? There was another customer inside and the doors we locked. I stood at the door and an associate finally came.  I explained I knew exactly what Iwas looking for.  A ring that was sold out online in my size.  I drove all the way from Decatur in hopes to find it.  I shared this and she said she couldn't let me in the store as they could only be open for so many hours. What does that even mean?  There was still a customer inside.  She closed the door on me and I was extremely disappointed. I am a long time customer of Brighton from Florida that just moved to the area.  I was happy to know there was a store close enough I could still spoil myself at.  I also work for a major retailer who does not close their doors till 15 minutes AFTER their posted hours.  Very poor customer service when retailers are struggling these days.  I will not revisit this location.  They have lost my future business.  I hope Brighton and the associates consider what customer service is to them, bending the rules just a little isn't bad for business.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626ebb1a9a4141:0xd91f29629c7d123d"}

I literally did not see one piece of paper or similar debris on the floor. Shelves were nicely organized with price tags, clearance racks and store personel easy to find. Everyone (employees and customers alike) was wearing their masks and following social distancing guidelines which made the whole experience even more pleasant since I was shopping with several friends including my one year old great niece and a lifelong friend who has an extremely compromised  immune system from struggles with Crohn's disease. Scored a ton of bargains on name brands and designer's fashions. Seriously, I got my great niece a pair of sneakers and a pair of adorable boots for only $2 each. By the way, they were made by none other than the legendary JUICY COUTURE. I would have had to shell out another $45-$65 if I had purchased these designer's labels from elsewhere.  I felt practically criminal after swiping a game carrying case plus a glass screen protector (two separate items) for my son's NINTENDO SWITCH. I paid $5 for both which saved me about $15 and earned me HUGE POINTS with my son. How about this bit of awesomeness: $3 for Beyonce Pulse perfume, 3.4 ounce bottle, normally $15 or more. I also grabbed 2 hoodies for $1 each.

This really felt like a bait and switch tactic, the shoes looked identical and were confirmed that they were discounted. I was quite disappointed and we walked out.\n\nOn the plus side Amazon has the shoes promised to me for cheaper.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626eba7fb01219:0xaec45b13a00ea16a"}

We arrived a couple of hours before our showtime, so like anyone else would have done, we decided to take a look around and see what some of the stores had to offer.\n\nI saw the Un Voyage Plain in the store window as we were walking by. I was in the market for a pair of comfortable shoes to wear to an upcoming event that requires all attendees to adhere to a business casual dress code. I don't often go to these types of events, so I didn't really know what I wanted, but I was immediately drawn to this shoe when I saw it in the store window.\n\nI went in to take a closer look and was greeted by an associate named LeeAnn. She was extremely knowledgeable with a keen eye for detail. She asked me when I had had my feet measured last, and honestly I couldn't remember ever having my feet measured.\n\nAfter taking my measurements, she recommended going with a half size higher than I usually buy and using insoles to take up some of the extra space since one of my feet is a half size bigger than the other. I took her advice, and I have never been more comfortable in a pair of formal shoes.\n\nOverall the experience was great, and I will be a regular customer going forward. In fact, I received a coupon during this visit that I plan on using to purchase another pair of Voyages in black.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAYYgiOD8b13SoCSThf36p_0r9dLQXfB14gX1s=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626eba7fb01219:0xaec45b13a00ea16a"}

And by all means it should have been half that time. There really weren't many people in the store. Crafts that were supposed to start at noon didn't begin till around 12:30 and the craft person was stale and thoroughly uninterested in their job. Before when we had come there was quite a bit of interaction and Mrs. Clause even came over to help.\nIt was a total waste of time coming out here. Their restaurant isn't even open anymore.

They were marked down from $44.99. I went and did about 15 more minutes of shopping and went to check out (at 0925 AM). At check out the item showed up as $44.99 and I said I would take it over to refund for them to research the price further. The associate at the refund desk stated the price was never $17.99 and there was no sign there showing it was ever that price. My wife walked back there and could you imaging the signs mysteriously vanished from the time I picked up the item at the rack to the time I went to check out. I was made to look like a liar and a cheat by the refund associate and Bass Pro. The only thing they had to say was they had mistakenly left the sales signs up from the weekend and I would have been okay with that. Instead I had to listen to the other refund associate say I was in the right and the signs were removed late but she could not make the other associate listen to her. Funny how they want to thank you for your military service one minute and then make you out to be a liar in front of other customers the next. I will no longer be shopping at the Bass Pro Spanish Fort location and I would suggest that all customers take photos of sales prices on the racks for they are to be susceptible removed at a moments notice to prove the customer is wrong and vendor is in the right.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a430e72ad1fc5:0xde568058c6022035"}

It had been a while since I was last in there.  I have never had an issue before but this time I was there to spend some money.  I went up to look at a  rifle scope that I had been looking at online.  I went upstairs and took the long way to get there.  We were greeted properly walking in so didn't see any reason to think anything else.  We walked through the bows, then walked past the rifle racks to the scopes.  The guys working the counter were working with other customers so I looked around, I found the one I wanted to see.  In that process, I found another that I was interested in I looked up to see the status of the salespeople and they were over on the other side talking to each other and what looked to be looking at a phone behind the counter.  I left the counter went to check on kids who were by the aquarium.  We walked around and I decided I was going to get both of the scopes I found.  I went back and both salespeople were talking to one person.  So while I was waiting, I found a third scope I wanted.  The lady they were talking to left and they went back to the other end of the counter and did what they were doing before.  Now I don't like when a salesperson hovers over me, but I have worked in retail enough to at least let a customer know I am there to help.  I couldn't even get that out of them, so we walked away.  They missed a out a $4K sale.  I am not going to beg for them to help me.  They weren't busy.  The way I see it is they were just busy ignoring me.  Walking to the exit, I found a gear bag for a decent price and decided to buy it.  The man at the cash register was awesome.  If the guys at the gun counter were, Bass Pro would have sold me a lot more than a $12.99 bag.  I will go back again.

He went into the tracker boat section, spoke with two elderly gentlemen, he doesnt rememeber his name but the gentleman that let him back in the building after looking at the boats outside didnt say anything to him, just opened the door and walked away. So he approached another gentleman sitting at the desk, asked about one of the boats they had outside and about financing, the gentleman\u2019s response was if you dont have a 700 or better they wont finance you and they wont finance anything under $5000.00. Assuming because of how my husband looked that his score was under a 700. So my husband went inside and started looking at kayaks, he was up there for close to an hour and was not approached one time by a sales associate to see if he needed help, at that point he left the store. So not only did you lose a possible sale on a boat you also lost out on the sale of a kayak.

I needed to purchase some steel stakes to secure palm trees that are damaged from the storm. I went to the Montgomery Academy Sports Store and purchased these stakes. I talked with the salesman in the back and notified him of our mission and asked him if they could give us some kind of discount and was told no. I asked him to ask the manager and he did and the manager said no. When checking out of the store the manager was up front chit chatting with an employee and a customer ( doing nothing) and I again asked him face to face if he could help us out and he again said no. All the other companies have been good about discounting supplies. Lowe's of Wetumpka,  Marvins in Millbrook,  Harbour Freight,  Home Depot all have been helpful especially Lowe's in Wetumpka. After being told no face to face I told him I appreciated it and then proceeded to name the other companies that have responded responsibly. I have bought alot of product from academy over the years but this experience has left a bad test in my mouth with the company and particularly with this manager. \ud83d\udeb7", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2c40d19dfb2d:0x98f12f478f5c3c31"}

I just went online ordered a pair of shoes stated I could pick up at the store within the hour. I received a call from the store that they didn\u2019t have my item and that it would be best if I canceled my order. That my money hadn\u2019t been taken out of my account. I tried to cancel online but it kept freezing up. I called the corporate customer service waited on hold for over 30 minutes and then they cut my call off. I then called the Decatur store back and ask for a manager. The girl that answered said \u201c I\u2019m a manager\u201d she was short and rude with me . Said they would cancel my order and I would get a email or text when it was taken care of. I did receive it and it stated my money would not be back in my bank account until 7 business days. So isn\u2019t that great!! Academy ruins a Christmas present for my daughter. And has not a second thought or concern for me . I tried to do the right thing order from home social distance for everyone\u2019s safety and this is the thanks I get. I paid for an item last spring $ 700 and basically the same thing happened only difference is they didn\u2019t have my purchased item so I had to buy a $100 higher item of the same kind. I guess you make so much money that I make no difference. So I am sure I won\u2019t be missed. But very poor service and no compassion for taking someone\u2019s money at Christmas..
