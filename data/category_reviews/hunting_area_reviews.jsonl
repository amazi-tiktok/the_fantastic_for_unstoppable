Once back at the lodge, Jay Taylor the owner, Lester and Shaq the guides were all congratulating her on her first harvest. My daughter was beaming from ear to ear with a smile for the way she was treated about her first deer. Secound day of hunting she saw 9 deer and 10 turkeys. Third day was a bad thunderstorm and that evening it quit raining enough to go out. In ten minutes of being in the stand Hayden shot at a hudge 4yr old 7 point. She missed, so no wounded deer. My daughter was heart broken but with the guides kind words of wisdom and Jays encouragement she got back in the stand to keep hunting. We have have one more day of hunting but i just wanted to post about our experience at Pako. We will be back every year from now on.

The campground is actually a trailer park with some spots for camping. We stay in many campgrounds, some better than others, but this is the first time we have driven through a campground and left. I could not even find the camp office to begin with and everybody at the trailer park was staring us down when we drove through.\n\nWhen I couldn't find the office, I called the owner back to tell her we had changed our minds. She did not answer her phone. I got a phone call later on from a different number and it was the owner. I let her know that her park was not what we expected and that we had changed our minds. She got an attitude with me and said, \"Thanks for letting me know. I waited for you for over an hour.\" I then informed her that I had tried to call and she didn't answer. I did not bother to mention that she wasted an hour of my time and the gas that I used to drive to her disappointment of a trailer park that she is trying to pass off as a campground.

Captain Ron was fantastic! We stuck five big flounder, one mullet, one catfish and five stingray. I've been bowfishing before but this was my wife's and brother in law's first time. The bows were new, well maintained and at a perfect draw weight. My wife had no problems at all and outshot me! The boat was comfortable and since Captain Ron only takes out parties of four or less we all had a lot of action. He was on time and very professional in setting up the charter. We had dolphins swimming all around the boat and had an amazing time. Captain Ron was very safe, polite, and great to talk too. If you have never gone bowfishing before, GO. It's a blast, and Night Shift Charter exceeded all my expectations.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a1a737d0aa33f:0xac2c0442a5a54494"}
