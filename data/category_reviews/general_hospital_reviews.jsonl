And it\u2019s a big one.\n\nOn Monday (May 20,, 2019), my brother had an outbreak of Cellulitis, a bacterial skin infection that he has had since college. When he has a Cellulitis outbreak, he has to get medical attention immediately because it is a life-threatening infection that can spread into your lymph nodes and bloodstream quickly. Every single time he has had an issue, we have rushed him to the ER. Nearly every time he has been admitted for anywhere between 2 and 10 days. It is a serious condition.\n\nWill is a truck driver. He was out to pick up a load when he came down with this infection and was so sick that he had to have a stranger take him to the ER at Andalusia Health. Typically, the ER nurses recognize the severity and get to him quickly. Not Andalusia Health. M the waiting room quickly, it was three hours before any medication was administered. Since he was on the road \u2013 and has insurance \u2013 he requested that they admit him for the night so he could regain his strength and get enough medicine in his system to get back home so he could see his doctor. Remember, he had to drive an 18-wheeler all the way back home. The ER staff at Andalusia Health knew this. They refused to admit him, telling him he \u201cdidn\u2019t fit the criteria.\u201d Please, can someone explain what criteria one must fit to be admitted into this hospital? Is it the Harvard of hospitals? He was extremely ill and had insurance. This should have been handled immediately.\n\nWhile he arrived at the ER midday, since he didn\u2019t get to see anyone until late, my mom called the ER to explain his medical history since they would not be able to contact Will\u2019s regular doctor. The nurse she was talking to hung up on her mid-story. And, as Will was getting his bearings and getting dressed to go back to his truck to sleep for the night, he wasn\u2019t fast enough for one of the nurses who told him \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u201cI know you aren\u2019t feeling well, but you have to go. We need the bed.\u201d Is Andalusia Health a Level 1 trauma center? The ER in a town of 8,787 (as of 2017) is that busy? The hospital has 88 rooms. Was 10% of the town so sick they needed to be in the hospital? I\u2019m asking. No, seriously, I am asking. Someone please tell me.\n\nAndalusia may or may not have Uber drivers, but my brother couldn\u2019t find one. Nor a cab company. He had to call central dispatch and have a police officer take him back to his truck, where he slept overnight, with Cellulitis raging in his body. Without any medical attention. Because Andalusia Health failed. Big time. I don\u2019t know who was on duty other than Sara Purvis, the certified nurse practitioner who saw him. But, I know that Kim Carol is the ER manager. I know that Amy Herrington is the director. I know that every time I have gone to their website, they boast the wait time being 30 minutes or less.

Days later it started to smell so I went to a real care facility that actually stitched my finger up. It healed but I no longer have feeling from the cut to my finger tip.\n\nI received a bill for $275 a month later. I called and explained that they did nothing for me. A review was supposedly opened to explore the case. I was never apprised of the findings until a creditor called me to collect the money. Here I sit deployed in the desert of Iraq while my wife and kids are home worried about a debt collection.\n\nI will be getting a lawyer to fight this!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8891ec06094fcf01:0x227d8f1880a09251"}

In which they wanted me to wait \"a few minutes\" to be discharged. Well an hour goes by and I decide to just leave. They wouldn't unlock the door for me and made me sit and wait. Then came in and listened to my stomach. I went in for a problem with my EAR then they made me squeeze their hands. Again this problem is for my ear. At that point I was extremely frustrated to which they told me \"hey people are dying in this hospital you have a small problem\" then they told me the reason for the wait was a shift change. Something that happens everyday at the same time backed the hospital up 6 hours? Also the bed they put me on had dirt and sand at the end which makes me think someone else was on this bed with their feet up and it was not changed. Floors were disgusting the male nurse who came in and took my vitals kept his gloves on after touching me and touching everything else and wrote vitals on his glove. Touching his pen also So whoever he touched last time and did that is now on the gloves used for me and touching me. The whole thing was a nightmare. A few days later and I'm still having the issue with my ear. Thanks for nothing! Can't wait to see the bill. They're not getting a dime from me", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a8a226bc79f05:0x5d3f82c16107e3b"}

He told me I had a severe kidney infection based on blood/urine. He had already ordered a shot for pain/nausea meds but no IV. Do after he came in he asked do you want another shot. I said please I'm really hurting. He ordered the shot along with writing me some rx's one for pain and the other for antibiotic. The ignorant nurse came in to discharge me and gabby given me the shot yet. So she went back out and 30mins later came back with shot. Then she said you have to stay for 10mins. I understood cauz I don't think they wanted me to react but it was the same shot as before. Then 30mins later my husband went and asked if I could go home. The nurse said I was just coming to get her. She let me lay there almost long enough for my pain shot to wear off. I saw Dr Reddy and he was excellent. My previous experiences with Dr Putnam were horrendous.

I decided to go to Urgent Care because I could not get an appointment to see a doctor. I thought that it would not take long. The first time I went there the wait was long and I had to leave because ADT was coming to my house to update my system. I returned later to Urgent Care to get some help with my back. My back was supposed to been x-rayed. Well, the X-ray technician had a very unpleasant expression on her face. She was not friendly. She just proceeded to slam the doors open. When we in the x-ray room, she started questioning me. Asking me, why did I leave and come back repeatedly and she said she did not know why she had to do an x-ray on me. I told her that it was none of her business why I had to leave and come back. I left the Urgent Care because the x-ray technician clearly did not either want to do her job or she did not want to x-ray a black person or she assumed that because I am black that I am there for pain meds. I have been to this Urgent Care several times for my sinus infections. This was the first time that I had been there for something else. I will never use this Urgent Care or the hospital again for anything. My appointment with Dr. Holcombe, who was treating me for IBS, will be canceled and I will find another gastroenterologist outside of Alexander City to treat me.

I have heard a wide variety of people make negative remarks about this hospital and how poor it\u2019s reputation is and has been over my lifetime, but I can now confirm that over the last 30 days my family and I were truly introduced to the most unprofessional and unorganized group of \u201cprofessionals\u201d we have ever encountered and we so badly wish that we had heeded all of the warnings. We called the ICU 3 times a day during my grandfathers 30 day (post Covid) stay and every time we talked to a different \u201cprofessional \u201c we received a new and very different response regarding factual information every time we called, for example: when we asked how long my grandfather was able to perform during his once a day lung conditioning. Some staff members would tell us \u201cabout the same as yesterday (2 hours)\u201d and then a few hours later when we asked about his overall well-being a different staff member would say \u201che\u2019s stable but he only made it 30 minutes during lung conditioning today\u201d. How can factual information vary so drastically regarding a once daily ( supposedly documented) test? We were also never informed in any way that my grandfathers Dr that initially evaluated him upon his arrival to the hospital and ultimately decided a day later to place him on the ventilator was out of the country for 3 of the 4 weeks that my grandfather was there (yes, under the care of a dr who was not presently in the same country which we would not have been comfortable with). No one ever let us know his dr was out until he was returning. With factual information constantly changing depending on who answered the call we felt so confused and discouraged because we never really trusted any information we were told. The hospital staff  failed to notify us until 24 hours after they accidentally punctured his lung and caused it to collapse. They still cannot get the story straight as to which lung they punctured. This hospital made a terrible time in our lives completely unbearable because we couldn\u2019t rely on any of the information we were receiving to have any accuracy which resulted in a lot of heartbreak. We tried on several occasions to solve this communication issue and managed to always remain patient with them but no matter what we said no one ever cared to clear things up or apologize for the lack of communication. In the end everyone we talked to finally got on the same page and gave constant reminders that we needed to make a decision to either trach my grandfather or cut the ventilator off. Somehow they all were all able to be on the same page for that. A constant reminder for us to have that decision made in time for his drs return. To say we are displeased with the staff would be an understatement. Our hearts are broken obviously, but I do not think anyone should go through the valley my family did without trying to fix the issue for others to come. Please don\u2019t fall victim to this place. This is the first review I\u2019ve ever taken the time to share and if it potentially saves one life then it was well worth the effort.

We have heard a lot of positive feedback from the community about how well-organized our vaccination clinics have been, and are very sorry you were not pleased with your experience.  Our team works hard to make every patient experience at our facility the best it can be.  In order to allow those in line for vaccination to wait inside the lobby area and not outside the building, it does unfortunately get a little crowded at times.  This is one reason we have never done a first dose and second dose clinic on the same day.  Because we give vaccines on a first come first served basis, we assign a number to each person to try to maintain an order based on arrival.  People are vaccinated according to their number in line which may have been confusing as some people could have passed you to get their vaccine while you were standing in line.  We are happy to help our community by offering COVID-19 vaccination administration and will continue to work hard to provide a positive experience for those getting a vaccine at our facility."}, "gmap_id": "0x8861ef02535237b9:0x86d3ad7ee9e52d71"}

If you have the sniffles, go to Highlands. If you got heart, go to Huntsville, Vanderbilt, stroke, Erlanger. Yesterday after 2 months of my family doctor saying UTI and giving me meds that even wasn't for that , I decided ok let's give it a shot. Huntsville has a long wait time.  I went in @ 11 :30 am. They were swapped. Ok. From admissions to Jarrod, Vonda, Dr.Jones were right there.  I didn't have a UTI. They literally didn't stop to find out real problem.  Cyst on ovaries, Bladder infection. Really? He done a CT scan, pelvic exam, urine of course.  The only wait time I had was waiting on discharge. 2 hours!! Oh well, in 2 hours they were trying to keep 2 ppl who come in code 4. Unfortunately 1 didn't make it. Not a car wreck either. I prayed for these families. Y'all gripe over wait times not knowing the other end.  The doctors, nurses, CNA's have priorities. Why go to a hospital and spend your money to walk out not knowing or getting your scripts to solve the problem?They were trying and I  saw with my own 2 eyes them doing CPR on a guy. You think bc you're sick with sinuses, back pain, tooth pain, sniffles, slight fever that they don't care?They do!  It's by priority though. I'm glad they saved one life. I'm sorry for who lost their family member. Remember you're not the only one in the world. They go home I'm sure questioning \"What could I have done different\"? I commend these ppl.  The law force, fire fighters, Military. Think if you're closest family member was to die... Would they help the person with a cough , fever? Or would they save your family member first? Once again Ty Highlands. My point of view changed bc you now have carrying ppl  God bless...", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8861ef02535237b9:0x86d3ad7ee9e52d71"}

She, too had to make another trip back to this hospital for the proper care. A different time they told the same family member that she had Hep C. She was put on medication for it. Years later, she went back to CVMC with stomach issues. They took her gallbladder out. Stomach pain and weight loss continued. She went to a different medical center to find out that she is actually Hep C negative and that her gallbladder wasn't to blame for stomach issues. It was stomach ulcers due to the Hep C medication. The same family member is now suffering from pancreatitis. They have sent her home 3 times now, each time a different Dr. has told her something different for her aftercare at home. One Dr gave threatening advice, telling her to eat, which sent her back to the hospital again, only this time to hear that she shouldn't have eaten anything.

Had I trusted them with their diagnosis for my son at 2 yrs old, not sure he'd be with us today and grown into the 19 year old brilliant very handsome young man who was a 2018 graduate from C'burg High School with Honors! He's now preparing for the next chapter in his life...Jacksonville State, here he comes! My son could have even had brain damage had we listened to the undereducated staff in that ER! After they argued for almost a hour with his dad and I, that we WEREN'T taking HIM anywhere after  we informed and Stated to them WE wanted to and WERE taking him to Children's Hospital in B'ham. They told us his CAT Scan showed bleeding on his brain! The very heart wrenching words that's ONE of a parent's biggest fears and nightmare! Long story short, our son's pediatrician, Dr Robert Grey whom we love so much to this very day, gave THEM ORDERS to LET US GO, via transport by Ambulance! Dr Grey we still thank God for bc had it NOT been for God and that precious man the outcome WOULD have been catastrophic bc after Children's performed another CAT and compared it to that mangie poor excuse for drs and surgical team that was bam up in our face trying to take our son to the operating room, Children's found absolutely nothing wrong with our son from either CATscan! The lady Dr who was treating him at Children's called his father and I into a private conference room. First words that came out of her mouth was \"Mr&Mrs..--- i want to first ASSURE you both there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH YOUR SON! HE'S VERY WELL & HEALTHY!! THOSE WORDS I'll NEVER forget and the BLESSED feeling of RELIEF in my heart and soul! I sat there crying as I thanked God and the Dr who knew exactly what she was talking about\nShe continued to explain WHAT had happened at Coosa Valley and it was just completely UNBELIEVABLE WHAT we heard!!! She said in pediatric CATscans they CANNOT be READ as an ADULT'S would be read and if our son HAD been an adult THEIR diagnosis may have POSSIBLY been correct however, HE WAS ONLY 2 years old and it showed that he was absolutely WELL and FINE!! I can't put into words what Coosa Valley put us ALL through that very scary day but i can assure everyone I'll NVR TRUST THEM! Id advise against trusting THEM with your pet!!! I'll continue to share our nightmare THERE which had a VERY happy ending once we were at Children's Hospital!!! My word of WARNING IS BEWARE allowing THEM to operate on your loved ones WITHOUT getting a SECOND OPINION!! God bless Dr Grey, the lady Dr in B'ham, our amazing son, AND God Bless You All!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bfd7c52887eb5:0x4db8fa5d2a350cf8"}

I was also severely dehydrated needed intravenous hydration administered. The doctor there literally said, \"your bowels are dead, they arent working at all\". So she referred me to Hospital ER for further testing and treatment that she said they just werent equipt to do. They printed my blood test results and  xray results and gave me a copy to take to Doctor at ER. She told me she wouldnt be surprised if the admitted me.  So, being tired and not wanting to wait long hours in an ER waiting room, I decided NOT to go to Huntsville or Madison Hospital (where I should have gone) and went to one closer to my home in Marshall County. I had been to Marshall Med Center North for broken ribs a few years prior and they seemed to be ok so I figured, \"how much different could they be, they are all educated medical professionals right? \" They had a way shorter waiting time and at first everything seemed to be going as it should. I gave the girl who did my intake my urgent care paperwork and she asked if she could hold on to it for awhile. I said no problem cause of course the Doctor needed to see it. They put me in an er room and the doctor came in and told me that even though they had the urgent care results they were gonna start over and then if they saw the same thing they would do CT and further testing. He said I was dehydrated and the hooked me up to a bag of water to hydrate me while I waited. The xray girls came to me and took three xrays of me in one position with an xray machine that looked like it was older than me (I am 48) . After my bag of water ran out the doctor came in and informed me that he saw nothing on the xray but they found a UTI with cystosis and he believed I had viral gastroenteritis. He said they werent going to admit me and made me call a ride even though they had not administered any meds to me. He wrote me a rx for an antibiotic that specifically warns not to take if you are anemic and an anti nausea med. There was no mention of why my red blood count was so terribly low, or why I hadnt  urinated but maybe twice in a month or had a solid bm in over a month. I just feel like there is more to it than a virus. Anyway I asked the doctor for an excuse for two days from work and he said he would write me one. When I got to the pharmacy (my 80 year old neighbor came and got me) i realized there was no dr excuse and they hadnt given me my urgent care results back. Called them when I got home, talked to Heath  and he assured me he would have my paperwork and excuse waiting for me at front desk in morn. Got up early, drove back to hospital (18 miles away) and no paperwork or excuse to be found. So the girl comes out hands me a freshly written excuse for only one day (I was on my second day of missing work at that moment) and tells me they misplaced my urgent care paperwork (overnight) and apologized. I told her I could probably get a reprint from urgent care, not to worry about it. Been a week today and I have been urinating more but my other conditions havent changed. I hope it wasnt a total waste of time to go to mmcn.  Cause this doesnt seem to be over quite yet.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889e4aa54cd0ad9:0x39a6cadb8301dd8e"}

We have had some good experiences with them in the past, but the last  2 times have been very disappointing.  The first disappointment was over a year ago with my son who definitely had a concussion after a wreck he had. The care was non-existent.  They did not care.  That's a shame.  Well I decided to give them another chance with my husband yesterday.  He has early onset Alzheimer's and had a fall on our driveway.  I told them at arrival that he has Alzheimer's and I have power of attorney which I brought with me.  They didn't want my power of attorney.  I try to be discreet about his diagnosis as he is aware.  He prefers to call it a head injury or concussion. He gets extremely upset and depressed when the A word is connected to him.  Triage was fine.  The wait was non-existent.  The nurse and Dr talked to him.  He was not explaining the events correctly to them so I chimed in as is normal for us.  They kept looking at me like I'm crazy so I whispered he has Alzheimer's to the nurse.  Do these medical professionals not understand what that means?  There are varying stages of Alzheimer's but my husband's is mid to late.  He can't write, he can't drive and has not driven for almost 2 years,   he can't retell any event accurately,  he can't fix a sandwich,  there are so many things he can't do that he once did.  To look at him,  people say he looks normal.  His obsession is working out so he's fit.  I guess they thought I was crazy or controlling,  I don't know what they thought.  But they were rude.  I'm with him 24/7 as his caretaker. This would be like ignoring the mother of a child.  In his mind,  he is a child.  Anyhow I had to tell them many times he has Alzheimer's.  They just continued talking to him,  he kept looking to me.  His hand was covered in blood,  his head was bloody where he hit the driveway.  They did do a CT  scan,  I guess???  They did an x ray of his ribs.  They did not clean up his wounds to check the damage.  The nurse did put a steri strip on the brow/ temple cut but did not clean it first.  He put an antiseptic but I do believe cleaning the wound should have been the first step.  This wound later popped open with the swelling.  ( WE did ice it, but it did swell)  I cleaned his hand up and it appears to have debris embedded; nothing big but I could have used some help considering his mental condition and he is bigger than me.  I was mainly concerned about the head injury.  He hit his head on the concrete.... hello?!  That is how the biggest onset of symptoms began 2 years ago when he fell from our roof.  The doctor did not discuss the CT scan and walked off when I told him I had a question.  Not professional at all and highly upsetting to me as his caregiver.  I am responsible for him.  I need to know.  The nurse discussed discharge instructions with him, not me.  Not cool at all.   He has Alzheimer's, he is not going to remember.   I was upset,  they did not care.  I told them they were rude.  I have been married to this man for almost 29 years and his Alzheimer's caregiver for 2 years.  I was told congratulations and sorry I had a bad experience.  I don't appreciate the snarkiness.  It is disrespectful and highly unprofessional.  Are you not in the business of caring for people?   I really wanted to make sure his brain was not damaged.  I still don't know.  Maybe to them it doesn't matter,  I don't know.  He seems to be acting \"normal\" for him but I will have to get Marshall North to send records to his neurologist to get pace of mind.  I'm not going to give the names of the doctor or nurse but I do hope they exhibit more care with people on a regular basis and for heaven's sake,  clean up the wounds so they can be evaluated properly.

I've ALL WAY'S USED RMC OR STRINGFELLOW OR CARROLLTON ER's because of where I lived! This is sad to say but out of my 39 yrs experience with the Dr's and Hospitals in the calhoun Al and Carroll Ga area have NEVER HAD A DR NURSE NO ONE EVER stop everything and take 15-20mins with the patient and family to go over each and EVERY TEST Explaining in so much detail but yet in a language we that do not have alot of Medical knowledge will understand. Review Marshall Medical Center North at 8000 Alabama 69, Guntersville, AL 35976 I was very impressed in how the dr went ahead and had EVERY TEST my son needed done rite there in the ER they even had to call in someone to do a test that is NORMALLY ONLY done Monday-Friday! I WANT TO THANK EACH AND EVERY PERSON DR NURSE ETC. I sure hope we don't have a reason to return to any ER again anytime soon but if we did there would be no doubt we will NEVER USE ANOTHER ER! The Nurses came in every 2-3 mins checking on him me every family member was allowed to stay with him and they made sure I was beside him at all times!!

A nurse Kevin and a security guard had threatened to drag me out and assaulted me, and they knew for a fact that my transportation wasn't there yet. This just happened 5 days post quadruple bypass heart surgery there, scars and bruises flapping in the cold, they denied my family even a dignified exit. My wife was scheduled to come that morning and they first locked her out in the cold, then showed what they're really about by their malicious crimes towards me. These people could have toe-tagged me and gone to lunch as far as they cared. Nurse Kevin screamed at me 10:41am jan 9 \"I'LL DRAG YOU OUT OF HERE MYSELF!!!\" Everyone heard him, immediately following my sceams and yelling \"THEY'RE HURTING ME!!! during the assault. Everyone heard that too. These two then hurried me by the wheelchair they dead-dropped me into, to a back exit where they forced me into the weather. I was able to hide in the entance facing Simon Williamson Clinic around 10:55am ish for warmth, but an exiting tiny white lady employee spoke to me there only saying \"they're closing this entrance\" to me, not one word about my health or safety, then soon a black security officer forced me into the cold from that entrance also.\nThis hospital employs and defends hateful criminals who likely have patients suffer serious complications during their shifts, and several should be in prison.\n\nI was the caller to 911 BPD, twice, for them attempting to hold me against my will, but I never saw BPD once, and nurse Kevin in the images had yelled down the hall to them \"I'M IN CHARGE HERE!\" from my critical care room doorway. They had distracted BPD into inaction, making them think the rest of their absurd actions would be unnoticed. I was filming for my life however, and clearly needed to.\n\nThat morning nurse Chrissy was quitely trying to add something in that IV port without waking me THREE TIMES but did each time. The only nurse who tried anything without waking me. Then she told my wife i was out of my mind midway to pick me up, and she should turn back. Then she tried menacing me into 15 more pills that morning, which would have made 45 pills total. She also called Sun Jan 10th and said \"Hi I'm Chrissy I discharged you yesterday.\" but she knew I refused signing anything at that point, and only wanted to check if I was dead. My people are convinced my 10 days of full-body sweats after home were from expelling poison from my body, and if this has happened before NURSE CHRISSY IS A SERIAL MURDERER AND SO IS HER APPARENT MATE AND CO-WORKER NURSE KEVIN.\n\nI gave this new heart back to God right after surgery, and clearly my first charge was bringing murderers out of His hospital behind me.\n\nI wouldn't dare speak lies through this renewed heart, it hasn't the time for it.\n\nI am also most grateful that our Father didnt inform me first that I would become His bait for these murderers, as I would have surely refused with only a 5 day old heart.\n\nAs for The Father and Christ, many prayers are needed for this place under His name as He simply doesn't recognize them when He returns, their souls don't have His marks on them, and their destruction is infinite and unfortunately for all, as we are all family, final.\n\nHere then now too is His Grace and only of a Living Breathing Eternal Christ in which all things and required of this existence: This post will be unavailable soon as I ask forgiveness of my many transgressions of Him and in only His Perfect Wisdom, do extend this Spirit Fruit out to all His children, no matter the darkness that may be upon them.

Also the lady who was my morning nurse who did my IV was very sweet and comforting and did a great job with the IV I don\u2019t remember her name but she definitely deserves 5 stars as well. The anesthesiologist was very professional and did everything to reassure me that I was going to be okay because I was very scared, she answered all my questions she deserves 5 stars as well. The anesthesiologist nurse assistant was so sweet she seemed very concerned about me and that meant a lot to me, she desveres 5 stars as well, the lady who wrapped my hair in a towel was very nice and supportive and gets 5 stars as well. Ken was my nurse after surgery while I was recovering he was also very very good my husband really liked him he always made sure I was comfortable 5 stars to him. However there was a few women outside room recovery area who was being very loud, complaining about who\u2019s going to be off work for the Fourth of July and all that. It\u2019s like they were forgetting that there was people trying to recover from getting surgery, I was in a lot of pain, the anesthesia made me extremely tired and I wanted to try and sleep some of it off, but no I couldn\u2019t because they kept yelling as they were talking and they were literally sitting next to each other so they really had no point in having to yell. There was no door on my recovery room just a curtain so It sounded like they were in the same exact room with me. For one please have respect for those who are waking up from surgery and probably in pain, for two if you don\u2019t like the fact that you have to work on weekends, or holidays etc then pick a different job.

I was admitted Saturday evening and kept until Monday for emergency surgery for the removal of my gallbladder. I was informed of a copay that I had for my surgery so I kept my wallet the whole stay at the hospital. The morning of my surgery my money was in my wallet and I had NO VISITORS because you are only allowed one visitor and it has to be the same one the whole day. No one had access to my room except my nurses and the cleaning crew. ONE OF YOUR INCOMPETENT THIEVING EMPLOYEES went through my items while I was unconscious and stole my copay money for my surgery. I am more alarmed than anything because apparently there are no cameras on the 4th floor where I was located.  I have never had an experience like this in my life. I came to this hospital to be treated for a health diagnosis and left in pain and emotionally distraught because my money was stolen. Your security, floor supervisors, administration and all have been no help. I have created a police report and all. I feel so taken advantage of and all you all are saying is that you will investigate. You all will not hesitate to send me a bill for my surgery but no one can properly look into why were my items gone through and why is there no proper way to monitor who has access to patients rooms. I am not satisfied and I will not let this go. These are very trying times where people are already limited in access in high stress situations with family so to know your employees are taking advantage of those they know do not have family to watch over them or their personal items is beyond ridiculous.

Today my wife had back surgery today. She has been worried about her I.V all day a new girl put it in the first time and missed (it happens) Then second time she still didn't get it right, 6 hours later after her surgery was over my wife (whom is very tough when it comes to pain) she doesn't complain ever, she is in tears because the I.V is burning her arm, leaving marks through her veins. We have asked multiple times to have a new I.V put in and all the stuff is been sitting on her bed here for about an hour waiting for someone \"qualified\" to come put it in and yet not one has come. She can not hit the pain button they gave her after the rods and screws and hardware they put in her back because the burning through her arm and I.V is worse than the 6 hour surgery she had on her back today. I used to be the biggest fan of this hospital because of the awesome attention and treatment you we able to receive but apparently that is not the case anymore. If some of the doctors that are here were not this would be the last visit we would ever have here. Im not trying to be ugly but some things are just unacceptable. In my industry if I treated someone like this it would tank my business. Im sad to see this. I especially understand the times we are in now but no one should ever have to ask multiple times to fix something so simple. I sit here and apologize to my wife for something I can't fix nor am i trained to. But there is nothing worse than feeling helpless to your wife.\n\nPart 2 of this review.\n\nThere are some really great people that work here one of which I was honored with the pleasure of meeting last night. His name is George. He is very attentive very kind and truly cares about the people he is endowed to take care of and the ones that fall through the cracks by the people that have fallen asleep on the job. His shift was done at 8 this morning and was still working till almost 10 to make sure that everyone knew what needed to be done and had all the information about the current patients that he was in care of. Today it seems as though there is a change in people in this unit Tara and Emily are who we have today and they are also a blessing. When I left to check in at work this morning and run home to shower I listened to other nurses talk about George and how hard of a worker he is and how much he cares. He is a game changer to this hospital and I hope that anyone who has to stay here gets the honor and pleasure to come in contact with him in the last 24 hours my mind has started to shift when I see some of the greatest heroes we have here in Birmingham they are kind, empathetic, and place other people in front of them selves im am glad I have had the pleasure to meet these heroes thank you Natalie for all your help.

She wanted me to go through everything again. When I refused to go through it all again because it traumatized me so much, she wouldn't give me any information about what was said or what happened with the so called investigation. She asked what I wanted from her, I stated I didn't ask her to call and to never contact me again. Why is the world would you make me go through that again?\n\nI had the same experience with the mental health department. They take everything away from you and stick you in a room with absolutely nothing. I couldn't even have my underwear or deodorant. None were ever offered. I'm gluten free and they continued to ignore that and send me food I couldn't eat. I didn't see anyone until the next day and that was the NP. She came in and said I know you don't have covid.. I stated they told me I did. I was tested two weeks prior and it was negative. I don't leave my house and everyone else I've been in any contact with had tested negative. I was very upset learning I all of sudden had it, and was visibly crying about it. The nurse Farah came in and I stated I wanted to go home and self isolate since this positive test has messed up the support system I had for my two children. She just kept repeating what's changed since I admitted myself. I repeated it over and over. She stood outside my door telling someone else I was suicidal. No, but keeping in a room with no other contact and feeling less than human would upset anyone. The Dr didn't come in the second day. I had to keep opening my door and requesting that he see me before he left the hall. He finally opened my door with his foot, refused to come, when I asked why he said he was afraid of covid. He went into every room except mine. He asked what I thought about the covid test, I stated I don't think I have it seeing as I have had zero symptoms. He said he would retest me and talk to the nurse about discharging me. About 1 1/2 hours later a nurse comes in to have me sign AMA paperwork. I said I thought he was going to discharge me, she said nope. I asked if I would get a script for whatever they gave me while there. Again she said no. I will never ever go back to that place. How you treat people who are already depressed is a big deal. If I would have stayed any longer I don't think I would've made out.

They strip you of everything and arevery skeptical of you making calls. I do not recommend anyone voluntarily go here. Most mental health can be managed and handled better as an inpatient local to you.\n\nIt took me several days to process what the isolation did to me. I\u2019m over it now but these places are not set up appropriately to handle people with mild mental illness. These are holding cells for the mentally insane or those they push to that direction.\n\nGregory Glasscock", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1596405954840, "text": "We\u2019re very sorry to hear about your experience, Greg.

He makes enough money the hospital bill will be paid. The test they promised has not been done. We still do not know what is wrong with my husband.

Oncology staff amazing. Chemo nurses go the extra mile for their patients. My brother stayed a month previously and they really were fantastic.   MICU treated him well.  One of his night shift nurses was amazing.  I wish I could remember her name.  He was transferred to MSU, after I warned the nurse verbally and it was already posted that he was a high fall risk, he was left unattended and he fell.  They called me and told me he scraped his knee.  They x-rayed his knee, I see him and his elbow is red, slightly swollen and the surrounding area was bruised.  No mention of his elbow.  Mikayla and Shay both night shift nurses were kind and helpful.   Transferred to Ortho-neuro for no apparent reason. I think just a bed.  Ortho- Neuro needs some kind of pep talk. Mackenzie, a nurse hung up on me when I asked to speak to a supervisor.  The supervisor on Ortho Casey basically was trying to dismiss her actions and behavior. I doubt she will be written up.  Oh and he has LOST WEIGHT,  so his oncologist stopped his chemotherapy. I see his skeletal outline.  Nutrition doctor talking about stopping his IV feeding like he is dying any moment.  I took him a two piece Popeye\u2019s chicken. He ate both pieces, he ate the biscuit and the red beans and rice.  So, naturally I think Ortho Neuro is not a place  where he can thrive. He is really declining.  Camila who was pulled to the unit for night shift  due to short staffing was wonderful. It\u2019s the only unit, I had problems checking his status. Problems with day shift staff.  It\u2019s the only time, I lost confidence in his care. If nurses didn\u2019t even want to verify in his chart I make decisions regarding his care because I have forgotten his code, who would they call if something happened?  Would they call anyone?

We have been very pleased with this facility. This past Wednesday our 5 year old son cut the end of his finger off so the first person I called was Dr. Bramlett looking for suggestions of a surgeon. He immediately took charge and said he would fix it, don't worry about it. Sure enough, his staff jumped into motion and had him scheduled for Friday morning surgery. We were not sure what to expect since he is a pediatric patient. From the moment we arrived we were absolutely blown away at the care he received on his level. The nurses, anesthesiologist, Dr. Bramlett, EVERYONE just absolutely got on his level and made him feel very comfortable.

Spend a few hours waiting to be seen in the ER after you wake up with numbness in your entire calf and foot, and get to be billed hundreds of dollars so a doctor can walk in, spend two seconds looking at you, and refer you to a neurologist that you will never be able to see because you're uninsured, hence the reason why you ended up in their horrible ER in the first place. No physical examination, no diagnostic tests of any sort. Then at a later date, be brought to the ER by ambulance because a sudden pain in your head in the middle of the night has escalated to the worst pain in your life, all you can do is scream and wish to become unconscious. Even though it was pretty clear that I was having my very first migraine at the age of 22, they gave me NO pain medicine or medication of any sort besides IV fluids, which did absolutely nothing. Don't get me wrong, I know about drug seekers and that they're a huge problem in emergency rooms, but I didn't want opiates. I've since found out that ibuprofen is effective for treating the migraines I've had since then, but for whatever reason they could not be bothered to give me any. I even asked a doctor straight up to \"Give me that medicine you give to people who are having a migraine,\" meaning triptans, a class of medication that helps a lot of migraine sufferers. I'm sure they thought I was asking for opiates, and felt validated in their decision to let me scream in pain all night and vomit all over myself. After about eight hours of vomiting and screaming, my pain finally began to subside on its own and it seemed like they were in a pretty huge rush for me to leave the ER. Maybe they had lots of other patients to not treat. But it's pretty surprising that their ER is so hesitant to treat patients who are suffering in pain, yet their ICU gives morphine to known substance abusers despite their family members explicitly asking them not to. With so many hospitals in the Birmingham area there is no reason to ever go to Brookwood. If one day I am literally dying and have five minutes to live, I will demand to be taken to any other hospital that is not Brookwood.

On September 4,2013 I had a robotic laparoscopic total hysterectomy. On September 12, I returned to the doctors office because I was having complications. I  was given a prescription and told that their was nothing to be concerned about. On September 15 I was taken to Northport DCH Emergency Room.I was told that I had a rectovaginal fistula and that I would need surgery (a colostomy bag,to be done the next day).I would have to wear it for six months. However,the ER doctor contacted the doctor who performed the hysterectomy and I was transported back to Brookwood Medical Center ,by ambulance. When I arrived the doctors confirmed that I needed the colostomy bag,but they still needed to do more contrast test. When I returned to my room I was told that their was nothing wrong with my colon and that I did not need a colostomy bag. The contrast test showed that both ureters had been cut and would need to be repaired. During the first attempt to stent my left ureter I was not properly sedated,so I  woke up during the procedure. I could feel the doctor making the incisions and injecting the needle into my back. My blood pressure was elevated to 246/199,therefore the surgery had to be stopped. The second attempt was done successfully by a different urologist. The right ureter was so severely damaged it had to be reimplanted a few weeks later. In November I was told that the left ureter had healed and the stent was removed. I thought this was the end of this nightmare;however I continued having urine leakage. On December 17, the left ureter had to be stented again. A few weeks after surgery I started having severe constipation. I complained to the doctor. He prescribed different medications that didn't work. At the time of surgery I had Blue Cross/Blue Shield insurance. The doctor said he would make sure my premium was paid because I wasn't able to return to work. That never happened so my family paid for me to see different GI specialists to try to find out why I was having such severe constipation. I had two colonoscopies done and other tests done and I was told that their was nothing wrong with my colon. I had no insurance so I was referred to UAB charity care program last year. Last year I was told by a GI specialist and surgeon that the colon transit study I had done in 2014 revealed that my colon is not functioning. Their is nothing that can be done to repair my colon. I'm going to need to have my entire colon removed(total colectomy) but their still is no guarantee that I want have to wear a colostomy bag for the rest of my life. So my question to the doctors at Brookwood is did you really do a contrast test or did you try to repair my colon and make it worse? I never had any health problems before the hysterectomy but now I'm left with a damaged colon, high blood pressure,severe arthritis,depression and anxiety. Let's not forget NO insurance,NO income. I would not recommend Brookwood Medical to ANYONE!!! They really should be shut down.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889199f54a0e70f:0x8026597d6a4588f8"}

Everything I've previously written still applies, except with one extremely large new issue.\n\nMy father recently had a very bad fall and was admitted to Brookwood's ICU. Brookwood's ICU is, without a doubt, the single worst ICU I've ever experienced. I was appalled! The nurses do nothing but sit around and talk! When my father started coughing uncontrollably and his oxygen level began to take a worrying dive, the nurse blew it off as a non-issue. Thankfully, my sister is a nurse and insisted that they talk to a doctor, and after his oxygen had apparently dropped enough, the nurse finally agreed. On top of all of this, the next night when the cough started back again (the same cough that coincided with his oxygen drop the previous night, mind you), they let him cough CONSTANTLY for a HALF HOUR before I finally had to go and get someone. I know they heard him, because his room was literally next to the nurses station. And what did I find the nurses doing? Talking. A man who had breathing issues and head trauma was allowed to cough practically non-stop for over half an hour.  This is just simply unacceptable! I have NEVER witnessed an ICU that bad before. I shudder to think about if he had a life threatening issue. Would he receive the proper care? I should not be afraid to leave my father overnight anywhere in a hospital, but especially not in intensive care.\n\nI want to be very clear about something here: My father may come here because all of his doctors are here, but I will not. If I ever needed emergency care, I have been very open about taking me ANYWHERE but Brookwood. My insurance is such that I gladly will pay more per month to ensure that I am able to go to any other hospital, but this one. It is a disgrace and by far the worst of the Big Three.\n\n--End of Update--\n\nMiserable hospital! One of the worst I've ever been to and I was born here! My dad was suffering chest pains one morning and so we called the paramedics and they recommended he go to the hospital, so he chose Brookwood. The emergency room people were attentive and helpful. They ran several tests on his heart and all pointed to it NOT being a heart attack (which was great news). They admitted for observation (understandable) and did some tests on his gallbladder, which also came back negative. By this time, my dad is feeling perfectly fine. Once he vomited, he felt better and all the tests showed no problems, but they STILL kept him! For two extra days! At this point, I feel like they were taking advantage of him. All tests were fine and any other concerns they had could have been handled out patient. I understand and appreciate caution, but this whole thing has been overkill to the max.\n\nOn top of all of this, the hospital is a completely confusing mess of a maze. It's very difficult to figure out where you're going. It's also outdated and not very clean. The nurses were okay, but not the most attentive. I had to go to the desk and get them after waiting 20 minutes when calling them. I often saw them congregating around the nurses station talking, so there's no excuse for that.\n\nI will say that all of the doctor's were professional, nice and knowledgeable. The only pleasant surprise in this miserable place.\n\nIf you have a choice, go to Grandview,  UAB or St. Vincent's. This place is just a mess.\n\n(No, I am not interested in sending you my information or contacting you to talk more about my issues. There's nothing more to say and I highly doubt that you are actually interested in correcting the issues)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889199f54a0e70f:0x8026597d6a4588f8"}

In late August, my mother, a 94 year old copd patient, aspirated on some thick liquid and so I had her taken via ambulance to Brookwood Hospital, as we had had a decent experience there earlier. When she left for the hospital, her oxygen was reading 93% on about a liter of o2. I had to drive behind the ambulance to the hospital, so I arrived a few minutes behind her at the ER. When I got there, she was on a gurney waiting for a room with a cannula in her nose...with NO OXYGEN attached to it. I was terrified; I asked the emts where her oxygen was and they told me she wasn't on any. I told them I could see that; why was she not on any? They said this was because the doctor wanted to see what her baseline was on room air. She was gasping 'help me', and getting weaker. I told them her baseline on room air would be crossed abgs, low oxygen, elevated co2.hypercapnea and acidic pH, and possibly DEATH, and to get her on oxygen STAT. They did not do this; and when they finally got her into a room and on oxygen and a monitor, her oxygen was reading in the 50s. Once admitted, she got decent care and rallied; but the insult of that severe distress, which could have easily been avoided - when the emts picked her up at her home, they asked me what her normal oxygen flow was!!! and I had told them, so I expected them to maintain it until she got settled in the ER, as crossed gasses were not an issue when they came and got her. When her blood gasses were drawn in the ER, her co2 was reading around 90 and her pH around 7.20, which can be fatal, especially in someone of her age. She recovered enough to stabilize and get discharged home after nearly a week in the hospital, but she never recovered from the overall insult of that crisis to her body systems, and died at home 6 days after her discharge. That hospital had treated her before, and those emts had transported her to that and another hospital numerous times; there was no excuse for that dangerous level of incompetence. She was also badly bruised on her legs when she got home, and the nurses neglected her dangerously for most of the day of her discharge. Don't take anyone you care about to that ER. They have some good doctors and nurses there, or at least they used to, but that quality is not consistent to the point that it is like Russian Roulette.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889199f54a0e70f:0x8026597d6a4588f8"}

In a matter of hours, she developed sepsis & they told us she wasn't going to make it. Obviously we were upset, crying, asking if they were going to even TRY! The head nurch in ICU said they've done everything they can & kicked us out of the room. Wouldn't even let us say goodbye. She passed about 15 mins after she kicked us out.
