I asked them to clean inside the ac vents where the mold was but they didn\u2019t get cleaned  the guys said they another job to go do. I was told the air scrubber we bought was to eliminate the mold that was still in the vents and prevent new mold from growing completely. I stayed away 24 hours cause I\u2019m  sensitive to chemicals and especially mold I\u2019ve dealt with mold before and became very ill and stayed in hospital. The night I did return home I woke up at 2 am with tightness in my chest and throat irritation and was very uncomfortable had fire dept to check me out was upset about it. I googled more about the air scrubber and found some people don\u2019t do well with it and I feel I\u2019m one of them and the side effects were what I was experiencing. It\u2019s been two days and I will not stay at home. I called one of the owners David and asked them to please remove the air scrubber system it was the weekend so they were gonna charge me service call which wasn\u2019t a big deal but I wasn\u2019t even told when they did mold treatment what kind of treatment or was there mold in the ducts I feel like I\u2019m scared to be in my own home. I don\u2019t want to upset anyone But I would have liked to known. I talked to one of the owners David he was trying to make me feel better about the situation but I\u2019m thinking the air scrubber is not for us.  which was very nice but I feel like im not going to do well with a system that isn\u2019t helping me and I want to be comfortable in my home. I hope this company will make this right for us. They are very professional and have helped us in the past. I didn\u2019t know how I would react to the air scrubber and I\u2019m not doing well I would like to fix it please thanks so much.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1607128462686, "text": "This is fantastic thank you so much for choosing Climatemp Cooling & Heating inc. as your Heating and air conditioning provider."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a1b95dfc08dd9:0x46ab285987648b9a"}

These came with a 10 year parts/labor warranty.  In 13 months, Unit A stopped cooling 3 times over several months and Climatemp was unable to effect permanent repairs.  The last time Climatemp repaired unit A, it stopped working within 18 hours.  This was after several days of disruption, no AC, and probably 10 hours of attempts to fix it.  Unit B stopped cooling at the 7-month mark and the air handler had to be replaced.  They broke the condensate pump which leaked water everywhere and didn't seal the discharge side into the main duct during the install.  In addition, I have seen several misdiagnosed issues,  unterminated wires, holes in return box, and uninsulated freon lines to name just a few issues.  My favorite was the condensate pump installed so that it blocked the door from closing to the air handler room.  The customer service is awful.  Nobody will call you back.  You have to follow up on everything yourself.  I had a no show on more than one occasion and when I called to ask where the tech was, \u201coh he\u2019s not going to be able to make it.\u201d  After unit A stopped cooling, yet again, and nearly immediately after the last attempt to fix it, I attempted to reach a final resolution with the GM David, but he never called me back.  He told me he would speak to the owner and let me know what they decided, but no call.  It would be laughable if I hadn\u2019t spent 14k on two units and was one year into a 10 year parts/labor warranty.  In the end, I never heard from him again, all while unit A was not cooling.  Ultimately, I had to get Carrier involved who thankfully switched my parts and labor warranty to another local factory authorized dealer, who has been amazing.  The new dealer fixed unit A on the first attempt, in about two hours, which was over pressurized with freon, and had been incorrectly diagnosed by Climatemp.  They provided updates through the whole process.  Then, they reconfigured unit A and B, which were never set up properly and were running inefficiently on factory default settings.  I would give anything to be able to go back and avoid ever using Climatemp, but they had such good reviews.  I discovered that A LOT of them are from their own employees.  Even the techs told me, they\u2019re told to leave five-star reviews on google and have their friends and family do the same.  Look through the reviews and you will see the same names that you hear when you call dispatch or receive an email.  The owners, and the GM leave them, as well as their family.  You will see the same names leaving reviews across every location.  Normal customers don\u2019t do that.  When bad reviews are left, you will see threats of litigation and claims of fake reviews.  Folks this company is shameful.  Please save yourself and use any number of available HVAC companies in Baldwin county.  If you have a part/labor warranty with them and you feel trapped, call Carrier.  They can and will help you.\n\n** In response to the owner's claim - the last time your technician was in my home, he was there for nearly six hours.  I loaned him my extension cords and fed him dinner.

My unit, which I\u2019ll admit is old, but it still works\u2026 Was not cooling as well as usual. This has happened previously and it needed Freon. So I called  Climatemp to come out\u2026 I knew they like to try to upsell your unit but I had them come out anyway. I had called and they told me there was an $89 service/diagnostic fee. So long story short\u2026 The guy came out opened the unit and within 10 minutes told my husband we needed a brand new unit that it would cost @ $3000 just to fix the leak. I told him no thank you we would get another opinion that I was not spending $10,000 today on a new unit. He then asked me \u201c What\u2019s the right price to get you to say yes to a new unit today?\u201d Climatemp keeps your credit card on file and within 45 minutes charged my account $189\u2026 For nothing! Within that same amount of time I had had another local company come out they had already fixed my unit, my house was cool and only charged me $150. Climatetemp does not tell you that they charge you $25 per 15 minutes they are there\u2026 If you do the math that is $1.66 PER MINUTE!! We would definitely not have let the technician take his 10 minute cigarette  break in our front yard if we had known we were paying that per minute!! They were there for 15 minutes, just wanted to sell us a new $8000 unit and told us ours could not be fixed for less than $3000, did not give us accurate information on charges, never left us an invoice and still won\u2019t give us one, just charged my card. Terrible way to do business!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1576124876471, "text": "Jessica, we are sorry you feel that way after further investigation yes your unit was very old and had multiple R22 Freon leaks in it. The laws require us to fix and repair the leak before we put r-22 Freon back in this is a costly repair especially in your case where a whole coil was going to have to be replaced to fix your unit. So yes a coil plus recharging your unit with r-22 is a very costly repair. You say you paid 150.00 and you were cool again by another company but did they actually do you justice by putting some Freon in knowing its going to leak back out and you will be calling them right back out. We also noticed you said you already had them out once before. So as you can see your having to call someone out every few months to charge your unit mean while when it is running low on Freon it is working double time and costing you double time just to operate the system. It sounds like as much as you are having to pay for a very inefficient  system in your home with multiple service calls a year you could have purchased a new efficient system with just the savings you would have on your utilities each month not to mention all the 150.00 dollar service call. So did Climatemp really do a dis justice or where you just putting a band aid on something that really needed stitches to buy you more time. Climatemp charges by the quarter hr. Which can save you tons of money many other companies charge a 1hr minimum and flat rate prices that would have cost you much more. We are truly sorry for any inconvenience to you or your family but in the same note here at Climatemp we believe in fixing things right and not putting a band on something that will end up costing you much more in the long run.

He came over the next day and had our a/c unit repaired in an hour!  He explained what was wrong (our capacitor needed to be replaced and the coolant was low, so he also performed a leak check and added coolant).  Our unit failed again and he came over and got it running again, and didn't charge us as he had just been over, which was incredibly nice.  He said the pump might be failing, triggering the unit to shut off, but didn't want to replace it immediately if we didn't know for sure.  We really appreciated that he didn't replace a part unless it was definitely needed.  When our 2nd a/c unit failed a week later, he was just as responsive and helpful.

I have used both the A/C and Electric services from blevins. I want to say the Electrical side is top notch. I would give them a 5star rating.\n\nNow on the to A/C service. I ordered a whole house dehumidifier for my 2100SQft. home. I was told by aprilaire and another AC company that the aprilaire 1830 was the size I needed for my home. So I purchased the unit. Anthony  came out to install the unit.\nAfter the install the unit wasn't working as it should. The humidity wasn't coming down in the house. So I tried to work with Anthony to resolve the problem. He did call support for aprilaire. And after going talking with them they decided that the unit was undersized. The unit is a 70pint and should cover a 2800sqft. house. I wanted my humidity around 45 to 48 %.\nthis unit was only getting it  to 57%. that is what I started with , so it wasn't working at all.\n\nAfter talking with support myself. I was told that the unit needed to be installed per the recommended installation. Which is from return to return. It needs to work with the AC unit to achieve peak performance.\n\nAnthony installed it from return to supply. which I was told by aprilaire that causes a resistance from the supply air and the air coming from the dehumidifier. He did not install a drip pan under the dehumidifier.( he took the charge off for the drip pan) He used 12\" duct which isn't recommended. And added reducer down to the 10\" inlet\n\nSo I asked Anthony to install it per manufacture .  He straight out refused. I have a copy of the text and a lot of pictures to post. Also have an email from tech support stating the correct way to install is per the manual install glide.\n\nI added the correct duct work and put a drain pan under the dehumidifier and rerouted the drain line.\nThe Dehumidifier is work as should now humidity is around 47%.\nThe only thing I asked Anthony to do is install it the preferred method ( which is what he should have done in the beginning and we would not of had any problems)  and he refused. I plan on sending a complaint to the Association.\n\nI will not use the A/C service again. And wish I could use the electric service because they are awesome. They fixed several issues I had. Plus was able to fix a problem that 2 other companies was not able to fix.

He jumped up and turned the breaker off, obviously a few minutes too late! So, he tells us he has to get the part but tells the warranty company that the unit needs to be repaired or replaced and that the coils are stopped up with dirt! And that incorrect parts are in the unit and that's the cause of the problem. So of course the warranty doesn't cover coil cleaning and won't cover any repair of the alleged incorrect parts. Warranty company calls him back asking about the smoke issue while he was here and he tells them it wasn't the part he put in. Then he tells them the unit is too big and the ducts are too small,etc. We paid him $100 to fill our home with smoke and ruin a part on our unit and the only problem was the fan blower continuously.

When one of my two HVACs went out in my new home, I called the company that installed it and they said the earliest they could come was three days.  When I called ACS, they were there the next morning.  I have been calling on ACS ever since.  During a heat wave, after Robert explained he would have to charge overtime, ACS fixed my HVAC on a Sunday morning.  Whenever ACS was at my house to fix my HVAC, after analyzing the problem, they were clear on what needed to be done,  how long it would take to fix it, how much it would cost, and why.  If necessary, they also provided a variety of payment options so I could choose what best met my situation.  So when one of my two HVACs needed to be replaced, ACS was one of two companies I called for an estimate.  While the other estimate was flowered with discounts for various reasons, the ACS estimate was clear, concise, and competetive.  Robert Akins spent a lot of time explaining options and whether they were worth the expense.  The unit ACS proposed has a lifetime condenser replacement warranty if the compressor ever fails.  An option ACS had that the other did not was a ten year warranty on the labor for warrantied repairs.  Finally, when the competitor said it would take at least a week for the replacement HVAC to come in, ACS had my new unit installed the next day on December 22, the week of Christmas!  So whether you are looking to replace your current HVAC unit or just repair the one you have, I highly recommend Robert Akins and ACS.  They have always been there when I needed them and taken care of the problem efficiently and professionally.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862657b007200dd:0x7c27a392b36f81dc"}

Unfortunately, occasionally, due to whatever reasons whether by our fault or other circumstances, a customer is dissatisfied.  In this case we did not learn of Mr. Hastie's dissatisfaction until he posted a negative review.  There was no phone call, no inquiry, no attempt to communicate or seek a resolution to his complaint, just a negative review.\nAfter speaking to the technician and reviewing the statements associated with this service I found the following facts to be true:\n\nMr Hastie called to report his house was hot and his air conditioning was not working late in the afternoon.  I diverted a technician to his house after 4:30 pm to help him so that hopefully he would not have to go through another hot night in his house.  (We go on overtime at 5:00 pm).  The technician found the primary problem and responded by installing a part from his truck which was close to what was required but not the correct spec.  The temporary fix allowed the unit to run and cool the house overnight providing immediate relief for Mr. Hastie.  The technician did not charge for the overtime.\n\nThe part required was an odd spec which the technicians and many of our professional vendors do not carry locally (often an order Item).  The next day our technician searched among our vendors until he found a part locally.  He returned to the Hastie residence and exchanged the temporary part for the correct one.  Our technician also inspected the refrigerant charge and found a need to add some refrigerant to achieve the correct cooling specs per his instruments upon this return visit.\n\nMoreover, our technician did not charge Mr. Hastie for the procurement or travel time required to serve his needs.  For the more than 3 hours time involved working exclusively on Mr. Hastie's behalf our technician charge him only for a service call and 1 hour labor.  As far as the cost of the part:  yes we, like most service operations who provide a responsive service, charge a markup on parts.  We do not attempt to compete with internet pricing.  Our pricing structure reflects the convenience of having the part, our vendors supporting us to have a part available, and the network which guarantees and supports the quick response business.\n\nOtherwise, a client is free to diagnose his own problem, order his parts online and wait in the heat until the part arrives (hoping he did not make a mistake or that a wrong part was shipped.)\n\nIn conclusion:  Our technician followed pricing guidelines which have been satisfactory for our extensive client base for more than 40 years.  He waived labor costs in the hopes of establishing Mr. Hastie as a long term satisfied customer.  Mr. Hastie indicated to the technician that he was satisfied and grateful for the prompt service and relief from the heat.\n\nHad Mr. Hastie called to inquire about the charges, we could have explained to him and even offered him a coupon if he was still not happy.  Personally, I see this negative review as simply malicious with the intent of harming our otherwise excellent review status and without any interest in understanding or seeking a resolution with ACS, Inc."}, "gmap_id": "0x8862657b007200dd:0x7c27a392b36f81dc"}

AVOID.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1543417470154, "text": "I remember this caller.  Nathan called and began asking me vague questions about what was wrong with his heating system.  I told him that it sounded like we needed to send a tech out for diagnostics.  He asked me what the charge would be and I told him the minimum cost of a service call and labor for a call out.  He then asked me an unusual question for our industry.  He asked me why we charged for diagnostics.  From having dealt with the public for 40 years I understood that he was not familiar with how service companies operate.  I proceeded to explain to him why a company had to charge to send a tech to a remote location, time, equipment cost, travel, insurance, education and training, overhead and all of the costs associated with a working company.  I explained that the tech, for instance, had to be paid from the moment he clocked in which included the driving time to a residence and back, hence the service call.  Nathan took offense at the explanation and told me that he did not need a \"lecture\".  I asked him then why he asked such a question if he did not expect or want a comprehensive answer, to which he abruptly hung up the phone. There was no profanity.  Moments later this negative review arrived in my email.\n\nPart of the service we provide is educational.  We are a very empirical and logic based company.  We deal with applied science.  When a question is asked we do our best to answer it thoroughly.  I often help clients solve heating and air conditioning issues over the phone at no charge when able.  I have recently successfully instructed non technical house wives in restoring their heat over the phone. My communication skills are very good.  In this circumstance it was very important that the potential client understood the charges and per his questions why there were charges.  If the customer does not understand that he will be charged for a visit and that he has an obligation to pay, or if he protests the value of the service prior to a visit by a tech, then we cannot send a tech to his residence.\n\nUnfortunately, part of the job of dealing with the general public is to screen the potential client to make sure that the interaction with the company and the technician is successful and satisfactory for both parties.  We will not send a technician into a contentious situation.  We would have liked to have helped Nathan but the initial phone interaction and the \"hang up\" indicated that the interaction would not be successful."}, "gmap_id": "0x8862657b007200dd:0x7c27a392b36f81dc"}

My wife met with Cason and we went into wanting multiple options which i thought were all fairly presented and well explained without any pressure of which to go with. I have a close friend who worked for many years for both Trane and Carrier with many of the dealers throughout Birmingham. He gave me a list of 3 companies he would have out to his home personally. Skelton was one of those, another company that i liked very much, and then one we didnt have a great experience on the quote with. Between Skelton and the other competitor, although Skeltons price was higher we were sold by the labor warranty and some of the other written guarantees, along with the rec from our friend. Installation - I believe it was Mark, my wife was the one on site - went way better than i could have imagined. We arranged last minute to have the unit moved to a new location. All of the work was very well done. I had an idea in my head of what \"the aftermath\" should have looked like and the equipment involved in the move and all that, and i probably would have been satisfied with a lot less. Its obviously a lot of money for most families, so I was bound to have some mix of buyers remorse and hesitation about whether or not we'd gone with the right people However, when i got home and saw the quality of the work, how neatly and efficiently and professionally everything was done, i immediately felt entirely confident in our decision and knew we had some true professionals out at the house.

Long post but I need to share my experience about this absolutely dishonest company. They were assigned by AHS home insurance, because my AC broke and in this AL heat my house got up to 92 degrees. Thursday morning I got in touch with them and they said they were available to come out the morning of the next day. I then got a message confirming they\u2019d come out Friday between noon and 2pm. Friday (today) came and I was at my house during those times and I hadn\u2019t heard anything from this company so I called at 2 asking for an update. The contractor told me he would call the assigned technician and \u201ccall me back\u201d. Over 30 min later and still nothing, I call the contractor back and again and they put me straight to voicemail and I get a text from the number saying \u201ccan I call you later\u201d to which I replied I needed an update on the technician\u2019s estimated arrival. More time passes and all my calls keep going straight to voicemail. It is 4pm, two hours after they were scheduled to come and I\u2019ve still been waiting at my house in this heat so I text that it has been over an hour since I last heard from anyone and explain this is getting to be an emergency situation with my house rising in temperature and I need to know if someone is coming out to my house. Of course I also get in touch with AHS explain what\u2019s been going on and they tell me if no one shows up at 5pm to call AHS back. Well, I call AHS back and this time the rep gets in touch with the contractor and they tell the rep that the technician is \u201con his way\u201d from Bham to my area. It is close to 7pm and still no sign of anyone nor had I heard from the company. I call the contractor and ask for an update on the technician since they said they were on the way over an hour ago. The contractor says \u201cDidn\u2019t you just get off the phone with *name*? He told me that you told him to reschedule for tomorrow morning.\u201d Absolutely shocking and completely dishonest if that is what the technician said because nobody has been contacting me throughout this situation, I\u2019ve been the one to be reaching out and they told AHS that they were \u201con the way\u201d. Absolutely I get in contact with AHS and tell them the update on this situation and at this point I don\u2019t want a technician who lied and was dishonest about me to come out to MY home. While on the phone with AHS the contractor calls me and asks to \u201cplease reschedule for tomorrow morning...it was our mistake/*insert excuse*\u201d. Absolutely not. How do I know what I went through today isn\u2019t going to happen the exact same way? I spent half my day in the heat waiting on someone who said \u201cthey were on their way\u201d multiple times and putting my trust and time just to find out that the technician who was to come out to my house falsified and lied about getting in touch with me and rescheduling without my knowledge.

Well, the A C didn't come on so I called American Home Warranty which provided me with my info and called Same Day maintenance (cause I've used them before to install a thermostat in my home), the technician came out flipped the switch on and never went outback to check my unit...naturally I was happy because now I'm knowing I have air. Kept my doors and windows opened and up until around7:30 because it was really hot inside and I didn't want the unit to work as hard cooling the house inside. 3:00 before day Saturday morning; I was drenched in sweat.not understanding what's happened, got up, checked the A C inside..on. Went out back, checked the unit..no fan turning, unit very hot..turned off A C inside, called SameDay around 8:00 that morning, left emergency message..no return called. Called again all day every30 minutes- an hour...no phone call. Same repeat for Sunday. Monday morning I was on the phone calling them from7:30 until the answering machine picked up and I asked them to please call me back..didn't call me, I called back again finally getting someone who told me they would check with the tec. to see when he can come b out( mind you, this is a re-call) so I should have been a priority along with other people who had an emergency over the week-end not wait until Wednesday to try and work me in. I was told Wednesday morning that the Tec. would be out between 1and 5pm. Okay... I'm trying to hold my self in check because now I'm feeling disrespected and ignored. 4:35 no Tech..I called their office back after the 2nd phone call I was told this guy name Andy would give me a call...what???\nIt's already4:55 I said\" call me\" he should be here by now i2don't need him to call me.. She said\" that's what he told me to tell you\" . long story....so he called5:10 said he would look at his schedule and see if he could get to me tomorrow( Thursday)....I'm sooo pissed now, hot and disgusted...called American Residential warranty back, explained this same thing to them and told them I will not use Same Day Maintenance anymore and to place that notation on the computer by my name...so now I'm searching the internet trying to find someone else who will come out asap to get me up and running......I recommend no body uses this service...at all.

They said the compressor was bad, and the unit would \"never run again\" and we needed a new, $12,000.00 heat pump system...\nThat's where Dylan, and Southern Comfort Heating & A.C. comes in. They were referred to us by 2 of our neighbors who said they were honest, on time, and got the job done. So we called today, Dylan, the owner, answered the phone himself which was good sign #1. Good sign #2 was that he showed up 1.5 hrs later, right on time. Early, actually, as he gave us a 2 hr. window. Then, after only about 15 minutes working on the unit, much to our surprise air came back on!\nAs it turns out, all our unit needed was a capacitor! All of the other companies (big companies at that) tried to high pressure us into a new system we could NOT afford. Dylan came out and got that baby running in no time flat! He charged a perfectly reasonable amount to come out and fix our stuff on a Saturday afternoon, & didnt try any high pressure sales b.s.\nWe were so impressed we also signed up for a maintainence agreement so we know we'll always be taken care of! And when we are ready to replace, Southern Comfort will be our guys! If you're looking for an HONEST, reliable company to come out and take care of your A.C., look no further.

He tells me that it isn't that hot outside that it could wait till Monday. This man knows that I have seven month old child as well as a four year old and he has the balls to tell me that it can wait because it isn't hot?

We did this twice and then gave up on them, and changed out filters out ourselves.\nAfter a few years we started to have issues with the unit not cooling, and blowing fuses and lost power to our thermostat.  Tech came out and checked voltage, and changed a fuse. They charged us 1.5 hours of labor, for a 20 min fix.\nThe issues above persisted and we called to have them come out for repairs again. The techs arrived and  tested voltage and various things but could not find the issue. It was my husband who discovered a wire that was cut and causing a short. The techs fixed that, and also cleaned the coils thoroughly on the unit.\nWe are still having some issues with our unit not cooling properly which were brought up in the first visit, but since the issue hadn\u2019t happened that much over the course of the past 5 years the tech didn\u2019t think it required any further investigating.\nThey will charge you for the techs coming from Opelika, however my husband talked to the tech and they were already in Columbus, had just finished a service call and were heading to our house. When my husband brought this up for Mr. Farnell, he stated that they had to include for fair wear and tear on their vehicles.\nTried to bill extra hours for labor, good thing I noted the time when they arrived and when they left, plus we had a rain storm that stopped all work for the duration of the storm.\nCharged us for fuses, that we provided since the tech didn\u2019t have any.\nMy husband called the office to challenge the charges on the bill and did negotiate them with Mr. Farnell, who agreed that something were charged/done in error.\nAs small business owners, we try to utilize other small business owners when possible.

They have replaced 2 complete heating & a/c systems for me, as well as 2 major heating system repairs, that several other heating & a/c companies had failed to figure out, after several expensive calls, over a period of 5 or 6 years. They have also done weekend emergency a/c repairs for me that took until 3 am, on a very hot summer night. Most recently (yesterday, 5/28/14, actually) they replaced an old water heater, in a very difficult attic location, in spite of a 3 hr. delay, while the Auburn City Water Dep't cut a very large root away from the shut-off valve at the meter, so that the water could be shut off; and the old water heater could be removed, and the new one installed. They waited, patiently, through the whole delay.\n\nThrough all of my experience with Farnell, I have dealt with at least 10 of their service men. From my point of view, as a repeat customer, it would be virtually impossible to find, and hire, better men, than those I have encountered, whenever Farnell was doing work for me. They are, without exception, always on time, very hard working, well-mannered, friendly, and very good at what they do. I have never had a single bad experience with Farnell or their people!!! They're just good people, and I actually trust them. They have never given me any reason not to.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ced510f4e5937:0x5a5209b4bcf2a4ea"}

I have now \"enjoyed\" EIGHT visits to my home by Farnell employees written them almost $1500 in checks, had multiple parts replaced (some I am now certain were not faulty to begin with), vacuumed gallons and gallons of water out of my attic, paid Alabama power $500 two months in a row (turns out the compressor was dying and it took Farnell five or six visits to figure that out), and yet I am sweltering through my second consecutive weekend without AirConditioning. Today was the first time we've heard from a manager, who only informed us that \"there are no managers in town to help you this weekend\" and \"we can send someone out, but I don't know if you'll have to pay for a service call or not, it depends on if it's because of something we did.\" OF COURSE it's because of something you did. Your employees spend more time in my house than I do. Don't waste your time with this bunch.\nUPDATE 1/22/2013: Today I was contacted by the owner of this business asking me to remove this review. In Farnell's defense after I first posted this review some attempts were made to rectify the problems we were having. Today when the owner contacted me I attempted to remind him that there was still work they'd promised to do that had never been completed (repainting of a ceiling they damaged in August). Instead of offering to make the repair the owner became extremely rude. Cut me off mid sentence, wouldn't let me finish talking, and talked over me; insisting that he didn't know anything about this issue and that I needed to remove my review. It rapidly reached a point that I hung up the phone. There are some extremely poor customer service issues at play here, and I'd steer clear of doing any business with this company in the future.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ced510f4e5937:0x5a5209b4bcf2a4ea"}

In a few minutes I saw him walk to his truck. I thought he was writing a bill so I asked how much. He came to the door and showed me that my breaker was burned up and how much hot it was. It would burn your hand if you held it. I was surprised he had a breaker for my unit and was able to install it so quickly. The charge for the service call, travel, weekend inconvenience, repair and parts was less than I paid for a service call in my last state. Donnie was so knowledgeable, professional and fast that I couldn\u2019t begin to give him enough stars. I said the first time I used Hansen that I would never use anyone else. This was definitely a great find. Hsnsen\u2019s Is by far the best company I have dealt with. I have already began advertising to my community how great they are. I am definitely a customer for life. Thank you so much Donnie.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a1b3271b78efd:0xd879aed7aea87b55"}

We had him come out a few months ago to repair our HVAC system. He did a wonderful job fixing it after the company who installed it really messed it up. I thought we were having problems with the same system again because water randomly began leaking through our ceiling which is what had happened in the past, so my first thought was, \u201cUh-oh, the air conditioner is malfunctioning again.\u201d So I called Shane to check it out and it turned out to be our hot water heater. First of all, he answered my call on a weekend when he was doing other things on his own time and made our problem a priority to fix, which I truly appreciate. And instead of referring me out to someone else to deal with it since it wasn\u2019t an HVAC issue, he came out and replaced it himself and made modifications to ensure it could never leak through the ceiling again. Also, he discovered in the process that a faulty valve had malfunctioned on the outside of our house and was causing extraordinary water pressure on the inside, which had cost us thousands of dollars in repairs and appliance replacement, (including the water heater!), over the years! No one had ever been so thorough as to investigate something as simple but as impactful as the water pressure in our home, (and we had other big companies come out over the years). But Shane did and he even fixed that issue- spending literally hours digging out and replacing the broken valve in our front yard. We are so thankful that Shane was there to help us out. They really are jacks of all trades at Gipson Heating and Air Conditioning and are truly knowledgeable about many things across the board in terms of repairs. I have since referred others to Shane and Co with full confidence that he and his crew will always do the job right for a fair price, without taking advantage of people in the process, and will go above and beyond in the quality of their product and services.  And that, in and of itself, is worth more than anything to me.

In order to give a better understanding of my situation let me say, without the intent of trashing anyone or their business, that when our system was replaced two years ago by the company that installed it, (who I also called for help yesterday when it stopped working), it malfunctioned quickly and flooded a bedroom ruining drywall and requiring extensive repairs. Eventually it had to be completely replaced as it never functioned properly. The replacement system needed a few tweaks, but eventually it seemed to work consistently and well and did for nearly a year- until yesterday. So, I contacted the company who installed the system and they were unable to come out immediately, nor could they give me a timeframe for their arrival.  It was 80 degrees inside, I have pets, and I needed someone there sooner rather than later. Shane wasted no time in getting to my house to assess the system and set to work immediately. In the process, he educated me on the system and gave me a complete rundown of what exactly was wrong, including a list of issues caused by the installers of the system, which were contributing to the malfunction of it. He also hauled off a large garbage bag of trash that the installers left in my attic! Additionally, his service charges were so reasonable I actually questioned him about it! His reply was basically that he would rather be good to customers, charge reasonably and fairly, and get great reviews and referrals than charge exorbitant amounts of money for his services! I was blown away! Now my air is working beautifully, I didn\u2019t spend a fortune to get it fixed, and he has a customer for LIFE. Try Gipson Heating and Air Conditioning.

I wouldn't hesitate to let him babysit my children because he is such a great guy.  His staff as well.  My story is unique because what started with me calling him out to talk about a duct cleaning turned into my husband and I gutting our entire home for a remodel (for other reasons) and we wanted a brand new system.  Shane came out to do a load calculation to help us pick the perfect system.  He was so detailed that he climbed into the smallest, most cringy area underneath a stairway landing in my basement. I felt like I was watching the show Fear Factor because you couldn't have paid me to crawl under there!!  We sat down at the table and he explained with so much detail the system I needed.  What I found to be so funny, is that I have never met a HVAC guy that was so passionate about his work.  I thought I was going to have to kick him out because, at one point, I think he started doing algebra equations based on how many windows I have and insulation in the house and whether the sun rises or sets on backside of my roof...LOL.\n\nAnyways,  this remodel has taken two years and I don't know how many times he came out to my home to help me before I ever paid him a dime.  I have a longer chain of text messages to him than I do to some of my friends.  He has just been there to answer every...single...one of my questions.

They have Serviced my 15 year old home unit for two years now and have never tried to sell me a new unit. Shane (the owner) always says he can keep it running with routine service and by topping off the freon at the beginning of each summer. He recommends this as it is cheaper for me and the best option with kids in college and a new unit is not needed right now. Previous HVAC companies pitched the need for a new unit based on age before even inspecting it.\n\nBut when it comes time for a new unit, as it was when Gipson replaced the 30+ year old unit in our rental house this summer, it was another positive experience with this company. Shane checked the unit, explained why this unit could not be repaired (it had rusted through in many areas) and recommended the best and most affordable unit for replacement. He even set me up with financing which allowed for payoff in six months with no interest.\n\nIt\u2019s a very vulnerable feeling when you have problems that you don\u2019t fully understand and feel like you are at the mercy of the repair tech\u2019s information. I don\u2019t have this feeling with Gipson as they take the time to explain and actually show you what the problem is before making the repair (Shane sent pictures to me at work when a fan motor needed replacing during last summer\u2019s service).\n\nI cannot recommend this company enough strictly based on their honesty and work ethics.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1591532328925, "text": "Thanks for the review and your trust in us!"}, "gmap_id": "0x8889744abc895555:0x2c0d9d979cb7770"}

They not only performed the seasonal maintenance on my unit, but discovered and remedied additional problems. They even corrected mistakes made by previous contractors which could have led to a malfunction of my unit in the future.\n(One example: I had been dealing with a condensation problem in my air handler and Shane Gipson explained why it was happening and fixed it immediately. By the way, the condensation was caused by the omission of an important step which another company\u2019s rep had not bothered to return my call on, much less offer to remedy.)\nShane Gipson\u2019s knowledge and expertise was surpassed only by his willingness to go above and beyond what he initially came to do. And he patiently answered all my questions (I had many).\nI urge you to give Gipson Heating & Air a call when you next need maintenance work or repair on your heating/air unit, no matter the brand. You will not be disappointed. In fact, you may be amazed that there are still those who have such a work ethic and hold themselves to such a high standard.

Not only did we get a quote FAST, but their quote was incredibly detailed; including sketches of our ductwork. In retrospect, this wasn't a big surprise, since Gipson actually did a full, comprehensive review, well beyond the cursory inspections the others did. Gipson asked questions the others didn't, revealed critical items the others missed, and provided additional details that truly benefited us. Their best suggestion was flipping a horizontal system to vertical. Yhis change gave us a tremendous amount of additional attic space, a genuine bonus!\n\nWe could go on singing Gipson's praises but will wrap up by simply saying all work was performed exactly as quoted, the installation was top notch, was done as promised and on time.

She received a few quotes from companies and although Gibson was not the lowest they were the most professional and were willing and able to do the entire job and not leave a whole in the wall to be fixed by another contractor she would have to pay.\nI agreed to stay at her home so she would not need to take a day off work and we wanted someone at the house incase there was a problem or questions that they needed to check with us before doing.\nThe owner showed up a few minutes before the agreed on time which was before his normal business hours because my sister asked if he could start early so I would not have to say there all day.  By 9 am he had already removed the old unit and started getting the new unit ready to install.  When his employees arrived they immediately came up to me and introduced themselves.  The two employees were clean and neatly dressed.\nWhile working they took the time to clean as they went never leaving a mess or tools laying around.  I watched the entire crew (owner included) and they all worked very well together and each of them seemed to care about the job as the owner.  All would answer any questions I had and were more polite than I can ever get my children to be.  I requested some very minor changes to the was a drain line ran and they immediately agreed and said it would not charge the price.\nWhen they were done all their work looked so neat, clean, and organized.  They went back with my sister and me both explaining everything they did and why they did it.  They went over what she had asked them to do and made sure she was happy with everything.  While working he also found a few other things that were not up to code that he fixed to bring everything around the unit up to the latest codes.  While the owner was doing all this his employees were cleaning everything they were even near.  They vacuumed a carpet that had probably not been vacuumed in a long while and swept out the entire garage.\nWhen it came time to pay he said he already told her the price.  My sister asked about any extra costs and the owner explained that he does not believe in changing the price after agreeing to the job and any extra cost that occurs he absorbs.\nIn my opinion these were some of the very best contractors I have ever been around working in my home or someone else's.

Our building contractor recommended Island Air-Air Conditioning and Heating, Gulf Shores, AL. My husband and I previously lived in several homes with HVAC problems stemming from poor design and installations. We knew we wanted to avoid those with new construction.\n\nI initially met with Rob Barnas of Island Air to explain our HVAC desires. Rob and Chris designed a plan to address the \"wants & needs\" of our system. It's very easy to install flexible ducts improperly, but Eddie and the men ran the ducts and attached the air handlers with great care.\n\nNew HVAC systems are very expensive. I did not want to buy a new system and suffer the same issues that we had to pay to have repaired in previous houses. So, throughout the construction process I asked dozens of questions.  I'm sure this was tiresome for Island Air, but they were very patient with me. Honestly, how can anyone be expected to properly operate and care for a system unless they understand how it's supposed to work? Hahahaha. Also, I wanted to understand the system while I could still see the components. Our drywall is not up yet. We are now 4 months into construction, so not far enough along to have thermostats installed or have the system turned on. However, we are enough along for me to say I am happy this far with the work done by Island Air of Gulf Shores, AL. I will try to post again after we move in to give everyone a final report on how it feels to live in an HVAC system built by Island Air.\n\nPS. In case you are wondering. I am not related by blood or personal connections to anyone at Island Air and have received no discounts or other incentives for posting this review.\nD.

The initial job was well done.  I was happy with the work that I entered a service agreement for my upstairs unit. In 2016 my trust with the company was severely damaged when the AC tech charged me for the part that was still under warranty and I had to call them on it.  To the company credit, they did \"refund\" me with the credit on the next repair job in the spring of 2017.  I paid the invoice without examining it carefully as I should have done.  Two months in late May of 2017, I received a letter from the Baldwin County small claim court saying that Island  Air is suing me for nonpayment.  I called them and the manager told me that all this can go away if I pay them at that point.  I went home and dug up all my paperwork and found out that they overcharged me once again on the visit in spring 2017.  I faxed them my receipts and called them the next day and advised them not to go ahead with the lawsuit because they will not win in court.  They rescinded the the court claim and offered me a six month maintenance complimentary service for my inconvenience,  but after all the shenanigans I have to walk away.  The trust factor is no longer there.  I waited for four months to write this review to make sure that my emotion is in check and to give them a fair review about my experience with the company.   Take home points?  Save your receipts and you need to know about the warranty your AC system.  Always go check the charges line by line and make sure to keep this company honest.

We are so very happy with our overall experience with this company. In fact (no lie) less than two hours after the final hook-up, there was a sudden storm, the electricity went out and the generator came on. It was seamless!!! We did have a misunderstanding with the salesman but once we brought it to the attention of Steve Dukes, the business owner, he quickly and decisively took care of it. Because we are on the Bay, we wanted the generator elevated so that, should there be flooding, the generator would be safe. That request hadn't been conveyed to the installers. However, when Mr. Dukes was made aware of the oversight, he actually constructed a metal stand for us himself. Plus he did this very quickly so that the delay was minimal. We were thinking they would build us a wooden platform, but the metal one is much better \u2014 both functionally (as it will last longer) and aesthetically. We are from Michigan and we had no intention of being here through hurricane season but we had traveled here with my 94 year old mother and, because of the coronavirus, she couldn\u2019t fly back and she can\u2019t physically tolerate such a long drive.  I was afraid that, because of the misunderstanding, we would be relegated to the bottom of the list and have to wait until they could \u201cget around to it\u201d because they were so busy...not so! There was only a slight delay while the frame was fabricated. So, fast forward to the present time: We had \u201cbugged out\u201d when Hurricane Sally was about 100 miles South of us and just now walked into the door after Sally had passed through. There is no electricity on either side of us but we walked into the door with the generator humming reassuringly beside the house. I don\u2019t have to worry about Moms Bi-Pap or oxygen condenser working. She will be able to sleep comfortably tonight...and so will I. Mr. Dukes made sure we had the generator installed the way we wanted it and in a timely manner, smoothing out the bumps along the way. I definitely recommend getting a whole house (Generac) generator and I highly recommend doing business with Mr. Dukes of Baldwin Heating & Air Conditioning. He knows his business and is a man of integrity.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1604097541449, "text": "Kathy thank you so much.

So we called Baldwin HVAC.  They sent a guy to come out and look at it.  He looked briefly at the unit, walked around the house for a few minutes with a thermometer, and quickly pronounced that there was nothing wrong, and that all we needed was to change our air filters.  So they charged us $39 for the visit (the fee they quote you) plus $50 for \"labor,\" which I guess is that guy's rate for walking around your house for 10 minutes.\n\nObviously, I keep my filters changed, so I was suspicious, but I assumed that he knew what he was talking about.  2 weeks ago, our AC stops working completely.   Before calling anyone, I go into the attic and check it out myself.  The coils were completely frozen.  And not only that - they were clogged with dust and mold.  This was due to our blower motor malfunctioning, which had been happening slowly for some time at that point.\n\nI took a photo to show how bad it was.  Naturally, I called Baldwin HVAC to ask how their guy missed something so obvious.  The manager, Anthony, said that the initial $89 visit \"didn't include\" looking at the coils, even though it took me - an ordinary guy with no HVAC expertise - literally 5 minutes to open up the blower and look in there.\n\nLike an fool, I believed him, and so hired them to come out and fix the blower motor that had gone bad.  Their guy John came and he was nice and did a good job.\n\nBut the next day, the same AC unit goes dead again.  This time, the problem is the outdoor compressor.  So I call them to come check it out.\n\nThey charge us yet another $89 to come and look at the same AC system they'd worked on the very day before.  This time, we resist their high-pressure sales tactics (\"It's 4 PM, so if you want the AC working tomorrow, we need to order the part now! \") and call a different company to work on the compressor.  Baldwin HVAC quoted us $822 to replace the part (which was covered by warranty).  We went to Climatemp instead, and they charged us $550 for the exact same job.  They got the part that same day and had a guy out there the very next morning.\n\nLong story short: I'd recommend someone else first, if only because these people charge more than other companies, and in my experience, the quality of the work just wasn't sufficient to justify the extra cost.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a69f62d949da1:0x9a9bd9e00f87db88"}

To their credit they did fix the heat the technician said he serviced the unit and put half a pound of freon in it and didn't find a problem with it. Well my air conditioning isn't working now and I called them out again. This time the technician said it had a leak and needed fifteen pounds of freon. So it would cost me about $489 to have them repair it. So how did the unit get the leak?

However, Charlie and the guys gave me a great deal.\n\nAlso, I lost one of my batteries to my DeWalt drill while they were here. They may have accidentally taken it or I may have lost it! Either way I called and asked if they had seen an extra battery laying around. Instead of saying \u2018\u2019no\u201d and moving on, they bought me a brand new DeWalt drill and mailed it to my house.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes this company great!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1569592896414, "text": "We're so glad that you enjoyed your experience!

And worst of all, he did not protect the work area and raw sewage dumped all over our washer and dryer, mop sink, basement walls, etc. I did not see this happen and it ended up being much worse than I thought. I asked him if he was going to clean up before he left, he didn't even sweep up the PVC dust from cutting the pipe. He asked me if I had a mop?? All he did was hose down the area and did NOT do a thorough job cleaning up the raw sewage or disinfecting the area. When I called the office to talk to a manager, they told me they have gotten calls before but that it was not standard for their crew to carry cleaning supplies on their trucks. They did not offer to send someone to clean up the mess. The Servpro quote was twice as much as the plumbing quote. I truly cannot believe they would leave someone's home in such a mess.

This would be for labor alone. When asked why so much for a job that should take 1 man less than an hour, I was informed they have a 4 hour minimum fee. This was after already paying a $70 diagnostic fee just to get in the game.  Sorry but this is not an acceptable business practice in the service industry, and rather dishonest. I wish them the best.\nEdit: In response to you, Sir, thank you for the specific details. Very informative, and highly technical. Doesn't change the fact that you're charging 4 hours labor (at a very high hourly rate) for something that takes far less than that to do. I can describe many processes in such detail that sound impressive but in all actuality are very rapidly executable tasks. The job as you described can be completed by others in less than an hour. I'm sure your techs do fantastic work, but you should warn customers of your unreasonable rates before you demand a $70 diagnostic fee that leaves a customer empty handed. Again, all the best.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1618490873082, "text": "The replacement of this part is not a simple one. To do this job the right way, we have to pump down the system and hold the freon in the outdoor unit. Not all of the freon will hold in the outdoor unit. We will have to recover the freon that is left in the system. Then unsweat the txv at the evap. coil with our torches and sweat the new valve back in.Fill the system up with nitrogen to check for leaks, pull a vacuum on the system and wait until the system is pulled down to 500 microns. After this is finished we wait another 30 mins to make sure again that there isn't any leaks. Once we make sure there are no leaks we turn the freon loose from the outdoor unit and check the freon levels to get the sub cooling to the manufacturer's specs.

The ground team is friendly, knowledgeable, and offers very high quality workmanship for very fair prices.  The entire team is great at explaining technical issues that are often beyond what I know and understand about HVAC systems!\n\nCarden has been able to capably fix every heating and cooling issue that I or one of my rental clients has ever had.  One particular issue was pretty involved and complex in an older home this past summer, where, due to a prior installer doing shoddy work, my client was unable to cool her home and was receiving sky-high bills.  The Carden Team came in and fixed the entire system and duct work, and her bill has gone down by HUNDREDS of dollars!!\n\nOne final note, and this may make me favorite thing about the Carden family:  I work with a vulnerable, low-income community, and it is often difficult to hire service workers to come into the communities where we need things fixed.  I have actually had service workers tell me directly that they would not service one of my clients\u2019 homes due to their address.  It is heartbreaking.

We had been waiting two weeks for the company that installed the new HVAC in our home (Buckner plumbing and heating) to come service the unit and after six calls to them in which they promised to be coming that day and then had an excuse each and every time why they weren't coming. They went so far as to tell us they don't money in warranty repairs, even when we had an extended warranty for 13 years. They told me to call someone else to come and do the repairs. The catch in all this was that our extended warranty covered both parts and labor. If we had to go to a different Trane dealer they would not cover the labor costs, but the parts were at no charge. I read several good reviews about Carden and decided to go with them. Our repairman was by far one of the most professional, kind and courteous people we have ever had the pleasure of working with. They gave us an estimate before hand and I had already checked the average labor costs to change the compressor out and their rate was very reasonable. Upon finishing the job and it came time to settle up with and to my amazement they came over five hundred dollars cheaper than the original estimate. HVAC has been running around the clock to keep our house at 62 degrees around the clock. I can't tolerate heat due to a medical condition. They called us a few days later to just in in to make sure it's still running great.\n\nIt's now over a month since they fixed and I got an email just to check on us, which I truly appreciated.

And in doing so, actually suggested that they didnt need a new system, but improved insulation because the current system is large enough.  Let me rephrase that, the tech DID NOT sell them what they were asking for, and what was approved by the budget department of this large property management firm, and in doing so, saved them approximately $4000.

I lost my air last Saturday and contacted HACS late afternoon.  The temperature in my home was hovering around 86 degrees.  The lady that I spoke to was very caring and easy to speak to.  She was attempting to send a technician out Saturday night, but I told her it was o.k. to setup the appointment for Sunday morning due to bad weather in the area.  She contacted me early Sunday to let me know that the technician was on the way to my home.  They also have an automated texting system that notified my cell when the technician was on the way.  The technician Billy arrived quickly and started to diagnose the issue with the outside air condenser after I told him the symptoms.  Billy was a great guy to work with and was very knowledgeable.  Billy told me that I defiantly had a bad capacitor and possibly a compressor.  I pretty much knew the capacitor was bad before he even arrived onsite.  Due to having a 13-year-old odd name 5-ton system Billy didn\u2019t have the right capacitor on the truck.  He asked me how bad I wanted it fixed on Sunday due to the warehouse being closed and it would cost a small fee to open.  I told him that I was hot and willing to pay the small fee.  Billy left the house and came back about an hour later to repair the unit.  When Billy pulled up I stopped him from repairing the unit.  I told him since it was a 13-year-old system, and I have had issues in the past that I was ready to replace.  I didn\u2019t feel any pressure from Billy attempting to sale me a new system.  He was ready for the less expensive repair.  Billy called home office and setup an appointment to replace the system on Monday morning.  The crew showed up Monday morning ready to work.  Everyone felt welcoming and treated my home like it was theirs.  I was very excited for the cold air Monday night.

It was then, that I knew we had the best of Birmingham! But, that was not all. They were able to get us financed for and entire new HVAC Unit within our budget!\n\nDaniel and Drew were both very pleasant and very knowledgeable, as they answered every question I had.

The owner, Shane, is very personable and the kind of guy you can trust with your door unlocked. Opie (dead ringer for a younger Ron Howard), his technician, is a relatively young guy (23), but mature beyond his years and a very good HVAC tech. He's also trustworthy and the kind of guy you would want to represent your company. Most importantly, he was able to diagnose my heat pump problem quickly and efficiently...10 to 15 minutes. The HVAC was over amped.\n\nThe company that installed my TRANE XL14 heat pump in 2007, Alabama Climate Control (ACC) of Huntsville, apparently did not notice that the heat pump was rated for max amperage of 40 amps because they did not bother to change the 50 amp circuit breaker in the panel in the garage. One would expect a professional HVAC company to do a basic electrical circuit check/test to ensure the electrical circuit is compatible with your NEW heat pump...right!?!?\n\nAnyway, this oversight by ACC resulted in a fried circuit breaker in the junction box at the heat pump. Opie said we were lucky this situation did not result in a burned up motor or worse a burned down house. After all that, Opie tried to give me a $25 discount because I'm a veteran.\n\nThank you for the sentiment Opie, but also thank you for identifying a problem that has caused me great anguish over the years. I had to replace 3 or 4 compressors on the original heat pump (a Rheem) about 15 years ago when we first started renting out the house.\n\nThe HVAC company (same ACC) kept replacing all those compressors under warranty at $250 to $300 a pop for labor, but just couldn't figure out what was causing all those compressors to burn up (the same 50 amp circuit breaker in the breaker box). Then, I was dumb enough to hire them again to install a new TRANE in 2007. Remeber, the TRANE is rated for a maximum of 40 amps, but ACC left the same old 50 amp circuit breaker in the breaker panel. Voila...we get a fried junction box this time.\n\nIncredible...that it took a young 23 year old tech with a lot less experience (but more common sense and intelligence) to recognize that a 50 amp circuit breaker is going to eventually cause some problems if it is not compatible with the rest of the circuit.\n\nThe cautionary tale here is...be extremely vigilant and careful about who you let work on your electrical systems and watch them like a hawk when they do...until you find a company like SMS that has techs like Opie.. Thank you SMS and Opie for saving my house from a potential fire.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1462206716420, "text": "Thanks Dwight! We are very happy we could take care of your heat pump needs!

The regional manager got the prices for a new unit and informed me that the Trane units come with a 10-year parts and labor warranty. A few days later August 17, I was met by the sales rep to sign the contract to have my air conditioning unit installed the next day. He let me know that the unit came with a 3-year parts and labor warranty. I negotiated to have the 10-year parts and labor warranty but felt uneasy that I had to catch the discrepancy and negotiate to get what I was told verbally.\nOn August 18, a crew came out to the house to install a unit. The crew then arrived and installed my air conditioning unit. After they left, I went up to inspect the unit and found that the air filtration unit (installed weeks prior by Best Plumbing and Air Conditioning) did not have the red light on, indicating the device was active, while the unit was running. A simple check to see if the red light were on would have revealed this. Furthermore, the electrical connection to the unit had a cable spliced open with exposed wiring. I called and asked for someone to come and clean the mess left behind in my attic as well as to fix the air filtration unit and ensure its operation. In addition, the crew had damaged my attic frame, but agreed to fix it later on in the week.\nBefore someone could come out, I noticed my celling over my shower leaking, right underneath the air conditioning unit. I called back and asked for a different crew to be sent out come out. The regional manager came out, then the same individual followed. As both were in my attic, the regional manager then left the same individual behind to do the repair, contrary to my request. After they left, I walked back in my house to discover my heat was on, even though my unit was set to cool. I called the regional manager back directly and he sent someone back out who said he got some wires crossed. He fixed it then left.\nI was informed on August 19th after the install that within 3-4 days I would have a contractor come out to repair the ceiling that was now brown due to the air conditioning leaking. When that time lapsed, I reached back out to him again. He told me it would get fixed. If I wanted to, I could call someone to come fix it and get reimbursed and apologized for them being backed up. Well, a few days later (September 4th), my ceiling started to leak again in the exact same spot. Fortunately, this was over my shower.\nThis time another technician came out. He mentioned that it was because the pan was the wrong size, or in the wrong location, so they would get it fixed next week. It concerns me that the regional manager was up in my attic after problems were found and failed to diagnose the cause of the leak as being the size or orientation of the pan. This makes me wonder what other problems will be faced down the road.\nThen another tech comes out to fix the cause of the leaking ceiling on September 8th. It gets repaired. So, I think all is good, right? No.\nLater that day, I notice a brown spot on the ceiling in my other bathroom. So, I go up to investigate and I find that it appears to be spilled water from when they repaired the unit. So, I call again (3rd time) and I am told the same thing \u201cWe can have someone come out and fix it.\u201d At this point, this is the 3rd leak I have had, so I have zero confidence that the unit will not leak again. So, I decide \u201clet\u2019s wait and see if any of the leaks happen again.\u201d Since it has leaked 3 times, it may be better to wait.\n2 weeks go by, so I reached out to the regional manager and asked for $160 so that I can fix the damage myself. $60 for the parts and $100 for my inconvenience. No response. Zero.\nIt is now 6 weeks after the unit has been installed, so I have decided I will just fix the stains myself, rather than to deal with the frustration of being ignored.\nIf I had it to do over again, there is no way I would choose to do business with this company.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObIA_nNXuBVhoMpLfBMSMveu9tLygpJxLPa-16=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPf0cxc3OT93_8vTRbUn3yzAOaKeA-nOTAGczeC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIIzElZAqdmu5ry6EfvLwFs5KDgzBMBmj3r0jQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1601651994499, "text": "Hi Mr. Boctor - our Branch Manager has been attempting to reach you regarding your feedback.

Tyler showed up with an assistant and installed the unit on June 22nd. My house is finally cool again. Thank you Carlos, Nate and Tyler, you guys are amazing. I am so happy with the service I have received from Best Care. Thanks!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626563baad35ff:0x9c51435c6c920e11"}

The regional manager got the prices for a new unit and informed me that the Trane units come with a 10-year parts and labor warranty. A few days later August 17, I was met by the sales rep to sign the contract to have my air conditioning unit installed the next day. He let me know that the unit came with a 3-year parts and labor warranty. I negotiated to have the 10-year parts and labor warranty but felt uneasy that I had to catch the discrepancy and negotiate to get what I was told verbally.\nOn August 18, a crew came out to the house to install a unit. The crew then arrived and installed my air conditioning unit. After they left, I went up to inspect the unit and found that the air filtration unit (installed weeks prior by Best Plumbing and Air Conditioning) did not have the red light on, indicating the device was active, while the unit was running. A simple check to see if the red light were on would have revealed this. Furthermore, the electrical connection to the unit had a cable spliced open with exposed wiring. I called and asked for someone to come and clean the mess left behind in my attic as well as to fix the air filtration unit and ensure its operation. In addition, the crew had damaged my attic frame, but agreed to fix it later on in the week.\nBefore someone could come out, I noticed my celling over my shower leaking, right underneath the air conditioning unit. I called back and asked for a different crew to be sent out come out. The regional manager came out, then the same individual followed. As both were in my attic, the regional manager then left the same individual behind to do the repair, contrary to my request. After they left, I walked back in my house to discover my heat was on, even though my unit was set to cool. I called the regional manager back directly and he sent someone back out who said he got some wires crossed. He fixed it then left.\nI was informed on August 19th after the install that within 3-4 days I would have a contractor come out to repair the ceiling that was now brown due to the air conditioning leaking. When that time lapsed, I reached back out to him again. He told me it would get fixed. If I wanted to, I could call someone to come fix it and get reimbursed and apologized for them being backed up. Well, a few days later (September 4th), my ceiling started to leak again in the exact same spot. Fortunately, this was over my shower.\nThis time another technician came out. He mentioned that it was because the pan was the wrong size, or in the wrong location, so they would get it fixed next week. It concerns me that the regional manager was up in my attic after problems were found and failed to diagnose the cause of the leak as being the size or orientation of the pan. This makes me wonder what other problems will be faced down the road.\nThen another tech comes out to fix the cause of the leaking ceiling on September 8th. It gets repaired. So, I think all is good, right? No.\nLater that day, I notice a brown spot on the ceiling in my other bathroom. So, I go up to investigate and I find that it appears to be spilled water from when they repaired the unit. So, I call again (3rd time) and I am told the same thing \u201cWe can have someone come out and fix it.\u201d At this point, this is the 3rd leak I have had, so I have zero confidence that the unit will not leak again. So, I decide \u201clet\u2019s wait and see if any of the leaks happen again.\u201d Since it has leaked 3 times, it may be better to wait.\n2 weeks go by, so I reached out to the regional manager and asked for $160 so that I can fix the damage myself. $60 for the parts and $100 for my inconvenience. No response. Zero.\nIt is now 6 weeks after the unit has been installed, so I have decided I will just fix the stains myself, rather than to deal with the frustration of being ignored.\nIf I had it to do over again, there is no way I would choose to do business with this company.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObIA_nNXuBVhoMpLfBMSMveu9tLygpJxLPa-16=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPf0cxc3OT93_8vTRbUn3yzAOaKeA-nOTAGczeC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIIzElZAqdmu5ry6EfvLwFs5KDgzBMBmj3r0jQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1601651994499, "text": "Hi Mr. Boctor - our Branch Manager has been attempting to reach you regarding your feedback.

The tech came out, assessed that it was the blower motor. It took 11 days for the part to come in, then another five for them to come install it!\n\nSecond AC issue: after a week of it working, it stopped again. The same tech came out and said that our thermostat was now uncalibrated. This was on a Monday. He said that it's a common issue and he will be back out no later than Wednesday with a new one. Seven days go by, so I call to find out what in the heck. The customer service said that my issue was marked as \"resolved\" so there was no plan to come back out! I complained, and they came out four days later.\n\nThird AC issue: it stopped working... again. Hurray, the same wonderful tech to the rescue! He said that now there was a crack in the coil and it was leaking freon. When asked why I've seen him so many times, he said that fixing one thing led to another thing breaking... Two weeks go by waiting to find out when they are going to bring a new coil, but they said they've decided to order a new unit instead.\n\nFourth AC issue: after three hours of installing the new unit, they inform me that this new unit has a different metering device that only blows a different kind of freon or something to that effect and that this issue should have been caught before they even came out.\n\nMy laptop has overheated and my dogs are not doing well.

We are also required to work within the confines of the warranty contract -- if it's not broken they will not cover to fix it until it does break.

In June 2017 we replaced our old units with two American Standard ac & heating units under the previous owner and the installers were awful.  We had small gas leaks on both units, insulation around the refrigerant lines was half ass done on the downstairs unit and not even replaced on the upstairs which was dried & cracking, etc.  When I called to have the has gas smell checked out the new owners were eager to get someone sent out immediately. The smell was intermittent so I wasn't sure if there was an issue. The first time Sonny came out & took care of the downstairs gas smell.  A few hours after he left the air purifier wasn't working.  Eddie came to our house and fixed and also noticed the \"dryer\" was installed backwards on the both units. He corrected both problems in addition to gas smell upstairs, & addressed the insulation on the refrigerant lines.  Eddie was wonderful! We so appreciate the time he has spent to address the install issues. My husband owns a construction company and we've dealt with several HVAC companies for our home & business....hands down we are so impressed with the service Total Comfort provides.

Drove from Gardendale to Talladega to look at our unit and see what could be done. He was a lifesaver. It was the capacitor. He had a new one on his truck, and fixed it within 30 minutes.

Our AC stopped working and we were advised we need a coil and condensor replaced. The fee for that was $3850. A month later the ac went back to blowing hot air. We called for PB to come back out and the technician stated a part was loose and needed to be replaced from the first service job and we would not be charged. That fixed it for about another month or two. The next technician stated a frog short circuited the system and he removed it and the ac went back to blowing like it should for another couple weeks. Every visit after the alleged frog incident has been one excuse after the other. We're doing renovations and were told the filters needed to be changed more frequently and the house would cool down. We continued to change them weekly and still no luck. We called yet again to advise of the continuing problem only to be charged $79.99 for them to clean the coils and blame the filters. The AC still continued to blow hot air and then the attic began to leak. So ANOTHER call was made. The technician stated the coils were frozen and that the ac needed to be turned off and to change the filter again (at this point we're already changing it weekly and have completed the renovations). The house still didnt cool down and the ac was still leaking. Another call was made the same day (as a leaking attic is urgent and ruining the ceiling) the technician returned and said the coil was shooting out water (ya think!!!! That's why we called in the first place!) had they bothered to look and not blame it on the filter they would have discovered it on the first visit. So the technician fixes the leak and says give it time, the house will cool. Guess what, it's still not cooling!!! So we wait a week (we work and can't keep taking off for someone to come out) and call them back out. The technician now states the roof doesnt have enough vents  and the attic door is off centered and that is what's causing the house not to cool. He said he tweaked something and give it a minute and it will cool. He also states he was advised to charge for coming out. What is there to charge for? The house is still hot, the temperature is steady rising as I type, and the original problem has not been fixed. They're basically grasping  at straws at this point and have run out of probable excuses.  Be prepared to throw away $4000 plus dollars and live in heat if you use this company.

I was told the technician would arrive between 8-10. I received a call at 8:02 AM stating he was on his way. KD arrived, wore a mask, put on boot covers to protect the rugs/floor, and got straight to work. Honestly I wanted to watch him work but I didn't want to come across as nosy or rude. KD was very receptive to me standing in the room watching him service the HVAC. Not only that, but KD actually talked me through the entire HVAC system, process by process, and showed me what he looks for and tests. I'm sure most people wouldn't care to learn about the system, but I was curious and he was so friendly and accommodating. I believe he went above and beyond because even though this was a pre-paid visit for a simple tune-up/preventative service, he went back out to his van and got the metal tape stuff and came back in to re-seal some of the spots that he could feel hot air leaking through. I bet I had the same fear most consumers have - I was waiting to hear how my machine (which has worked perfectly for me since I moved in a year ago) was somehow in need of hundreds or thousands of dollars in repairs. The fact that he (a) didn't charge a dollar, (b) didn't recommend that I spend any money on anything, (c) spent the time to run me through his entire process, (d) and then used his company's tape to fix some gaps in my ducts without charge... I couldn't be happier with the service I received. Any concerns I had about \"another monthly expense\" ($12/mo) are now out the window. I'll be requesting that KD do our HVAC service work exclusively moving forward.

I have always trusted Norrell and I know things will happen but, it's how you respond to it that really matters.\n\nI have been using Norrell for over 4 years, Thanks you Jeff!\n....\nService date was May 7th, 2021. I want to say Norrell Service Experts was doing a good job up to this point. Last service tune up was terrible, technician left the cover to the attic unit half closed, stripped out the fasteners due to over tightening. Cool air was blowing out the side of the unit, because the door wasn't sealed correctly.  Also he left the insulation tape off Freon pipe hole into the unit (6X2 inch hole). My attic was cooler than the house itself.\n\nWhy tune it up if you cant put everything back the way it was before you started, didn't save me anything!\n\nSeems like the two technicians were really only interested in selling me on the \"Advantage Free Plan\" or a new Water Heater then doing what I was paying them to do.\n\nAlso if I look at their Home Health Service Report (yellow copy), 90% of the report is checked good, 10% is checked fair.\n\nEmergency technician that came out after I realized the AC wasn't working correctly stated half my Freon is gone (4LB) $800. Hmm??\n\nStill waiting on a call from manager!\n\nThanks Norrell!\n\nPrevious Review..............................\nNorrell has serviced my unit since I moved into my new home. Always professional and they take the time to explain your systems health, along with showing pictures.

After finishing the maintenance job, the technician said that the unit is old, it could go on just for a day or week or an year. He advised to replaced the unit. That was a red flag. The other technician who came over to evaluate AC performance gave a couple of options to replace the unit with estimates around 6k to 10k.  A few hours after the left, the unit was break down for the first time,  I followed up with Norrell Experts and raised my concerns the next day after I had the unit looked at by another technician to diagnose the problem. Norrell Service Experts had sent a senior technician who temporarily fixed the issue and said the problem was with a wire the connects the compressor and capacitor that burned out.

One was a big advertiser in the Birmingham media market, and they just wanted to sell me a new $15,000 unit. A smaller company wanted to basically do the same, although they came in at $11,000. Two one-man HVAC guys were nice, and didn't want to sell me new units;  but after several attempts, they couldn't find out what was wrong.\n\nThen I called Norrell. Technician Jeremy Stiles patiently listened to my long boring history of our heat pump and how it had worked off and on. He asked questions. Then he started investigating. After almost two hours poking around both my inside and outside units, he discovered a terribly clogged dysfunctional coil was the problem.\n\nInstead of charging me $15,000 for a new unit, Norrell charged less than $1,000 and Jeremy took the better part of a day to unclog and restore both the inoperable coil (which kept the heat pump from turning on) and the dirty coils on the outside unit.\n\nHe not only found the problem and fixed it, he explained what he did in detailed layman's terms I could understand.\n\nFrom my experience, if you don't call Norrell for heating and air conditioning issues, you're wasting your time and your money.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1543428527804, "text": "Gilbert, your recommendation means so much to us and we're so happy to have earned it!"}, "gmap_id": "0x8888ddbda9d2ba57:0x87966ff1b9d57714"}

Anyways JEESE was sent out and he told me mycircuit board was damaged and they would have to order the part and it would take two days. I have several health issues and to leave home would be impossible. JEESEKnew I had already spent one nigh in the cold without any heat so he was determined not to have me in the cold again. HE completely re figured another board to another u it and spent all day to get it to work and by six I had heat!! There is not another service man who would have done this. Most would have said well good luck and see you when the part comes in two days later! But notJEESEhe found a way for me to have heat! He is one fine service man! Norrell is very lucky to have him! Jeff his boss should do something nice for him because he went far beyond what others would not have done!

I would like to give a special \u201cthank you\u201d to the three men that came to our home in the past two days, John, Brody, & Steve. All three men delivered top quality customer service, while also allowing me, as a stay at home mom, a sense of trust and comfort that the service being provided to us was one we needn\u2019t question. These gentlemen were very thorough with their original diagnostic visit, and also very kind to answer all of my questions. I have hired companies, prior to Bradberry , to repair our HVAC unit, and many a time I have been left feeling \u201cswindled\u201d or ignored. (I.E. rather discuss the business at hand with my husband). We\u2019ve had multiple companies, even just send out a salesperson, instead of looking at all possible cost saving options for our family\u2019s financial situation. I have been disheartened by other companies, to say the least...\n\nThat\u2019s why I am so honored to write a five star review for the company of, Bradberry. They have gone above and beyond meeting my expectations. For years our family has \u201cband aided\u201d our AC unit, we knew it would be in the near future to get a new unit, however, Bradberry, and their service workers, still gave us multiple different options to consider.\n\nAfter much deliberation, my husband and I did decide to replace the HVAC UNIT. All diagnostics, financing, and installation were done in 24hrs. (Keep in mind this is also at the end of May, in Alabama, when the heat is unbearable). These gentlemen had a kind smile on their faces the whole time, while also giving clear and concise details on what to expect going forward.\n\nLike I said, I cannot say enough wonderful things about the customer service and products that Bradberry delivered to our family.\nThank you to the three gentlemen and the company of Bradberry for exceeding my expectations. I am truly thankful, and so much more comfortable!\n\n-Mary Sutphin", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1622746402552, "text": "Thanks for your business Mary Catherine!!

Instead of being honest with the repairs that needed completed so we could get our AC fixed and stop living in 80 temps inside our house, he made up a LIE saying we would sue everyone.

First of all, they sent out this young guy but I feel did not know what he was doing. He kept snapping pictures and calling other people to assist him with my situation. My problem was merely outside and to be honest I had already told him what the problem was before he even started. The problem was my compressor. He changed out all these different things that had nothing to do with the fan and after an hour and 30 minutes he then comes to me as if he was defeated and told me that's a problem with my compressor. I told him that's what I told you at the beginning of the service call, but that's neither here nor there. So he continues to tell me that they do not carry the compressor that I have for my unit and that it would need to be ordered and it will take an a week for it to be ordered so I complied and thank him for his time after paying him the service fee. Fast forward 4 days I decided to call the company just to double-check and see if the part has by any chance already come in and to my surprise the operator their stated that my claim was actually denied from my home warranty company because the technician stated that my compressor going bad in an 11 year old air conditioning unit was not normal wear and tear and that I be customer could have prevented it from actually happening so in that case the warranty company denied my claim which was total home protection. I would not suggest this company be used because it seems as if the technicians they're clearly need a little bit more training they do not know what they're doing and what it seems like there is also doing is coming out diagnosing the situation and going back and telling the actual company that that hired them that this was something that was not considered normal wear and tear so the company would not be obligated to fix your units or your equipment and still charge you the service fee that is not a refundable this whole entire thing to me is just a complete rip-off and I do not suggest that they be used", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888927aabecbadef:0x79f99d1351f351a9"}

All of the technicians to include Cole and Ty were very nice, professional, and knowledgeable. However, the owner Randall is very rude, does not follow through with his work, and lies about their intentions with repairs. I used American Home Shield and they sent this company to my home. The entire time they stated that my warranty company supplies junk and the owner continued to try and sell me his units. When my air handler was finally received after nearly a month without air conditioning, the service people came out to install and then told me it was the wrong part. I was fine with that and was very understanding as long as it would still be fixed sooner than later. However, after they left once again the owner and his wife told me that the part was correct but that they had additional work that would need to be done. Again, more money requested out of pocket and still no A/C. Randall, the owner stated he would complete all of the work within a week but instead the very next day after the install was supposed to occur they completely ditched the entire install. Randall then called my home warranty company and told them there was a confrontation (which absolutely never happened). In fact his two employees stood in my living room for 30 minutes talking about pets and their parents during high school life. I offered them water and even assisted them with unloading the air handler from its box in my driveway. There was absolutely no confrontations and at the end of the day it was because he didnt want to do the work. He wanted to sell me expensive equipment and wasted an entire month of mine. He didnt even have enough decency to call me before dropping the entire job completely. I found out when the new company called to schedule with me. The new company that American Home Shield is sending states they can fix it same week. Arrow Company and its owners are a joke. Do not use them as they are not reliable and are run by rude inconsiderate people that do not have a sense of urgency nor care about the way they treat you.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888927aabecbadef:0x79f99d1351f351a9"}

Randall, his son Hunter and their team provided the most professional service that you would wish. I did not now Arrow Air System before. I just filled an online request and several companies called. First, a technician, Cole, came from Arrow Air Systems. He provided all the information that I needed with absolute honesty. As a university professor, I was able to distinguish that the service I was receiving was very high quality. After showing me the exact problem and explaining me all the details, he provided me several options. Given that my outside unit and air-handler were 18 years old and I have been very tired with the patch work that was done by the American Home Shield HVAC firms, I was ready to move and replace both units.  I spoke with the owner Randall and he gave me a price for American Standards Unit. I told him to give me couple of days to do my homework and shop around. He encouraged me to do what is best for my family. Obviously he was very sure about competitiveness of his quote.  After shopping around I realized that Randall gave me the best quote. The level of honesty was phenomenal!  I had many experience with other HVAC companies. I can easily say that Arrow Air Systems is the best in Shelby county and Birmingham. Within couple of days Arrow Air came and performed an absolutely perfect replacement of my air-handler and outside unit. As a mechanical engineering student Hunter provided absolutely the best service. They replaced my upstairs unit within several hours. The owner, Randall, provided the best price, which even Sears was not able to beat. From beginning to the end all the employees were extremely professional and polite. The first day I recommended their service to my neighbor. I will be recommending their service to all my friends and neighbors.  HVAC industry seems to be infested by unprofessional many companies. As consumers we need  companies like Arrow Air Systems to thrive and do better to clear the bad name surrounding HVAC service providers. Keep up your professional and honest work Arrow Air!

There is nothing more aggravating than to have your air conditioning unit quit. Although it is mid-October we needed our air conditioning fixed ASAP. Our unit was 17 years old and I knew we needed to replace it if not immediately, within the very near future. I emailed a few companies Saturday night asking for estimates and to please contact me Monday morning. Only Autumn Air and one other company returned my call today. Autumn Air was very pleasant and offered to have someone come out to price the unit immediately. Since I knew I did not want to start throwing money away repairing such an old unit I asked for a quote for a new unit (with and without the furnace). Skip came out and priced the unit with three options and it was clear if I wanted more options he would give them to me. He did not acted putout or frustrated with my request. He did not pressure me to make a decision nor did he push me to buy the most expensive product. Without me asking, he let me know the specials that were being offered. I asked how soon they could install the unit and he said either this afternoon or in the morning. I called my husband and sent him the estimates. My husband was impressed and even showed his fellow employees who were also impressed with the prices. After weighing the pros and cons we decided to replace the entire unit (with furnace). I called Skip back about 2:30 saying we did want to go ahead and replace the unit, he said he would call me right back, that it would be either this afternoon or in the morning. I was floored when he called me back shortly afterwards and asked if it was okay with me if they could install it today. Skip and two other gentlemen came and installed the unit working hard until close to 9:00 pm. We were all extremely grateful to the diligence of these men. In addition, Autumn Air included a 2-year service plan where they will come out to service/clean the unit twice a year. They have earned my trust. I am very thankful to Autumn Air.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSUL9QRFJSPykXqDzrNKpCip6nXxO_y7dxFY68=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2RdAWKk5TI7OZtRl8wgn94aokdQNwgFcu2UXt=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEyoCn2esr-2rrYIf35lCntXDGlIln-damn4kj=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1593532696719, "text": "Thank you!!!!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888924e52224bd39:0x2e611205e661f050"}

{"user_id": "117764367263681419355", "name": "John Hosmer", "time": 1505317915712, "rating": 5.0, "text": "For a long while there have been atmosphere issues in our basement where the previous home owners had never taken care of sealing up the rooms and keeping temps and humidity in check. We had addressed those issues and we had tried using good filters at the returns to prevent as much of any dust, mold spores, etc. from recirculating and spreading, but it ended up being a losing battle for both comfort and our family's health.  Finally, about a month ago I disconnected one of the flexpipes at the end of the trunk run to see just how bad it was and found almost 100% coverage of dust, mold, and nastiness throughout the system. It was in every bit of the trunk, and every flexpipe throughout the house (See pictures). Even a few of the vent registers had started harboring mold growth which was a really bad sign as well.\n\nSo, I did what any good panicking homeowner would do at that point. Went to Google, pulled up nearby HVAC companies with good reviews that could do duct replacement, and called for appointments for onsite inspections. Out of the four highly reviewed and reputable companies (minus individual contractors) in the Pelham area that actually showed up for their appointment, Autumn Air's rep Baker was the only one who showed up on time, actually visually inspected inside the ductwork even after I showed him the initial pictures I took, and then spent a solid amount of time explaining to me options for replacing the entire ductwork system so we could see about what would be right for our budget. In the end, the price that Autumn Air was able to provide for an upgrade to a new round smooth metal interior and outside insulated wrapped system, including new boots and registers, throughout the entire house, plus a new central AprilAire Space Guard filtration and iWave-R GPS ionization system upgrade (per my request) beat out the one other company who actually sent me a quote by almost half. Let me say that again differently...TWO of the four companies NEVER sent back a quote. This told me that two of the highly reputable companies in the Pelham area that have a high amount of favorable reviews simply did not want a job. Pitiful for them.\n\nFast forward to the install a week later...Led by two guys named Javy and Charles, they took care of making sure everything was treated with care when taking out the old ductwork so as to minimize spreading of dirt and mold as much as could be. Then, they proceeded to assemble and install all of the new system on site for custom fitting plus making sure all seams were taped properly and coated with mastic so that the chances of air leaks past the coils is forever kept at a minimum. They arrived early in the morning, and worked until the job was finished that evening (on the day of Harvey storms coming through too!).  Any questions I had concerning anything with the job was answered and explained with no hesitation on their part.  They went beyond expectations with accommodations and I just can't be any happier.\n\nI can't say it enough in this entire description here how great Autumn Air is for an HVAC company. They want someone's business in the best way because they give the work the best service they can at reasonable prices, and offer great financing options too if needed. They understand how to go the extra mile to make sure the customer is being taken care of in the end as well. I can say I have also had the pleasure of meeting Jeff, the owner, later when he came back to look at a minor issue that crept up post install, and he is just as awesome about discussing more than the \"here's what we'll do\". He takes the time to explain the why and how's (if you are interested to know and ask) and will work with you as a customer to do everything he can within reason to make sure you are satisfied with him and his company. Because of all of these things described about everyone at that company and how we were treated, we now not only have clean, sanitized fresh air, but the confidence to know it will stay that way due to the complete service and professionalism we got from Autumn Air.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMabAWy162GH96gyl3m37sUEbn3lZkhH_QMnw5p=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_X0ScvBCZDov4a77tJ8--jNZxa4SLKPRwf7ZQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2_SRCsbshQYMwunCW_Svt09o-TDruxZ8tozW8=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKpjJ6ZJSD3l76fC4DaZ5moDrfqENk5DrC3V5m=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVryaFeSx9Ipmsmn5UNXwMOBC9HZqnM-6Io7MO=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1593532681755, "text": "Thank you for sharing your review of our company!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888924e52224bd39:0x2e611205e661f050"}

I arm impressed with their work, knowledge, professionalism and honesty. Prices are most fair and they come out when they say they will come out.  Thanks to Corey, we now have AC again less than 36 hours after going down. Oh, and their preventive maintenance plan? Heck, you better jump  all over that, $10 a month auto draft to come out 4x yearly and clean and do PM check is unbeatable. Then when you join, no diagnostic charges when you  call them out, but wait, there's more ! You get a discount on all service  after you sign up !\nReally, $120 a year for the PM plan  ?? i thought he misquoted so I jumped on it but its for real ! Great service, great guy. You rock Corey !

The warranty on parts come from the manufacturer and we can get warranty parts on units installed by any Trane Dealer if we are the company that installs the parts.   We can not warranty another installing dealer's labor unless an extended labor warranty option was purchased through a warranty company that we are set up with.

Kevin left  me his personal cell phone number to call him back in the event my husband has any questions or needs help during the install.\n\nEverything from scheduling to finished work was amazing. Can't say enough good things about this company! Will definitely continue to use them for our rental house in the future.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1558626892738, "text": "Rochelle,\n\nThank you for your glowing review!

I have tried numerous times to get this problem corrected.  Technical support advised me that there were \"upgrades being made\" which I was later informed that was a lie and evidently used just to appease me.  I've since called back numerous times and left messages which are rarely returned.\nI actually had one lady transfer me around and when I kept getting transferred back to her she sent me right back to their internet help department which I had already spoken to thanks to numerous times for several hours total.  Their internet help department apologized and transferred me back to her and the phones had been switched off saying that they were closed.  After successfully giving me the runaround for nearly 30 minutes she was able to just switch the phone off and be on her merry way.   I left Century Link due to poor internet speed and piss poor customer service.  It appears Riviera isn't much better.  I understand things happen with technological items and speeds vary.  But to never get the speed I'm paying for and to constantly get the run around when trying to get the problem fixed is unacceptable.  If only Mediacom serviced my area.

Scheduled for the next day between 8:00-10:00 AM.  I stayed home from work to meet with the repair man.  Recieved a call shortly after 8:00 to inform me that due to an emergency it would be closer to 10:00 AM and maybe a \"tad\" after before he could get there.  This was fine with me.  10:40 AM had come and gone and nobody had showed up or contacted me.  I called 3D Air Services and all circuits were busy.  I left a message and number to call me back and how nobody has showed up or contacted me.  Never got a call back.  I had to go back to work and decided to call on my way at 12:28 PM.  I get in touch with someone, who asks who I am after explaining how nobody showed up or contacted me.  I hear \"oh yeah....the estimate....\".  She apologizes and explains that there was an emergency and they can have somebody out later that evening.  So after work close to 5:00 PM, the original repair man shows up to do the estimate.  I explain what is wrong with my unit and what I THINK might be going on.  He uses no equipment and only goes into the attic and outside to look at both units, with only pen and paper (NO TOOLS).  I believe he recorded the model information and that was it.  He then basically agrees with one on my suggested problems being that it could be the TXV valve on the inside unit.  He says he is \"95 - 100%\" sure that is what it is.  Used no equipment or tools to verify this would be the fix.  He then left and said he would give me a call this morning with an estimate.  It's now 12:30 PM.  No contact from them still.  Will never use this company.  UNPROFESSIONAL!\n\nEdit (After 3D Air responded):  It is really sad that this company is lying about calling me and leaving me a voicemail with a message on the estimate.  This is completely false!  There is only one number that they have from me.  They did not call.  And how gracious of you guys to not charge for a service call, when he literally just walked in the house with a pen and paper.  And was simply looked at the unit in the attic and the unit outside.  The unit upstairs has several phillips head screws for panels that are secured to the unit.  There is no way he could have diagnosed that is was a TXV valve with pen and paper.  I even offered a screwdriver for using on the unit up in the attic, to which he said he didn't need.  All this still doesn't take away from nobody every calling me back in the morning of the scheduled appointment to let me know that nobody was showing up.  Believe who you want.

We're SO excited.  We scheduled our regular maintenance with Valley.  Alex came out and did a thorough inspection.  The original system was over 30 years old, but we had some refurbishments done in 2007 (also by Valley).  The original system was shot.  Alex sat down with us and went over all the options.  Everything was thoroughly explained.  He really knew what he was talking about.  Lance & Kyler came the following day to do the installation.  EVERYTHING was done so professionally and quickly.  We have dogs and these guys worked with us to make sure everyone (including the dogs) was taken care of.  Since completion took a little longer than expected (having to wait for someone to do the inspection), Valley provided space heaters to use overnight.  Followup and coordination were outstanding!  We switched out an outdated heat pump with this new system.  We look forward to many years of efficiency with this new system.

Someone else called back and their answer was $65 for service charge plus $265 for swapping a fan motor that took all of 30 min the last time it went out. When I asked why so much they basically said because they have to pay shipping on parts and don't get paid back for that and that they have to purchase upfront and get reimbursed by the manufacturer. So, basically, they were charging me for the parts and shipping all in the \"labor price\" even though my warranty covers the parts. That came straight out of the horses mouth so definitely would not recommend for service if they didn't put your unit in. They'll rip you off, or try at least.

Luckily, we had a warranty through Old Republic, which paid for a replacement unit. Unfortunately, however, the company that Old Republic required us to use for installation was 5 Star Heating and Air Conditioning out of Foley, AL.\n\nOver the past year, we have experienced several issues with our new unit not cooling the house properly. About two months ago, we came home to soggy carpet and buckled wood floors due to the drain pipe for our unit overflowing. My father came by to take a look at the unit and noticed that the \"Safe-T-Switch float valve\", which cuts the unit off if the drain pipe clogs and fills up, was installed ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE UNIT, rendering it completely useless.\n\nWe called 5 Star and they did come out to the house and move the valve to the correct side without charging us, which we felt was the least they could do since their poor workmanship was the cause of this incident. Over the past few weeks, we noticed that our outside unit would randomly cut off during the day, making the house unbearable to be inside. We called 5 Star, and they let us know that it would be $100 to come out and take a look at it. At this point, I decided to call another company to come look at it rather than paying 5 Star.\n\nThe other Service Man came out and took a look at it and noticed that the inside of the pipe that the float valve was attached to was clogged with sealant, preventing the flow of water. (See attached photos) I'm no plumber, but I can tell you that when you put sealant inside the female coupling, and push the male part in, the sealant has nowhere to go but inside the pipe, which prevents the drain pipe from being able to drain water. He replaced the drain pipe, and put the float valve in the correct place, and amazingly, our A/C unit works like new!\n\nI will be sure to let everyone know how much money my \"no-cost warranty replacement\" A/C unit has cost me thanks to 5 Star's sub-par work.\n\nPhoto 1 - Crazy Straw like drain pipe from 5 Star\nPhoto 2 - Sealant inside pipe (photo taken after I punched a large portion of the sealant out of the pipe)\nPhoto 3 - New drain pipe installed by another {competent} A/C Repair company", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfTmZE3Bd42fClrv34oV45AuBHNZQe-gBb-dcw=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1534874112513, "text": "Dane, we are sorry to hear that you were not satisfied with our options for maintenance.

Originally, I was confident I chose the right HVAC company when I purchased a new packaged unit to replace the 30-year old unit when I purchased my new house. The salesman seemed to know his stuff and took time to come in and explain what they wanted to do. The only thing I did not agree with was putting an air return in the laundry room ... and I sill think that is a bad idea. It\u2019s a small room and has moisture from a \u201cwet\u201d area and wouldn\u2019t provide any benefit with the door closed. I asked for another solution and they said adding another run of flex under the house will help, so we did it. Overall I am happy with the packaged unit I bought. One end of their agreement that I have learned that they did not hold up was sealing my existing air ducts... however, with that background I can discuss why I wouldn\u2019t recommend this company. Recently , we noticed moisture issues (mildew/mold) in the house and humidity above 80% ( this is the first summer with the new unit; our first summer was with the older unit and did not have the issues I am about to outline) We decided to call Airnow to come look... I had to work the day of their visit and three airnow employees came to the house. They supposedly crawled under my house and said one thing I do agree with and was planning to do and now have scheduled but get a vapor barrier ( I am going further with total encapsulation) however, they told my wife ridiculous theories about underground rivers and blah blah blah ... no solutions.... the packaged unit I have should be removing a large amount of the humidity... the older unit was able to keep it lower..... well after I spoke to the original salesmen he said he thought my air ducts were leaky... and need replacing.... however during my original install and purchase that was never mentioned AND one of their guarantees is that they deal air ducts so why is it leaky if they held up their promise? I\u2019ll tell you why... that was rubbish and nothing was sealed...    after not hearing from the salesmen\u2019s who said he would call me back I finally called a general contractor I know for a recommendation of a new HVAC company... they came out and found that I had an air duct completely hanging out of the connection ... please see photo.... I took this as I crawled under my home with him and we FELT air just blowing on us... so how did these airnow professionals (one of which is the service manager) miss this? It was obvious to me and I have zero training in this area.... well it\u2019s been a week still no call ... and guess what, airnow is no longer my HVAC company and I absolutely do not recommend them. They are happy to do the \u201ceasy\u201d work and collect the $7200 or so I paid but once it\u2019s time to figure out an issue they haven\u2019t the slight-lest clue and only make up excuses such as underground rivers... do yourself a favor and really research a better company who will stand behind heir work because airnow might be saturating the market with ads but they certainly not the best company. Buyer beware.

I asked what was wrong and he informed me it was the capacitor.\nI asked if he already installed it , he said that he had so I replied what was the cost, he informed me that it would be $244.00 but he would go over things when he was done and it would save me some  money.  I also asked if he checked the pressure to make sure the unit had enough oil, he put the gauges on it and informed me it was 1/2 lb to 1 lb low on Freon. I asked if he was going to do anything about that and he said he would, I asked about the Freon in the system 2 times before he left. He had assured me he would take care of it. I went inside and a couple minutes later we were sitting on the couch talking about a monthly program with air now.\nWe went straight from service call to sales man. After the 30 min spill on the monthly program and the appointment for a new unit, I was given a bill for $344.00 .  So here is the the breakdown\n$99 to drive over, $245.00 for a $20 dollar part. Never was any Freon added to the system, and not one time was a temperature pulled from a register to see if the unit was cooling effectively.\nI guess the couch conversation was free?  More time was spent trying to get me to sign up on their monthly program and setting up an appointment for a new unit, than was spent showing any concern about the actual problem at hand.  I was told that the capacitor had a 1 year warranty and if it goes out in a year they will come out and fix it!   I\u2019m not even going to call Air Now in that event. My next call will be for a new unit to a different company.

I called around and chose AirNow to take a look. A few hours later, a well dressed, clean, young tech showed up. So, of course, I stereotyped him. I prepared to do the talking, teach him how to check my HVAC, be told I needed a whole new system. I mean, what experience can he have? Shouldn't he be sweaty and dirty from being in attics all day? I was proven WRONG immediately. He introduced himself as Bryce. Before I could let him in, Bryce had me laughing. Bryce was full of life, positive, personal, and genuinely happy to be there to help me. I voiced my long winded, end of the world, I'm going to die in this house complaints while he listened patiently and took a few notes. He assured me he had seen it all before and would figure it out. A short time later, Bryce sat down and went over my system in detail. It was me that was learning, asking questions, needing explanations. He was very intelligent, well spoken, funny, and honest. I asked him how in the world do you know all this, I mean you look 18 years old. He laughed and said that he was not 18 but thank you and that AirNow sends him to the best classes you can get. They provide extensive in house training, continuous OJT, and unlimited access to the best co workers/peers in the business. He said AirNow was his second home and family. He said that he knows that he and AirNow are only as good as their customers say they are.\nI didn't know what to say. He went right back to discussing my system. He suggested that I needed an updated thermostat because mine was very old and causing some of my issues. The other issues, he had already taken care of. I got the new thermostat, and he was right. It is wonderful. I also signed up for their service plan. I couldn't believe how affordable all of this was too. I've paid more in the past just for a service call and a capacitor replacement. Like clockwork now, AirNow and Bryce show up, check/service my system, help me prevent issues and have a visit. I've recommended many people to AirNow and I hear the same story from all of them.

However they will use scare tactics to try and get you to replace your system. When the service tech arrived at my residence he seemed very nice. He hooked his gauges to my unit and quickly diagnosed the problem. My outside coil had a leak and he showed it to me. Advised me that it was going to cost as much to repair my old unit as it would cost to replace the whole system. He also tried scaring me into believing that in January 2020 that it will be illegal to recharge my unit with freon. Thank goodness we still have plenty of cool weather left so I had time to think about this and do research. I ended up getting a second opinion from a competitor and found out I can get a replacement condenser coil for $400.00, $300.00 labor and $450.00 in freon. That's about 1/6th the cost of a replacement. Is it worth fixing? Maybe, maybe not... But I want to make that decision and not be influenced by scare tactics. I understand it's the slow season and sometimes you have to do what you have to do to make a sale but at least remain ethical in how you conduct your business. And the tech was half right about the freon becoming illegal in January 2020. It will no longer be produced and imported but it will still be legal to recharge old systems with the remaining stock pile and recovered refrigerant. And to add icing to the cake, I had a coupon for a waived service call fee (*with repair) now I didn't see the \"*with repair\" small print until the tech pointed out out to me and that's fine, completely my fault. But what got me is when the tech had to call his boss to see how to proceed with the coupon. While trying to get his phone to connect he looked at me and said... \"I normally wouldn't call in like this and would just give you the coupon without question... Sometimes I come across people I like and I'll hook them up on the service fee\" So thanks for admitting to the customer you don't like them.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1551470166336, "text": "Thank you for taking our call to discuss your concerns directly.

Our home owners warranty had effectively done nothing for us over a 6 week period, compounded by another air conditioning company attempting to do as little as possible to help us.  So, after firing them (and canceling our HWA contract), I visited Air Now on a Monday afternoon at the end of my wits.  Within two hours, Randy and Adam were at our house assuring us that they could help us.\n\nBy Thursday of that same week (just 3 days later), the Air Now staff had replaced our outside unit, furnace, and all the duct work in our home.  The service performed by Jim, Bill, and Zach was exemplary.  Matter of fact, we had initially only planned on replacing the unit outside and the furnace, until Bill noticed a high level of black mold in our duct work and his advice helped us to replace all the duct work AND install a Reme Halo Air Purifier.\n\nOur home has never felt cooler, the air has never been cleaner, and with the warranties that came with our purchases we won't have to worry about these for years.  Thank you Air Now, your customer service practices put to shame the previous air conditioning company we were dealing with, and home owners warranty we had, and we are very grateful for you.  ~ Rev TJ and Michelle Conwell", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e84cb8d84fad7:0x3d6fcc3d52d6bec9"}

AirNow sent Taylor who arrived after 11:00 p.m. Completing the check and finding multiple leaks took over 1-1/2 hours. He told us he'd call the next morning with a name and time for a sales person the next day. He called early and as promised, Matthew came early (arriving around 1:00 in the afternoon). Matthew found a solution for us but the install couldn't begin until Wednesday. He arranged for a temporay air conditioner to be installed and called back to check later. Taylor and another technician arrived around 7:00 p.m. and had the temp installed by 8:30. This entire team has been amazing, professional and truly committed to doing a great job.....giving up their holiday weekend to take care of multiple customers. Thanks AirNow for your committment to your customers and taking care of such a great team of employees. One of the unfortunate surprises as we have to have a whole new system, but Taylor, Matthew and the team are the best support we've ever!\n\nSuperior System Installation\n\nThe installation team arrived shortly after 8:00 in the morning and promptly got to work removing the old ductwork and equipment. Since Ken mentioned we needed more airflow into the house, the team increased the size of the return air vent at no extra charge. They unhooked the temporary air conditioner and worked all day to insulate and install the metal ductwork. AirNow owners, Terry and Stacy stopped by to check on the progress. The team is extremely professional and it was very obvious they know their job and take tremendous pride in their work. They cleaned up quickly and efficiently. They explained the system to us and reminded us to call them if there were questions about anything. The air conditioner had the house cool by 5:00 that afternoon which was wonderful. The entire experience with AirNow has been a great experience, from their experienced technician, Taylor, who evaluated the problem late at night; Matthew, who advised us on the best solution; Taylor and Ken who installed the temporary a/c; to the entire team of installers who were so professional.
