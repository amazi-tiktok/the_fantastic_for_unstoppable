The property is full of spiders. One or two spiders is expected for an outside unit BUT 10+ spiders inside unit is unacceptable for a unit I've only had a couple of months. That shows lack of pest control or even Raid! I have spoken with several employees, multiple times, at this location about pest issue and requested for their DM  (Nathan) to call me which as yet to happen even though they noted in my file several times for him to call me. I've been complaining for weeks. They have also decided to increase the storage rental an extra $22 ( I've only had the unit 6 months and according to the fine print, they can increase every 6 months if they choose to). Employees have openly complained to me about management and company and how they hate working for Public Storage (I have the recordings). Unethical and poor company values. If i was not out of state on a job assignment, i would've moved my property months ago! The ONE star is for the employees who work onsite because they all were helpful even though they have no control or say over any issue. And I wonder if they are offered the people below me some type of incentive for a \"5 star\" review?!? More than likely. Save yourself and your property the stress/insects, and CHOOSE ANOTHER STORAGE COMPANY! ~~~Update~~~ Nathan, DM, finally decided to call me. Ironically. He informed me that they have Orkin pest control which comes monthly and that maybe the location of my unit is why I have a MAJOR spider issue. He refused to provide me w/ a date of last service from Orkin. According to him, it would be too much of an hassle to go through the paperwork to find invoice. Really?!? His advice is that i consider moving allllll my property to a different unit which isn't near trees. Really?!?! Sooooo, after some prompt investigation and people I know, I have a invoice showing where Orkin last serviced the property in Sept. 2015 and this review was written on July 2016.... ALMOST A YEAR AGO SINCE THEY HAD ANY PEST CONTROL SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Go figure, huh?", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891ec22431fc29:0x1d63d592c911fe8f"}

My grandson graduated high school and was offered a full scholarship at Auburn University. As an average family we made the decision to rent my home and I would move in with my daughter and assist with getting him through college. So I packed up my most precious belongings and searched for a climate controlled unit for myself. The staff were most helpful and assisted me in getting an end unit so that I could get to my things easily if needed. Being a single woman and trusting your entire life being put into storage can be so stressful. However Ashley has been great, her kind words and helpful attitude have made me feel comfortable about leaving my life of independence and helping to write a new chapter in life for my grandson. I certainly hope that IStorage knows what a wonderful employee they have in Ashley. I would not hesitate to recommend this facility to anyone for their storage needs.

The explanation given by the customer service representative Nyrie was, \"We try to tell people not to leave food in their unit. It probably came from another unit.\" Today I went in to close out my account and was told that although I was closing my account out today December 5, 2017 I would be charged until the end of the month. Originally I was told that the amount would be prorated however was later told that they no longer prorate because their competitors do not prorate. I followed up with the district manager Jennifer Sanders and was told that unless I kept my personal lock on the unit they would rent the unit out to someone else although I was charged for the remainder of december, which I must say I find inappropriate.

The previous day on the 1st I spoke to the manager on-site.  She was very nice and very customer service friendly.  I spoke about vacating my space so I wouldn\u2019t be charged for another month.  It didn\u2019t seem like a problem, she mentioned coming to get her when I was  finished, and I even made mention that I may not be done that day.  I was told no problem.  I came to the office on the 2nd at 10:00 am, let her know I was out, it swept clean and empty.  I then at that time asked if the auto-debit would still go through on my account as has been done religiously for 2 years, she said yes but that the pro-rates refund amount would be returned in approximately 5-7 days.  Today is a week and a half later, I tried to contact the site, spoke with an extremely rude customer service rep (NOT the on-site staff for clarification), and after with the District Manager Jordan. I was informed that I would not be receiving any money back as the rent is month to month and nothing would be done-however when I moved in I was pro-rated for days then? That it was policy....I fully understand that, I deal with policy every day-I am also have a responsibility to act fairly and not hide beyond policy and take care of my customers.  When I asked specifically (and while in the office ON THE 1st) when I would receive the difference back-that would have been the time to be upfront, transparent and honest about the truth about the intent to not refund the remaining days on my unit.  If I would have not been told a refund was coming I would have stayed the month-and not called regarding my pro-rated refund.  If that wasn\u2019t what I was told why would I be calling? Bottom line here, I moved up the street to Extra Space Storage, rented the same size unit for $18/month.  I was paying Public Storage $89 after 3 increases over 6 mos.  for the same size unit.  At this day in age a simple apology for the miscommunication and an effort to reimburse me something would have been appreciated and seen as compromise, the lack of an attempt to make it right is unacceptable to me.  It\u2019s not the $89 at this point it\u2019s the principal of managing my expectations as a consumer.  Please go up the street to Extra Space Storage, who were very decent about not wanting to steal their customer by the way, business is business.  The pro-rated refund would have been easier at this point instead of a negative google review and friends that also rent there and now will know to relocate.  Hope it was worth it, I do plan to make further calls.  At this point I do want my money over the principal of standing up for myself and what is right.  By the way, I work for a large property management company in town and in 2 other states that I travel, we were using Public Storage on our marketing material for new move-ins to our apartments and giving them this location in just Birmingham.  That will be changing.  Hiding beyond policy is one thing, refusing to see your company miscommunicated and screwed up is another.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888922751385a587:0x11a09201c8c5123b"}

Yes, most places do that, however, Christy didn't just try and throw specials at me, or get me to spend more money just to have extra space.

While I am a college student I wanted a place to store my items to make my appartment a happy livable space. Today I went to store 8477 and met a very lovely associate named April Goodman and while  I was there she treated me not only as a customer, but it welt like during the our time felt like family. When I asked to see the 5' by 7' we looked at the unit and it was not something i was looking for. However when she suggested a 5' by 15' we needed to walk to the very far building on the property to view the unit. Ms. April recommended the golf cart. I told her we did not need to use it since it is a beautiful day out and it would be a nice walk to get exercise. As walking down I told her I might not like the 15' size and asked about the 5' by 8' and that it was the last one available and that we needed to walk back to the main building to see it. As we were walking to the last building she asked if I still wanted to see the 15 footer and I asked her please. When we walked back to the 5 by 8 room I walked in it and i felt in love with the space that it had its own light and also own air vent. I told her it was sold and we went back to the office and did all the paper work and I am now renting a air controlled 5' by 8' and so far I love it. As I was loading my unit an hour ago I loaded a car load in the unit then walked to the office to ask a question. As I opened the door to the office I was looking into the office smiling and as I was walking in Ms. April's office phone rang and Ms. Lechelle in the desk right next to her asked me how can i help you. As I was walking in I did not notice Ms. Lechelle asking me that question. So as I continued walking into the office Ms. Lechelle rudely asked me how may I help you. I asked my question and left the office not happy with the tone she was talking to me in as a paying customer. I do not appresiate that at all. Next time I go to the office to get help I will only make sure that I only ask miss april for help no matter if there are 2 people in the office or if she is off I will only work with her. Overall I love the facility and I would gladly recommend it to my friends and family if they ever need any storage rooms.

The security is also excellent including daily checks of each unit by the management. Automated billing is offered and works well. A worry free experience. You can tell a lot about a place during the move-in and move-out processes. This place is the best. I also learned that the humidity in the Madison Alabama area is not good for cardboard boxes. Stacked cardboard boxes began to fail over time. I do recommend the tough storage tote bins from Home Depot. They hold up well and can be stacked to the ceiling. You can seal the tote bins with Ty-wraps and large moving companies will take them without an issue. The plastic tote bins also do well if it decides to rain on moving day like it did on mine. Of course, I always recommend being a good steward of the rental space keeping it clean and reporting any issues (none for me). Although not required, I always set aside a broom and dust pan and sweep out the unit to leave it as I found it or better.

On both days I checked my account balance. It was $0.00.\nSix days later I received a text message advising me to pay my bill to avoid late fees. I logon the SAME day to make my payment and see that I've ALREADY been charged a late fee. In other words, they give you five days out of 30 during which to pay your bill without avoiding a late fee.\n\nOh, also, apparently there's a door in the back that always remains open and unlocked next to a fence that's about 3 feet high so all of their security systems either don't work when they should or do work when the shouldn't.\n- the exit gate that has worked 2 weeks out of 4 months I've been there\n- I've been given 4 gate codes which have been turned off without warning or notification\n- There's no CERTAIN number of days during which the property manager is required to remove the lockout on your storage unit if you don't pay your bill within those 5 days. It certainly ISN'T the SAME or NEXT day which would be the case if there were an attendant. But then if there were an attendant that back door probably wouldn't remain open and unlocked.\n\nThe first night I got there I will admit the customer service agent was pretty helpful getting me into the unit since neither the gate code I was given or the building code worked for me. They were able to get me inside after a couple calls and they were nice enough so kudos for that.\n\nI think this is the only company I've ever had to deal with that doesn't send you a bill before they send you a late charge. Red Dot conveniently reminds you of your monthly payment...the same day they charge you the late fee. I've never received an invoice or payment reminder prior to the late notice which I receive via text message and email.\n\nI've also received text messages telling me when the gate will be closed for holidays and stuff. The message I'm getting is they want you to know when you can't get to your stuff and they want you to know once they've charged you a late fee but don't want to notify you when your bill should be paid on time. No worries, I've set a reminder of my own so sorry, you'll have to do without the extra $10 you've been accustomed to receiving.\n\nThe exit gate has been broken for almost 2 months. For a while it would still open automatically when you drove up to it but it could still be pulled or pushed open from either side. Now there's just a big chain around it. They could probably have had it repaired for the amount they've charged me in late fees but they're probably too busy slapping red pad locks on units they've yet to send out a late notice on.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb4b797cd74c5:0x6014f12e5009bb8f"}

I confirmed my lease was ended twice with a public storage employee and that I did not need to do anything else, I was payed up, and they proceeded to pass off my \"bill\" for another month to a debt collector. Lower management was initially helpful and confirmed that I did indeed vacate long before they said I did, and he was going to fix the issue, but then he saw it had gone to collections and there was nothing he could do with that. So he gave me the contact information for management out of Birmingham, and they never returned my calls. She answered once and the call dropped or something? And I could never get her to answer again. My fiance and I used their advertised discounts on our first two months, and ended the lease before the outrageous increase on rent the third month. We couldn't afford their regular rates. What I do know is that the company did yet again refuse to correct their mistake when I refuted the charge with the debt collector. My next step will be to pursue legal action if I can. Hopefully I do have enough proof that I did reach out and end my lease. They have hurt my credit and charged me for a space that I cancelled. Their discounts in the beginning are nice, but they will absolutely charge you for whatever they decide to. When you cancel your lease, they might simply just have \"forgotten to write it down\" and then refuse to fix it. I wish I could press charges.
