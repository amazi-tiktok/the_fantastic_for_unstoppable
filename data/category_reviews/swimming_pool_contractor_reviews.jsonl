His sons Zachary, Miles and Cole play a major part in this well oiled machine as they each have a part in most every install.

I am in the kitchen most times that he comes and have watched him. He does every single thing you have paid for regardless if it needs to be done or if he could easily skip that step without you knowing.  He does all of it...every single time he comes. I never question if he has been at the house to clean the pool. And he always takes pictures of the pool after servicing and sends them to you through email.\n\nI have had other pool companies where I have questioned did they really do anything...for several months. I kept missing them when they were here. I finally was home and saw the guy literally walk in the back yard ...toss in a chlorine tab in the skimmer basket..come to my front door and leave the card stating he has been here and did this and that...which he had done none of. He didn\u2019t even empty the skimmer basket. Upon calling the owner ...he gave the excuse of \u201c Well, he\u2019s a big guy and doesn\u2019t like to get down on his knees\u201d.

I suspect the original quote he gave me of 900$ was too low ( I usually pay 1,200$) for him to complete the contract. I did not ask for the check to be sent back, or for it to be cancelled, so he voided a contract illegally. After I APOLOGIZED to him for asking for my services to be rendered, even once again offering my condolences for his loss, I assumed his erratic behavior was because of this, Brad still snubbed me, telling me we didn't communicate well.

Well, pool might be a bit of stretch to describe what in fact appeared to be in the process of becoming a protected wetland. The pool, like the house, was in a state that was the result of years upon years of deferred maintenance. I called several companies with ASP being among the first. And before I continue, let me say that many of these companies won't even call you back, answer their phones or come out for visits like they say so ASP is ahead of the curve just for that reason alone. Brad was exceptionally busy with it being the beginning of the pool season, which he told me right off, and that he would try to get over to the house to inspect the pool. The price I was told it might take to get the pool in a usable state took my breath away! But I wasn't too surprised by it. He stated several times that it could be a little more or much less depending on what was found beneath the cover and behind walls. He was sure to prepare me for the worst. However, after that initial few calls and the visit, I didn't hear back from them. This wasn't a major problem because there was roofing and foundation issues to tend to before swimming could even be considered. Why would you need a backyard water feature when the roof itself was becoming one all by itself? Being that I needed someone to get out to do it fairly quickly once it came time address it, I called another company and they gave me a lower quote and could get started fairly quickly. Well, that went bust because we required a contractor with insurance, just in case of a problem. This guy didn't have it and didn't tell us until AFTER he was supposed to show up to do the job. I called and then he lets me know all that. ABSOLUTELY UNPROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR that seems to be the hallmark of many service businesses like that these days. I was ready to just put the pool stuff off for awhile until I could find someone trustworthy until Brad calls out-of-the-blue! Just in time!! I was glad because, honestly, I really wanted to work with them from the start due to the good reviews on Google. Not only have they performed all the work needed so far, they did it for WELL under what they told me initially. It seems they prefer to brace you for the worst rather than underestimate costs just to get the job. We have a few more issues to address with the pool, again from the previous owners, that I'm sure Brad will help us iron out. These people have been tremendous and I can't say enough good things about them. They do what they say they're going to do, are available anytime just about and HONEST. I will only call ASP for any of my pool needs. Save yourself some frustration, money and anxiety--CALL ANGIE AND BRAD AT ASP!!!!!!

I have a 12,000 gallon KOI pond that is 4 ft. deep and has 2 large bottom drains and a skimmer that feed a filter system much like that of a swimming pool except the media in the filter is plastic beads instead of sand.  It pumps 9,000 gallons of water through the system an hour and runs 24 hours a day.  The water after passing through the filter returns over a waterfall back into the pond.  There are 2 large river birch trees that overhang the pond and the shed a lot of leaves and small twigs into the pond.  Over time I had an accumulation on the bottom of the pond and the drain pipes running under the pond had stopped up and after a routine backwash of the pond the pump lost its prime and I was unable to restart it.  I got the bright idea that since it was similar to a swimming pool to call a swimming pool maintenance company for help.  I looked on the internet and found and called ASP.  Brad answered the phone and when I described my problem he said he could help and he could come 2 days later.  When I explained that I had 60 large KOI fish that required the water flow to keep the water oxygenated he said he was leaving for an appointment and would come as soon as he finished.  He worked on my problem the rest of the day and returned the next morning and got everything working great.  He also altered the plumbing to give me the ability to blow out trash in the drain line.  He found a problem with the multiport valve which we decided needed replacing and added a shut off valve on the waste line to solve the problem until I could get a replacement.  He was great to work with and communicated his findings and suggestions well and his pricing was very reasonable.

I still walk out my back patio or look out the window and I still almost can't believe how nice it is!  My back yard looks like it belongs in a resort!  I had been in contact with another local pool company who came out twice to give me a \"quote.\"  Neither time did they give me an exact price.  It was always a ball park figure.  With a project of this magnitude, I need real numbers!  Also, this contractor was adamant that I did NOT want a salt water pool which goes against EVERYTHING that I've heard from anyone has experience with pools.  All you ever hear is that salt water pools was the way to go.  So, I thought that maybe he was just being really honest, so I believed him.  But his lack of real numbers and honestly his lack of enthusiasm caused me to shop around for another quote.  I spoke with Ronnie from Valley Pools that same afternoon and he gave me more information over the phone that the other pool guy had in two trips to my house!  I had told him that I was thinking about not going to a salt water pool based on what another pool contractor had told me.  Keep in mind, I didn't tell him who I had spoken to.  As soon as I said those words, Ronnie said \"That wasn't such and such pool company was it?\"  He was dead on!  He knew all about them and I wasn't the first to tell him this.  He explained to me that they this particular pool company hated salt water pools and didn't know how to properly maintain them and that they would rather have you buying chemicals from them.  Ronnie changed my mind on the spot!\n\nOnce Ronnie was actually able to come out and see my back yard, he was straight and to the point.  My yard had a significant hill that sloped upwards which would require a lot of excavation and then required a retaining wall.  He said that he welcomed the challenge and began laying out his vision for how the retaining wall would look.  He recommended that instead of squaring it off around the pool that we curve the wall around it in a half moon shape!  It's awesome!  I was so excited about all of the possibilities that I was ready to go right then!  And on the spot, he gave me an exact price and we signed the contract right then and there!\n\nHe tells you upfront to allow 4-8 weeks for completion.  We obviously were shooting for the 4 week mark.  But things happen.  Ours was completed in 6 weeks.  We were really hoping to have it completed for our daughters' birthday party.  I told Ronnie about the party and he made sure it got done!  It took all the way until the day before the party, but we had a pool party that next day!  I had daily phone calls with Ronnie on the schedule and what would be happening that day and the next and so on.  I can honestly say that although we would have liked it to have been completed a little sooner, he made our hard deadline!  But, it's easy to be impatient when building a pool.  There's a lot of excitement involved!  I have already recommended Valley Pools to all of my coworkers and friends interested in getting a pool.

When asked why they poured it in the rain in the first place, the response was because they were behind in their work and had other pools to start. We have been promised for over 6 months they would repair the pitting and cracks not only in the cement but in the border around the pool which has started to crumble into the pool itself. I do realize they did give us a textured concrete at no cost to hide all the pitting and holes we were left with, and do appreciate that but the pitting has returned and mud is coming up from underneath the cement through the holes.  We have documented over dozens of calls and voice mails always to receive \"we will come out\" or \"oh we will stop by next week\" or \"you didn't verify that we could come\" after we asked dozens of times for someone to come out. I have finally had to resort to legal counsel from an attorney and will have to proceed in court. When I phoned Mr. Ryan last year with a problem before the pool was actually finished he replied saying \"I have over 200 phone calls weekly, I can't get to every one of them, lady what do  you want me to do?\"  This is an example of the worst customer service ever, I spent $41,000 on an L shaped 35,000+ gallon pool, with them and I am treated as if I am unreasonable because I need some repairs done while under my 1 year warranty. I really hope they are not trying to forfeit my warranty by putting me off so that the warranty will expire and they will not have to do the repairs.. I will not recommend them to anyone at this time. I am sorry it has resorted to legal counsel and bad reviews but my husband and I have reached our limit of no help.\nKaren Wright - unhappy in Duncanville", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c299df652325b:0x7118d2167e96ecf9"}

We chose to go with the True L shape 18x36x42 as it provides plenty of room for guests with younger children and then a separate deep end for the older kids and adults. The design we chose also has a tanning ledge with bubbler. It's 14 inches deep which kind of negates the tanning functionality without the addition of some specially design pool loungers that won't harm the vinyl liner.\n\nI had already received 3 quotes prior to calling Mr. Pool (Ryan) There's one particular company that I will not name here that I was particularly concerned about the finished concrete work on the pool deck. I have a neighbor who has had several issues with his pool deck. The company gave them a free deck coating which is peeling 3 years later. On yet another pool that company just installed in September they also had to put down a coating to try and cover up their poor workmanship. Mr. Pool was out bid by this company on both of these pool builds.\n\nWhen Ryan came to our home I was immediately impressed when we began our walk through around the backyard for the layout of the pool. He immediately picked up on our house having a septic system and marked the field lines just by sight. (I had not put the Winter low cut on the yard at the time) We walked around marking the yard for the pool. By this point in the bidding process I knew some more pertinent questions to ask. (I was ill informed by 2 of the prior bids about anything the pool would have and upgrade options available).  I knew I wanted to have 2in plumbing which wasn't the other companies standards and I wanted a 3hp pump and possibly even a variable speed pump to save money on electrical costs.\n\nI asked Ryan what size his plumbing would be. He stated he uses 2in plumbing. The other companies stated they use 1.5\" plumbing. I asked Ryan what HP pump and he stated a 3HP. The others stated 1.5HP.\nI asked how many returns would be used which he replied there would be 8 due to the size of the pool. The other companies were going to be installing 3-4.  I was very pleased to hear these responses and we went inside to put everything on paper and figure out the rough draft of the concrete pool deck.\n\nHe drew it out and we agreed on the layout pending the septic system layout I'd have to pull from the health department. I mentioned as he began to write the quote out that I may be interested in the variable speed pump if it saves on energy costs. He stated it definitely does and that we'd only see an increase of $30-$50 a month by going with VS pump. He quoted me with automation included.\n\nDuring the build just before the concrete was to be poured I noticed a spot that I just really felt I'd like to have concrete instead of the way we originally had it. I contacted Ryan and he informed me what the added cost would be which was very reasonable for what needed to be done.\n\nThe concrete job is nearly perfect and I say that because concrete really is never perfect. The finished product delivered is far above what I have seen of others. He also takes extra steps in the preparation to ensure years of even concrete with little chance of settling or cracking.\n\nThe crews during each stage are knowledgeable and friendly with us sharing in some laughs often.\n\nI recommend the upgrades in automation and your pump. Swing for the ability to run your pool from your phone as it'll save you time from running to and from the panel and if you have a waterfall and or a LED bubbler it will remove the risk of causing problems (expense) by not opening or closing the proper valves in the right sequence.\n\nIf I were to ever need another pool installed I'd call one company and save myself time and money. That company would be Mr. Pool.\n\nI hope that you will choose them as I did,  I'm confident you'll receive the same great product and service I did.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c299df652325b:0x7118d2167e96ecf9"}

They brought in dirt at least four feet of dirt to surround the pool, so now we can see our neighbors walking around their pool from their knees up. You can see from the picture how much dirt is up against our 6-foot fence. I brought this issue to the company's attention before the concrete was poured  and requested they fix.

Maybe it\u2019s just my attention to detail, but those details are important to me. Like making sure the screws on my filter assembly on my pump are screwed down all the way so it\u2019s not sucking in air, cross threading the drain on my sand filter and when I tell people at the store about it it takes them two weeks to finally replace it and fix it, when they opened up my pool for the first time this year and started the pump they opened up a access panel on the electric motor side and left it open and didn\u2019t tell me about it leaving it accessible to rain and debris. Two weeks ago I had to replace my pump, just a coincidence. I don\u2019t think so.

In beginning, the staff were extremely polite, courteous , knowledgeable  and pleasant to interact with. We picked out the pattern we wanted, and paid 50% of the total cost, to cover the  price of manufacturing the liner which, was very reasonable indeed. Steve came out in late December, to take the measurements of the pool, to pass onto the liner manufacturer. We then agreed to call Anders Pool, early March, to set a date to install the liner. I called Anders Pool, March 9th, and spoke with Steve, and set the date to install the new liner on Wednesday, March 27th. Steve touched base with me, a few days before the install date, to make sure we were good to go. Chris and two other staff, arrived early Wednesday, and drained the pool with a gas pump. They removed the old liner, thoroughly, and I mean thoroughly, cleaned, the pool walls and floors, smoothed over the pool floor and installed the new liner without any issues at all. Then, they set up a vacuum pump and a set a vacuum hose between the pool wall and the pool liner, to suck the trapped air out as we filled the pool from the faucet. The Anders pool liner installers, were extremely Professional and polite throughout the entire operation. They did a fantastic job, far, far, better than their local competition, that I'd used for the two previous liners, over the past 30 years. This liner fits snuggly up against the 4 ft. radius walls of the pool. Anders Pool, took the time, to accurately measure the pools dimensions. The previous pool company, when measuring up, rounded down the measurements, to get an even number. Which, resulted in a poor fitting liner. If you need a new pool liner, make sure you get a quote from Anders Pool Company. Trust me, they'll get you the best price and, the best quality liner, and the best possible installation. This company is well worth my 5 star rating.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b9030e73f55:0x77c49d0f0e266ebe"}

I\u2019ve also been told that the tiles, grout and adhesive used for the job are incorrect for this size/shape/type of pool, which is something that SPS vehemently argues against - I\u2019ll attach some pictures of the current state of our pool so that you can be the judge for yourself.\n\nThe Manager (Dave) AND Owner (Glenn) will act as if they\u2019re trying to help, but it\u2019s seemingly just an act to keep things looking positive online (look here and at the BBB for examples). In conversations they remain friendly/polite, but will only offer to continue doing the very things that have led to us now having a damaged pool. I fully anticipate that the owner will follow up on all reviews acting as if they\u2019ve tried to make things right, just as he seemingly does on all negative reviews, but their idea of making things right is continuing to do things incorrectly - \u2018the customer is always wrong\u2019, seems to be their approach to customer service. No thanks.\n\nUnfortunately there\u2019s a max character count for reviews, so I can\u2019t share everything - though I will be elsewhere.\n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t allow these guys to put a bag of salt in my pool going forward.\n\nUpdate based on owner's claims:\n- The response, as expected, is full of misleading statements in an attempt to come across more helpful than is actually the case.\n- I turned them away ONCE, not several times. I turned them away because they refused to proceed with repairs without 100% draining my pool and indicated that properly bracing it was out of the question.\n- Notice he's not mentioning the 'remedy' that they proposed? Because they didn't propose a remedy. They said they would 100% drain my pool, and would not brace it - which is actually the opposite of a remedy.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWFp0EfHj0oSG3ApdvzMCI-80MWmgJqno06aEE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4tjuqvHvrZEA5bY-MTV8G8oir5Z0Iv8cYzC8K=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOokYi54tLnNqMDkPCSmSNJeG9E7ld1w77GtA2R=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_9RUO7otQifznO9h9uUp-qHfdspKF1zWj_yZP=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRB_x9TPBN3U87jCmN-8mL89RSnax0kerjyxbl=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpjtsEvUANahj3v54DKdWZNW6A4o7RaMjPINIw=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeiwPiGcL3HpVwZB2Ivtop56JpIE9fTggW-e4y=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSN89--TjXMUceMLKEvQc0Y-iKMm5BBho0Sa7d=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPI-zJ2OcILKZGHMe4cqdKmz1M438l2gTyJSJBH=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1544041452230, "text": "Matt, I am sorry that you feel this way and felt it necessary to resort to social media!

Our dosages given are all based on information that is supplied by our customers unless we send a Technician out to the pool to measure and get accurate volumns. My staff in an effort to help after getting the proper size of your pool did in fact give you chemicals at no charge to treat. My understanding is that you wanted a continuing supply of chemicals at no charge.

When we called to complain, we were told it's hard finding good help. In Oct 2012, we bought a hot tub from them. In Oct 2016, the hot tub quit running. When the repairman came out, he said we needed to buy a new pump. After waiting a few days for SPS to give us an estimate on a new pump, my wife called the maker of the hot tub, Shoreline Dynasty Spa, and got an estimate from them. We decided to try to fix it ourselves and took the pump to Alabama Pump and Supply who fixed it for much less. We then reinstalled it. After reinstalling the pump, we decided to move the spa a few feet and called SPS and were told Glen would call us back shortly as he was on a job. I waited until 2 PM. When I called back, I was told they wouldn't be able to help us until sometime the next week. TIME TO MOVE ON. We had experienced poor service many times over the years, but weren't sure who to use.

We paid for it months before it was installed -- keep this fun fact in the back of your mind -- and seemed super easy and hassle free. Walked in the store, told the salesman we were looking for the largest above ground pool we could get that would be about 5 feet deep. He was super helpful, because we also admitted we knew nothing about the specifics, dimensions, or details; just what we wanted. We ordered and paid for a 27 foot round, 52 in walled, extended liner package.  We were also, originally,  getting a hot tub.  However 2 months after the purchase we found out we were having a baby, so we opted out of the hot tub, and stayed with just the pool.  3 months after that, pool installers brought the pool and did their thing.  My wife was concerned when they finished because the over lap liner was 6 inches from the ground in places, but they convinced  her that was what an overlap liner was supposed to look like. It took her about 3 weeks to actually get in the pool (when it was finally warm enough) and then she just cried. It was 3 and a half feet deep at its highest point. She drove her very large, pregnant self down to johnson pools and spoke with the original salesman.  He very shortly told her they have no affiliation with the installers, and there was nothing Johnson Pools could do to make it right, because it wasn't their fault.   Wife said her blood pressure got so high she thought she was going to have the baby at their store. Fast forward to the end of the first summer -- when we ordered a winter cover (obviously from a different place, the last time to step foot in the showroom she almost birthed a baby on their floor and swore them off for good)  we learned it was a 24' pool. \ud83d\ude32. Now, here we are, over a decade later, ready to replace the liner and find out THE WALLS ARE 48 inches tall. How much did we over pay for what we have?!! I'm still disgusted with the whole thing,  and have gotten in the pool MAYBE 5 times in 10 years.  My wife says every year we open the pool and the kids are taller she just gets angry all over again.

I contacted her again and stressed we were having a Birthday party and needed the pool up and running. She promised to get back to me. I called her two days later... She isn\u2019t there has gone on a mission with her parents. So I start all over with someone else. He calls me back! It gets delivered early! Yeah we are going to have time to get it up and running and won\u2019t have to have go with plan B for the birthday girl. The installers are great guys and get the new liner installed! Yeah!! They leave and we start filling! It now Saturday and we have lost two months of Pool time! We go get salt to get this thing going... Monday I call her back and let her know we are looking good and ask about the chemicals and the expense. I explained we had already gotten salt. No worries she says, bring in a sample we will get you what you need and give you credit. Ok that seems fair. I take a sample down, they give me algaecide and other chemicals, When I go to check out hey have to get her since I should be credited.  She has the cashier comp the stuff, I ask her what about the salt I have already purchased? She says she will give us store credit for the qty we bought. Ok that works for me!  Fast forward to last week. I go to the shop and get algaecide and shock to get the pool up and running for the year. I explained I should have a credit and the tech finds my account so he goes to talk to her... a few minutes later they come back. She bellows at me \u201cYou don\u2019t have any credit with us!
