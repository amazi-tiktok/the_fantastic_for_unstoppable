We had a tough time this past weekend, but the people at Platinum made it the best it could\u2019ve been! First off, our Taxi no showed us, and there were no Lyft drivers available, so I desperately called the FBO for help finding a taxi. They didn\u2019t send a taxi, they came and picked us up in their courtesy car! Then we burned up a starter in our Baron, so they let us borrow the courtesy car while we waited for rescue, and also gave the kids crayons and coloring books to keep them entertained while we waited! They even tried to find us a mechanic, but we didn\u2019t get that lucky on a Sunday! So, on top of their great fuel prices and normal stuff they do a great job of, they went the extra mile, and then another mile, to make our crappy day a lot less crappy!
