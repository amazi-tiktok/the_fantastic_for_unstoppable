I'll look at it when I come back\". I agreed and we hung up. So I went on Saturday around 1130 am (the man said they opened at 10 am) and the lights were off and door was locked. So I called a few times with no answer. Fast forward to the following Tuesday (I worked from home that day) I went to the store to drop it off....it was about 2 PM. The door was locked and lights were on. Another lady (probably in her 70s) was standing there with me and we were discussing the fact the door was locked and why. So I put my face to the glass and saw someone so I knocked. A young man came to the door and mouthed something about an errand (we couldn't hear him thru the glass). After a few times of yelling \"WHAT, WE CANT HEAR YOU\" I yelled \"CAN YOU CRACK THE DOOR OPEN AND TELL US WHAT YOU ARE SAYING?\" well...he didn't...he yelled thru the door louder that it would be 25 or 30 minutes til someone came back. Not really sure why HE couldn't open the door so we could leave our vacs but she and I looked at each other and said to each other as we left that we won't be back.

I will definitely keep you in mind in the future. All your son had to do was open the door and tell us what he was trying to say. The nite he was pointing to said \"will return by 1130\".

The website says it has excellent service, but Donna and Kevin (owner?) are really unprofessional. Long story short, I received two defective machines and now they have everything back and don't want to give me my money back. The way Donna handles \"customer service\" is to hang up the phone on you and tell everyone to not answer your calls and not respond to emails. When she does decide to respond via email after writing many times, she doesn't solve the problem, she just causes more and doesn't sign off. The way Kevin \"solves problems\" is to lie and make up whatever is convenient for him. Have him email you so he cannot go back on his words.\n\nupdate: RELUCTANTLY, they sent me a third machine that I did NOT want. YES, I had to pay for shipping. The second one was broken within a month and I have email proof that I informed them at that time. I tried to save them money and have them send me a piece and change that to see it that is what was broken. Of course it was over a month by then and hard to contact them so they wanted me to pay for shipping. I had no choice b/c they wouldn't give me a refund for the broken machines they sent me. This was after months of them not refunding me my money & having possession of their machine. Donna was extremely unprofessional and childish. To expand on what I wrote above, she would hang up the phone on you and then when I try to call numerous times, she wouldn't pick up. I would then call with a different phone and then, wah-lah, she is magically answering the phone again. Who does that? Then Kevin gets the phone and has the nerve to tell me I hung up the phone. If I hung up, why would I have tried calling back several times to no avail? Kevin kept giving me the run around and wouldn't let me talk to the owner. I asked him NUMEROUS times to give me the same order when he shipped it, yet when I received it, the threads I had chosen were not included. The ugliest colors they could find were thrown into the package they sent me. I am so tired of dealing with them, I didn't even bother to contact them.\n\nBuyer beware!

I spoke to Jeremy I believe who works on them. He asked what I currently used and explained the situation. He said he had not heard of a tension board on that machine. He said if you are willing to send it to us I will look at your machine and if I can't fix it all you are out is the shipping. I decided to go for it. I shipped it and it was repaired and returned within about 10 days!!! These folks rock!!! I highly recommend them! If you have a Janome Compulock serger Jeremy is the man to work on them!
