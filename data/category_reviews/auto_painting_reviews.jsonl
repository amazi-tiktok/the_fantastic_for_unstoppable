Econo was also able to apply a newer paint color code specific to the manufacturer and matched it perfect.

Also, my car was ready when they said it would be.  Bottom line, if you want an older car looking good at an affordable price, visit Econo.

So of course I called the rental place to extend the rental for a extra day because my daughter had a doctor's appointment at 2pm on Monday that could not be missed!

I should have followed my first mind to not let my truck be taken there. Thinking that since they do work for Geico that they would be fair. The adjuster JY was unprofessional and is in the wrong business dealing with all types of ppl. Two supervisor called me to talk with me and was all nice but wanted me to give them a call and when something did come up no answer . They raised the price up and was about to put savage parts on from junk yards!!! Then broke my truck down of unnecessary parts , sent me 3 pic of my truck where the damage was and made a mistake and included pic of a Durango include with mine in the estimated online where they dropped the ball at so they could total my truck out. $7,500 their price after I was haggled on what should be fixed or not. The under part that I was told would be looked at by Geico in Macon under and told me that everything would be fixed and even sent a wrecker for it. When I saw this scam I sent for my truck to be taken to another shop of my choice in Trussville where I live at and the price dropped to $2500 . What\u2019s the use of having insurance for 8yrs without any incidents and was deem not my fought and still getting the run around but I guess it\u2019s just a moody thing then , I have a 1,500 rental car limit that I pay for in my and JY told me that it had to be back today mon 2-26-18 or they wasn\u2019t going to extended it til the next day when my truck will be ready I\u2019m the am, how about I called jay (sup) while I was at the shop because they needed to ask him something and he told me he was going to call them and did. They just threw my parts in the back of the bed and shipped with all the unecesary parts too! New parts hand to be shipped in . This is just a scam place too much unprofessionalism going on after JY started talking to nice nasty and rushing me off the phone like I was Bothering her! So after I go meet with the ppl in Macon and send all the paper work and the pictures that I have with m parts and the Durango and explain that I had to miss work tonight because of the treat that JY told me .Also the shop ppl a security system that pick up everything that she said to them about me and my truck which is very unrespectful because they played it back so I could hear her and what she said !!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889737b9ba9a8db:0x558163db9059166f"}
