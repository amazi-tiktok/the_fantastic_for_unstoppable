It has so many things to do and it is incredibly clean and beautiful. They have bounce houses, a toddler playground area, mini zip line, swings and slides for kids to play on. They also have a petting farm area with a llama, sheep, pygmy goats and pot bellied pigs to feed and pet. There's a large rock climbing wall and an impressively long zip line for adults and older kids. They usually have several food trucks on site with great food and plenty of variety. There are 2 shaded pavillion areas with picnic tables to sit at and rest or enjoy something to eat. There's a small country store that sells souvenirs like t-shirts and things and often local vendors have tents set up there selling various items. The list of things to do here is truly incredible, so I'm sure there is much that I've missed. It's a very large, beautiful venue that is owned and run by some wonderful people. I HIGHLY recommend checking it out for yourself this fall! \ud83c\udf83\ud83d\udc10\ud83c\udf1e\ud83c\udf42\ud83d\udc11\ud83d\ude9c\u2764", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888ca0593734b67:0x9290d199e8f79f94"}

When you are around animals anything can happen and I understand that is a liability of having animals. I don't think this justifies a 2 star rating. I have not increased our admission fee in 7 years. At this point the only way I can give a military discount is to go up on the admission price. I appreciate all the men and women that serve our country. I think our admission fee is very reasonable for what we offer. You obviously did or you would not have returned the 2nd year."}, "gmap_id": "0x888d69231015b093:0xcdac619b35b62265"}

Kids may have a decent time but it is not nearly as fun and exciting as they make it seem. My kids were bored and filthy after 15 minutes and I felt disappointed the moment we got there.  Staff is also combative as you can see for yourself in a response that they posted on here in reference to another customers concerns. I'd save the trip and find a nicer location. Lane Southern Orchard is nice as long as you go early in the season for the corn maze. They have a very nice playground and offer military discount. Plus you can buy wine so bonus!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1514167709743, "text": "I am sorry you did not have a good time. I try to be open minded to every review I receive, regardless if it is 1 star or 5 star. There is always ways to improve your business if you will listen to your customers. But I also do not understand how your children got bored and nasty 15 minutes after you arrived. If they were bored how did they get nasty. We keep our facility very clean and the first 15 minutes would not get you through the petting zoo. Is this a negative review on our Pumpkin Patch or are you trying to advertise another pumpkin patch at my expense. I am not trying to be combative but we do not sell alcoholic beverages at our pumpkin patch so bonus! It is unfortunate that  you have nothing better to do than write a negative review about our facility on Christmas eve 2 months after we closed our pumpkin patch for the season.
