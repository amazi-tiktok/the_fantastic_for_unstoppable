The three bedroom lodge was so cozy and well decorated with fun and interesting art. All of the art on each of the buildings on the property is SO COOL. We took the kids out for a walk on the property, where we saw there are pigs, ducks, and other animals on the farm. I will definitely be coming back for one of their events in New Market, they have a music stage built and the speaker system looks like it rocks! There was even a playground on the property which made it that much more fun. Plus, they are dog friendly, so we were able to bring our dogs to run around and there is a fenced in back yard at the house, which was perfect.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1613497447313, "text": "Thank you so much Natalee!

But to my shock and horror  instead of working with me or accepting my payment, they confiscated all of my merchandise and personal display cases and tents and even my personal belongings. And the old guy who's managing the place was pretty rude about it too.\nI could understand if I was refusing to pay or leaving them hanging but I communicated the whole time and I was trying to pay them. I always caught them up if I ever was late  and always paid, I never didn't pay. When they confiscated all of my belongings I guess they decided that the value of my items was worth more than my business or loyalty.\nDirty business. Don't trust them or rent booths/buildings here unless you want to risk your hard work and investment. They really did me wrong and didn't care. I was very sick in the hospital and my dad had just passed away, I didn't need to be told that I was losing my flea market stuff.\nThat's okay though, Bless them.
