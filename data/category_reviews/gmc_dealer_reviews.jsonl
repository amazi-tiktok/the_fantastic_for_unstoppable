Yesterday it didn\u2019t start, and we had it towed a guy from Tamron Buick service department (named Shay) called and claimed that the issue was a dead battery ask him for an authorization to replace it for $165 plus tax. It was stunning to hear this as the battery was replaced just last month from O'Reilly auto, who kindly accepted to replace the battery. Shay called back upset asking to authorize $50 charge to \u201cspray the brand-new battery with sealant\u201d to prevent it from corrosion and breaking down again. miss Becky at O'Reilly auto called and told me that Shay was a liar as she tested the old battery (which Shay claimed to be broker and wanted to replace). Shay ended up charging the amount of the battery anyhow.\nShay seems to be trained to scam as his boss, Kyle shamelessly stood by the scam and endorsed it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a432fea5a1821:0x88d2d8ec001e2cc6"}
