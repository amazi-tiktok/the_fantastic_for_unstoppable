Who ever this Cynthia is she is very unprofessional and rude I will not be going back to that store.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888f05d4ee5b4d03:0x9390ce19146d963"}

India who is always on her phone ringing up customers, snarling at people she doesn't like, and just being plain rude. Tonight I went in and asked where I could find a green polo shirt bc I planned on being India for Halloween to make light of a situation that really hurt my feelings. To be followed around a store bc of the color of my skin. So to make matters worse after asking Carrie the manager where I could find a polo she told me the thrift store. So then I told her I was going to be India . Carrie was furious. She berated me and told me and all the other customers in the store it was their job to follow people that are stealing around dollar tree as if I was stealing . She yelled that India was doing her job and that it didn't matter which color the person was. Making it seem as if I am a thief. I'm in total disbelief bc I've known Carrie the manager for years. But the way she acted and talked to me tonight amongst other shoppers was ridiculous, mentally scarring, and just plain bad for business. I literally shop in dollar tree every single day. But this could all be changed very soon . Thanks to Carrie having a bad day. Then to make the situation my worst yet this year. I was apologizing to the cashier ringing me up telling her I knew the objectives of their job bc I was offered a management position about a year ago and had a application for the job in my car . Carrie the manager walks out and tells me to shut up and that the conversation is basically over. I said Carrie I was not talking to you I was speakkng to the cashier. I think it's sad when a person brings their personal life to work. I know Carrie has problems at home. So I told her I didn't know what she bad going on but I knew this wasn't her .

They are very unprofessional and unorganized. We bought basically a whole house worth of furniture, when it was time for delivery they informed us that our sectional was not in stock and that it\u2019ll be in stock in 2 weeks and that they\u2019ll deliver it out to us with no delivery fee but we could still get our bedroom suite that we ordered.\nIncident #1: On delivery day I had to call and ask what time would the furniture be in because we were out running errands. They forgot to put our furniture on the truck and the delivery people had to come back and get it\ud83d\ude44 (I\u2019m sure if I had not called I would not have known)\nIncident #2:Two weeks later, which was on yesterday (Sunday) at around 12pm I called and spoke with OJay and asked was our furniture in. She told me yes(why didn\u2019t they call?) and that they can deliver it out same day. Okay cool. She then called back and said that we didn\u2019t pay all of our delivery fee which in fact when they delivered our furniture the first time my boyfriend gave them the delivery free PLUS A TIP. She then told me that it was okay and that they would take care of it. Later that day, at 4pm, I called again just checking to see what time they would be coming. The guy I spoke with asked would I be okay with getting it delivered first thing Monday morning. Uhh no. (My problem with this was WHY DIDN\u2019T ANYBODY CALL, I would be okay if they had the common courtesy to inform me of any issues instead of me having to call them.) The guy told me my furniture should be at my house no later than 10:45AM(I didn\u2019t know how if they opened at 11am) I asked was he sure and he said yes.\nSO THIS MORNING MY FURNITURE WAS NOT AT MY HOUSE AT 10:45! I called promptly AT 11am and spoke w/ the manger Rodney and he informed me that a driver was on the way to get my furniture to deliver it. If my furniture was not able to be at my house at 10:45AM they should have communicated that with me. I received my furniture at 12pm after all the mess I had to go through. I appreciate it if you guys would be more professional with your customers and communicated more with your drivers. I should not have to go through this hassle of getting furniture delivered and I WILL NOT shop with you guys again.

DO NOT RECOMMEND.\n\nFull story: I shopped at American Freight on Black Friday 2017 with high expectations after reading these reviews. And the experience in the store was fine. No pressure to buy, but a helpful staff answering any questions my husband or I had. We bought a sectional and ottoman set we liked even though they weren't available for delivery for 2-3 weeks. We were fine with the delay and left looking forward to it arriving in a few weeks (more time to find homes for our old stuff).\n\nThat's when the trouble started. Fast forward 4 weeks, no sectional and no call/news at all. I call the store and was told that my purchase wasn't on the truck as expected, but they would be calling other stores to see of they had it and we should hear something the next week.\n\nLife was busy so I didn't check again for another 3 weeks. This time when I called I was told they didn't know why, but it was on back order. But it would for sure be in the next week. I again expressed by hope that it would arrive as I very much looked forward to using my furniture.\n\n2 weeks later, no furniture.  At this point, 2 months after purchasing the furniture and as my husband and I are both active duty military and didn't have the time to go to deal with it, my mother-in-law visited the store on a Friday. She made a bit of a scene stating the facts in front of other customers, and wouldn't you know it our sectional and ottoman arrived on rush order the following Monday. Corners were scuffed in some areas, and a few tears from packing staples, but at that point we were so glad to have the furniture  and tired of dealing with the company that we accepted it anyway. I will never shop there again  and highly recommend you don't either.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2bce410ad21f:0xb1653e3c3ad41741"}

However the great reviews must be only for furniture that they have in stock. The couch and love seat we really liked was not in stock and we were told it would be two weeks until our furniture would arrive This was 15th of July. It even said August 1st on the sales receipt.  Two weeks go by and we heard nothing. We called American Freight and we were told that they don't have a date that the truck will show up it will just show up one day. Three weeks out we had heard nothing and we're told it would take 2 to 4 weeks. At this point we would of asked for a refund and shopped somewhere else but their policy states you can get a refund after 4 weeks from purchase.  Now four weeks arrives still no furniture still no date a truck will arrive.  We call on Monday with all intentions to ask for a refund and were told there is a truck and the Manger will be in on Thursday for us to get a refund. Thursday comes no phone call from American Freight we call on Friday and we're told oh your couch is here. Alot of effort on our part to find the status on our order. So after 4 weeks and several days of a family of 5 sitting on the floor since we just moved to Montgomery we have our couch and love seat. When we picked them up we told them we were still in the market for furniture and we were told to come back and they will give us a good deal for being so patient  well why not give us a deal while we were there. We won't be back.\nGoing back to the day we purchased the furniture the couch and love seat we wanted they actually had in the back but it was already sold to a customer who was waiting for it to be delivered some sales people were telling our sales person to just give us that one but we would not do that to someone else. So it puts into question did our furniture arrive weeks ago and they sold it to someone else it's possible especially since they could never give us a date our furniture would arrive.\nWe do like the furniture but if you shop here and they don't have it in stock BEWARE you will never know when you will get it.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1471896687656, "text": "We do apologize for the inconvenience, Wes.

When it was delivered, the delivery guy Preston had noticed they sent the wrong chairs but I had noticed the box with the table looked as if it had fallen off of the truck or dropped from a distance. After bringing in the table, they left and came back with the correct chairs. After putting together the chairs, I opened the box containing the table and it had indeed been dropped. It was well after store hours at this point but I still called the delivery guy with my issues. The next morning at 11 sharp, I got a call from the owner. Like he has obviously done before, apologized for it and said that he's send another out by the end of the day. TWO DAYS later, the table finally arrived. They opened the box to make sure that nothing is busted up and I was very pleased with the way it was handled. I was so pleased that we decided to order two more chairs from them. We were told that it took 2 weeks for the chairs to arrive. It was November 27th and we needed them before Christmas. Before they ordered the chairs, we had to pay and that wasn't an issue for us. We paid the full balance of nearly $180 for two Madrid. counter height chairs. Two weeks go by and no chairs. I was told that the truck hasn't come in but I'll definitely have them before Christmas. December 22nd, I gave them another call and I was told that I could pick them up the next day. I was overjoyed to hear that. On the 23rd I got a call from the manager telling me to not come because they wasn't there and he didn't want me to ride there for nothing. He said that he was just have them delivered when they came in. The delivery guy Preston brought to our home at 6pm that night. He told me that they were in a different box because they opened it to make sure that they sent the right chairs because of what happened the first time. Trusting his words, i signed for it then took them upstairs myself. I placed them in a closet, grabbed my things and left home until Saturday night. Christmas morning I pulled out the box, opened it and removed all of its contents. I then took the box to the dumpster. When I returned, I settled myself down to begin assembling the chairs only to find that the chairs HAD ONCE BEEN ASSEMBLED. There were marks on the chairs, the screws were stripped and rusty. and the floor protectors were very worn. There were also four screws missing as well. There were hand smudges all over the wood. There was nothing about those chairs that said NEW. In complete disbelief that Rodney the store manager for charge me full price for two chairs off the showroom floor then have me wait nearly a month to receive them made me a bit irate. Without thinking, I called the store on Christmas morning. After realizing, I messaged the delivery asking for the cell number of the manager and I've yet to receive an response. So as a result, I feel it's very necessary to be waiting in the parking lot with two unassemble Madrid counter height chairs and several questions that gonna require an answer as well as a solution. Until this, I thought very highly of American Freight and its coworkers. Now it's BUYERS BEWARE... there's a reason they say that all sales are finals. For me, I don't want my money back because I do want the chairs. I just want what I paid for and I DID NOT pay for recycled chairs", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1483030131860, "text": "We're very sorry to hear this happened to you, Sylver.

Yes thats right he never showed us anything on sale nor did he bother to ask what our spending limit was so he know what to work with. Instead he just showed us around the store that highlighted\nThe furniture with the 699 and up prices.\nWe spotted a black leather sofa that had 398 price tag on it, sat on it to try it out, and as we began to show insterest in it and began discussing to each other about maybe we should get this or not. Thats when the salesman kinda brushed us away from the actual sofa set that we were sitting on that was 398 and started reverting us back toward that 699 plus tax sofa set. Smh thats not the sofa set we wanted or was discussing.we felt that the salesman wasnt offering us what we wanted but yet offer us what he wanted us to buy.....and we are the customers...its our money not his....we felt like our wants were disreguarded so we decided to check another store, told the guy we were gonna check somewhere else also before we decide. Asked him for a bussiness card and of course he didnt want to give us one and by him doing so gave us even more reason to be absolutely sure that we dont want to shop there now.\nSo as we started to walk out the door the guy then decided to offer us a deal on a sofa set\n...A BETTER PRICE is what he said so im like oh ok he wants to work a deal on the actual leather sofa we were sitting on with the 398 price tax. So im like ok turn around and ask what are you offering...he reply...600 right now walk out..we refused and left and went somewhere else because once agin the guy was still attempting to sale us what he wanted us to buy rather than what we the customer wanted to spend our money on...", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1462553897247, "text": "Hi Byrdie, I am so sorry to hear that you had this experience.

When it first opened, the guy who ran that store would get rid of anyone who had nasty attitudes, and he kept that store clean and looking good.  This new manager, not a chance.  It is nothing to be making a purchase and the cashiers are on the phones arguing with their boyfriends.  There is another Family Dollar down the road and I will pass this one to instead shop at that one.  Family Dollar places these stores in mostly black neighborhoods, and does just enough, which is deplorable.  I should never go in a store where I am purchasing any foodstuffs and see rodents running across the floor.  Let me be clear however, there are one or two of the young ladies on staff there who do all they can to make this store better, but they are not manager, so they can only do so much.

By the machine being down this is not possible. I spend$50 plus dollars a week in Family Dollar and I want to use my coupons. This really is an outrage how corporate the district manager or whomever has let this problem linger so long. I spent almost$80 yesterday and the cashier was really sweet because she manually gave me the smart spin coupons but the rude store manager gets upset because it was a long line behind me. How about you get on the other register and take care of the guests because I wanted my coupons and she was only doing her job... The nerve of her. Take that anger and frustration out on corporate or whomever is responsible for taking care of this issue.

Also, Marcus claims he forgot to include my bedrails and I didn't have screws for my headboard. The delivery fee was $100, with no assembly. I had to drive back to the store for my bedrails. No considerations nor accommodations were made for me regarding my time or gas even though this order was paid in full and this was a mistake he made. As of yesterday, he still could not give me an update on the status of my living room furniture. I finally spoke with the manager who was unaware of this situation and told me that my complaint was one of many and that Marcus had been demoted.

He works his magic to ensure you get exactly what youre wanting and stays within your budget! DARNELL IS AMAZING!!! I AM OVERLY PLEASED not only by the  products I've received but more so the level of customer service. Its hard to find great sales people these days that actually give good customer service!

The pricetag was certainly lower than anywhere else we looked, and it looked like OK quality furniture.\nLess than 3 weeks after purchase, the sofa literally fell apart. We're pretty normal sized people and have treated it with care. I turned it over and opened up the upholstery to have a look.  The construction quality is the worst I've ever seen; low grade partical board, half-rotted knotty 1/2\" thick pine, and the whole thing is held together with staples.  I identified 6 separate joints that had come apart inside the couch due to the staples simply slipping out of the wood, and many more that were halfway undone.\nI ended up taking around 3 or 4 hours and meticulously replacing pieces, reinforcing joints with metal brackets and screws, and closing up places in the upholstery which were mysteriously split and leaking stuffing.\n\nThe furniture here is truly of the lowest quality, even if it appears fine on the surface.  If you buy from here, make sure you also purchase their ridiculously expensive warranty (that will tack on $100 - $200 to your purchase), because you're gonna be needing it a whole lot.  If you need cheap furniture, go to the thrift store or use Facebook marketplace.

I called 2 days before and they told me to call on Saturday when I wanted to pick up.   So I call on Saturday morning when they opened telling them  I wanted to pick up and 1pm.  They told me to call 30minutes before I came so they could spray it.    Got there and the couch they had ready for me was not even the correct couch.  On top of that it had not been sprayed with the fabric protection.  No one there really knew what was going on or who had done what with the couch.

My purchase was actually from the Trussville location, and my experience with them has been far below professional. They did not provide me with the information I needed to know for my furniture to be delivered. I paid ONE HUNDRED FREAKING DOLLARS for them to literally drop the box off at my house. That is a LOT of money for a box to be dropped off regardless of the location. So I spoke to Darnell at the Helena location who very kindly listened to me rant about this experience is resolved the matter in much less time than the Trussville location. Seriously, he's your guy. He's amazing!!! I cannot thank him enough for what he is done.

I literally did not see one piece of paper or similar debris on the floor. Shelves were nicely organized with price tags, clearance racks and store personel easy to find. Everyone (employees and customers alike) was wearing their masks and following social distancing guidelines which made the whole experience even more pleasant since I was shopping with several friends including my one year old great niece and a lifelong friend who has an extremely compromised  immune system from struggles with Crohn's disease. Scored a ton of bargains on name brands and designer's fashions. Seriously, I got my great niece a pair of sneakers and a pair of adorable boots for only $2 each. By the way, they were made by none other than the legendary JUICY COUTURE. I would have had to shell out another $45-$65 if I had purchased these designer's labels from elsewhere.  I felt practically criminal after swiping a game carrying case plus a glass screen protector (two separate items) for my son's NINTENDO SWITCH. I paid $5 for both which saved me about $15 and earned me HUGE POINTS with my son. How about this bit of awesomeness: $3 for Beyonce Pulse perfume, 3.4 ounce bottle, normally $15 or more. I also grabbed 2 hoodies for $1 each.

I know for a fact they had 22 units as they called the boxes and then another truck. So tell me why they didn't put out any supplies: Disinfectant wipes, lysol, microban, dg disinfectants or alcohol.
