We set a high standard for ourselves in serving our clients & we're sorry that this was not met in your interaction with our business.  We strive to be as clear & transparent with itemized pricing on our service envelopes detailing parts, labor & totals along with a detailed description of work to be done as to remove any chance of surprise at pickup.  Regarding your visit, we created two separate envelopes because we provided two different services, one pair of earrings with 18k protector backs & specialty posts & one pair of earrings with 18ky screw posts & screw backs.  On each envelope, we included an in-depth description of parts & labor needed to complete your job along with the total.  Each envelope had a total written & differing totals ($257.10 & $300.70) due to different mechanisms.  We DID obtain your signature on each envelope as acknowledgement & confirmation of the details regarding the services BEFORE we proceeded.  We understand that your complaint is that our 10 yr. sales professional, Santana, did not give you \"the grand total verbally\".  It is very typical for a client that may want to pick up their services independently from one another, i.e.:  $257.10 one week & the $300.70 the next week.  Although we may have fallen short with \"verbally\" providing you with the grand total, we were completely transparent with our detailed written description & totals for each signed envelope.  We do value you as a new customer as well as your other family members & hope you will reconsider visiting Jewelry by Design in the future."}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c3ed9f2d5b:0x2fb4de104c11cb57"}

I walked into Jewelry by Design with my custom made, one of a kind engagement ring. It has 4 bands that meet in the back. My engagement ring had cracked where the bands meet and one of the bands had broken off. I still don\u2019t know how it happened but I was devastated so I took it in to get it repaired. I took it to Jewelry by Design because of all the great reviews and because the original jeweler was now retired. When I took it in, the service was great and I also asked to resize down 1/4 size because it had been fitting loosely. My first indication that something wasn\u2019t right should have been when they didn\u2019t check to see if they agreed that I needed it resized. When I came back for my ring, I could no longer put it on my finger after only going down a 1/4 size and they had bent the bands causing the halo for the diamond to be out of place. It no longer looked like the same ring and the setting for the diamond was crooked. I went back to them the next day and explained that I believed somewhere in the resizing process/repair that some of the bands looked a little out of place and asked if they would be able to fix it. I also brought a picture of the ring to show how it looked originally. The jeweler at this point was incredibly rude and even asked if the picture was of the same ring. I then explained to him that it was and stated again that this was a one of a kind ring and that it did not look like the picture and also didn\u2019t fit. He then proceeded to tell me that I had not needed to get it resized in the first place and didn\u2019t understand why I had gotten it resized. He also said that he had only done work in the back so anything that was messed up in the front was not his doing. He walked away at this point and his sales rep picked up the conversation asking if we wanted it resized. I said yes and that I would like it fixed to look like the picture. She relunctantly asked me to send the picture to the store email. I was charged more for the resizing than I had been originally and they told me it would take a week to resize it. I should have at this point taken it elsewhere but I wanted to give them a chance to fix their mistake. A week later I got a call in which the jeweler said that he had gotten it \u201cas close as humanly possible to the picture.\u201d He also said that the ring was unstable and that it needed additional structural support insinuating that it was poorly designed. My fianc\u00e9 picked up the ring and much to our disappointment and frustration it looked nothing like the picture. The 4 bands had originally been crossing and now they were parallel to each other. On top of that they removed the 14k gold stamp from the inside of the band. I hope that doesn't mean that they used some other metal when they resized it. I don\u2019t know how he thought that it looked like the picture. I have shown several friends and family members the before pictures and what it looks like now and they all agree that it\u2019s not even close. To make matters worse he added tacks to the ring saughtering the bands together. This was not part of the original design nor had we asked for it and he never called to ask before he modified the ring. The jeweler was again very rude to my fianc\u00e9 when he picked up the ring making comments about how the design was unstable and insinuated the damage to the ring had been some how done by my fianc\u00e9 between leaving the store and giving it back to me 10 minutes later. We believe that our poor treatment was due to our college age and that the piece was from another jeweler. The jeweler who had created our ring had designed most of my family\u2019s engagement rings, had been in business as a family for over 80 years, and was highly respected as a master jeweler for his unique design and pieces. So to anyone who has jewelry designed by another jewler or who is young do not go to this establishment because they are extremely arrogant and have no respect for you or your jewelry.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c3ed9f2d5b:0x2fb4de104c11cb57"}

I\u2019ve had much more detailed rings done in 3 days and they have taken almost a month to complete this ring. They did not tell me when I took it in that they ship it somewhere else to get resized other wise I wouldn\u2019t of let them because it is my grandmothers wedding band and I don\u2019t trust it being shipped because things can happen. I am furious. DO NOT SHOP HERE!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cb66ea47319:0x463ed01caff288a4"}

They have a beautiful high quality selection. We worked with Stephanie and she was so sweet patient and professional.  We purchased a new setting for my engagement ring solitaire while we were vacationing there and my solitaire fell out(after 10 years). They helped me select the perfect ring. We put it in layaway as our 10th anniversary was in December(this happened in June). I forgot to snap a picture of it while we were there so I called Stephanie and she happily got it out of the safe and put it on her own finger and sent me pictures via text message. She went above and beyond! We were shopping with our kids and they offered them chocolates and water. We called to have my diamond placed in the new ring on Wednesday of this week and they placed it on the same day we called and overnighted the ring to me for free. I live 6 hours from Gulf Shores. It was at my door the next morning. It is so beautiful! I am so thankful we went there to see about getting my original ring repaired and ended up with a gorgeous new ring that has special meaning since it was purchased at one of my favorite vacation spots. If you need a jeweler you can trust and who has a gorgeous selection give them a try. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a04d9b67ea82b:0x14d06995d471721d"}

When we met Read he was genuinely excited that we had been referred to him and took a lot of time to explain the types of bands and diamonds available. We left with a few solid ideas on the band (this was big progress!). I came back to see Read by myself and selected the band. He then helped me shop for the right diamond, something I was still unsure about. Read has access to diamonds from all over the country of varying qualities, sizes, and cuts. He gave me some parameters of the size and cut he thought would look good in the band. Once I selected a few options we discussed price. All I asked for was a fair price and I truly believe I got it. The other thing that was important to us was for there to be service after the sale. Read Kloss has a great reputation and the times I was in his store return customers would stop by to browse, drop items for repair, or just to say hi. There was a relationship. Bottom line-my wife loved her ring. She bought me a watch from Klos Diamond Center as a wedding gift. I have been back several times for anniversary and birthday gifts.

I'm a newly engaged man in my 30's and having never purchased any jewelry before.  Naturally I reach out to my family and my Step-Dad was quick to say \"Go see Read. He'll take care of you.\"  Read has been my Step-Dad's jeweler for years so I knew who he was but had never dealt with him first hand.  He definitely took care of me to say the least!  From the moment I walked in Read and his staff were extremely helpful, had a great selection to look at, listened to what I was looking for and what my budget was, were extremely patient, and helped me find \"the ring\" that has had people asking my fianc\u00e9e where I got that beautiful ring from!\n\nNow keep in mind that I had actually picked out two different rings and due to certain circumstances had to change my mind twice before finding \"the ring\"!  The response from Read was always the same, \"hey that's fine, not a problem, now let's find the one!\"\n\nAfter that Read, knowing what I was looking for, based on our conversations, found exactly what I was looking for in a ring and then found a great deal on a beautiful diamond in the parameters I wanted and in my budget!  And did I mention he did it quickly!!!  His communication with me the entire time was quick and easy and constant between the phone calls, texts, and emails.\n\nThe customer service didn't stop after the purchase though.  He set up a wonderful, private, jewelry soir\u00e9e for my Fianc\u00e9e and her friends which they thoroughly enjoyed!!  Next, when she went to go get the ring sized, her Facebook post read \"When you walk in to have your ring sized and your jeweler greets you by name and offers you wine. He gets me.\"  The fact that he takes care of my Lady when I'm not there, speaks volumes and is greatly appreciated!!!\n\nIf you're looking for a jeweler to be YOUR JEWELER, that will learn what your style is and more importantly your Lady's style, take care of you both every step of the way, with great service... I just have a simple phrase.... Go see Read. He'll take care of you.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626caac715d171:0x1d7766f286f9159a"}

To his credit, the jeweler was wonderful. I got my quote and was told it would probably be ready by Monday.\n\nMonday rolls around and it's not ready but that's okay. I understand delays happen, and it's not like I need the ring right this minute. I say thanks and on goes my day.. The next day I get a similar phonecall, but it's still fine, I get it.\n\nThe third day past due, my husband gets a call that the rings are ready and they're ready for pick up. He asks if it's all three. \"Three? Um, there's only two.\" No, there are two bands and an engagement ring. \"No, I only see two bands here. I don't see any engagement rings here. Let me look for the order I'll call you back.\"\n\nSo he looks. And he can't find it. Calls back. Some stern words are had regarding the fact that yes, we dropped of a ring for repairs and it should be there.\n\nKeep in mind, this is my grandmother's ring. She is deceased. I have no words for how upset I was during this whole exchange.\n\nEventually they call back. They found it. The order should be complete \"tomorrow\"\n\nNo phone call that next day.\n\nThe following day I called back and was told yes, two rings are here for you.\n\nI swear, I think I blacked out for a second.\n\nGrogan, get your act together before you give someone a heart attack.\n\nTo the jeweler's credit, the ring fits great and looks amazing.

I have had a sorted history with this watch over the years with other jewelers in TN who have gouged me and taken upwards of six months to complete a job so now that I am a local here I wasn't sure what to expect from my local jeweler. Well these guys did a quick turnaround at a very reasonable price and not only replaced the stem but my  watch was so clean and polished that I did a double take because, at first, I thought they had given me a brand new watch by mistake. Nope, it is my watch and I could not have been happier.\n\nNow as for the business, they have a wonderful selection of what you expect. Rings, watches, bracelets, earrings, etc. but they also have beautiful local artist pieces that are absolute stunning from inexpensive ocean themed pieces to a gorgeous diamond piece we just saw that range in prices into the thousands. They also buy gold and make custom pieces of your own design right in house.\n\nWe're here to yesterday to get my watch band repaired and they did it in minutes at no charge! That brings me to just how friendly, professional and all around terrific that everyone here, that I've encountered, are. I couldn't have asked to find a nicer group of folks in my new local jewelery store and I can assure that this a great place that I highly  recommend and that I will do all my jewelry business from now on!\n\nBottom line: they're great!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1598368836697, "text": "Thank you so much!

She lives in the condo complex where we were renting for the week. So I asked her if she could recommend a nice place to eat and if she knew of a good jeweler. She right away told us of some places to eat, then she called her jeweler friend Glenn Manning and got me an appt with him. She told me that Manning Jewelers\u2019s has been in business for over 70 yrs. and how awesome everyone there is. And she was so right about that. And she showed me her beautiful ring that Glenn made for her.\nGlenn took my old wedding and turned it into the most beautiful wedding ring I\u2019ve ever seen. My husband and I were celebrating our 35th wedding anniversary in Gulf Shores. Because our trip to St Lucia was canceled due to Covid! And we had been planning to make some changes with my ring anyway, so this was the best time for us to do that. I believe God puts people in our life path for a reason. So meeting Pepper, then meeting Glenn was a huge blessing for us.\nMy husband was very impressed how Glenn designed my ring on his computer then made a resin ring to hold my stones so I could see how it would look and feel on my finger. I wanted to use my existing center stone as a side stone to represent our past 35 yrs of marriage, then added a new larger center stone for the present, and another side stone to match for the future. Then we decided to add a two sided ring guard using my existing ring guard diamonds. So not only did Glenn design a beautiful ring for me, he also saved us a lot of money. And he recommended a great company to insure my new ring with, which had a better price than our home owners insurance co.\nI was very nervous about having my new ring shipped to me once it was done, just a few short weeks later, but Glenn put my mind at ease letting me know it will be insured and it came over night at my convenience. The whole process was Awesome! As well as the entire staff at Manning Jewelers. So if your heading to Gulf Shores, Al, or just looking for an Amazing  jeweler in that area, be sure to look up Manning Jewelers in Foley, Al. They are worth the drive from anywhere.\nWe also bought a really nice \u201cflip flop\u201d neck less for our daughter while we were in Manning\u2019s  and she loves it. Plus Manning Jewelers\u2019s also has a beautiful pendant called Stray Love that Glenn designed himself and he donates 20% of each sale to their foundation to help save stray animals. Best company to work with for all your jewelry needs.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1598110336782, "text": "Wow! Thank you Dena!

Don't get me wrong, those rings were beautiful, but they seemed overpriced and all looked the same. Even after showing the employees of those stores pictures of rings that I did like, they would still come back with the same ole ring I just looked at. Some of those employees remained professional and would tell me that they didn't offer anything else, while some became very rude and seemed to take it personal that we didn't buy the ring immediately. It was becoming a very stressful and unenjoyable venture.\n\nHowever, we luckily came across Griffin's Jewelers in Pell City after I searched for related images on Google. I had never been there and assumed that they probably had the same handful of rings all the other stores had, but was more than willing to give it a try.\n\nI couldn't have been more wrong! We were very pleasantly greeted by Michael and Stephanie when we entered the store and they remained helpful and attentive without making us feel pressured to do anything. They have a large selection of rings and most of the rings were already unique in their own ways; meaning they actually have a large selection of Different rings! I showed them pictures of rings and because of their knowledge of jewelry in general, as well as their own inventory, they were able to quickly locate rings that had the features I was looking for. It definitely felt as though a weight had been lifted.\n\nI ended up finding a ring that looked even more unique than the style I had originally been looking for and I love it! My fiance didn't complain about the price at all either; he was given a more than reasonable price and would have paid so much more for this ring elsewhere.\n\nWe're very grateful for Michael, Stephanie, and the everyone else at Griffin's Jewelers! We will continue to visit them for anything we need in the future.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1533160173304, "text": "Thank you for the kind words, Jillian. It was our pleasure to help.

Whenever a jeweler sizes a ring, they then have to follow up on their work by checking each individual stone and tightening it, which can become very labor intensive when you are dealing with rings that have a large number of tightly spaced stones down the shoulder and onto the shank.  When it's all said and done, our objective is to make sure that when you get your ring back, you can wear it with full confidence that everything will remain where it belongs, from the ring on your finger down to the smallest stone on the shank.\n\nAgain, thank you so much, and I hope that helps clarify our policies a bit for you!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888dd4d29378307f:0x3fa4cd5e97e0d99d"}

Jessica, the store Manager, was INCREDIBLE.  I had dreaded walking in and she immediately made us feel at home. The reason I am leaving a review is because not only was the man claiming a dispute with his credit company in there and behaving like an absolute juvenile, I fully believe the call she received from who I gathered (from eavesdropping tbh) was corporate was in regards to the man on here complaining about \"an order.\" First of all, I am a retail manager as well. If I gave a return on a machine we sent somewhere for maintenance I would lose my job.  The man acted like a baby, and my husband was irate that a grown man should behave that way. The manager, though, was nothing less than professional,  and dealt with it better than I would have for sure! Secondly,  when I listened to her phone conversation about pendant man,  Jessica said more than once but shouldn't we do something for him, they hadn't found out if they could yet (or something like that.) All I thought that day was wow, people are so rude, and it's not even their fault. I never thought I would recommend the Decatur store, but 100% I recommend to everyone! The staff is nice, I actually trust them for once, and the manager Jessica is clearly willing to go above and beyond to try to help you even when you act like a total jerk to her.

We did not have a ring on the wedding date, we couldn't even talk to anybody who knew the status. I finally received the ring, well past the wedding date, about twice as long as Gary told me it would take. Gary repeatedly blamed the shop for not having or knowing about my ring. When I picked up the ring I told Gary they dropped the ball and I felt like they should adjust the price of the ring - or do something to make it right. Gary looked me in the eyes and told me \"I will go to bat for you\" in regards to making it right, he said he would contact me in a few days. After a month I called Gary back today to ask for his district managers number, in hopes of finally getting a resolution. Gary said to me, \"I thought we were done when you picked up your ring\".

I took my engagement ring in for its 6 month checkup and to go down a quarter of a size. They told me to come back in two weeks and it will be here. So two weeks later we go in to get it and it\u2019s been ruined when they went to go down a half a size. Had a huge gash in it, popped out two big diamonds and a diamond on the side. We were heartbroken, they also told us that it was a discontinued ring so they couldn\u2019t reorder another ring and to pick another ring. So I spent a couple days looking and just couldn\u2019t find any ring that I liked. So I ended up going to the Kay\u2019s in bridgestreet and instantly falling in love with one. Told them the situation and they were so shocked. They said they had never had a ring be sent off and be ruined at their store. They told me to tell Decatur which one I wanted and they could have it ordered. So my fianc\u00e9 called Decatur asking if they could have it in my size and ordered and the girl said absolutely you can, come tomorrow and we will have it all ready for you. Well we go the next day and the girls calling all these places just to come back to me to say we can\u2019t get your ring in a size for you so pick another ring. I was so upset. They ruined my ring, then told me the night before they could just to have me go all the way to the store to tell me no they can\u2019t pick another one. I was so angry I ended up leaving. I later in the week went back to the bridestreet and they were so shocked with Decatur\u2019s performance to us, they said we can absolutely get you the ring you want in the size you need and they were confused why Decatur told us we couldn\u2019t. They told us to go into Decatur, get our ring and walk out and call customer service. So we did and the store manager himself fixed us up at bridgestreet with the ring we wanted, plus the band, the size we wanted, and ensured us it would be in two weeks in time for engagement pictures. Yesterday my ring came in, it\u2019s absolutely perfect!! It just goes to show Decatur is very unprofessional, their workers are unskilled and the store manager not once came to handle the situation or talked to us about it even when we were two feet away from her.

April and Christie went above and beyond with their customer service to help me with my issue and ensure all my needs were met. I had to get my wedding ring cleaned and repaired as a diamond had fell out. I sent the pieces of jewelry off mid-March and was expecting them back around early-April. My jewelry ticket consisted of one diamond in my band to be replaced, the three separate pieces sautered together, and the final ring cleaned. Upon mid-April, I did not hear from the store on the status of my ring so my husband and I went to the store in person to get an update. Ms. April informed me that the ring was being held because they wanted to make sure that I was okay with how the ring would potentially come out and discuss any pitfalls. I was informed there would be a potential gap in the ring once the pieces were sautered together. Upon me giving the okay, the ring was supposedly sent to be fixed and I continued to wait patiently. During that time, Ms. April helped me find two other LeVian rings that were on sale and that were absolutely gorgeous and suitable to wear at my job. I decided that once my other rings came back, I would get the two new rings resized for my finger. Coming into the first week of May, I discovered my ring was still not back and at this point I was getting very flustered. Ms. Christie spoke with me and ensured that she would get my ring repaired and back to me quickly and had apologized for the long wait. She personally made sure to let the jeweler know to expedite the process. When my ring finally did arrive back, the middle stone of the main ring was still cloudy, there was black residue on the ring bands, the ring was resized even smaller than my finger, and the same diamond was missing when it was presented to me. At this point I was livid, upset, and refused to do any more business with Kay Jewelers. Despite my ordeal, Ms. April and Ms. Christie showed me the greatest empathy for my situation. I was given a comforting and sorrowful hug from Ms. April. Ms. Christie personally took my ring to the jeweler and stayed with it until it was complete so that I would have the ring that same day and not have to wait any longer then I already had. In addition, she ensured that the other two rings that I recently purchased was resized that say day and back on my hand. These ladies truly exemplify the highest standard for customer service. My frustration and anger was not toward these two ladies but toward the poor service I received from the people repairing my ring. Now I do not take my ring off. Each ring or necklace I get from Kay\u2019s is not just a piece of jewelry, but it is a story of my life. With these ladies understanding that, they will continue to earn my business from here on out.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889221402e1fc1d:0x2dea3497b2214921"}

About a month after receiving the ring, it became apparent to me that the main stone was loose (it was not only wiggly and I could feel it, but it was actually rattling audibly). From being loose there was dust/dirt trapped between the stone and the basket of the stone. Keep in mind I had not been wearing it daily so it was surprising it came loose after such a short period of time.\n\nI brought the ring to the foley Zales to have the sterling silver prongs tightened and the basket cleaned. The rep there said since it wasn\u2019t purchased with warranty I had to pay out of pocket for both the cleaning and repair. It would cost $90.00. (Almost as much as the gift itself, but I couldn\u2019t do anything about the fact it hadnt been purchased without a warranty and I wasn\u2019t going to call up the person who gave it to because that would be rude).\n\nWhen I picked up the ring I was ready to pay for services done, except the moment my hands touched it I knew it was still loose. I showed the representatives behind the counter and they swore up and down to me that it wasn\u2019t loose and it was my imagination. They wiggled it and one even got her pen ink on it trying to \u201cdisprove\u201d me.\n\nThey said they could send it back free of charge so I said ok. But I got a bad feeling and since it had become a sentimental gift I felt like I no longer trusted that store to handle it since I felt like they were lying to me about it not being loose. I asked them for it back and they said yes but they would have to charge me the $90.00. I didn\u2019t want to have a confrontation with them so I paid and figured maybe I should just get a second opinion because it very well could be my imagination.\n\nShe swipes my card and is packing it up and I said \u201cI hear it rattling, tell me you can\u2019t hear that! Call me crazy, It can\u2019t be my imagination!\u201d\n\nShe held it up to her ear and to my surprise said \u201cyes! I do hear it rattling. You\u2019re not crazy\u201d.\n\nIm dumbfounded!! Before I paid, she said it wasn\u2019t loose, lied to my face, then the moment I swiped my card, she acknowledged it was loose!!! I am appalled. I\u2019m just going to dispute the transaction with my bank now because there is no way I trust the people working there. And I\u2019m going to advise the person who purchased it for me to do the same. I won\u2019t be making any purchases from jewelry stores like this again. I learned the hard way, at least this time it was only $90 instead of $900", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0e3378b63149:0x38a08331cfe85986"}

Went to Kays about a week & a half ago to look and purchase an engagement ring with my fiance. Starting looking at rings in our budget and was only shown 1 ring which I loved (& the girl who showed us the ring got kinda in trouble for showing it to us) until they said they were having a diamond show & started showing me rings from those cases, apparently they only have a diamond show every so often and I was shown about 3 rings or so from those cases & ended up picking one of the 3 after being felt like those were the only ones in our budget and  I was pressured into it. We were able to get the ring sized that day & take it home.\n\nSkip to week or so later, I decided to just browse online at rings that were in our budget & that said available in store at my local store. Came across several beautiful rings that I was NEVER shown to begin with so I decided to call and speak with the manager who helped us & told her about how I had seen a few online that said they were available in store & in our budget, so I go to the store to see them in person to make sure I didn't pick the wrong ring.\nGot there & the manager who from the first visit was super helpful and nice, didn't speak to me once when I entered the store. I showed the girl who was helping me a few rings I seen online that said they were in store & the first ring she said \" oh we just sold that ring\" the 2nd and 3rd ring I showed her she Said \" I don't think we have it\" & I was like \"why would it say it was in store if It wasnt?\" She couldn't give me an answer. She did everything in her power to convince me to keep the ring I had but that pissed me off even more so I still ended up returning the ring which I know they aren't happy about, but I wasn't happy with being pretty much only shown options that benefited them. They didn't treat me the same as the first experience & u just don't do your customers that way. Regardless. I will do everything to make sure everyone is aware of how crooked this place is.\n\nAlso, after returning the ring (which was leased throigh progressive) we made an account online to see how the process of the refund was going, come to find out our total was double the price we were told it would be in store from the kay employees. The deposit we put down was suppose to be 79 dollars and would also be the amount of our monthy payment & after looking online we discovered they charged us 86 dollars for the deposit & that our payments would be 91.60 WEEKLY! We were told 79 dollars and some change monthly and then it shot up to 91.60 weekly! They never went over the contract or interest rate with us.\n\nAfter the return I asked the employee if everything on their end was done and all we were waiting on was the leasing company to do their part. Called the leasing company to find out that they were waiting on KAYS to send the invoice over to get the refund process done & taken care of.\n\nCalled Kays once again to speak with the unprofessional, rude heifer off a \"Manager\" to make sure they sent the invoice in and to try to get some answers as to why she never vocally disclosed with us while signing the lease that our total was actually double the price she told us, & she would not answer the question. All she would say was \"you made the return, what else do you need, blah blah..\" How they can get away with is beyond me, after asking her multiple times times she actually HUNG UP on us. I called bk & another girl asnwer the phone, I continued to try to get answers we as customers deserved & as I was speaking the girl started pressing buttons on the phone & then hung up on me, incredibly immature & unprofessional. I am mind blown at my experience. I made a complaint with corporate, with the better business Bureau and got intouch with the district manager with the help of another kays manager of a different location!\nKAYS IS A FREAKING JOKE, THEY LIE & NEVER FULLY DISCLOSE THE FULL TRUTH & PRICE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS IN ORDER TO MAKE THEIR SALES & COMMISSION!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a68210bdbea6d:0xd5e4dcdfa346b928"}

Meffords was the first place we visited.  My fiancee lives two hours away from Florence and I was not in the habit of visiting jewelry stores, so I asked friends and coworkers who they recommended.  The number one answer I received was Mefford Jewelers.\n\nWe could not have been more pleased.  Toddman Thompson, the manager, spent a considerable amount of time talking with us and making us feel right at home.  He even encouraged us to visit other jewelry stores to see what they have to offer in terms of products and services.  I'm so glad we did.  We saw a lot of nice jewelry and met a lot of nice people, but none that came close to comparing with Mefford.\n\nMy fiancee decided she liked a ring at Mefford best of all.  Ironically, we found a ring just like it at another Jewelry store in Florence, but Mefford had a much better price as well as service.  I was thrilled to purchase the ring from Mefford Jewelers because my fiancee and I both know it's top quality at a great price from a family owned business right in my hometown of Florence.\n\nI would say to anyone looking for a jeweler to do business with in the Shoals area - visit Mefford Jewelers.

When you came in, both of us were already with customers working on custom designs, so we weren't able to break away to help you right then, and we were the only employees in the store today. When you walked over to look at our men's ring display, I acknowledged you but I don't think you noticed, which is fine, it was a little loud in the store at the time.

The salesperson, Taylor Schweighardt, was extremely nice and told me they generally did not do watch repair, however he asked me what I needed. I explained that the clasp kept opening while on my wrist and I was unable to wear it for fear of losing it. Since the repair was not on the watch itself but only on the band he attempted to repair it right then but was unsuccessful. However, he offered to call Citizen and find out if he could get a replacement band (witch he didn't have to do). He called me the next day and said that Citizen had discontinued that specific band and they had nothing comparable. Since that was the case, I told him he might as well just dispose of the watch since there was nothing else that could be done. I thanked him for going out of his way to do everything he could to salvage my watch. At home I got on line and considered purchasing a new watch but changed my mind since I had another less expensive watch I could wear as a replacement until I could purchase something better. Two days passed and Taylor had called and left me a message to call him.  When I did he had good news.  He and the owner of the shop (Billy) had put their heads together and figured out how to repair the band. I was so surprised, I was speechless!  I went to get it the next day and asked  how much I owed them and they said no charge.  I insisted on paying them but they said no, but any referrals would certainly be appreciated.  They specialize in stunning hand created top of the line diamond and gem jewelry, and I might add, thoughtful, top of the line service as well!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1559342193217, "text": "Thank you for the kind words, it was our pleasure to be able to assist you!"}, "gmap_id": "0x887d485e73215c41:0xf87e913e61a9a851"}

I cannot explain what sets Goldstein\u2019s apart until I share the negative experience I had at another jewelry store in Mobile, so I will share that first.\n\nLike I said, I had a ring repair somewhere else first. The other jewelry store not only sized my ring down (when I didn\u2019t ask for it to be sized down), but failed to claim fault for it.  My diamond had fallen out of my setting and I asked the other jewelry store to reset the diamond and also solder my wedding band and engagement band together. When I got my rings back from them, my ring was a size 5 3/4 which is 3/4 smaller than the original size, which was a  size 6 (rings also fit tighter when they\u2019re soldered together, so it fit much tighter than before.) I want to also note that their store never sized me in store either, but rather had the ring repaired with no size listed in their system. Goldstein\u2019s makes a practice of sizing you and placing the size in the system, anytime you come in for ring repairs so that it is never your word against theirs.\n\nWhen I came back to the other store, not only did they not apologize, they did not want to take apart my soldered rings and resize them individually (so as to protect the integrity of them) , but they recommended making the two rings into one. The sales associate also sized me as a size 7 which is A LOT larger than the size 5 3/4 ring they had sent me home with just a few days before!\n\nI felt something was off with how everything was being handled, so I decided to not have my repairs done there but instead have them done somewhere else...which would be how I ended up at Goldstein\u2019s a few days later.\n\nWhen I went to Goldstein\u2019s, they measured my finger and reassured me that yes, the other store had sized my ring incorrectly. The rings wouldn\u2019t even fit on my finger without redness and swelling (which the other jewelry store associate said was due to having large knuckles, or perhaps even the humid weather.)\n\nGoldstein\u2019s assured me they stood behind their sizing methods. The other jewelry store actually told me they didn\u2019t guarantee their fit and scoffed over the phone when asked if they guaranteed the fit. Goldstein\u2019s on the other hand, said that they do guarantee the fit they size you with in store. They didn\u2019t make me feel like I was being unreasonable at any step of the way, like I felt at the other store. They affirmed me, as one should do when providing quality customer service.\n\nGoldstein\u2019s measured me as a size 6 1/2  and I noticed they had a careful attention to fit, and also that their ring sizing methods seemed more legitimate than what I was offered at the other jewelry store (they used individual rings to size me at Goldstein\u2019s, and the other store used a keychain of sorts full of various sized rings. I was more impressed with the Goldstein\u2019s method because if you\u2019re getting rings soldered together, you want to see how the two stacked rings will fit your finger and that they come off easily, versus what was offered at the other store, with only one ring being placed on the finger to determine fit.)\n\nIf I had gone through with the second round of repairs at the other store, I would have been paying for extra gold that I would have had removed anyway because they sized me as a 7, and my true size is a 6 1/2, as determined by Goldstein\u2019s (my rings fit beautifully now!) Goldstein\u2019s got it right the FIRST time versus the other store which didn\u2019t get it right the first two times.\n\nAll this to say, Goldstein\u2019s did everything correctly and professionally. They even texted me to see how my rings were fitting a week later. I call that excellent customer service.\n\nIf you want a correct fit the first time with no back and forth issues that make you second guess yourself, and if you\u2019d rather have extra money in your pockets (unlike I do, since I had to pay for correct repairs that the other store failed to provide) then please, go to Goldstein\u2019s!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1601480386580, "text": "Thanks so much for the great review.

If only I knew my experience with them later will be so emotionally and mentally traumatizing, I'd have never stepped foot in that store.\nI had insisted I'd rather patronize a local business rather than purchase online contrary to what my boyfriend wanted. In the store, I chose a ring that was in the showcase. It wasn't my size so I was told they'd order one in my size, also the diamond for the ring was not kept in the store so i had to wait for over a month for it to come in store. Unfortunately my wedding was called off and so I decided to return the rings for a refund 6 days after purchase was made and three days since receiving it from the store. There is a 15 day return policy for a full refund. I was denied a full refund because as the store owner stated; \" Its bad for my business\" and offered a 50% refund instead, which i refused. I don't understand why I  should bargain for a refund I'm  entitled  to. When I insisted to be treated fairly and given my refund,the store owner  Richard Frank Jr,  made comments suggesting bias and racism against my color and country of origin.Insinuating I'm ignorant and stupid because I'm a foreigner from another country and had an accent.  I have never been treated like this in any other store environment and urge any other potential customers to beware and steer clear of this rude and racist  business.

Most recent I was in the store looking for a replacement chain, sterling silver for my granddaughter, who has struggles with speical needs, Angela found the perfect little affordable chain to fit our needs, and even added a little piece of chain, so she could adjust it on her neck, didn\u2019t charge us for her quick fix of placing the small charm on the necklace, that met so much to my granddaughter, I only paid for the small chain and we were out the door, as I was leaving she offered me a water for the road. That is such wonderful service, the kind you don\u2019t get anywhere else. That charm was left at another store for over two weeks, just to be placed on a chain, when it wasn\u2019t ready for my granddaughter\u2019s flight, the jewelry store had a hard time finding our ticket and never seemed to mind, because we were only spending less then fifty. If ever I spend thousands, and I hope to do that one day soon, I will spend it at Goldstein \u2018s. Thank Goldstein\u2019s for caring about the person and not the dollar amount, and a special thank you to Angela, a fine representative of the Goldstein\u2019s name. Sincerely, Mona Wade", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1526243503077, "text": "Mona, everyone who walks through our door matters! We look at all of our customers as they are family!

Unfortunately, our experience was nothing like the reviews.  We wanted to redesign/enhance my wedding set and explained what we were looking for. The store manager took one look at my set and informed me it would cost us more money to custom design a new wedding set using my original stones. She then proceeded to show us settings and told us if we wanted to use my diamond they could put it in one of the settings, made a \"joke\" that I could have two sets and decide which set I wanted to wear based on the outfit I was wearing. Showed us countless settings then informed us to draw a picture of what we had in mind and bring it in.  Throughout the experience, a price point was never discussed.

The owner changed my battery and then admitted to me that he had broken the watch crystal (clear glass over watch face). He reassured me that he would fix my watch. He is a liar, thief and con-artist. In the almost two months that they were \u201cfixing\u201d my watch I went 3 times to try to get any information. Finally I just gave up and told them to give me my watch broken. The owner was rude, impolite and intimidating.\nWhenever; I informed him that I wanted my watch immediately regardless of the fact that 2 months later it was STILL BROKEN. He said that he had tried to \u201cmake it right\u201d and that he had been looking to buy me another watch from EBAY. The watch I have is a limited edition Android Prism watch that is no longer being made. He said that he had been unable to find any watch similar to mine. While I do not watch a watch from EBAY; I would like to point out that in the last 4 minutes I have found over 5 watches currently for sale on EBAY with the exact same crystal. These are not cheap Wal-Mart watches; he simply did not even try to find a similar watch.\nThe owner stated that since he had been unable to find a similar watch on ebay (lie) that he would have to send the watch out to Las Vegas to have a crystal custom made. If that was the case then why after 2 months was my watch still sitting on the counter? Why had they not already sent it to be fixed?  It does not take 2 months to drive to the post office. It is apparent that they had no plans on trying to fix my watch.\nWhen the watch was originally broken by the owner, it had a tiny chip in the upper right corner. The watch has received even more damage since it has been in their possession. The original chip has spread to 3 times the size along with a new crack on the upper left. The back is covered in DOZENS of scratches and the hands do not seem to be functioning correctly.\nThe owner did not even try to fix my watch. He did not even offer a replacement. Under no circumstances should anyone ever go to these people. Now all I have is a broken piece of crap, and no way to have it fixed or repaired. They broke my watch and refused to fix it.

My husband I went to the Galleria location to get my size and we wanted to look at the one I had found. Unfortunately it was an \u201conline only\u201d item. The woman who got my size acted as if she was not only inconvenienced by us but as if she was better than us. So my husband ended up ordering the ring and gave it to me on Christmas Eve. When I took it out of the box and put it on I noticed one of the diamonds were missing. My husband immediately called their 1-800 customer service number and they directed us to take the ring to the nearest Zales and they would decide wether to have the ring repaired or replaced. Being Christmas Eve night the location was closed and closed the next day for Christmas. We went to the Galleria location on December 26th and when we explained the situation to an employee they went and got the manager. The manager then asked what we wanted done. I told them I wanted it fixed. Then they asked if I had the paper work for the diamond bond that came with it. I told them no that it should be fixed period considering it was a brand new ring. After about 30 minutes of talking to the manager she said she would take care of it and we wouldn\u2019t have to use the diamond bond and we wouldn\u2019t have to pay for anything. I even went ahead and bought the extended warranty on the metal and the sapphire. The manager said it should be ready by January 7th. When that day got here my husband called and it was not ready yet. Well my husband got a call yesterday, January 10th, that the ring was ready and that it was going to cost $110. When we got there to pick up the ring the woman that was working was the rude woman that waited on us before and the one that rang up my extended warranty. She told us it was going to be the $110. I told her we weren\u2019t paying a dime that the manager was supposed to be taking care of it. Apparently the manager was not there and had made no notes of anything!! I got extremely frustrated and upset. Eventually, after getting verbal and irrate, another employee came over and tried to calm me down. The woman ended up giving us the ring and not charging us. None of this should have ever happened. I will never buy another thing from Zales again!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889221402e1fc1d:0xdf5089bd7c120266"}

Wasn't. Then, at 5pm, I was told she left to pick up my ring, would be back in 15 minutes and I could go ahead and head up there. 30 minutes later I'm there. My ring isn't. An hour and 15 minutes later and she's not back with my ring. An hour and a half later, she's there with my ring. Isn't nice. Isn't happy. Isn't smiling. This is the MANAGER. She hands me my rings, doesn't ask if they fit ok, doesn't ask if I like them, doesn't ask if that would complete my purchase or if I need anything. Throws it in a box, hands it to me without saying a word and walks away! They talked bad about me because I'm already under the pressure of my wedding, getting my rings on time and I'm mad because they've told me lies all day long! Of course I'm going to be upset! I was lied to several times! What sucks for them?? I was preparing to buy a bracelet and a pair of earrings but instead, I walked out. When we got home we closed our credit account with them. TWO stars because my rings are absolutely beautiful. But, I will never go there again! She was sooo nice when she was selling me the rings but after she got her commission, she no longer cared if she upset me or not. She's the manager, yet her and her two employees sat there and talked about me while all three staring at me! So, two stars. For my beautiful rings and them helping me get my rings on time. What really sucks is I already left her a great review from when she wanted my money and sold me the rings. I'd love to speak to someone higher up, but they all seem to believe their employees, even if there are cameras. BTW, when I left, I went to Kay's and bought my earrings and bracelets from them!

This Zales location is where my husband, the man in uniform in the picture below, bought my wedding ring (#19868058) on October 2017. When first purchased from Zales, the ring had a morganite stone, which was beautiful, but I had my heart set on aquamarine. We also purchased the lifetime warranty on the ring, and later another warranty just on the aquamarine stone I picked out. To make a long story short (for character count) during our time at Zales we were lied to, given false information, struggled getting in touch with the store as well as returned calls, and were pressured to purchase an aquamarine stone at a price much higher than previously discussed. Overall, my husband and I were very displeased with the service we received at Zales. Anyway, after a painstaking process, I finally got my ring back around December-January with the new aquamarine stone. Being fed up with Zales, my husband and I decided to go to Kay to have our wedding bands made. We went the same day I got my ring back from Zales to begin the process of ordering our wedding bands through Kay. His wedding band was relatively simple and took only about a month or 2 until we were able to pick it up, however, mine had to be custom made to fit the oval of my wedding ring. I picked the french beaded design Kay had for my wedding band to be made and they put all the information into the computer system. Kay assured us the bands would be ready in time for our wedding and that they would give us a call when I was able to pick my engagement ring up and to review and approve a molding of my wedding band. About 2 months went by and we hadn't heard anything, but I needed my ring for our engagement party. I had it for about a week and was told Kay needed it back to make the wedding band. Finally at about April or May we received the call that I was able to pick up my engagement ring, but never had a molding to look at and approve. In late May, about 2 weeks before we were getting married, Kay called and said my wedding band was ready. Upon seeing my wedding band that we had waited 4-5 months for the first time, I burst out crying uncontrollably and couldn't even speak to the lady. They had made the band in the wrong design. I was told that I either had to use that band to be married with and then we could start the process all over again after our honeymoon or that I wouldn't have anything to be married with. After several discussions with corporate, we were able to get our money back in full for my wedding band. I felt so defeated... I only had my engagement ring about 2 months out of our 9 month engagement period and I had no wedding band to be married with. Luckily, we found a local, family owned store that was able to make my wedding band in 2 weeks. Lou's in fact overdid themselves and made my wedding band OVERNIGHT! I saw the molding one day and was able to pick up my wedding set the next day! They saved us. But back to my aquamarine wedding ring. On the 5th day of our cruise I lost my stone. As you can see in the pictures below, the prong completely broke off and the stone fell out. I searched the ship for 4 hours, sobbing the entire time and finally a little girl found the stone at the bottom of the pool! We took the ring back to Zales as soon as we got back to port and they soldered a new prong on in about 2 weeks or so. Not even a month later when we were in Savannah for my birthday, I was taking my wedding set off to clean it and the band completely snapped in half (picture bellow). I took my ring to a local Zales a few days later, but not until another area on the band broke, leaving my ring in 2 pieces. Since we had the complete warranty on the ring and stone and this was the second time the ring had broken I told Zales that I wanted my aquamarine stone put into a new setting. Well now I have my ring back. No new setting, just soldered in 3 separate places. Now I'm scared just to put the ring on my finger. Why are we treated like this when we've paid so much money?", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_G9nZMWGEKaykUu4_hJqkMuPOTGvyA-tVHezQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkZzymrZ58H7rgSUcx4aAYMPcnQuSVKUFkoJZt=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhIvb-S9YhwDKqyDwFWD3rOrPGXQ9TQd-v51p7=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da185689b79:0x50916a0e1ccfac2a"}

I went in for a new battery for my husband's Movado watch. I inquired about a piece being welded back on a gold hoop earring that I had brought in on a Saturday back before the pandemic. The owner was not there but a young man was with an unkempt appearance. He quoted me $45. I told him that was more than I paid for them so I guess I would just sell them for scrap. So currently while in the jewelry shop, I inquired with the owner who informed me they have a $30/minimum. I was not told of that the 1st time I inquired. The owner began chatting saying, \"You know, I went to the dealership the other day, they told me my tire was going to be $150, I told them, no, it should be $10.\" Then he said, \"I went to the grocery store, they said my groceries were $100, I told them, no, it should be $10.\" While putting the battery in the watch, he stated, \"You know this watch has the wrong size battery?\" \"The battery is too big.\" I informed him it was purchased at a pawn shop so I have no clue who put the battery in but it worked for a long time. He said, \"Well, that's what you get buying from a pawn shop,\" in a condescending tone. I never requested a lower price on the earring repair. I will not pay for something only to be spoken to in this manner. His level of sarcasm was ridiculous. I will not be a patron of his business any longer nor will I ever refer anyone to him again.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1617377765626, "text": "Hello, glad you have been using us for many years. Sorry you had a bad experience this time around. Hope the battery that we put into your watch stays working longer than the one you got from the pawn shop. As for your earring. You came in the store without it and you did want a price on how much it would cost to fix it. But we can not give a price on any item unless we actually see it. You said you talked with me before the pandemic and I told you it would cost 45 dollars apparently. And like you said in your comment \"that was more than I paid for them\".\nWe don't do any repairs on earrings for free and we do have a minimum price we charge on basic repairs like those. I know you wanted a cheaper price because you complained to the owner about it. That is why he gave you examples of other scenarios like the ones you posted in your comment. Hes by no means trying to upset you or offend you in anyway. He just wanted you to understand that we don't barter with prices and we can't just give you a price without seeing the item. The owner also is very honest and upfront with any problems with repairs. That is also why he was concerned and wanted to let you know your watch already had the wrong battery put in it. As for me, I am the young man replying to your review and I do reply to all reviews that concern me. I do believe calling me unkempt was rude and uncalled for especially since I never said anything bad at all to you and barely talked with you in our store. Sorry my appearance is not up to your standards. As always have a nice day and I hope you have a wonderful Easter."}, "gmap_id": "0x889bb2652292ca55:0x21841c55b0c7bb0d"}

We dropped the ring off to him about 10 o'clock in the morning. We called him after 2 o'clock to see if it was ready. He said he would call when it was done. We never got a call so we went up to his store around 4:30 and he was just as rude when we picked up the ring like he did not even won't us in his store. Would not recommend this place to anyone.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1513739726645, "text": "This is the co owner and I was actually the one who took in your wifes ring. I did mention to her sizing / cleaning the ring would be at her risk since it did have rose gold plated on each side. The ring was almost as if someone took a paint brush and painted it barely with rose gold on the sides. However a little bit of the rose gold plating did come off while cleaning it. We were sorry about that and we did tell her if she did get another ring we would size it for free. And she did come back into the store today with you and I actually handled the conversation, and I by no means was rude so I'm sorry if you felt that I or the owner was rude in anyway. And I'm not shocked at all that you came back because we wanted to make things right. As far as getting your ring done and calling you. Christmas is a very busy time and we can't promise to get your repair done right away. And can't promise to call you when it is done. Thats why we tell customers it may take just an hour or two or longer and to just check back in with us. But we did want to ensure we got your repair done and you and your wife were happy with it before the day ended. And thats all that matters in the end. Sorry you felt like we did nothing to fix the problem and that you felt that we were rude and you recommend no one to visit our store. Hope you have wonderful Christmas and a Happy New Year with many many years to come!"}, "gmap_id": "0x889bb2652292ca55:0x21841c55b0c7bb0d"}

I originally went in with some family members looking at engagement rings and Amanda stated that they could do sizing for the engagement ring they liked if it didn't fit. I had a ring I got for our 2nd Anniversary that had gotten to small.\nSeveral other Jewelers told me it could not be sized. So it sat in a special case hoping one day it would fit. When I spoke to Amanda she said she thought they would be able to size it. Just bring it in and they would see. I found out that the reason my ring didn't fit was because I was sold the wrong size. Amanda sized the ring, sized my finger and checked to make sure none of the stones were missing. She was so polite and professional. I felt so comfortable with them I even gave them my engagement and wedding ring to be cleaned. Amanda did the same thing checked to make sure I wasn't missing stones or had loose stones. I got my rings back today and I am so happy with them. Diamond Depot is definitely where's all my jewelry will go in the future. And I already have my eyes on my next Anniversary present.

The customer service was friendly, but they were unable to complete the service due to \u201cnot having a piece to close the back.\u201d Since it was a \u201chigh end\u201d watch, they needed to send it to a company for 2 weeks + $20. Didn\u2019t seem right so I decline and they didn\u2019t charge me for the new battery they gave me. I left with a bag full of watch parts. Later, I realized the gasket was damaged, I was missing parts, and with a battery that doesn\u2019t work. This watch is a standard Tissot, and doesn\u2019t need \u201cspecial\u201d parts to change out batteries. I will send my business elsewhere.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1595683816573, "text": "Hi Joseph.  In the 1000+ Watches we work on yearly, we do occasionally have a watch repair that requires a higher level of service than our on site Watch Repair shop feels comfortable offering. In those instances, we send the watch to our repairman in Texas, whom we have worked with for years, and they will repair and send back to us. The service is excellent and the pricing is very affordable for our customers.\n\nOut of all the watches we have replaced a battery on this year, yours was the only one that we needed to send off for further inspection. The reason was because of a damaged gasket (so it appeared) - but certainly it was beyond our comfort level of repair locally. Rather than continue to work with it locally, we felt the need to move it to a higher tier repairman so that we could offer the best service on your watch. Your response was that you had someone in Georgia who has worked on it before and could put the back on with the gasket, no problem. You seemed as if it was no problem and we assumed that was the case.\n\nIt appears that there your repairman in Georgia saw a similar issue that we did - that there was still a problem.   Our repairmen would have had no issue providing the service that was needed to complete the task but I understand that you didn\u2019t feel comfortable with us taking care of the problem for you further. I\u2019m sorry you felt that way.  We certainly do everything we can to provide a level of service that makes people feel comfortable with allowing us to take care of them from start to finish. I believe, as you can see by the reviews, that we have always done our part to make things right and offer a service that ends with satisfaction.  While you may have felt uneasy about letting us finish the repair for you, I do not believe we have any type of reviews or history that would warrant that feeling from you. Instead, I believe it\u2019s just the opposite - that we have a proven record (shown on reviews) of making sure all of our customers are fully satisfied and we work hard to maintain this level of service.\n\nEither way, we are sorry you were unable to do business with us and see our service through to the end. But we wish you all the best."}, "gmap_id": "0x888bb172c55c3801:0xdc319865b7fa1df6"}

I had a loose diamond that I wanted to incorporate into a unique engagement ring. I work in Atlanta, so I decided to visit a well known jewelry designer in Buckhead. She was very knowledgeable, but had her own idea for the ring, and didn\u2019t seem to listen to what I wanted.  Frustrated and disappointed after our third meeting, I decided to scrap the whole project.\n\nWhen explaining the bad experience to a friend, she mentioned that Terry had recently designed an engagement ring for a relative which turned out beautifully. Since I live in Oxford, I figured I didn\u2019t have anything to lose so I dropped in one day to check it out. During our first meeting, Terry really took the time to listen to me, made notes and offered suggestions when I asked for them.\n\nOver the course of the design process, I completely changed what I wanted, but Terry and Amanda were very patient and encouraging. When I decided that I wanted side stones, they arranged to bring in three sets for me to view with my diamond to find the perfect match.  After I received the original CAD rendering, I realized that there were a few things that I wanted to change. Each suggestion was promptly incorporated into the design and a new CAD rendering sent.\n\nI was able to pick up my finished ring on Christmas Eve, and it was more stunning than I had ever imagined. Even though this was a custom design that involved a lot of personal service, the price for the setting was very reasonable.  I have worked with various jewelers on other projects and I can say without a doubt that Terry and Amanda\u2019s design capabilities and professionalism are the best I\u2019ve experienced.

I took it, along with the wedding bands she & dad wore, and her \"lucky\" ring. (The \"lucky ring\" was found on a trip to PCB some 25-30yrs ago. She spotted something shiny in the water and fished it out.) They took all the gold from the rings, plus some old necklaces and earrings, in as trade, and actually gave me $ back!

I am a flight attendant and have honestly looked everywhere.   Funny Diamond Depot was right in my backyard.    We live about 40 minutes away in Ashville, AL and well worth the drive.  Much closer than Atlanta or Birmingham.  Amanda our diamond consultant was INCREDIBLE!!!   She has an awesome personality and was so patient with listening to our needs and wants.   Amanda\u2019s knowledge was also helpful.  We ended up special ordering my ring and could not be happier. Just WOW! LOVE IT!  The Oweners were there as well and adds the nice family atmosphere.   I think it is important to support small local businesses, but We got to do this and get the best service and quality we were looking for.  Their prices and customer service are not beatable.  We have found a local jeweler that we will recommend to anyone! Near or far.\nTHANK YOU Diamond Depot!\nThank you Amanda, & Terry for all your service!\nDon and Marci", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1592332864449, "text": "Thank you for the wonderful comment!
