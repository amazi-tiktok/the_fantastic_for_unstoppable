Maybe that's my only option...but the scars were VERY visible no matter how hard she tried to convince me they weren't. I understand bc of my anatomy, I may have limited options, but we said from the beginning, anchor scars were a deal breaker. His portfolio was unimpressive, and a lot of women's breasts looked better to me and my husband in the before pics than the afters.\n\nI wouldn't hire a plastic surgeon for their personality, and this one was supposed to be a \"perfectionist,\" but the way he judged me the entire time, and pretty much made me feel incredibly unattractive and stupid made me want to leave his office as fast as possible.

I first went to him in 2013 for a surgical procedure. The results I got from Dr. Howard were simply amazing and gave me years of beauty and personal confidence and happiness. I know that I cannot attribute those results to anything but to the skill of Dr. Howard's hands. I went back to him for the same procedure two weeks ago and I could not not be happier with the results. I hesitated about my timing, but from the very first call into his office, I felt confident about my decision to come back to Dr. Howard. The magic of his hands is there as it was in 2013.  Dr. Howard and his staff are absolutely wonderful, caring, nice. After the procedure I have been treated with kindness and I feel reassured. I could not be happier with my results again this time.

Dr.Hedden at my consult seemed nice enough it was a bit of a wait but he apologized for it no biggie or so I thought . I must admit that they do tell you that you probably won't go back immediately you will have some wait. Well I was coming from out of town my surgery was to be at 9:30 am I didn't get called back until 12:20. I had asked what was taking so long as I was paying for a caretaker by the hour and hadn't eaten the night before, I asked the Dr. personally about it he said sorry but sometimes in surgery things happen it shouldn't be much longer he seemed to get agitated but still professional offered me a refund I stated no since I had waited over 3 hours by this time please proceed as soon as possible. While another hour and 30 minutes go by with me in this thin bathroom no nurse or anything comes to check on me I put my clothes back on and ask the lady at the front how much longer she states she didn't know and she went and found someone. By this time I go back to my room then comes in Patrick who was very nice and was going to start my IV, they called him out of the room then comes in Nurse Manager Win (Nguyen ). She states how can we make you happy I'm like at this point just get my arm surgery started and I'm happy I told her I was fine I just wanted to get it over with since I have come all this way. She states I dont think we can make you happy you're going to give the practice a \"bad review\" I said I am about the lack of communication but I can't say anything about surgery. I was like I'm over it I just want to get my arm lift done so I can go home. She basically said they didn't want to do it because I complained about the wait time. Who or what person taught these people business etiquette I wasn't loud I just stated that I would be giving a review to let people know how they treat their patients. I stated again I'm fine she extended a discount on cool sculpting I accepted I thought everything was fine. Dr. Hedden comes in very very nasty and stated we're not doing your surgery and we're giving you a full refund and I told him I was fine I wasn't happy but not angry enough not to have my surgery after I have waited over 5 hours he storms out wouldn't hear it. They didn't give me a on refund on my travel or hotel, informed the spa not to do my cool sculpting, and also would not honor a gift certificate that I was given. I wasn't all smiles and giggles, but I didn't get loud or curse. The staff couldn't believe it and said they had never heard of such. Please don't go there Dr. Hedden is a bully and don't dare ask to question why you are waiting or you too could be out of money and time beware stay away awful !!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1504756710051, "text": "We always try to do everything to accommodate patient's. What happened in this case which she is not disclosing is that she requested a late arrival time. She was told in doing that she could not be given an exact start time but that she would be following other cases. She expressed that she was upset about the wait when she first arrived. Our office manager offered her and her care giver a free spa service for the inconvenience. She seemed to be happy at that point. When she was brought back I explained we were sorry for any delay but that when someone ask for a delayed start time that it becomes more dependent on the cases before them which are not something that can be predicted. She then explained she was upset that she was paying for a sitter she hired and was having to pay her. I explained we would pay for the sitters time for her delay. Again she seemed happy with that. She then told the nurse that she also wanted some other procedures for free or she would write a bad review if she was not given them. She had voiced this to several staff members. I then went back into the room and told her I did not feel comfortable operating on someone who was blackmailing the practice in an attempt to get procedures for free. That this was not the right way to start a doctor patient relationship and that we would offer her a full refund and cover her sitter for any inconvenience but that I could not proceed now that threats were made in an attempt to get more free services when we had already tried to do so much for her. She then went up to the spa and asked for monetary exchange for the free spa services we had just given her. We always do everything we can to help our patients and do whatever we can to make their experience as nice as possible but this was not our fault. There is a reason we are one of the busiest practices in the country and it's because we do great work and take care of our patients. We treat everyone as if they were family.

I would NEVER recommend him for anything. They were 5 hours behind the day I got my surgery. I went almost two days without food or water. When I went back to have the IV put in, because I was so dehydrated it took two different people to stick me about 12 times. Finally got back and they stuck me in the supply closet/room where all the implants was. I was like what the heck. I should have walked out. I told the anesthesia to please give me something for nausea before they woke me up, due to I will start thowing up. I woke up in a wheelchair, at my car, 8pm at night, throw up bowl and throwing my guts up. The anesthesia basically said okay to my husband and took the wheelchair and took off. I felt like I had been hit by a train. I thought I was truly going to die that night.  I was sick and hurt for days. When I went back I was so extremely disappointed in my upper and lower eye lift. Dr Hedden was like, oh well that\u2019s all I can do. Long story short, breast augmentation drop huge in 2 years, I had them removed by another surgeon. The other surgeon also told me Dr Hedden did not remove the fatty tissue in my lower eyelid, so that\u2019s why I still had sagging. I was also told Dr Hedden\u2019s office was known for breast implants in and out, in and out. Trust me, you get what you pay for.  Go to a better surgeon!!!

I personally checked every Glenda as well as the one and only Tippett but who has a different first name. I looked at all of those patients charts to see if anyone may have had the surgery this person talks about and no one did. So she most likely has us confused with another practice. I\u2019m going to respond to this review though just to give some clarification on our practice and how this could not have happened. First of all no one is ever asked or told to go without food or water for more than 6 hours before their scheduled surgery time. That\u2019s just no safe. Second this person states she was put in a closet. Not really sure what practice could really look like that but ours obviously does not. Anyone reading this can simply take the virtual tour which shows our operating rooms and see that we are probably the nicest surgery center in Alabama and with cardiac size operating rooms. So I really believe she has us confused with another practice. We do all types of cosmetic surgery and are world renowned for all types of cosmetic breast surgery as well. But for the last 15 years I have always charged the same price. I just think that\u2019s doing right by the Patient by trying to make plastic surgery more affordable. But what she put as what she paid is nowhere closed to what we charge for the procedures she states she had. We always remove fat when lid surgery is performed but some fat has to remain around the orbit to cushion and protect the eye. We also have some of the best anesthesia staff in the city and always give patients nausea medication and never have someone leave before their wide awake and able to take care of themselves. Anesthesia does not wheel them to their car. Our recovery nurses help them outside. Lastly I give my cell number to every single patient that comes through our office if someone has a problem I would hope they would actually call the number. I give out my number because I truly do care about all of our patients that\u2019s why I even still make house calls if needed."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889160ab45d4869:0x3e6975f2afcb69a5"}

I have contacted his office serveral times to discuss the issues and was brushed off. I will now be seeking a malprimalpr lawsuit, as the implants have caused more and more pain over the years and made my job as an exotic dancer impossible to perform. I can not even look in the mirror without crying and I suffer a lot of pain. I would not recommend this man to anyone. He acts like he is the best doctor until you have an issues .my deformity issues showed as soon as the swelling was down and I was informed that this was his mistake. I am also suffering CC due to him placing textureed implants when this was not what I was asked for at all. His resolution to this issue was to just remove the inplants he placed, leaving me with scars and saggy breasts. I plan to gather all of the women I have found in online support groups that he has wronged.\nEdit*** I am most definitely one of your patients and have the serial numbers on a card to prove that you used a textured Sientra implant on me. When I confronted Dr. Hedden about this and the double bubble within weeks after surgery, he told me that he would remove my implants and not offer any money back or to replace the implants. I wore all support recommended and didn't try to go back to dancing until years after surgery, which I can also prove. I also have records from a plastic surgeon that I saw in Georgia within months after my surgery, who informed me that a doctor should not have used the implants used, neither texture nor size, neither of which Dr. Hedden spoke to me about before or after surgery. All he did waswbrush me off. I have been suffering since surgery and plan to sue if something is not done to make this right, and especially since you are now denying the use of textured implants. Also, I don't have my full name on this site and use a nickname for my own safety.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1540401214274, "text": "We tried to find this patient in our system but no one comes up with her name or anything close to it. We also do not use textured implants as the carry a risk of patients developing a form of cancer. So I\u2019m not sure if this is a patient of ours or even a true patient.  But I will try to respond to her issues. We do perform close to a thousand implants each year and do have several patients who are also dancers. I always try to stress this to dancers ..that you must wear very good support during the healing process and reframe from dancing for the first 3-4 weeks. Otherwise your pocket is not healed enough to prevent migration of the implant down and to the side which is the direction the muscle wants to push it. Patients that come in with no droopiness and wanting a good small implant do not have their muscle changed and so most of the time the implant will not shift much. Also going above the muscle would typically not lead to this but patients would be at higher risk for rippling and capsular contracture (CC). But if someone wants either a very large implant or they have severe droopiness then it will lead to some of the inferior pectoral muscle having to be detached to allow the larger implant to fit or the droopiness to be camouflaged. Thus running the risk of lateral drift if the muscles are used too soon such as an exotic dancer going back to work right away and or not wearing support. So it is very important to always follow the guidelines from your surgeon to minimize any risk of complications. We always offer bliss insurance which would cover any cost of fixing any issues as well. So I\u2019m not sure she is a true patient or our patient because she would have most likely obtained this.\nAddendum; she called our office yesterday and is using a different name here but she is very mistaken she does not have textured implants. My nurse called the implant company and gave the serial number to them as well. This is not the appropriate placed to discuss these issues as she should come back in and see us but she wishes to slander us and make accusations that are completely wrong. When someone comes in with droopiness , one breast lower than the other and their breast drifting to the sides because of their chest wall you have a few options all of which are always offered to patients. Asymmetry and droopiness.. best treated with a lift with implants ( cost twice as much and leaves scar that not all patients want ) or biplaner breast augmentation ( less cost , less , scaring but carries the risk of feeling the implant at the bottom and slight double bubble) or going above the muscle (requires silicone, higher risk of capsular contracture). If she really wants this to be educational for you she would consent to her pictures being shown which will show where she started and where she was 3 months out and let everyone judge for themselves. Now it\u2019s very easy to seek a second opinion and a doctor not that busy to say ( without even seeing your before pictures) that something was done wrong. You must understand not all doctors offer all options and some have no experience with biplaner approaches. They will be quick to say something was done wrong so they can charge you to be reoperated on. Always be careful of the doctor giving an opinion without seeing your before pictures. Again this is not the best way to discuss your concerns."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889160ab45d4869:0x3e6975f2afcb69a5"}

I had a breast augmentation in July of 2012 and it was okay. I did 290cc of saline I can't say anything bad about that surgeon. I just wanted an upgrade I wanted them bigger and I wanted silicone! I had a friend that went to dr. Hedden and she was very pleased with him, so I decided I scheduled a consultation with him it took me about 2 months to get a consultation. I was in the office for probably 15 mins before I was called into a room to see dr. Hedden! Me and my boyfriend played around with the samples while we waited to see what size we liked. I was kinda hard for me to tell what it would look like since I already had implants. Originally I was wanting to go to a 450! But me and my boyfriend continued to talk about it and said we really couldn't even tell a difference so we picked 500 (he wanted me to go a lot bigger being a male of course) but I researched and researched females my size and 500 cc of silicone gel, and I truly liked the size and I felt those would look best! My consultation was July the 14th and that day we scheduled the surgery for august the 10th. My surgery was scheduled for 8 I got back in the room about 9 around 10 the took me back for surgery. I remember waking up around 12:15 and I left at 12:30, I ended up getting 525cc silicone gel! It was a super easy process. I felt like everything was done in a timely manor. I stayed the night the night of my surgery and had to follow up post op day one, while I was there I got some juvaderm injections in my lips! It was pretty painful but I have to say I absolutely love them! They a beautiful I've received so many compliments on my lips! I'm now post op day 5 I can pretty much do anything I'm still a little sore! I will return to work Friday and I can't wait to show off my lips! I highly recommend dr. Hedden and his facility. He truly listens to you and your concerns. He puts his patients first. The staff is awesome as well, they make you feel at home. And the anesthesiologist was great to!

This leaves the patient with one breast larger than the other, an unnatural look and feel. Because of the hematoma it also stretched and scarred my nipple. Proffit used the wrong size implant on the left side even though we consulted on size before surgery. He placed the implant so far under my armpit it is diffcult to shave and embarrassing to wear sleeveless tops because of the excess skin. On the right side he gave me a hollowed out hole  with a different type implant that is also badly placed. This is not what we had decided on during the consult. He has not learned to put in the gel implants without giving his patients a hematoma. I am not the first.  During my surgery I also had Juvederm around my mouth, he only did one side of my mouth. This was distrubing! I guess he forgot to do the other side. With the 38 years of experience you would think he would be better skilled and have some regard to his patients out come and his reputation. I paid $5,000 for this surgery without insurance. I pleaded with him to fix the hematoma. He wanted to charge me $3,000 to fix the hematoma he gave me.

Then I came back and you did your magic makeover on me. You took all that skin and snatched it back even better than I was before including my scratch marks from 2 children. You sculpting my waistline like I had been in the gym all my days. My breast lift looks like Im a 20 years old again.  You absolutely did an amazing job and gave me back my confidence and my active life with my family again.  The only downside is I am happily married and have to fight the guys off daily now.  One gentleman who was 55 years old, asked how old I was and I said your age. He continued to say, women don\u2019t look like you at our age because he had been looking for a while.  I didn\u2019t share my secret, I just said thank you. But he kept saying wow you are beautiful so maybe I should have.  Needless to say it is a good thing I love myself, my husband and GOD.  Yes, my husband loves my new body also but he is more excited that I will  come Jet-skiing with him now and I\u2019m back at the beach again feeling confident.

I finally got up the nerve to go to a consultation to see about a breast reduction. I went to see Dr Feagin and immediately knew that he was the right Dr for me! He was very reassuring that I would not be disappointed and that the pain afterward was minimal. I had my surgery on October 3, 2018. I had to have a Nipple graft because of the size and weight of my breasts. I spent the night in the hospital and went home the next day. The recovery process went amazingly well and pain was minimal. I went from a 38E to a 38D and could not be happier with the results! I would recommend Dr Feagin to anyone!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88928d989c13f943:0xf45fac2093fc84db"}

Please do not take heed to those one star ratings because they obviously mistakenly left ratings for the wrong doctor. My story:  I was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a bilateral mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction. Not knowing to research plastic surgeons I was \"assigned\" a surgeon with the large PS firm in town.  This large firm was very busy and doctor and staff mechanical and cold.  I felt like just another number to them. This reconstruction was totally botched and I ended up with tissue necrosis with large gaping holes in my new breasts and severe infections. I was mortified and heartbroken. I decided to try another doctor and went to a prominent PS in Birmingham. He fixed the tissue necrosis crisis and then performed another reconstruction. Botched Again.  I had survived breast cancer but was now depressed from the constant pain and from the results of these reconstructions.  I was about to give up when I found Dr. Wilson's website and decided to give it one last shot. From the moment I met him I knew I was finally in the right place.   He is extremely kind and compassionate and a truly gifted surgeon. He is a perfectionist which I absolutely mean  in the best way as a compliment. My results are PERFECT and I couldn't be happier.  Nurse Barbara is also very kind, helpful and easy to talk to as is Ashley. The entire office gets a high five from me.

I got my ear pierced at the end of 2015, which caused bumps to grow by the piercings that keep growing and growing. They are called keloid scars, and they are the reason I went to see Dr Wilson.\n\n\u200bFrom the first day I didn't like him. He seemed arrogant and didn't really give me any options as far as treatment. He said that they were too small to remove surgically but that we could inject them with Kenalog to soften them and possibly shrink them but that they would not go away. I asked what else we could do if the Kenalog didn't work and he said nothing because they were too small and removing them would definitely cause them to grow back.\n\nI decided to stick to him given that I had already paid for the doctor's visit and that I was consulting with another plastic surgeon (a friend's mom, in another country) on the phone and she agreed on the Kenalog shots as the first step of the treatment. The fact that I didn't like him didn't necessarily mean that he'd be a bad doctor, right?\n\nWe did the injections and a month later when I went back for the second round he said that the first round didn't do anything and that there was nothing else to do. No plan B, no nothing. That consultation lasted no more than 10 minutes and I was sent a bill for $65 for it. The first consultation was about $70 and the one round of injections was around $60. The whole thing was about $200. Not too bad but given the amount of time he spent with me that was steep.\n\n6 months passed and the bumps had grown dramatically, so I decided to see the doctor again. I called and I was asked for a picture. I sent it via email but didn't hear back. I called back a week later they said that they had issues with their internet so asked me to send the picture again The doctor said that he would remove them surgically for $1500 if done privately. I asked about filing this with my health insurance and his office said that they would have to get it pre-approved, which takes 4-6 weeks. I asked for the CPT codes to talk to my health insurance myself (to see if they would cover the procedure without having to wait the 6 weeks) and they said they would get them to me once they talked to the doctor. I waited for a week and called back to ask for the codes but they said that they had been busy and hadn't had time to get them. It has been months. They never called me back.\n\u200b\n\u200bI decided to go to another doctor because I didn't like Dr Wilson in the first place and because his office was wasting my time (which meant that my keloids kept getting bigger). I went to my consultation and the new doctor told me that one round of injections alone wouldn't have helped, but that I should have had multiple rounds of injections instead. He also said that I should have gotten them removed when they were smaller because the chances of them coming back are way lower when not so much tissue is removed. He recommended that we did rounds of injections and then surgery, and provided other things to try if plan A wasn't successful.\n\nIn other words, Dr Wilson wasted my time (and money), stopped treatment too early, and gave me bad advice. He sent me home and discouraged me from treating the keloid scars for months. The bumps got way bigger (about 5 times the size) and when I got them removed I had much greater chances of them coming back. Not to mention that when they were smaller they didn't hurt but when they got bigger they hurt to sleep on and the injections were much more painful. I lived with these huge itchy painful bumps for about a year thanks to him, plus his office didn't even have the courtesy to call me back with stupid CPT codes to see if my insurance would cover any of it. I was (and still am) SO ANGRY I looked into suing for negligence, but apparently no death = no case. Now I just want to warn people so they don't go through the same. He might be good at other cosmetic procedures, but SCAR TREATMENT IS NOT ONE OF THEM. I wish he would have told me that this wasn't his specialty and recommended another doctor, instead of experimenting on me.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862148fffffffff:0xf4918f0b9816b453"}

Lastly, Dr. Sami personally contacted me the evenings of each procedure, I was pleasantly shocked and excited to have my him call to inquire how I was doing as the pain was intense.

The office is very nice, VERY efficient (we were in an out within an hour), and the Dr. himself seems attentive, and even called to check in on us that evening. My problem is with the post-op info - or lack thereof - from the nurse who helped my husband to the car.\n\nShe handed me a single sheet that mostly covered medication schedules and dietary restrictions, a pack of gauze, and 4 prescriptions. I have no knowledge of how to care for oral postop things, but my mom's a nurse so i know these things can go smoothly or horribly depending on the patient's choices after surgery - behavior that is usually informed by the advise of medical staff, since the general populace is presumably ignorant (safest assumption). I asked if I needed to replace the gauze as soon as we got home, and was about to ask what all he needed to avoid doing. The nurse quickly said, cordially but also sharply such that she cut me off before i could ask, \"everything you need to know is written on this sheet\" and told me to call if I had questions. Well, long story short he ended up using a straw and doing a few other things I had no idea he wasn't supposed to, because i didn't //know// those were things i needed to ask about, and the sheet made no mention of any of them.

During that time, the intent was to keep my teeth and gums as healthy as possible. Regularly scheduled deep cleaning worked. However, my doctor retired and the new staff had different ideas. The regularly scheduled deep cleaning was no longer an option, and within a couple of years my teeth deteriorated to the point where it was embarrassing to even smile. The new staff recommended extractions, at first only a few teeth. Ultimately, they planned to extract all my teeth and do implants. I agreed to have the first three teeth extracted. That was the beginning of a horrible time for me. After the extractions I bled profusely and was in a lot of pain. For two weeks I continued to bleed on and off. I was frightened ,I could not eat, and I was miserable. As time passed it didn't get much better, and I was not myself, as I was normally very outgoing and talkative, but now became very uncomfortable around people. The staff then recommended extracting the rest of my teeth and doing implants. But I was afraid of what might happen after the last experience. I thought, \"if I bled so profusely from 3 extractions, how would my body react to all my teeth being extracted\". The thoughts going through my head were all scary and uncertain. I sought out other opinions, but did not have a good feeling with anyone. Finally, in late 2016, I met with Dr. Sam Nizam. When we met, I immediately felt the connection, and I was comfortable. Dr. Sam listened to all my concerns attentively. I knew the qualities in a doctor that I was looking for and Dr. Sam had all of them. Dr. Sam sat me down and explained step by step what he recommended and how the procedures would be done. He was so calm and confident, and did not sugar coat anything. He explained that I needed 26 extractions, and why. He explained that I needed bone grafting for the implants to take, where he would need to do the grafting, and why. He explained that I needed a sinus lift, and where and why. Also, he showed me visually on the computer and pointed out exactly where my implants would be placed, to have the best chance of success. He explained how all procedures would be done at the same time. I was still nervous about the whole process, but I had total confidence in Dr. Sam and agreed to schedule it as soon as possible. It was February, 2018. I was in surgery for 5 1/2 hours. He performed all the work that he had explained to me. I went home, knowing I was in good hands and that I was going to be fine. But I was just a little nervous, thinking I might bleed. Dr. Sam prescribed pain killers, which I took that night and went to sleep. I awoke after a peaceful night sleep. My bleeding was the size of a dime!. I had minimal pain. I stopped taking the pain killers. I went back for a follow up. Dr. Sam was pleased with the results and so was I. No pain, no bleeding, the implants (all 11 of them) all took. I now have new teeth. I can smile again. I can speak without fear and embarrassment. At my daughter's wedding I was able to proudly smile and laugh all night! Dr. Sam gave me my life back! I am myself again! Thank you!! I will always be grateful to Dr. Sam for the incredible work he did, that now gives me the chance to enjoy life as I had not been able to do for so long. If I ever have a problem, even though I now live many states away in New Jersey, I would not hesitate to make the trip. I recommend Dr. Sam highly . He has been blessed with a tremendous talent and gift to help people. I wish him all the best,and pray that his success helps thousands more like me in the future. - Linda K", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXOD5MDeQykhOWyJzNjQ_ZTNsvFxMngiU7Owt6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2b3cc3f973f1:0xa4ac2f65d2cc478d"}

I tried Fraxel laser surgery a few years ago and had a great experience, but the swelling was awful.  Per a recommendation, I went to see Rousso Facial Plastic Surgery!  Dr. Rousso's team suggested that I try a newer, less invasive laser treatment.  Practice Administrator, Nancy Higginbotham answered all my questions that I had regarding the procedure so I felt completely at ease the day it was completed.  Their COVID protocols are outstanding...the best of any office I have been to!\n\nThe Pico Laser procedure was completed by Ashley Strickland and Gillian Rogers and they couldn't have been more professional.  They did a great job ensuring that I was comfortable and letting me direct when to stop/go on the treatment since...it being a laser is slightly painful.  I was very pleased with the results.  As it was less invasive than Fraxel, I was able to cover the treatment with makeup and go about my business with no downtime.  I just looked a little wind burnt for a day!\n\nFurthermore the office staff was phenomenal in their follow-up with checking on my progress and scheduling a followup treatment.  Unlike my visit to a local dermatologist, where I felt pressure to \"move to the next treatment\" ...here I felt at ease with their suggestions but no sales pressure.  I wouldn't hesitate to come in for further procedures at this office!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1615920838863, "text": "Kristy, what a wonderful review!

He really took the time to explain various treatments with me that I had been curious about. He was very positive and upbeat, never once did he seem annoyed with my questions.

He didn\u2019t try to sell me anything I didn\u2019t want or need. Actually, I think I left with less than I expected. We only ended up doing botox around the brows and eyes.

I have been seen by numerous doctors from The Woman's Imaging in Denver Colorado, Slaon Kettering in New York and Johns Hopkins in Washington DC.

I was very happy after my surgery nine years ago but to have others comment and see the expression on their faces nine years later just makes me so happy.  Now I am quite sad the a surgeon in DC will be ruining the works of Dr Beckenstein. I wish doctor Beckenstein could be my doctor once again but asking him to fly to D.C. Is asking a little much.

My husband called Dr. Beckenstein and began to tell him of this child in need on the other side of the world and before my husband could finish the story, Dr. B said, \"I'll do it...no problem.\"  Dr. Beckenstein committed to help our family give this child something that I thought may be impossible.  He has gone beyond just being her surgeon...  He has shown us kindness beyond anything I could have imagined.  There is no one that I would trust more.  We have had approximately 14 surgeries and we have gone weekly into his office for the past 5 years.  After each surgery, the scars are being erased and I'm humbled by the gift (his surgical ability) that God has given this man.  And then, there's  his team...oh my his team...they are just like him.  Committed, professional and the kindest people I have ever met.  They are a reflection of him.  I cannot imagine going through this without Dr. Beckenstein and his entire team.

I figured since it was a more upscale spa that I would only have positive things to say, but I was very wrong. I went to get one syringe of Restylane. The doctor examined the structure of my face then proceeded to prepare injecting. First, he did not clean off the area he was injecting. Second, he did not wash his hands or put gloves on before touching all over my face or doing the injection. To no surprise because I have sensitive skin, the very next day I broke out in the same exact spot he touched. While injecting, he was sitting on a stool while I was propped up in the patient\u2019s chair. I\u2019m no doctor but I\u2019m pretty certain that as the injector, he should\u2019ve been standing to get a clear view of exactly where and how much product he was injecting. Lastly, he did not massage or smooth out the product during or immediately after injecting!! Which resulted in a lump. It wasn\u2019t very noticeable from just looking at me from the front. However, I could definitely feel it and from the side view of my face you could tell something wasn\u2019t quite right.\n\nI gave it a couple of days for the slight swelling I had to go down and to give time for the Restylane to settle in. Also, he put more than half the syringe on one side of my face and what felt like air in the other side because there was no difference at all.  ALSO, the lump I felt was more so in the lowest portion of my check rather than the actual smile line where it should\u2019ve been. I\u2019m assuming this was due to him sitting during the injection and not having a clear view of what he was doing. 10 days later, lump is still there. I went back to the office and all he could do was offer to inject another syringe for $100 off. I declined the offer because I refused to spend any more money at that spa. Do not go here to get fillers.\n\nDr. Marlow at Infinty Med-i-Spa fixed all the issues I had.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626ebafd8231d1:0xcf48d168ceb00c66"}

I also want to add that he recommends an overnight stay at a hotel so you can be checked by his protege in the evening.

Even my stitches (which will dissolve) haven't bothered me.\nMy husband drove me home, but I could have driven myself, since I didn't even have the expected bleeding.  The anesthesia just barely started wearing off after I'd already taken my first prescription for pain medication, and so I never suffered at all. When I woke up the next morning, I was prepared to take more pain medication, but I realized I didn't need it and never took any more. What a pleasant surprise.\nDr. McLain personally called me the same evening to find out if I was doing okay.\nAlso, the actual wound was closed up so neatly, you could barely even see it.

I was told both my implants were ruptured and had been ruptured since 2013. The implants were only 39 years old and I am 72 years old, I believe I got my money's worth. \ud83d\ude0a Guess what? No one ever informed me of the ruptures. I was also informed I should contact a plastic surgeon ASAP to discuss explant surgery. So, I began a search for the best surgeon in my area. A friend told me about Dr. JEFFERY WALDING in Dothan, AL.\n\nMy consultation appointment was on July 18th. His office staff were extremely helpful, professional and friendly. My consultation was very informative and Dr. Walding was polite, professional and assured me I would be fine. I had my explant surgery on July 31st, the best decision I have ever made in my life. I have never had a surgery where I have experienced ZERO - NO pain. I am one week post surgery and I still have not had one second of pain. I have drain tubes now, which are not painful, just a nuisance for the time being. Hopefully, the drain tubes will be removed by the end of the week.\n\nI highly recommend Dr.Jeffery Walding. Even though I lived two hours away from Dothan, the drive was nothing compared to the excellent care I received.\n\nLeah Brown\nPhenix City, AL", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892929af315383f:0x2a4c31efc76f9224"}
