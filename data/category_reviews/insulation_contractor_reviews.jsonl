On some of the 1st hot days this year, the AC did not seem to be cooling efficiently, and there was quite a lot of condensation and then ice on the lines. I called Head's with some reluctance due to the negative reviews, but they were extremely responsive, came out to the house in less than 2 hours, and were extremely thorough, professional, courteous, and pleasant. They diagnosed the problem, handled it, and then checked everything else, and explained exactly what was going on.  They even gave me a call the next day to make certain everything went well. The only reason I'd take of 1/4 star would be because there was some initial record keeping confusion, and the problem with the AC function was traced back to a cap which should not have been added/placed at the previous service due to the slightly unusual configuration of my particular AC and furnace.

Instead stops all contact with customer.\n\nI accepted a proposal to repair a leak on my back porch and fix a floor joist which had been rotting due to the leak.\nWork took place on February 20th while I was out of town. The floor joist was successfully repaired. Unfortunately when I got back and poured some water over the patch I found that it still allowed water onto the support.\nI contacted the business owner (Devin Lanier) on February 25 by text message and by email on February 27th.\nThe business owner replied via email the next day stating \"So sorry about that. Let me look at our schedule and I will get someone back out there to check it out ASAP\".\nThe company scheduled an appointment for Sunday March 3rd to look at the leak. A storm came through the area on the day they were scheduled and I understand it would not have been possible for them to come out. Unfortunately no cancellation notice was communicated to me.\nI reached back out by email on March 4th to ask again for someone to check on the leak and I was told \"Yes a few of my guys were caught up up with the weather. Let me look at our schedule this week and try to get someone to cut loose and head over there. I\u2019ll let you know. \"\n\nSince the email on the March 4th I have not received any contact from the company.

Earlier this year we met with a member of the MDH team, and an assessment was made. Then before the job plan was finalized, the owner, Mike, came out to thoroughly go over the plan.

Instead of walking away, which most contractors would do, he  instead wasn't willing to leave my  situation in a worse condition than when he started the job.   He repaired the slab above and beyond expectations at a MORE  than fair price.  I have finally found a real contractor that puts his reputation first.  First Class in all categories.  Thank you Mike!

Please stay far away if you want an honest assessment and accountability. I will explain the events and you can judge for yourself.  The experience started off quite well, Christian was quick to come out for a consult, where he made the assessment that flying squirrels were the cause of our attic sound.  He then proceeded to hand my husband a contract for $2400 without explaining charges.  My husband questioned the cost and he quickly removed the multi year warranty which lowered the price to $1400. He was then told it would be a week before any exclusion work would be done.  He agreed and waited. The company placed barriers on roof and a one way door to allow squirrels to leave on their own (work happened on a Tuesday).  So we waited some more.  The next Monday.  A week later we were still continuing to hear the SAME noise.  I called the company (twice) before someone named Greg came out to do a check.  He only checked the roof and not the interior of the attic where the sound was, said everything looked good and was working correctly.  We voiced our concerns and he said sometimes they take 3 weeks to leave but that there is a possibility that since the excrement looks similar it could be mice instead but if that was the case it would require a different company. He said they could set traps but would just wait until the follow up the following week. Mind you the amount you pay up front is not refundable AT ALL. so that Monday night once again we hear the noise (2 weeks into the process now and the sound is right above the master bedroom so two weeks with no sleep).  The next day I go to Home Depot and get traps myself.  Place the traps after work (about 7pm) and by 10 pm the have a heart had caught something! But to our surprise.  It was not a squirrel but a mouse.  We release it the next day and reset the trap as well as two old school back cracker style traps, the next morning we\u2019ve caught another.  Still no squirrels.  I call the company obviously irritated (once again takes two calls to get a call back). Greg calls back and is super defensive won\u2019t admit there is a chance that they did not assess the full situation correctly (house was built in the 70\u2019s so sure maybe there was a chance there was old poop up there from something else).  Once again extremely defensive, belittling, opposite of good customer service.  Says he is the boss there is no one above him to discuss my concerns with.  They are currently still supposed to come do a recheck and spray some sort of an enzyme mix to stop squirrels from coming back (that we\u2019ve already paid for at this point) but if Squirrels were not the problem what good is that?? I think even an admission that the initial assessment could have been wrong would have gone a long way but no.  they basically said there is no way to prove that squirrels didn\u2019t leave...even though the sound is still present so the situation is obviously not resolved oh and the icing on the cake, the company does not trap mice.  If your in the Vestavia, AL area please pick a different company if you don\u2019t know for sure the specific animal you have a problem with because this company will be honest upfront.  If Christian had told my husband..look here is what I think but there is a chance 50/50, 75/25 whatever you want to call it that this won\u2019t work to solve your problem because you may have a different problem or two problems...then we would be looking at a different review.  I\u2019m not unreasonable I just expect accountability.  I still have a phone call in to someone at a higher level at the company hoping for some answers  or resolution before taking further action but my hopes are not high.   Best thing I can do is to warn my fellow neighbors and friends.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1608460632653, "text": "Mrs. Wilger,\n\nWe appreciate your review although there needs to be some clarification.

I spoke with you the day after we rushed over to your house and fixed the problem. You were happy and were suppose to pay your bill like you had said that you were going to do. today is 5/21/19 and its still not paid. It is very costly to run company trucks up and down the road each day.And hire great technicians. The bill reflects a 75  transportation fee and our company rate of 75 dollars as well. the part was 28 dollars at my cost.  You knew this Scott.  I do not know anything about your fan motor going out . It had to be two days later because I spoke with you the following day and you were thankful and praising us for getting you from the 90 degree heat.  I really doubt your fan motor went out Scott. If it did then you should have called and we would have came back and replaced it. And added it to your bill that has yet to get paid.   I have never met you personally but though that you were a nice person on the phone. Then I read the lies you have wrote about my company.I do not appreciate it one bit Scott.

After checking our attic and seeing that the squirrel had not yet made an entrance into our house, they told us there was nothing they could do.  The guy didn\u2019t even have a ladder to check our gutters!\n\nSo we call Jim from Exclusive Wildlife & Pest Control.  He laughed when I told him the previous encounter with the Critter Capture company and then proceeded to get his ladder (that he brought himself!) and take a look at our gutters and ensure that the squirrel had not damaged our roof yet and also took the time to double check our attic. No damage was noted except for the fire pit cover we caught the squirrel tearing up the previous weekend.\n\nJim gave me two options on how to get rid of our furry new houseguest; we could capture him alive and release him elsewhere or set a trap similar to a rat trap that should kill him instantly. After much discussion my husband and I decided on the rat trap since the evenings here have been very cold and the poor squirrel may freeze to death in a live trap. Jim was so very patient as we weighed our options and was able to give me the pros and cons on both methods.\n\nAfter one failed attempt to trap him (the trap caught his tail instead of his neck) Jim text me throughout the evening to reassure me that he would get him the next day and that all would be OK. Jim returned promptly the next morning, set the trap again and was able to get the squirrel instantly. He disposed of everything and cleaned the nest out of the gutter.\n\nJim was so very pleasant to work with I will definitely be calling again if any other squirrel decides to make his home here!\nI would recommend Jim and Exclusive Wildlife to anyone who is looking for good, quality, and prompt service.\n\nThank you Jim!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBbVC-1NoRZZKkz46lqwpMR0kKMUXVSo0HNWyH=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpMImbqi6WT6TFmbGFntrWu9R1ePdVJL0QITRP=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1548888877159, "text": "Thank you Mike & Stephanie Freeman, it was my pleasure helping you rid your home of your unwelcomed guest and it was nice meeting you."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a1b2dea85547d:0x4c0bde02d4614206"}

{"user_id": "106281876022532132920", "name": "Betty Pierce", "time": 1624154500227, "rating": 5.0, "text": "Some years ago we needed some significant waterproofing and structural repairs done in our basement home. We contacted a few different companies to provide an Inspection and estimate. After some discussion we decided\nOn a company that was not on the higher side of the estimates. We felt like the fix would be pretty much the same no matter who we chose\nAnd saving money was in our interest at the time..One company we called was a fairly well known local company A.F.S. We were familiar with them because they began here in Decatur\nSo we would see trucks around town. FYI,  I wanted you to know, we should\u2019ve called AFS from the start. Today I\u2019m here some 7 odd years later, after spending thousands of dollars with the low price alternative and my\nSump pump and drainage system doesn\u2019t work, our walls are blistering and cracking up, down and horizontally, water is seeping thru the wall cracks and the concrete blocks are shifting and cracking our exterior brick and interior block walls. I have limited mobility and couldn\u2019t go check on these things easily and things kept getting worse. Considering what we received from the lower priced company, we decided to call AFS to provide their opinion on our basement situation. At this point , the only thing working or effective was a dehumidifier. It was time to seek experts advice. We had previously used AFS in a limited capacity for our cracked pool deck and they performed that repair just fine and although that repair is not inexpensive,\nIt was much less and more quickly usable than any other options we looked at. So from there we felt we could allow them a chance to tell us (what )was happening and (why )was it happening . When the day came for the inspection, David Flamm , the inspector called our home in advance and let us know his arrival time and asked if we could sit for a few questions before beginning the inspection. He felt we would have something of value to help  determine the cause of the damage. We felt he was sincere and listened to what we had to say and even wrote down the answers. We watched as he went room to room with his big light and something like a laser . He was very thorough, and  took  pictures as he moved around the house.\nOne thing he did,  that most never do, is David removed his boots before walking on my clean floors. Not a big thing but it got my attention.\nAfter the inspection inside , he explained what he would be doing outside and that my husband\nWas welcome to tag along if he wanted, so he did. He was rather impressed with David\u2019s knowledge and ability to explain the plan of repair. After our experience with another company (who did almost nothing) and David\u2019s attitude and attention to our concerns, we were very relieved that we called AFS. He took pictures and put them on his laptop for us to clearly see the issues, he asked our opinion and waited for our response. Never did he act pushy or lacked any uncertainty about what he would do to help us. He allowed us to view video software of the repairs needed, and even priced the project as he went thru the videos. Needless to say,  we were very comfortable with Dave and could feel he really knew what the problems required. Before we had to ask, David explained AFS Warranty, Service and maintenance program and how they return and maintain the eguipment so we didn't have to worry. This was very helpful considering my physical limitations and my husband is very busy with work. We felt very reassured after spending a couple of hours with David Flamm, we had called the right company. AFS must invest a lot of time into the people that work for them, it was so smooth . We had no trouble connecting the dots. David explained the project review process they go they prior to arriving to our home and how the foreman on the job has already seen the project and all of the pictures as David and the foreman discuss the ins and outs of it. It seems every concern we had initially was addressed before we had to express it. AFS, should be the first and only call you make for your home today.\nWe are glad we did.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1624291512896, "text": "Hello Betty!

They were very prompt and courteous.  We had a small problem that Nathan brought to my attention after he and his crew started the prep work in the area which resulted in them having to remove 2 additional (early 1930's) brick support columns and level the dirt foundation under them.  Had Nathan not brought the potential problem to my attention, even with the work they were doing, I might have had more collapse in that area in the future.  Now I won't have any concerns about that.  I was very impressed with how well these 3 men worked together and also independently while completing the job.  AFS has turned an old damp 1930's basement crawl space area into a bright, clean space my grandkids could play in at my house.  The crew cleanup in my yard was spot-on.  They even hauled off those brick columns for me.  I'm looking forward to the follow-up visit in about two months to see how much more lift they can get in my (had been) sagging floors.  There was some immediate improvement when they tightened all the floor jacks and after that new dehumidifier dries up my floor rafters for a few weeks we should see even more improvement.

It had to be stabilized or I was going to have to totally redo the carport.  I did not know who to contact but a friend had AFS do some foundation stabilization work for him. I asked him about AFS.  I had seen the TV ads but know that anyone can do a slick tv commercial.  It turns out, the friend was positively impressed with AFS on his project. So, I made an appointment for their rep to visit.  I was still a little skeptical.  The field rep arrived on time and looked at my issue.  He suggested their concrete stabilization product.  He described how it would work and be installed.  He was not at all pushy nor did he give me any slick sales pitch.  He knew about the product, how it was installed and what it could do.  I agreed to do the project with them and made a down payment on the project.  We scheduled the job and on the agreed upon day, the installation crew arrived.  They were a little later than initially planned BUT the office called to say they were running behind, so that was not an issue.  They were maybe 30 minutes later than planned. The installation guys checked over the carport and talked over their plans with me. Then they went straight to work. They were clean cut, totally nice people to have at my home with no smoking or foul language - just hard work! There was an obvious difference to the carport when they were through.  So, I really felt good about their work.  They also cleaned up any mess that they made (a little concrete dust) with the tools they brought to the job site.

Over the last 2 years, it has flooded during the heavy rains in January and February.  I did some research to evaluate this issue and decided to go with a reputable, established, and known company.  I was not disappointed.  Mr. David Flamm arrived at my house promptly for my initial appointment.  He was professional and personable.  After a few minutes of discussion, he understood my concerns and started his investigation.  Once he completed his investigation, he sat down my wife and I and went over his findings. His presentation of what could be done was easy to understand and follow along using the video clips on his computer. All seemed logical, but me, being the ever skeptic, asked many questions about how the system would work and why it seemed the water was infiltrating my living spaces after 7 years of no water. He answered all of my questions and his explanations made sense.  After it was all said and done, we had the Aquastop Control groundwater seepage system with Aquastop basement air system,  EZflow  tubing with the triple pump action installed.\nDay of installation:\nThe team showed up on time for the install lead by Nick.  It had been raining a lot AGAIN and i had my makeshift sump-pump system running to dewater the area where it was building up.  The team laid down plastic tarp so as to not get my finished basement dirty and commenced to working.  It took them 2 days to complete.  What a job. When they laid in the pump system and started the pumps, the water buildup that i had my makeshift system in for, drained and did not come back.  EUREKA!!  Since this system has been in place, we continue to get the storms and flooding but my basement/crawlspace remain dry.  The system works as described and projected.  I cannot thank Dave and his team from AFS enough.  Their professionalism and concern to provide a solution to my problem was genuine and their work is top of the line. Dave's evaluation of my needs and his concern to present me with different options was genuine and without company profit in mind. I highly recommend this company and team for any issues you may have in basement or crawlspace area.

Due to hydrostatic pressure my walls were caving in slightly. I don\u2019t remember the terminology  AFS uses but they came in and put what looks like a tarp over the walls.  It\u2019s to prevent moisture and mold buildup. Life time warranty. It might be working but since my walls are covered up I am only guessing it is. After I removed everything from the walls in the basement, yes, everything, including taking out my bathroom, they jackhammered around the edge of the walls about a one foot trench. AFS then put in place , what I call a gutter. Rocks were placed around this gutter along with a moisture barrier and then concrete poured on top. Supposedly, they put holes into each concrete block on my wall and place  a pipe that goes from block to gutter. As you know, these blocks have cylinders inside where water can build up. The purpose is for water to drain from block(my wall)into the gutter then it\u2019s to flow to corner of house where there is a sump pump.\n\nShort story is that it\u2019s been two years and no water has touched the sump pump. As you know the last two years have been like northwest Washington where we are getting tons of rain. Now I\u2019m having moisture, called efflorescence, coming up where they jackhammered. AFS came by several times and put a sealer on floor. Never worked. Had another man come by and look at system to see if water was flowing properly; it was. I spoke to one of the managers and he stated there was nothing else they could do. I thought about legal action but statue of limitations had expired. $13k pretty much wasted and I\u2019m left still trying to fix the problem.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1579289402562, "text": "Mr. Simmons,\n\nWe are sorry for your  frustration.

We found this out after we notified them we had a quote from another company.  This should throw up major \u201cred flags\u201d to anyone reading this. Why not give you their best price up front? Now read the rest if you would like.\n\nStay away from AFS if you plan on getting multiple quotes.  I LOVED everything they told me and was completely impressed by their upfront professionalism.  The representative came out, did a thorough inspection and gave us a detailed layout of what needed to be done.  Where things went bad was when it was discovered that we also had another company come out, providing comparable services for a moderately better price.  As a decent human, I felt it important to contact the AFS rep to inform him of our appreciation but we were going to go with a competitor. At that point he became a high-pressured salesman and became somewhat belligerent.  To top things off, we had filed a coverable insurance claim regarding a busted drain pipe and the insurance company contacted this AFS rep and the rep told them the problem was due to an issue that is well-known not coverable by insurance.  Had I not called the rep to inform him, man-to-man, of our decision and simply \u201cghosted\u201d him (a cowardly way of handling things), we wouldn\u2019t be in the predicament.  Through this behavior and revengeful tactics, he reassured us that AFS is not the type of company we want to take care of our home.  My wife and I are teachers and work on a limited budget...we would be silly to not request more than one estimate for a job this size.  A company such as this should realize that.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1578440362389, "text": "Mr. Milam,\n\nWe appreciate your kind remarks regarding the professionalism of our inspector.  We do try to be extremely detailed and responsible with both our inspections and repair plans.  Obviously we are disappointed when a homeowner chooses to use another company, but always want folks to make a decision that they\u2019re comfortable with.\n\nIt sounds like there was some confusion regarding a possible insurance claim that you filed.  When asked by homeowners whether a crawlspace scenario is covered by insurance, our standard reply is that \u2018it depends on your policy, it\u2019s best to contract your insurance provider\u2019.  While we\u2019re not an insurance company, the trend that we have seen is that acute issues like a plumbing leak may be covered, whereas issues that develop over time, like ground water seepage are typically the homeowner\u2019s responsibility \u2013 similar to hail damage to a roof vs a roof just wearing out.\n\nThe inspection photos of your crawl space showed a pattern of mud lines on multiple walls of your crawlspace.  This is consistent with a ground water seepage challenge and why our repair plan called for drainage and a sump pump in your crawl space.  If asked what was found in our inspection, our policy is just to be candid.  We can\u2019t really speak to causality, but just to current conditions noted.\n\nHope this clears up any misunderstanding and we wish you the best with your repairs."}, "gmap_id": "0x88621663b63fdbf9:0xecb0ee1e38d7cfea"}

When it rained the water would not drain properly in both of these locations.  AFS said that their injection program would fix both of these problems; in reality it was the start of making things much worse.  They drill a bunch of holes in the concrete and inject some material that is supposed to raise the concrete; unfortunately the whole concept is flawed.  They cannot control where this material goes as it is injected under the concrete and they are unable to correctly monitor the pressure as it goes in.  AS a result my walkway in back and my driveway ended up cracked and tilted in such a way that the problem was much worse; the water was now more directed towards my house.\nAFS tried to fix the driveway by cutting a 25 foot trench in my driveway and installing a drain; unfortunately this was also done incorrectly.  The slope of the drain did not allow the water to drain out, the drain was installed with large screws going into the drain pipe, which caught leaves creating a barrier.  Additionally, the cracks they created in the driveway and improper injection of the filler material caused my driveway to sag creating a lake that does not drain at all.\nAFS tried to fix the drainage problem made worse by their injection program in back by digging up part of the walkway and replacing the concrete; unfortunately, again they did not get it right.  They did not provide the proper slope to the new concrete and as a result the water make another lake immediately up against the side of my house.\nSo now I have worse drainage problems, my driveway looks like hell and as a result of the drainage problems the corner of my house at the garage is sagging.\nI would have been much better off if they had done nothing.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1558126613083, "text": "Hello Mr. Ballard, we can certainly understand your frustrations.

What my Inspector did was gather just enough information about my crawlspace to fit into his sales pitch. It\u2019s probably best to do your own crawlspace inspection before you even call them out, because you may have to perform repairs before their crew comes out. They DO NOT employ plumbers, carpenters or electricians to handle possible crawlspace issues.

In accordance with the contract I was responsible for making sure there was power available in the crawlspace for the dehumidifier. When I go into the crawlspace to take care of this I see a wet spot from 15 feet away and realize I have a water leak. A closer look revealed I had water damage. I point blank asked that Inspector if he saw anything that required immediate attention and he said \u201cNo\u201d. There\u2019s no way he should have missed this. The \u201cInspector\u201d did come out and look at it and he did put me in touch with a carpenter, whom I did use, and I was able to get a plumber out quickly.

I\u2019ll give the Inspector a break here and say he may or may not have discovered this if he had performed the type of inspection I expected. This turned into yet another unexpected expense on top of the carpenter and plumber. It would have been nice if the Inspector had caught all of this.

So it was decided I would have the work done.\nOn the two days the pier crew arrived, the crew chief Javier greeted me and we discussed the work progress and what they were doing each day.  Javier was ready to explain anything I was unsure about, with a short discussion on my expectations he and his crew was ready to get started.

It was great to see a crew that was self starting and knew their job so it could be accomplished with little delay. The second day the crew members changed a bit, but still  Javier was the crew chief, and again they started work soon after they arrived without delay and some conversations occurred at times to make sure what they were doing was the right way, because the situation of this repair was a little unusual, but they adapted to keep the work on time and with a professional attitude.\nThe third day the poly crew chief,  Dendy and crew arrived on time and immediately Dendy greeted me and explained what they were here for and ask to be shown the work area.  We discussed what he was going to do and how it would be accomplished and without delay, they got started preparing for the job of the day. They were always willing to explain the procedure and the expected results, and also how they would attempt to prevent any unwanted results.\nI want to commend all the personnel for their excellent work and their professionalism and accepting my sometimes unneeded suggestions and allowing me to express myself.\nThank you AFS for having happy crews, apparently they like working for AFS and proudly say so with a strong sense of belonging to a company who apparently cares about their employees.\n\nRobert Hendrix\nA  Satisfied Customer.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1509053963738, "text": "Mr. Hendrix, we greatly appreciate your feedback, as well as your trust in AFS to complete your repair project!

I really appreciate the work the crew did, and the patience David had for the sale.  There's no buyers remorse at all...the cost was right, and the work produced the intended result...quieter, cooler, AC not running constantly.

His crew is a reflection of him as well. They were done in one day and I noticed the difference immediately. My A/C is an older unit but after they finished sealing the attic and installing new insulation, I see a marked difference in how much it kicks on each day. 3-4 times throughout the day vs not holding a temp and running most of the day continuously when it's hot outside. Very pleased. Will use him in the future and he comes HIGHLY recommended!\n\nJW", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b8d7a628e2b:0xf5298ef0d0e349bc"}

He not only explained the issues but showed us the issues using advanced technology. He communicated with us as needed. All work was completed timely.\nJason, the crew leader, was professional, courteous and respectful of our home and space. Jason went above and beyond our expectations. He and his crew not only did excellent work, Jason \"uncovered\" a probelm unrelated to the scope of our project but he said he would do some research to find out the best solution. Now that is excellent customer service. He even said he would come back out once this problem was fixed to make sure the insulation was proper in this small space.\nBoth Jason and David are very knowledge and answered all of our questions in terms that we understood.\nI recommend this company.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1488552465882, "text": "We enjoyed working with you, DeWight!

They seem good at first but the second there is a hiccup, good luck. They will not work with you, yells and screams instead of acting professionally (Walker is who we dealt with) and will absolutely avoid you if they cannot resolve the matter. I would absolutely encourage you to look elsewhere. I see the other reviews but I guessing they are freinds and family posting those reviews. With one simple phone call, we had another company out to do the work correctly. Coincidentally, that other company happened to be an ex-employee of there's and had said he had left and started his own company due to the same reasons metioned above.

I live in Pensacola FL and felt that my 3700 sq ft house (10 years old) needed a little insulation (top-off)  help.\n\nSo I got the usual 3 estimates and heard the analysis and sales pitch of each, and evaluated each of them as a Chemical Engineer, that I am.\n\nThe summary is that two of the three Contractors gave me a over-sell pitch of everything that that I needed (which I knew that I didn't need).  Only Walker Goodrich of ECO -three gave me that real pitch and actually-talked me out of unnecessary work when I pitched to Walker what the other contractors said I needed.\n\nThe bottom line ( literally) was that Eco-Three quoted $2850 for the job,, while the other two contractors quoted about $12,000 and $8,000, respectively.\n\nOnce I awarded the Contract to Eco-three, they did what they promised and when they said they would do it, and in a very neat way.\n\nStarting the day of instillation Feb 24 2018, my average daily electricity usage dropped 33%  (for equivalent outside temperature highs and lows) relative to before the insulation was added.\n\nAnother  energy saving tip is to replace your AC single-speed pool pump motor with a low energy (variable speed) pump motor.  I did it last year for $800 installed and with it on 8 hours per day, everyday, my power consumption cost just for the pump dropped abut $100-$125 per month.\n\nI hope that this helps\n\nDon B", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b8d7a628e2b:0xf5298ef0d0e349bc"}
