From the kind servers, to the cook...they were literally one big happy family!

Fried, crispy and absolute perfection.\n\nAbsolute standouts included the pork ribs (come early before they sell out), white mac n cheese, chicken quesadilla, Bootsie's dog (sausage dog with BBQ), and even the kids meal were homemade chicken nuggets.\n\nTook a banana pudding and key lime pie to go.

Stopped and was not disappointed at all.\n\nThe restaurant is a cozy little shack, but the food goes way beyond it. the shredded pork was outstanding as well as the ribs. The side items are delicious. I have not tried the chicken nor the hotdogs/sausage/hamburgers yet, since they only serve them during the weekdays (unless you pre-order them). I usually get a plate for me my mom and myself on Sundays. My mom actually devoured the whole plate the first time she tried it.\n\nTheir sauces Are all homemade. I really loved their vinegar-based ones. Tried their Carolina hot last week and it was very good. The sweet and tangy is also good, which is what my mom likes.\n\nWould definitely recommend this place to anyone. country\u2019s barbecue in Columbus used to be my favorite place, but it\u2019s got mad competition with backwaters now.\n\n-8/23/20: Finally got a chance to try some of their chicken. It was awesome. Had a great smoky flavor and was done all the way through. Had to pre-order it since they don\u2019t usually cook it on the weekends.\n\n-1018/20: Watch out y\u2019all. Mr. Wayne is being a mad scientist at deliciousness. Picked up two barbecue plates and a full slab of ribs from him on Sunday. He is experimenting with a new honey Bourbon glaze for the ribs. Didn\u2019t have time for it to go on the grill to be caramelized, but with it just being wet and soaking into the ribs when I got them home, they were outstanding. When my mom eats more ribs than barbecue, you know it\u2019s good. It\u2019s not overly sweet, but you can taste the hint of bourbon and honey. I\u2019m not a person that likes sweet foods, but I thoroughly enjoyed it too. Keep up the good work Mr. Wayne.\n\n11/1/20- Mr. Wayne has a new sauce that would make Ted Nugent proud. Ask for the Wang Dang. It\u2019s awesome", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMHO8ROkJC-ClFNxDXGQzBtwXnDpegGMVZiLN2=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cb879fa583d99:0xc8d29bfd15b56883"}

My fianc\u00e9e and I had always seen a ridiculous line inside and in the drive-thru for this place.  We decided to give it a shot.  Well, we went to the drive-thru and didn't get to the window for 35 minutes (there were only 2 cars ahead of us).  We ordered the chicken, ribs, and pulled pork with potato salad, cole slaw, and hush puppies.\n\nWe were disappointed in everything.  The potato salad was more of a puree than actual salad.  We got the impression that we missed the description for it on the menu somewhere (\"take out your dentures and gum on this!\").  It was roughly 98% mayo with 1/16\" pieces of potato and such in it.  The cole slaw was marginally better, but still lacking larger pieces in it.  The taste was very strong with vinegar as well, which soured your tongue a bit.  The hush puppies were surprisingly good, but still really dry and expensive (6 for $1.50).  The BBQ bread looked and tasted like it was rushed as well, with no butter or real cooking that took place prior to being given to us.\n\nNow on to the meat.  We are from Georgia, and have had some amazing BBQ over there and in Huntsville.  This has to be the second worst meat we have ever had (Golden Rule BBQ was the worst by a country mile).  The chicken looked good, but was super dry and tough in spots.  The pulled pork was dry and mushy when you started chewing on it.  The ribs were so hard and dry that my knife sounded like it was cutting through cardboard when I was trying to make a small piece.  They were also full of small cartilage pieces and bones that you couldn't see once cooked.  Once we got to the actual meat of these items, there wasn't any flavor.  It literally tasted like we were eating plain meat that we didn't even think about seasoning or tenderizing.  Keep in mind, all of their meats are served without sauce on them at all, but we will address that next.\n\nLast, but not least, THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN BBQ SAUCE!  They try to sell you a mild, medium, or hot sauce, but its all vinegar based and really watered down.  The girl at the drive-thru window even admitted that it was \"super watered down\" and that they give everyone Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce with their meals (no sauce comes on the meat)!  What proper BBQ business doesn't have their own sauce?!  They will even sell you 1/2 pint, pint, quart, half gallon, and gallon containers of Sweet Baby Rays at an increased price!  You could go to Publix/Kroger and get a gallon for half of what they are charging!  And what BBQ business uses pre-made, marketed sauces for their BBQ?!  This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen at a BBQ business.\n\nOverall, we won't be going back.  The wait was horrible, the food was dry and tough, and the sauces aren't unique to them in any way.  I am confident that I could go to Publix/Kroger, buy all of the ingredients they use (just low grade meat and Sweet Baby Rays), set up shop right next door, and you wouldn't know the difference.

It was good quality chicken but there was a hard cartilage/clump in it I couldn't eat. The BBQ sauce was fine. The Mac and cheese was above average and I added a little salt and pepper to it. They were out of kielbasa (polish sausage) and potato salad which were two things my bf wanted...but he ordered a chicken sandwich with baked beans and coleslaw. The coleslaw was a little watery but had very good quality ingredients. The baked beans were alright but I expected a sweet or spicy taste to them not more so plain. They have a nice outdoor seating area and nice staff as well. So it is a decent place but not super scrumptious. Worth a stop by for a quick bite.

But let's talk about the turnip greens:  the taste is i describable.  What this man does to those turnip greens should probably be prayed over in church because I believe he made a deal with the devil to get them to taste that good.  I woukd go there just for them.  His special that day was smoked turkey and he let me have a sample.  If you like smoked turkey sandwiches, you need to come here on thursday.  I was there a couple of hours and customer after customer came in ordering the smoked turkey sandwich.  He has a smoker going on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant.  He's about to build an outdoor stage next door for live music.  Let me tell you, Josh is starting something magical and I am so glad that I get to witness it.

Saturday's are naturally days that I load my gf and my dog in my car to do something random or try something new. Ricarda's got to be our new thing today. I am already very familiar with Filipino BBQ, but had zero idea there was Filipino BBQ in Bham. We opted to try the pork adobo that came with rice and marinated cucumbers/peppers. The pork was super tender, juicy and flavorful. The rice was perfectly cooked and the marinated cucumbers was that perfect bite of crisp freshness to balance the plate out. We also had an order of the pork dumplings with the spicy sauce. I personally wanted more kick in the sauce, but mannnn were those flavors all there. All of the food had great price points, portions were perfect, and everything was piping hot. Location is easy to find and I love how it just gets you away from the city. Enjoy the picnic tables and fresh air. Above all the owners and service just made the experience that must more enjoyable. They are so sweet and welcoming. I would come just to speak to them, it's just a plus that their food is bomb too.

He said he wasn't sure where he was but would take a message and have him contact me ASAP. I explained that I was calling based on the response I got off our review and he went to find Darrell for me. Darrell immediately apologized for everything and I told him we understand that things happen and that we have never ever had a bad experience with them except for that one time. I even told him that we had switched to them from Dixie Wings due to some bad experiences with them and couldn't have been happier. My husband gets there to pick up our replacement wings and just the look and smell of them was back to the quality of what we were used to. The taste of their wings makes you want to cry they are so good. I'm so happy we gave them a second chance and so happy that they are dedicated to make sure that their quality exceeds expectations. Thank you Jose, Darrell and the rest of the outfield staff.\n\nWe usually get wings from here at least once a week and have never had a problem with our wings. We got a 50 PC wing last night, mild and extra crispy. We live almost near big smoke diesel down hwy 80 so it's not a quick trip. My husband got home and when we went to eat some of our wings the first thing we noticed was there was hardly any sauce on them. Then there were only four flats and we were offered to pay an extra for only flats. That's not what we want....just half and half would be sufficient but 4 flats out of 50 wings is a bit ridiculous. But we were still going to eat them however as we were eating them they were extremely dry. We ate maybe 10 out of the 50 and when we called and spoke with Darrell we were assured that it would be made right. We ordered another 50, mild and extra crispy and took the other 40 from last night back to them. Brittany who works there said we've got you we will take care of it. Well when I get back from taking our daughter to the bathroom they wanted $28.50. So we said they could keep the ones we brought and the ones they just made for us. We aren't going to essentially pay twice for wings that should have been made correctly the first time. They've lost our business for good. On the hunt for wings somewhere else.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cc5bd61bef0f1:0xd6bd3a53f8b647fe"}

I picked the Pulled Pork sandwich and sausage for a side bite.  Their selection of sauces I picked was their Mild/Original and the Spicy.  Both meat servings were excellent in flavor without any of their sauce added.  Then I tried both meat servings with both sauces I selected.  Both sauces had great flavorings with the meats with the Spicy not being a \"hot\" sauce but had that flavor kick one wants in a sauce.  The outside sitting area is a small great spot to eat their menu items and share conversations.  If you want a great priced BBQ spot with a small home feel served by some great people of Alabama stop here.  Give them a try!!!  I'm going to stop again for other menu items to sample.

The Q stew, i.e.:Brunswick stew is a winner. ALL PORK AND BEEF platters, inside or outside chopped, served with 1 or 2 sides,  French bread or cornbread will fill you up with a to-go box for sure. The ribs fall off the bone,  and I truly recommend the chef salad.  All dressings are homemade. Price per person is about $10-14 for a full meal. Homemade lemonade and sweet tea are outstanding. Don't forget dessert.  The pecan pie and lemon pie are the best around. If you've got the time to wait, their steaks are excellent too. Chopped steak is my favorite, the fried chicken fingers are so crisp and tender. My kids love them. They cater too, and do a very good job.

To my enthusiasm n surprise, Country's BBQ. I grew up in Columbus, Ga and go back from time to time. And EVERY TIME I do go back 1st place I stop is Country's. I LOVE Columbus Country BBQ and longed for it. About 3pm when we first walked in, the Mgr told us \"to walk over there, grab a menu and seat where ever we wanted\". There was 2 other couples in dining area. The waitress was outstanding!! I don't remember her name, but she was super bubblely. But we were so disappointed with the food. I ordered my usual; pulled pork platter. Husband ordered his usual; 1/2 chicken. Well the pork was drowned in chutney n coleslaw juices, which totally ruined the taste mainly b/c I don't like chutney. I used a numerous amount of napkins to dry up the juice. Husband's chicken looked liked it was cooked the day before or real early that morning. The BBQ sauce was dried and skin was wrinkled up and some spots were burnt. It was very dry. Husband informed waitress and she was very helpful and offered another one, fresher or something else. He ordered another chicken. The 2nd chicken was a more moist but didn't compare to the taste of Country's in Columbus. If Jim is affiliated with this establishment, he would be ashamed. Also, the Mgr had fixed a plate for herself and sat and ate. Not once did she come over to ask about why we sent it back.  How convenient it would've been since we travel through Montgomery often and it's closer than Columbus for us. Needless to say, we won't be coming back or if by some chance we do, we will hope to remember and not order the same thing.......", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1448860779322, "text": "Dear Pamala,\n\nI am so sorry to hear about your recent experience at our Zelda Road location.

I am not sure if the staff was just busy at time of order or what.  While calling in the order the person taking the order seemed inpatient. We picked up the order 10 minutes later and noticed there was only one person dining in Country's BBQ, 4 staff in the kitchen and one or two staff in the dining area. About 4 orders were picked up while we waited 10 more minutes (added item to order) for our order. After getting home I realized my 1/2 and 1/2 order of fried pickles and onions was far from being fried.  In fact it was very clear they had gone straight from the container to my take out container. Not cooked what-so-ever. I was soo disappointed. Was really looking forward to trying the side dishes. Now I travel a lot and have been to great BBQ places across the US and outside the US and this is definetly not one of them. Anyone who says Country's BBQ is great has not had good BBQ. Aside from the poorly prepared side dishes the BBQ (chicken and beef) was just okay, definetly not worth mentioning. Being that the food was just okay at best there was no reason to call and complain as we would have only gotten more phone attitude.  Would not recommend this place.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1425420647795, "text": "Dear Robert,\nPlease allow us to apologize. We get a lot of good comments about our marinated barbecue onions.

Born and raised in Texas, I know my Tex-Mex-BBQ. If I could give a 4.25 stars, I would.  Being my fist time there, I had the BBQ sampler with potato salad and ff as sides.The sides were perfect.  Flavor was off the chain and the amount given was more than enough, thankfully.  The sampler comes with brisket, pulled pork and sausage.  For the price, I could have used a bit more brisket and a lil less pork but I was completely full at the end of the meal, as I mentioned before the sides were ample.  The flavor was perfect, my only complaint was the brisket was a tad on the dry side, I know brisket is tough to get right fresh off the grill, much less hours or the next day.   I didn't get any desert, I asked where the pecan pie came from and was a lil disappointed to learn is was from Sam's rather freshly made, especially at $6.00 a slice.  My wife had the Southern Bell and Brisket tip Tacos and she said they were amazing.

It is easily one of the most unique dining experiences in town. The menu is unlike any other, and EVERYTHING is good. This is not fast food, and it isn't priced as such,  but the value is definitely there and I think anyone who tries it will agree. It does come to you fast enough however, and it won't cost you an arm and a leg or anything, just don't expect average, low-rate mexican food prices as that is absolutely not what you will be getting.\n\nThe brussel sprouts are to die for. I already liked brussel sprouts, but I've never had any anywhere that are even close to theirs. I can't even begin to describe them, but take my word for it. Even if you think you hate brussel sprouts, you will probably love them. The soft tacos are big and they are lovingly put together and presented \"gourmet-style\" on a large, metal tray that is then covered with wax paper. They're not just slapped together all haphazard and plopped on a cheap plate like at everywhere else. You can mix and match them for a chance to try several different ones in a visit too. There are lots of different ones to choose from and they all are awesome, with like 6 or 7 different fresh ingredients each and then drizzled with unique spices and sauces. The different meats in each one are not ground or shredded into oblivion, but are thick pieces that need to be bitten into, which is good because you can better appreciate the exceptional taste and texture that comes from the extra care that went into cooking it.\n\nThere are also burritos, lots of different sandwiches, and even some more traditional items like BBQ and such. It takes a few minutes to study and understand the menu before you can know exactly which items will be perfect for you personally, but I'm pretty sure it will happen for most everyone just as it did for me.\n\nWell, I tried.

There's random classic funk rock like old Zeppelin and cream playing very quietly as a backdrop to the one tv above the bar with a game on. It feels like the restaurant was decorated for something else and halfway through they gave up and turned it into a taco joint. Identity crisis.\n\nCustomer service: Not impressed. The cashier or server or whatever he was didn't seem to know much about the menu which is a pretty big deal when your making food as specific as this. They also give you a buzzer to let you know when the food is ready... Which is fine if I have to come get my food but if you're going to bring it to me anyways then what's the point of giving me a buzzer? Just seems like a pointless extra step. Once my food got to me I asked which taco was which because all 3 were very different and the server said he didn't know and walked off. That's unacceptable. I had to get up and look at the menu in the storefront again to remember which was which.\n\nDrinks: My date and I each had a margarita. She had the special of the day and I had the catalina. They were both delicious but very alcohol light. They were also served in plastic cups which seemed cheap for a not so cheap drink. There is also the added inconvenience of having to order each drink individually and then get up in the middle of your meal, walk to the front of the store, and pay for your next drink. ??? That is a really bad business model for selling alcohol. As a restaurant your highest profit margin should be from your alcohol sales. You should make ordering alcoholic drinks as easy as possible to maximize your revenue and customer satisfaction.\n\nFood: The food is quite possibly the most disappointing part of my experience. Not because it was bad, but because it was nothing. I ordered 3 tacos with chips and queso. I had the Russian Roulette, The Outlaw, and The Lonestar. Each pretty unique in their overly complicated design and odd amalgamation of ingredients that are essentially slopped into a flour tortilla in an effort to ensure I have the messiest taco eating experience of my life. There was so many different ingredients in these tacos that I was expecting to have a symphony of spicy flavors and aromas accompany these gorgeous tacos, but there were so many random ingredients on each one that just don't work together that I couldn't taste anything. So many flavors working against each other just for the sake of having more \"artisanal\" ingredients on your taco. I had 3 very different tacos and they all tasted the same... Like paprika sprinkled on cardboard. That may sound harsh but it's honestly the closest comparison I can make. You would also think that at a place that serves a cuisine known for its spiciness that I would expect to get a good kick in the mouth out of 3 of its spiciest tacos but I'll be honest.. I had hot wings from zaxby's last night that were far hotter.\n\nOverall not the worst experience I've ever had but this seems like the type of place that trendy hipsters frequent so they can make instagram posts about \"artisan\" tacos and feel Californian for a day.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b8655555555:0xcaa6bcabf907d80e"}

Born and raised in Texas, I know my Tex-Mex-BBQ. If I could give a 4.25 stars, I would.  Being my fist time there, I had the BBQ sampler with potato salad and ff as sides.The sides were perfect.  Flavor was off the chain and the amount given was more than enough, thankfully.  The sampler comes with brisket, pulled pork and sausage.  For the price, I could have used a bit more brisket and a lil less pork but I was completely full at the end of the meal, as I mentioned before the sides were ample.  The flavor was perfect, my only complaint was the brisket was a tad on the dry side, I know brisket is tough to get right fresh off the grill, much less hours or the next day.   I didn't get any desert, I asked where the pecan pie came from and was a lil disappointed to learn is was from Sam's rather freshly made, especially at $6.00 a slice.

Sure, the food truck may be awesome but the restaurant is terrible! I waited 40 minutes for 4 tacos and a quesadilla and they only had two tables in the restaurant. There were 4 employees. I kept asking how much longer, and one girl said \"I'm not sure, we got backed up and I realize you may be in a hurry but it'll be ready soon!\" They desperately need to work on their customer service and staff. I can't imagine how long the wait would be if they actually had a full restaurant of customers! Its a good concept but I dont think they were ready for a full service restaurant or all that it entails. I won't be back!\n\nThomas, you are absolutely right! I was in your establishment as a door dash driver. Your employee advised me of your policy and I left and returned 10 minutes later with my insulated bag, per your policy. Upon arriving with the bag, I waited 35 minutes for the food to be ready. It took your employees a total of 45 minutes to make 4 tacos and a quesadilla. Your delivery driver left and returned and I was still waiting for the order. Another door dash driver came and left and I was still waiting for the order. A car side to go came and left and I was still waiting for my order. It became increasingly frustrating because while waiting for the order I was assigned to pick up, I was unable to be available for other orders. This one assignment took over an hour of my time and ultimately messed up the potential money I could have made because the service at your establishment is negligently noteworthy. If I was a paying customer I would be furious to wait an hour for over priced food and mediocore service. First impressions are everything and everyone that visits your restaurant is a potential paying customer. If my experience would have been different, dont you think I would have returned as a paying customer? I can understand why your employees are uneager to service patrons, as the owner has repeatedly rudely reacted to all negative reviews, this pattern, as another patron noted, is highly unprofessional! The restaurant business is not easy and making responses to negative reviews such as you have will not help your business. I'm so glad you contacted Door Dash so I had a chance to respond to your threatening Facebook message for me to take down my negative review.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, please be weary of writing negative reviews to this restaurant because the owner will threaten you privately. The time you took to look me up on Facebook and message me could have been spent training your employees to be more attentive to any person entering your establishment. I am appalled that a restaurant owner would conduct themselves in such an unprofessional manner. The right response would have been, \"I'm sorry you had a bad experience, please let us know what we can do going forward for you to possibly return.\" However, your response solidifies the unprofessionalism and disregard for others opinions and ultimately their money. I wish you the best of luck, as you are going to need it to stay in business for the long haul.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1604108283457, "text": "Jessica. Thank you for finally adjusting your review to reflect the truth. We apologize you feel like you waited so long but our longest wait time that night was 25 minutes.

Now that you changed your review, it finally reflects your true point of view. I will always defend my business when I do not believe I was in the wrong. If this was such a bad issue last night, you should have asked for a manager instead of constantly complaining and raising your voice in our establishment."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626b8655555555:0xcaa6bcabf907d80e"}

I was briefly in Huntsville visiting family and working.  This place was just down the block, so I decided to check it out for lunch.  I got the smoked bologna sandwich and was totally blown away!  The meat was incredible, and the combination of their sweet slaw, their pimento cheese, and the mustard was the perfect complement to this hearty, comfort-food sandwich.  While complimenting the owners, they told me about some cool sounding tacos they make with fried chicken and pimento cheese, but they only make it as a special.  They are planning on adding it to their permanent menu but hadn\u2019t done so yet.  I asked them if they would consider making it for me if I came back for lunch the next day, and they totally did!  It was fantastic!  These guys have a real gift for flavor.  And just when I thought they couldn\u2019t be any cooler, they doubled down and made me their fried pickles as a side (also something they have only experimented with so far and wasn\u2019t on the menu yet).  They make their own pickles, they are spicy and thinly sliced and perfect!  Since they are so thin, they fry up like chips and are mind-blowing good!  On top of all of this, they have many gluten free and vegan options.  So cool to have a place with options that my family members could eat and still serves food that I actually WANT to eat, as well!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b8655555555:0xcaa6bcabf907d80e"}

It's a shame because we were told this was the best BBQ in Alabama. I unfortunately am going to disagree with that claim.\n\nWe ordered take out for a party we were having. Several pounds of pulled pork and pulled chicken. The BBQ was ok, nothing spectacular. We did however have quite a few bones in both the chicken and pork which was alarming since we have young children who were also eating the food. I will say that the sauce itself was pretty good. So there was at least one positive.\n\nThe real disappointment with this establishment came to the bill. Total for our order was $150 which was split with another party. Rather than charging myself $75 and the other party $75, they charged me $150, then charged me again $75, then charged me again another $75. The other part was double charged as well. Upon complaining to Full Moon, I was told that I was not charged multiple times and that it was an issues with both my bank, and the other parties bank. It's now the next week and they are still in fact trying to charge my bank the additional charges, that is per my bank.\n\nWould you like to pay over $400 for only $150 of sub-par BBQ? Probably not.

The food was not bad good portions self serve on drinks and BBQ sauces to me a little pricey but overall not bad but to me it kinda lacked a smoked flavor? I've eaten a lot of BBQ over the years and I know good BBQ. Overall, the place had a bunch of celebrity pictures on the wall with TV's in the corner kinda felt more like a sports bar than a BBQ place? The place was clean and probably not a bad place to take a friend or meet up with someone as it was convenient but depends what you are looking for and how picky you are in great BBQ.

With that said, I had an experience there that has me rethinking my BBQ choices. My family and I went to Full Moom last weekend to celebrate my son's birthday. We ordered the smokey wings like we always do, as well as ribs, greens, mac and cheese, and fried okra. The sides were tasty as always, the okra cooked a little too hard, but edible. The wings however were smoked, but very raw inside. I am not sure why because it took them an hour to bring out the wings in the first place. When we brought this to the attention of the staff, they apologized and said they are not smoking anymore wings so we would have to choose something else. We specifically came for the smoked wings, but we had already been there over an hour at this point and just wanted to consume a meal. They were suppose to replace two 10 piece orders, buy brought two six pieces. Once this what brought to their attention the server got upset and said you need to go up to the register with your concern and they will work out a refund. So not only did they have cook my food, short me my food. I waited in a 20 min line to get reimbursed for services not rendered. This was my first bad experience at full moon, but sometimes that is enough.

We have to get a table because my  86 years old adopted  Mother has dementia and down \ud83d\udd3b n a wheelchair.  After waiting 20 minutes still no table available. My adopted 81 year old Dad asked to speak to a manager. The host then got us a table after waiting 30 minutes. We looked in all corners and they were available tables everywhere. When the manager did come to our table I told her about our experience and  asked her why this happened and she explained she was short handed with staff and she was swamped with doing to go orders. If someone is in a wheelchair and I can't stand very long and there's no sense in them not offering at least a place that's available to sit until our table was available. I have a bad torn hamstring. If management don't get better we will take our business somewhere else. I will be contacting cooperate office. I have the manager's name's. This is very bad customer service when we are regular customers and my adopted parents drive a long distance. Besides this Logan's the one in Moody is even much worse. We've gave Moody chance after chance. It's poor management at that store. It's ashame I just moved here a year ago and when I first started going and our good experience only lasted maybe 3-4 months now we can't even eat here anymore. It's lousy. Don't do any good to talk to the manager. Moody  Al don't know how too cook a medium rare steak. It's always too tough. I should have sent it back but I didn't. I had to feed it to my patients dog so it didn't go entirely to waste but was still very expensive steak to not get to enjoy. t's time to go to cooperate office with this!

There were three factors. Baby Back Ribs were not properly cooked......an ongoing problem at all the locations in the Birmingham area.  I have learned to have a picture on my phone showing the proper preparation when I run into this problem.  As I was politely attempting to explain this issue with manager John Prince, Mr. Prince's attitude was hostile, uncooperative and confrontational. When I asked if he knew how they were supposed to be cooked, he replied, why don't you tell me how they are supposed to be cooked.    At this point I knew I needed to document the conversation and started my phone recorder.  Mr. Prince said I am not going to talk with that recorder on.  I asked Mr. Prince's name and he just stared at me.  I then prepared to leave and Mr. Prince said his name and walked off.  My waitress did a splendid job.  The issue with the ribs is they were pre-cooked as usual, but then they were not finished on the grill.  They were warmed up and BBQ sauce smeared on them. It appears that race may have even been an issue.......I am white and Mr. Prince is black. Mr. Prince never acknowledged the ribs were not properly cooked nor did he offer any apologies or consolation for my dining experience. At approximately 5:15 pm, Logan's District Mgr Charlie Eben called me in response to my complaint.  Mr. Eben assured me that employees would be retrained to insure that proper food preparation would result and the John Prince would also be counseled.  Sorry Mr. Eben!  I have heard promises like that too many times.  It is a roll of the dice no matter how many free meal cards you want to send me.  Your sincerity is in doubt.  There are too many good and quality companies out there with whom I will do business.  Just for the record, I am including a photo of your signature Baby Back Ribs when prepared properly.....and this photo was taken at the Trussville location several years ago when they were doing it right!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5meTA3g87mqIEgBhLxUFVvMvDBZsYFfZ7Pi9K=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOruS7JqwKqimfLfTToU9zMi6yQsE4lgxgHOyW=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1488303649780, "text": "Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

I asked The hostess how much longer and she said her manager was waiting for a party to finish before she sat us. Another 10 minutes went by and I began to get upset because our placement should not be based on when another family finishes eating. We were about to get up and leave but a server came and got us, told us he was working a big party but he would be more than glad to serve us.

Now granted I am not an unreasonable person nor am I impatient but the lack of professionalism displayed by the management team was unacceptable. We arrived around 6:20 we were not eating to well over 8:00 pm. I didn't want any discount or free food just the common courtesy to say I'm sorry for your wait and we will get you and your family served as soon as possible, but I guess that was too much to ask for.

We sent the wings back and told the server that we would pay for the three wings he ate and ordered something else. The manager came out, not to apologize, but to tell us that we didn't need to pay for the three wings. Oh ok, thanks. Guess that was his solution to the problem but then we receive the replacement meal. The replacement meal that we paid full price for and paid extra to get an upgraded side of macaroni and cheese that came in a container that was less than half full. So what do we do?

That would be my only complaint all in all good spot to eat!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1480170680208, "text": "Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

Over half of the restaurant was empty. Then they seated four 2 tops before me and my wife and 1 child. Even though we were next in line according to the hostess. I can understand seating 2 tops over 3 because they are busy and that's what's available but they had half of the restaurant empty. There was no reason to adhere to section integrity when tables are open. Then they were out of the steak I ordered and when the steak I chose  was served it was cold.\n\nIn the end the food wasn't bad but wasn't worth what I paid or the 2 plus hours we spent there. I have finally learned my lesson and will never ever give them another chance.\n\nWe never heard from a manager to explain what was going on.

Hands down the WORST dining experience I've ever had in my 30 years. The wait wasn't too terribly bad, but after we were seated was terrible.\n\nMy roommate, her son, her girlfriend, and I were sat and promptly greeted by our server. We each ordered drinks, and then our food. The salads were pretty good, but then things took a U-turn.\n\nOur food was first brought out to the table next to us. When we brought this to the attention of the server who brought it, he said \"Let me go check the ticket.\" I know from some knowledge shared with me that when that happens, a fresh order is to be made because it touched the table. So the same man finally brings us our food, with the exception of my roommate, which I happen to know is another mistake, as we should have all been served together. I should also note these plates were the same ones as before, which I happen to know because I had a clear line of sight to the kitchen from where we were sitting. This is a health violation.\n\nSo after bringing our steaks out, I notice mine is undercooked (I ordered medium and got medium rare). My roommate's girlfriend's steak has been cut into, which is ANOTHER huge no-no. When this was brought to the attention of the man who brought them out (the same man I mentioned before), he claimed that was how it was cooked and acted as if he didn't care when we stuck a knife straight through the pre-existing hole in the middle of the steak.\n\nAfter the guy walks off, my roommate's girlfriend goes to our server and asks to speak with a manager. Our server points directly at THE GUY WHO HAD BROUGHT US OUR FOOD. You remember him- the rude one. So she asks if there is another manager around. Keep in mind that my roommate still hasn't seen the first morsel of her food. She informs her that the other manager's name is Jennifer and she will be right over. Jennifer was great and went above and beyond to try and turn our visit around. She quickly explains she will check on my roommate's food and bring fresh steaks out to replace the ones we had.\n\nMy roommate finally gets her food, and there is cinnamon all over her baked sweet potato- which she specifically ordered without cinnamon. But there is also cinnamon all over her steak- why would the steak have cinnamon on it in the first place? So they bring out a fresh potato, which tastes like it's been sitting out for about 2-3 days before it was brought out to the table.\n\nMy roommate's girlfriend and I finally get our fresh steaks, and mine is RARE when I cut into it- worse than before.\n\nWe left not having to pay for any of our food, including what my roommate's son ate because his was fine- but I still won't be back.

Let me say I've been to this Logan's many times since it opened, in fact it use to be one of my favorite restaurants in Trussville, but that has definitely changed. We got there a little after 2 PM and had to wait for a table until almost 3 PM. Now, I understand it was a Saturday, so even though it was annoying I was willing to look past it. Once we sat down, we sat there for 45 MINUTES without anyone even acknowledging that we were there. My uncle had to get up and go find someone to even get them to come take our drink order. After finally placing our drink order, it took another 45 minutes to get our drinks...and most of us ordered WATER. Our waitress had a terrible attitude,  we didn't even get our food until almost 5 PM, and once we did get it, it was not good. 3 1/2 hours for what should have been a simple lunch, when most of it was due to sitting around waiting on someone to even acknowledge that we were there is ridiculous. If it hadn't been for my grandmother refusing to leave, we would have left. And then, when my uncle asked about getting a discount, because there was no way we were paying full price for the terrible service, the manager had the nerve to ask \"Why do you need a discount?\" Even the management didn't seem to care. Needless to say, I will never be back.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1487439208391, "text": "We're sorry to hear we fell short of a great time.

However, after this pass weekend, they left me no choice. My fiance' and I go to Logan's faithfully, so needless to say, we have spent too much money in this place to be treated the way we were. The service and food quality has really gone down hill. Quite frankly, I can see why they're having to close so many locations now because the competition is better. Granted, all of the other Logan's in this city ARE indeed horrible, but this one was still the best in my book. That is no longer that case!\n\nFirst of all, we ordered a basket of fried pickles, and we received a half of half basket of fried pickles. I would rather they just told us they were out rather than bring us what they did. We ate those because we were hungry, it was getting late, and we expected a much better dinner than appetizer. It got no better! We waited over 30 minutes for food, and when we got it, most of it was cold as hell. I guess our waitress forgot about it and left it on the counter. My fiance' had meatloaf that was not thoroughly cooked in certain areas, he never got the fries he ordered, so he practically left everything on his plate, he never touched the mashed potatoes and gravy. Our waitress took up our concerns with the manager about our 30-minute wait and the missing items, and as a courtesy she removed 3 whole dollars from our ticket. That was the cost of a side! Gee thanks! You took off what exactly? Our taxes off one of our sides! Then she goes on to explain that they had a party of 35 people come in that they had no idea was coming. That's great, but what the hell does that have to do with us? That's not our problem!! If your business can't serve large parties while maintaining the quality and integrity of your food to all other visitors then you SHOULDN'T be in business... PERIOD!\n\nBasically, we paid full price for horrible food and horrible service. It's sad because we WERE faithful customers, and Logan's just lost us.

I have eaten here several times and the service has been average, but yesterday was awful. The hostess said it was a 30minute wait to get a table and their were people ahead of me waiting. However she said that if I would sit at the bar that there would be no wait and I would get immediate service. What a misstatement. As I proceeded to the bar, I couldn't help but notice 6 tables empty and wondered why no one had been seated there. Anyway, I sat at the bar and spoke to the gentleman who was seated to the right of me. He said that it had taken 20 minutes for them to take his to go order and that he had been waiting an additional 40 minutes for his prime rib order to come. After about 20 minutes of waiting myself, the bartender/waiter finally brought me a menu. I told him I wasn't expecting to wait an hour for my  food like the gentleman next to me. He said food was coming out in about 30minutes which obviously wasn't happening. Finally the waiter came to take the order of the gentleman on my left side who was with a young boy. He had been waiting over 30 minutes for his order to be taken. He explained to the waiter that he had ordered prime rib on his last visit and was disappointed because there was more fat than meat on his portion.  The waiter told him that the prime rib is usually very fatty and that gives flavor to the meat. I thought to myself that I have eaten prime rib at many places that had little fat and was very meaty, juicy and tender. The bartender/Waiter then suggested that the gentleman order the new York strip. At that moment I changed my mind about ordering the  16 ounce prime rib and decided that I would order the 22 ounce porterhouse,if I could ever get my order taken. By then the poor guy on my right was getting antsy because he had been there over an hour and said that if he had not already paid for his to go order that he would leave. Finally someone else came and asked him what he had ordered since he had been sitting there forever. That  person went to the kitchen and the bartender finally came out about 5 minutes later with the man's order. I thought to myself I hope he has his order right in his bag after that awfully long wait. So now I've been waiting over 35 minutes and still have not had my order taken. So now the bartender waiter guy goes to take someone else's order, bless their soul who was there before me. At that point, I could not take anymore,so I politely got up and told the people around me to have a nice evening and left. I would think that a major franchise as Logan's Roadhouse would provide extra help on busy days like Sunday. I left went to the grocery store and bought a large tbone steak and took it home and cooked it. Oh, also one lady ordered only potato skins to go and said she has been there over 30 minutes.

I have eaten here several times and the service has been average, but yesterday was awful. The hostess said it was a 30minute wait to get a table and their were people ahead of me waiting. However she said that if I would sit at the bar that there would be no wait and I would get immediate service. What a misstatement. As I proceeded to the bar, I couldn't help but notice 6 tables empty and wondered why no one had been seated there. Anyway, I sat at the bar and spoke to the gentleman who was seated to the right of me. He said that it had taken 20 minutes for them to take his to go order and that he had been waiting an additional 40 minutes for his prime rib order to come. After about 20 minutes of waiting myself, the bartender/waiter finally brought me a menu. I told him I wasn't expecting to wait an hour for my  food like the gentleman next to me. He said food was coming out in about 30minutes which obviously wasn't happening. Finally the waiter came to take the order of the gentleman on my left side who was with a young boy. He had been waiting over 30 minutes for his order to be taken. He explained to the waiter that he had ordered prime rib on his last visit and was disappointed because there was more fat than meat on his portion.  The waiter told him that the prime rib is usually very fatty and that gives flavor to the meat. I thought to myself that I have eaten prime rib at many places that had little fat and was very meaty, juicy and tender. The bartender/Waiter then suggested that the gentleman order the new York strip. At that moment I changed my mind about ordering the  16 ounce prime rib and decided that I would order the 22 ounce porterhouse,if I could ever get my order taken. By then the poor guy on my right was getting antsy because he had been there over an hour and said that if he had not already paid for his to go order that he would leave. Finally someone else came and asked him what he had ordered since he had been sitting there forever. That  person went to the kitchen and the bartender finally came out about 5 minutes later with the man's order. I thought to myself I hope he has his order right in his bag after that awfully long wait. So now I've been waiting over 35 minutes and still have not had my order taken. So now the bartender waiter guy goes to take someone else's order, bless their soul who was there before me. At that point, I could not take anymore,so I politely got up and told the people around me to have a nice evening and left. I would think that a major franchise as Logan's Roadhouse would provide extra help on busy days like Sunday. I left went to the grocery store and bought a large tbone steak and took it home and cooked it. Oh, also one lady ordered only potato skins to go and said she has been there over 30 minutes. I give yesterday at Logan's a negative -10.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1545182424141, "text": "Hi, Ira.

We even put in an appetizer of spinach dip. An hr goes by and still no food or appetizer. Finally, and hr and 10 mins later, the appetizer comes out, and it was salted and tasted old. We had them take it back. An hr and 30 mins later, or food comes out.... I ordered shrimp and rice with a sweet potato... yeah no sweet potato and the food visibility looked old, but was cold. Finally the manager comes out and says I'll take it to the back and put it in the microwave... really? We waited 2 hrs for food and now you want to microwave it? Uugghhh no.. I wont be going back.

The last 2 times we have come it has not been a good experience. Either the food is subpar or the service or both. Tonight we waited over 10 minutes to even be greeted. We had to get up and say something to the hostess for someone to come to the table. Well, then we waited another 5-10 minutes for drinks and rolls. I know it took our door an hr to come out.

Yesterday June 11th my family and I went there for my daughter's birthday dinner. We got seated right away. But then it took 10 minutes before the waitress came to take our drink orders. This was shocking since the restaurant was fairly empty. Also The waitress tried to bring my daughter Coca-Cola  twice when she had sweet tea that was empty . But that is not a big deal. Upon receiving our steaks That's when we were told that what my youngest daughter ordered they did not have. They asked her to re-order while the rest of us had our food in front of us.\nI am not the type of parent that will eat in front of my child that has nothing. At that point I asked to speak to the manager. I watched as the waitress went over to the manager and told her I would like to see her. But she did not come right over. It took at least five minutes before she came to see what was going on. I explained what had happened and she did not even apologize. I asked her what we can do at this point. She said she would take our food back and make sure that we all got them served at the same time. It just did not sit right with me that she did not apologize and I had to ask what we can do to fix the situation. At that point I asked her for a check because we were leaving. It was then she just pointed towards the door. Again not apologizing or saying you don't owe anything. Just pointing towards the door. So we walked out and left the food on the table To say I am disappointed is an understatement. I especially felt bad for my daughter who just wanted to eat there on her birthday.

His side salad never came with his order. I waited 20 min for a box to take our nasty food home to give to our dog. When I asked the waitress if she could get my to go side salad as fast as she could (seeing that I already paid for it and I over paid on my bill) there was literally about 3-4 bites of lettuce. My son had practice at 6:00 and it was close to 5:50. Mind you we we got there at 4:45 and ordered right away with our drink order. We were done eating before 5:30. This is a real shame since my son is obsessed with your dinner rolls and we frequently dine there. I will never go back again. I paid for things I didn't get. I don't know if the cook was new but my steak had so much seasoning on it it was barely edible. I scraped as much off as possible. If our waitress would have been more attentive I would have said something. We spent too much of our time seated with no one taking care of us. Even when I said I have to go please give me my receipt to sign, she dropped it off with no pen. Leaving me to have to chase down another waitress to borrow her pen.

But now my friend and I look back (2-3 days later) because we're still distraught over our experience, there were several red flags, which started from the moment we walked in to be seated.\n\n1.  When we walked in to be seated there was a customer complaining about there service and how they never received items that they ordered.\n\n2.  The first thing we noticed once seated (which was promptly considering they weren't busy at all) was the table across from us hadn't been cleaned.\n\n3.We sat for about 15 minutes before a server (black male). finally came to our table.  He stands there with his arms crossed speaking abruptly says, \"have y'all decided what you you want to order\". Without a greeting or introducing himself, we were caught off guard because it felt like he was a drill Sargent commanding us to order our food! We ordered and noticed his arms were still crossed AND noticed he wasn't writing down our order!  It felt as if someone made him come to serve our table.\n\n4.  While we were enjoying our appetizer, which a nice, cheerful young lady brought to us, he returns once to let us know since it was 2:44 p.m., it was too early to put our order into the system because  it's a certain time to order the 2 for $15.99 special, which we understood.\n\nAs a result of not writing down our order initially he came back to ask what our orders were again!  Then shortly after that, the initial young lady comes back to ask my friend what his entree was.\n\n5.  Also, while we initially started eating our appetizer, we noticed there were no napkins.  My friend had to get up (while on crutches and wearing a boot) had to go find us napkins!\n\n6.  The entrees were served and the first thing I noticed was my salmon seemed very dry and I thought it was because the oil topping was missing.  I also noticed I received a mushroom skewer, which I'm allergic to mushrooms.  I was supposed to receive the veggie skewer.\n\n7.  The table across from us still hasn't been cleaned, this has been after sitting there over an hour (2:30 - 3:30 at least) looking at it.\n\n8.  After talking to the sweet manager and explaining to her that this could be a training moment for our server(at this point we hadn't started eating to notice the actual condition of our food), by this time,  we're frustrated and ready to leave.\n\n9.  While the female manager was adjusting our ticket to remove the appetizer, I noticed my food wasn't cooked properly.  The sweet potato wasn't cooked all the way through!\n\nMy friend has to get up once again, now to request carry out containers because we haven't seen our server lately except from across the room while he was just standing there talking to someone.\n\nThe server comes to ask if we need carry out containers.  I explain that my friend just left to go find containers. At this point he realizes hat we can use a refill on our water, which was the best 2nd thing we've had after the appetizer.\n\n10.  The next day (Sunday).my friend takes his dinner to work and realizes his chicken isn't done in the middle!  This is when he and I start to reflect on our overall dining  experience at this location!,\n\nI do not recommend this location, please consider the Fultondale or Crestwood locations, l've only had good service and food from these locations.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1496690231605, "text": "We're sorry to hear about your experience.

We waited 30 min to get our drinks and bread and 45 min for our wing appetizer. When we asked why he told us the kitchen was backed up.

The steak was not seasoned had to use steak sauce. My daughter asked for extra queso which took 15 min to get her food was cold by the time it came out. The manager came out and explained the kitchen was not backed up and explained Dusty was new and he brought me the avocado they were out of.

We pay for the food and start reviewing the receipt as we thought the bill was high, only to notice that they charged us for 2 extra pints at full price.  Pints are 6.95, quarts are 9.95 (may not be exact to the penny but it's close).  I get the three dollar up-charge as that's the difference between the two but why would I pay nearly $14 for 2 pints (2 pints = 1 quart) when I could pay the $10 and get the same thing.  We brought this to what appeared to be the manager on duty (he had a different color shirt than everyone else) and all he would assure us of is that he would speak with the cashier and acted as if we were crazy for questioning the charges for what we received.  He made no offer to correct but only saying \"what do you want me to do?\".  As a customer service manager you should know full and well what to do.  On this alone I won't be back.\n\nFor the product, the brisket was cut thin (who does that) which severely limited the flavor available from the bark.  Got chopped pork, this was insanely dry.  Only saving grace is they give you almost 2 quarts of sauce - it's certainly needed.

I never leave negative google reviews but at this point I feel obligated to. On my first 2 visits to this cookout they manage to completely mess up both of my orders. On my 3rd visit I sat in the outside lane waiting to order but no one answered me through the speaker. I then pulled up to the window and asked if the outside lane speaker works and the employee told me no it did not. I asked why was there no sign on the speaker indicating this or why was the lane not blocked off. At this point there was already a line of cars waiting behind me attempting to order in the outside Lane. The worker then had the audacity to ask me if I would personally go tell the other cars waiting behind me that they would have to pull into the inside lane if they wanted to order. After all of that they did not let me place an order at the window and then told me I would have to drive around and get back in the one functioning lane. I promptly said no thank you and left.

When we did finally get to the board she would ask if we were ready to order LITERALLY every 4 seconds.\nNext, since it was our first time there (AND LAST) the order board was like reading hieroglyphics. there were so many things on the menu and none of them were set up in a way to where they made sense. The 2 Order takers took turns asking over and over and over again what our order was.\nI did not get what I wanted and honestly I don't know what i wanted because I couldn't understand the order board while being berated by two order takers, rushing us through.\n3rd... When we did get to the window to pay, the cashier was rude and cold and shoved our order at us without saying a word. I would have been offended but I could see on her face that she has a permanent attitude and will likely be nothing more than a cashier, ever. If she worked for me she would not even last 1 hour... And she would be gone with her nasty attitude and Lee Press-On Nails that were sharpened into long claws.

It took around  8 minutes from the start  of the line until we got the food but wait was mainly due to people reading there very big menu and not due to waiting on food.\n\nI did love the choices of options. I would recommend you view their menu online and decide what you want before you get there because you could become overwhelmed by choices if you see it for the first time.\n\nWe spent around 7 dollars each.  I got a drink, burger and dog. The other order was a chicken sandwich, slaw, onion rings and drink. The chicken patty was small and flat compared to other fast food. The slaw was in a small sauce cup and she only received three breaded onion rings. She said the taste was good but the potions small. My burger & dog were ballpark field quality in a good way. The taste was great and they were the perfect size. I also loved being able to customize what I wanted on both.\n\nI saw they had a walk up window for orders as well in case you didn't want to wait in the drive thru line.

I really like Cheerwine and you never see it on menus but it is here!  Burger was very good. When I unwrapped it from the foil, it looked like the picture. Cheese covered completely both patties but none was stuck on the wrapper as it would have been anywhere else. The onion slices were fresh and cut thickly. The pickles were delightful. They were rectangular had a great flavor and were not soggy \u2014 they had a nice little crunch to them. But the tomato!  It was so big that it also covered the whole sandwich and was clearly cut fresh.  I hope they always buy big tomatoes and that this is the way they always are. Fries and onion rings were both good. Hush puppies were not what we are used to in the South. Not bad but I won\u2019t order again.  Plenty of them in the bag.  They were the size \u2014 and looked like \u2014 a cocktail weenie that had been battered and fried.  The result is a large surface area that is hard and barely any fluffy corn meal inside. I do highly recommend going here \u2014 especially when hungry late. I will certainly be back very soon!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891f2b21c94d59:0xf5c15aee62a1d993"}
