A lady by the name of Jordan was, this ladies name was Gloria! When I confronted her and told her NO MA'AM you were not in the room Jordan the dr and myself were the only 3 people in there that day, she put le on hold and later came back to the phone with a different attitude, but informed me that my Dr was out of town and guess what HE HAD NO FILL INS..

Then she asked if my primary doctor was in the group, my response was no but I have two specialist in the group, so she then informed me that they couldn\u2019t see me because I didn\u2019t have a primary doctor there. The website says nothing about having to already have a primary there! Either she was lying or the website is giving out bad information! I just drove all the way from west Mobile to go to the walk in clinic and couldn\u2019t even walk in! Wow! I\u2019m sooo disappointed, someone really needs to correct this problem, it\u2019s so unprofessional and so was she!
