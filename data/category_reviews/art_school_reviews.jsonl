The art classes for adults allow both children and adults to pursue any artistic interests they may have. I'm currently in her adult class. I can create my own project or draw a still life of candles; whatever my interests are, she helps me through the process. Whether you're in her children's or adult class, the environment is always comfortable and fun. She treats all of the children as if they are her own, and she's friends with her adults students. I'm at the age where I'm a mix of both; she gives me motherly advice, but we also talk about what's going on in both of our lives. She really cares about her students' lives; she'll ask you about your grades, your siblings, your children, or your grandchildren.

I can definitely tell when someone is trying to get a bad reaction out of me.  As I assess the situation further, I can only assume her intentions were bad from the beginning. No child should be taken from his/her classroom to another classroom without the parent knowing, especially since there was no problem.  I mean why go take my child from his class to yours? Then once I do formally meet you, all you have for me is shadiness and ill intent. My family expects professionalism first and foremost, not shadiness and ill intent. I honestly thought she was related to the bigots who wrongfully evicted us since we don't know her and she seemed to be reaching for my son. After about 2 months of her saying and having weird behavior towards us, I sent a letter of concern.  Anyhow, I told them about her calling my son clueless to our faces, I told them about her coming to the car to say hey and bye everyday just to slam my BMW door. I told them about her going the extra mile to buckle him in his seat belt in order to give the full effect that my son is clueless. I even expressed my concerns of another teacher grabbing his wrist as he proceeded to the car. I hand delivered the 2 copies to the school. I didn't hear back from the school all year regarding my concerns. Things got worse. Suddenly we became the bad people. Their behavior resembled that of a cult as they tried to make us as uncomfortable as possible. We were excluded from almost everything regarding the school. Except the times found out through social media, family, or friends. You should see the school pictures they sent home thinking we would purchase them. Perhaps it was a sick joke. We didn't know about Awards Day, we weren't told about Day with Dad. I showed up with cupcakes for Day with Dad bc we found out that morning and my husband didn't have time to request off. Well they tell me I should have gotten an ok from his teacher before bringing food. The thing is, where is the schools communication for my family?  Well, during the last week of school, we went to the school board and spoke with James Pope. Guess what? School starts in 2 days and we haven't heard back from them all summer. Not one phone call, Not one email. June 15th, they sent me a letter saying that he will be withdrawn from school on Friday, June 29th. Yet, they still have not responded to my letter of concern. Children can audition for this school regardless of where they live. Why can't my son also audition? As a black prestigious mother of 2 beautiful biracial children, I rub people the wrong way without even trying. I suppose they don't want the children at their school seeing black women with white men. It will surely give them ideas. Do Not Give In to the people who want to label all of us bad. Furthermore, I wouldn't dare give Julie Dunn the satisfaction to make me act less than prestigious. If I can hold my composure under these circumstances, I also expect my other prestigious black people to be just as mentally strong and not give in. This school is full of bad apples and they have \"Uncle Toms\" who stand behind them. They will Not do anything about Bullying either. I have friends who children also attend there and the school will not acknowledge these types of issues.
