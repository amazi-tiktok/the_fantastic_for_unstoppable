Glynn(who\u2019s family owns the business) was my\u201dLow Pressure\u201dsales person,who remained completely calm as I changed my mind 3-4 times.LOL I ended up with building with regular looking eves with overhang. I ended up having 3 sides closed in. I had contacted 3-4 other places and was left with little reassurance that they would even show up,and they all wanted the spot to be level within 3-4 inches,my spot was sloping at least 12 inches,I explained this to Glynn and he compensated for it\u201dno problem\u201d. So far a\u201dsmooth talker\u201dcould have led me along,now it\u2019s time to actually build something. The crew,Alben and Richard showed up early with a nice\u201dbusiness looking\u201drig:a nice heavy duty pickup with a nice trailer,not a\u201dRag-Tag\u201dlooking outfit. All of their cordless tools were Milwaukee brand and neatly stowed. They snapped a chalk line for the screws and did a great job\u201dboxing in\u201dthe corners and enclosing the the far end. Yes, I spent a little more than I had planned but not much. What I ended up with looks pretty much like a garage,not something you bought at a farm store to put hay in.

However cardinal\u2019s crew finished my roof within 24 hours (start to finish). Let me say my roof is huge so I was shocked. This part was the bonus the benefits for me was speed, warranty and the product used.

Will recommend to everyone who needs a roof replacement in the future.\n\nI wanted to add to my first review, because I needed to add to how great my experience has been with Cardinal Roofing. I have had two roofs replaced now with Cardinal Roofing. Both were done with the same crew but a few months apart. The second roof was my personal house. The crew came early and worked hard all day long through hot temperatures, muggy conditions, and rain off and on. With only one small break in the middle for lunch the crew worked until they could see no more, then came the next day and finished the job up. The roof looks amazing. The crew worked with precision and accuracy that I have not seen before. I have had roof work done in the past to some of my rentals and the experience was not good. This time was different. From beginning to end I was treated with respect and valued as if they were replacing someone in their own family\u2019s roof. Anthony Gioiosa, who is a representative for Cardinal Roofing, saw the job through from beginning to end, handled all of my concerns with professionalism and grace that has exceeded all of my expectations. I will be using Cardinal Roofing for all of my future roofing needs and will be recommending them in the future to everyone who needs roofing help. Great job Cardinal Roofing!

Jason Smith was always more than punctual, helpful with every step of the process, and laid out every minute detail for us as this was a roof for a multi-level 4,500 sq. ft. house. If it had not been for Jason Smith, we might not have our brand new roof in the fast amount of time it came together. He noticed extremely significant hail damage to my roof that likely meant replacing the entire roof. I was surprised that a roof on this size of a house could be completely torn off, plywood repaired or replaced, with all new shingles, flashing and vents put on in one single day, but that is what happened. A week later we were visited by inspector Mac, who answered questions I had concerning 2 spots on the roof where I saw some materials I had questions about. He got on the roof, took pictures, and came down to explain theses to me, and I was totally satisfied. It can be scary as a homeowner to take on such a massive and costly project, move the family and animals out of the house for a couple of days, and hope you've chosen the right company for the job. After my first meeting with Jason Smith I had no doubt that I could cancel all other roofing contractors I had called for appointments and go with Cardinal Roofing, due to his extreme efficiency, professionalism, and thorough knowledge of all aspects of the roof repair. From consulting with insurance (which he has immense amount of experience doing) to the step-by-step process of the installation, even down to telling me how and when to have my TV satellite dish reinstalled (and not on our beautiful new roof due to leaks/damage the bolts could cause), Jason brought us all information we never even knew we would need to know about a roof installation. Our satellite dish now lives happily installed in our yard on the ground. There was an army of persons installing our roof in 90 degree heat, and they worked very efficiently and very hard. Within 2 days after the roof was on and complete, someone had swept my entire property with large magnets to gather up roofing nails and other debris scattered about from the install. I did a thorough look over my driveway when I returned to make sure no nails were left that could cause my car to get a flat tire. They had gotten every single one. Within a week after the roof was completed all materials - extra tarp, shingle boxes, plywood, etc., were removed from my property by Cardinal Roofing. I cannot express enough that Jason Smith and those at Cardinal Roofing were professional, punctual, and always available to answer any question I had, via phone call or text message. Jason Smith is invaluable to the company. We are so grateful to give our house a much-needed update, better living for our family, more equity, a facelift due to a change of color from a dated orange roof, and most importantly, zero leaks. I am forever grateful to Jason and Cardinal Roofing and would highly, HIGHLY recommend them to anyone and everyone whoever asks me about a roofing job on any scale. Also, Jason never asked me himself, but I contacted him and insisted that he put a Cardinal Roofing sign in my yard when they were completed, so that others in the neighborhood knew who did this beautiful and very fast, excellent quality job on such a large house.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1598366476517, "text": "Sadie, we're a little late here, but THANK YOU for your kind review!

The actual work contracted, putting on the roof, I guess we'll see in the years to come but the behavior and ethics of this company are known and it is not a good story.  Originally they did not think the Insurance company was going to fully pay out the policy so they gave me a cash quote and fully expected to leave that in place after the insurance company decided to pay fully (after repeated harassing by me).    Mary Margaret spoke of it while standing in my front yard as the third inspection took place.   That even if they did decide to pay out fully that the original quote was valid and that we were \"technically\" committing fraud.  She had no issues with it, even mentioning that I would make out nicely.   I admit I was ignorant and perhaps complicit about learning the subtleties of the arrangement.   I got scared when I fully realized what was at stake and full disclosure was weighing my options at that point.  I had decided that 1500 bucks or whatever it was going to be was not worth the penalties and possible ramifications.  Cardinal needed to send in a completion certificate.  After avoiding my calls for two days Mary finally answered the phone.  I needed to know what they needed to send in the certificate and what was the final total given the insurance company estimate.  Mary encouraged me to call them and defraud them by telling them I could not wait for the certificate.   I immediately sent in the full amount to Cardinal as I knew at that moment Cardinal was without ethics and could not be trusted.  CYA was in full effect.    Then to put the cherry on top, they did send in the certificate but now my insurance company notified me that the full amount, or what I thought it was, was not correct.  That I had overpaid Cardinal.  My insurance company told me that, not Cardinal and they had no intention of telling me.  So I called them and let them know that I needed my refund immediately.  The owner, Jody, feigned ignorance and defiantly \"objected\" to my insinuation of impropriety.    The problem folks?   I have every text, every document and most importantly every phone call documented and recorded.  I have the audio.   This is not a question of right and wrong.  Cardinal was going to defraud my insurance company and complicit or not initially, I was not.  I was however not going to allow them to defraud me.  I would stay very far away from these people.  If you see them chasing ambulances in your neighborhood understand these people are not ethical nor honest.\n\nJody, I have the audio.  Feel free to ring me up and give me your email address.  I'll be happy to send you copies.\n\nIf you read this far and are confused at all the other positive reviews notice one thing.  They haven't responded to this review to refute it and I never heard another peep from them when they realized I had the proof.\n\nFinally, look at the review profiles of the reviewers on here.
