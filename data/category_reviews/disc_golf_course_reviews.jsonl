Trees line every fairway and there are no open shots. It is not super dense foliage and there is usually an opportunity to save par on an errant drive if you get creative. There are a lot of short par 4s (around 425 feet) which creates birdie opportunities. A good player could probably eagle a few. Perhaps that\u2019s why it\u2019s called the eagle!  Unfortunately the baskets on holes 16 and 17 were missing on my round. The course wraps around a large dog park and there is a nice walking trail as well.\n\nOverall this was a very enjoyable course. It\u2019s not that difficult, but there is just the right amount of challenge to keep you engaged. There are no \u201csignature holes\u201d per say and a lot of the holes are similar in style.
