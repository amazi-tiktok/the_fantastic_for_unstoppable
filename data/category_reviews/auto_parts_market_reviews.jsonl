I go back the next day to try and replace it and they didn\u2019t have it. They then would not refund me. The part was picked and sold to my mother after being very specific about what I needed and they just made a mistake. No biggie but it is ridiculous to not make good on it... they tried to convince me that I should just put it on and not attach the sway bar and after that the thought I would let him weld a tab on there.
