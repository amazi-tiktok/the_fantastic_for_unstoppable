I ordered mine to go: Fajita Plate with chipotle chicken, add charro beans. The chicken had a nice flavor and heat to it. The guacamole was fresh and chunky. There are just a couple of things that kept me from giving it 5 stars:\n\n- When I ordered charro beans, I wasn't expecting plain refried beans. Perhaps they are one in the same and I was mistaken.\n- Most Mexican to-go places include a bag of chips and salsa. While I never eat the chips, I think the salsa would have gone a long way in helping the flavor of the refried beans (see above). Also, I thought fajitas came with a side of tortillas--but the fajita chicken and vegetables were so flavorful, tortillas were not necessary.\n\nI would recommend this place and will definitely try it again.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1500169260242, "text": "Thank you for your feedback.

The menu has changed the quesadilla now has soy sauce. BAD IDEA GUYS WHO WOULD WANT SOY SAUCE ON A QUESADILLA!!!  My boyfriend called to ask if there was soy sauce on the quesadilla and the worker responded \"not really\" \ud83d\ude33 Wth does that even mean??!  You either have soy sauce on it or you don't. Then after all that they forget to put the fajita burrito in the bag. So my boyfriend calls them again and ask if they can remake it since they left it out and we paid for it and would have to travel 15 mins to get  back there. They said they would remake it.
