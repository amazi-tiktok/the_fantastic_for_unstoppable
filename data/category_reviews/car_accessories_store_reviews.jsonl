Devon helped out anytime I called to follow up on when parts where coming in along with the progress during the day of install.

The employee further told me that their delivery truck would be there on Wednesday. He seemed to indicate the truck would bring newer dated batteries. I left my name and number but never got a call. The following Monday I visited the store again and spoke to the same employee. He checked and said they didn't get any newer batteries in. He said he was going to the Alexander City store that afternoon and would see if they had a newer battery. He again said he would call me either way and let me know. I confirmed that he still had the note with my name and number. And again he never called. I sent an email to AutoZone's national website regarding their lack of customer service. They replied and said that my email was being forwarded to the district manager and that I would be contacted within 24 to 48 hours. That didn't happen either. I sent a second email to AutoZone letting them know that the district manager never contacted me. They said my second email was also forwarded to the district manager.A day or two later the district manager finally attempted to contact me.

They are 40 minutes from where we live, but highly recommended by a friend. Great experience, it was quick, under an hour and it looked great. So we schedule my car for the 1st available appt., a couple of months away. No problem. My husband wasn't able to pay deposit over the phone that day - somekind of trouble with payment system. Female told my husband no problem, we were a repeat customer. Morning of 1 pm appointment I call to confirm time only to find my appointment had been cancelled because a deposit wasn't paid and they had already scheduled another for that time slot. She said he (her husband?) tried contacting me the day before but I had just swapped to a new phone -and my voice mail wasn't set up yet. Next available appt.was in May. I just tell her I'll reschedule, or find another place to have it done. She offered to call if there was a cancellation.  My husband calls them and reminds her that she said the deposit issue was okay. She admits she didn't make a note of it and they can get me in. I take my lunch hour and an extra hour (or so) off from work, drive 40 minutes one way, then when I say I'll just wait while it's being done, he says that it will take 3-4 hours for my sedan. I based my timeline on our previous experience (<1 hour) and we were NOT told on any of the three phone calls leading up to the appointment to expect a 3-4 hour window! They even knew I was driving from 40 minutes away. I am not bashing this business, I am just sharing my experience.

Took my 6.0 LQ4 block, crank and heads to have them reworked, cleaned and check to see if they were still within spec limits. We discussed engine gaskets rebuild kits. I left and then called on the phone to discuss more pricing and gaskets again. I went back to stewarts to bring some more parts to be cleaned but on that visit talked again about rebuild kits and gaskets. Now each time i talked to the owner about the gasket sets i asked, were they felpro? his answer every time was yes they will be felpro. He gave me a price which was little more then what i had search online for but i decided to go with his kit since the gaskets were definitely felpro . well is snowed the next day and roads were closed so i had to wait another day for him to finish. roads were still bad so he came in late but he was finished around lunch time. So when i get there to pick up my parts i ask where is the rebuild kit. The machinist shows me the box and the gaskets sets are not felpro, they are Victor reins gaskets. I refused to buy the kit because he told me a they would contain felpro. The machinist told me that felpro and victor reins were made by the same company that they were the exact same gaskets. That was his first lie too me. Those are two entirely different companys, with different pricing and materials. so we deducted the kit and now i owe for the machine work done, which is 345.00 I pay the balance go home and start unloading the block and notice the cam bearing that they installed for me were damaged from the installation too. Took it back and the owner said he doesn't know any other way to put those bearings in. well duh!!! but you don't damage them when they go in , if you do damage them then you take them out and install new ones. but they sent me home with that crap. so i decided to look over the heads real good since things are already not good. well the heads are aluminum heads , they look as if someone took a wire brush to clean the mating surfaces on the heads. they are scratched badly. there are several scratches going across the from one cylinder to the other which will leak when it is installed back on the block. So i took the heads back to stewarts this morning and asked to talk to someone about this and the owner wasn't there but the machinist was. so i showed the head to the machinist and asked what he did to it. he said he milled it. i asked is that acceptable? he said yes. i asked if he could show me any where in writing, online or any mechanic that can tell me that those scratches on the mating surface of the head was acceptable .The machinist looked at me and said pick my head up and get the hell out of there. You can imagine what my response was. :) but I'm not happy with this and the place of business is just horrible. I have been building engines for over 23 years and i have never seen anyone tell me that scratches on a aluminum head was acceptable to install. They refused to take of this and now i have to take the heads and have them resurfaced if they can even be resurfaced again. i also heve to take the block and crank to another machine shop to have them check and correct everything stewarts touched. BEWARE SHOTTY WORK AND BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. STAY AWAY if you want good work performed.\n\nYour Desired Resolution:\nAt this point all i want is a complete refund for the services they performed. I tried to go back to talk to them and i was told to get the hell out of their store. The work performed was bad and i don't fell comfortable letting them touch anything else of mine.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889cb974de7cfd5:0xb07e55d35fc40cf9"}

I write this review after driving an hour and a half to do business with them.  First off all, they do more than trucks.  30 inch rims for your car they do it, headlights, taillights, lifts, flares, tonneau covers, etc... if you want it they can get it.  There prices are hard to beat.  But let me talk about what sets them apart from everyone besides their exceptional pricing.  From the moment you walk in you are treated with respect and that they are glad to see you there.  They listen very intently to what you want whether in person or on the phone.  This is missed by so many other places.  They go through getting prices as well as can show you options.  They do this to make sure you get exactly what you want for the best price.  While doing so they take notes on the conversation to ensure they don't have to ask you several times because they forgot.  Making sure they stay on top of it and making everything move flawless.  The business is very well maintained and the showroom is definitely a showroom, not just a display, spotless.  Respect and honesty is projected so loudly by the staff, you will feel like its your own family that runs the business.  I can't say enough about this because I have been there a few times for different purchases and  the entire staff is friendly as well as great to interact with.  As I return to them next week to make another purchase, driving an hour and a half versus using the internet, I know I am meeting people who are like family, getting the best price, the right part, quality parts, but also the best service that I have seen in the state.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bfdfe2467e0eb:0xd5c2a691b573b7bb"}

(Employee)\nDate of incident: 2/20/21 - 4:30-5:00pm.\n\n\ud83d\udd25Bought a refurbished starter from there a few years ago. Returned it because it went bad and had a warranty. Did not want to deal with another refurbished starter, so I requested a brand new one. Was told they cannot get a brand new one which is fine. So they told me I could return the defective refurbished starter I had for a refund so I can use that refund on buying a new starter from another store. At that time, that particular employee was real helpful and kind to me.\n\nThen the incident on 2/20/21 happened when I returned on that date with my defective starter. was dealing with the store manager Mike and his employee Thomas D. at the time. I was told that the starter needed to test bad in order for me to get a refund which is fine, because I had my mechanic test the starter beforehand and I recorded a video as evidence. After waiting a good few minutes because it seemed like something was wrong with the machine, the store manager Mike comes out and says that the starter tested good, but that he would still honor the refund. I told him that's fine, but the starter should have tested bad because my mechanic already tested it and I watched him test it, so I pretty much told Mike that the machine is to blame, then he got defensive and rude with his tone of voice about the machine clearly stating that the machine was not incorrect. To avoid further debating, I directly said to just do the refund. His attitude regarding the situation was unprofessional and unacceptable.\n\nWhat makes the situation even worse is the fact that the employee Thomas D. asked me for my driver's license on returning the defective starter which should not have happened, because I have my receipt. When I asked him why he's asking for my driver's license, he said they were supposed to do that on returns, but that's obviously not true. Something didn't feel right, so I called another advance Auto parts store about the situation and that store told me that advance auto of Enterprise were in the wrong for taking my driver's license. My driver's license has the address to my Mother's home because it's an old address and I am not comfortable with that address being on file because I'm protective of my mother and concerned for her safety. I do not trust people I don't know, and I definitely do not trust that advance Auto parts store anymore and ever again.\n\nThey acted very shady and I felt discriminated because I'm part Asian. I've been shopping there off and on for years for myself and for my Mother. As of now, I am no longer a customer and I want my information out of that system immediately. Yes, I got my refund, but I shouldn't have had to go through that much trouble to get it, or feel that uncomfortable. Everything that happened that day was pretty much recorded on my phone along with two eyewitnesses that were with me in case I need them for future reference.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1617481519561, "text": "Hello KJ, thank you for leaving your comments about your visit to our Enterprise location.

I went here in June and spoke with Ben about correcting an issue that was caused at another car audio place.\n\nBen assured me that it would be an easy fix and told me to come by the following week. I called one day that next week and Ben said that they were too busy on that particular day. I asked if I could just make an appointment instead. Ben said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m kinda tied up right now. Try us again later this week.\u201d\n\nI was in the area the following week so I went by. After greeting me, Ben remembered me and immediately told me that they couldn\u2019t get to my car that day. I told him that I wasn\u2019t expecting a same-day service. I, instead, wanted to make an appointment. Ben thanked me for coming by and told me that the shop had been so busy.\n\nHe, again, assured me that the shop could easily correct the problem. He went on to say, \u201cIt\u2019s really a five-minute fix. I could do it now, but I don\u2019t want to just in case something happens and makes it longer than that and throw our day off.\u201d\n\nMy appointment was set for Wednesday, July 8th at 9:30am. I used PTO at work so that I could finally get the issue taken care of. The evening before my appointment, Ben called and told me they would have to cancel (not reschedule) my appointment because they didn\u2019t get a chance to finish a car from the previous day. He went on to say that they could probably do it at \u201csome other time\u201d and he\u2019d call me to let me know when. Of course, I was never called.\n\n\u2022Why would you tell your customer that you\u2019re too busy to give them an appointment?
