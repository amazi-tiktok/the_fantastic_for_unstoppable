I had him come out for a Master bath remodel to replace a tub valve and re-route/rough in plumbing to a walk in shower.  His plumber that came out to do the initial work did not turn the new valve to the bath tubs water on, and after tiling up the shower and trying to turn the bath water on, there was no water.  Had to go back in through the tile and found out the valve was never turned on/tested to the tub.  The rough-in work to the shower ended up being so poorly done, we are having to hire another plumber to come out and go in through the wall to fix the shoddy work that was done.  The plumber that came out to do this initial work was too concerned with having to leave early to officiate a soft ball game.  The worst thing about it is the owner is not standing behind his work and fixing himself. He has repeatedly blown me off and will not come back out.  I could also go in to how he threatened legal action if I didn't pay him for partial work before the job was completed, but that is another story.  If he is that concerned about needing money before a total job is completed, not a reputable plumber.  Beware", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889338819de61b7:0xea3f1db7e03a5777"}

When one of my two HVACs went out in my new home, I called the company that installed it and they said the earliest they could come was three days.  When I called ACS, they were there the next morning.  I have been calling on ACS ever since.  During a heat wave, after Robert explained he would have to charge overtime, ACS fixed my HVAC on a Sunday morning.  Whenever ACS was at my house to fix my HVAC, after analyzing the problem, they were clear on what needed to be done,  how long it would take to fix it, how much it would cost, and why.  If necessary, they also provided a variety of payment options so I could choose what best met my situation.  So when one of my two HVACs needed to be replaced, ACS was one of two companies I called for an estimate.  While the other estimate was flowered with discounts for various reasons, the ACS estimate was clear, concise, and competetive.  Robert Akins spent a lot of time explaining options and whether they were worth the expense.  The unit ACS proposed has a lifetime condenser replacement warranty if the compressor ever fails.  An option ACS had that the other did not was a ten year warranty on the labor for warrantied repairs.  Finally, when the competitor said it would take at least a week for the replacement HVAC to come in, ACS had my new unit installed the next day on December 22, the week of Christmas!  So whether you are looking to replace your current HVAC unit or just repair the one you have, I highly recommend Robert Akins and ACS.  They have always been there when I needed them and taken care of the problem efficiently and professionally.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862657b007200dd:0x7c27a392b36f81dc"}

Unfortunately, occasionally, due to whatever reasons whether by our fault or other circumstances, a customer is dissatisfied.  In this case we did not learn of Mr. Hastie's dissatisfaction until he posted a negative review.  There was no phone call, no inquiry, no attempt to communicate or seek a resolution to his complaint, just a negative review.\nAfter speaking to the technician and reviewing the statements associated with this service I found the following facts to be true:\n\nMr Hastie called to report his house was hot and his air conditioning was not working late in the afternoon.  I diverted a technician to his house after 4:30 pm to help him so that hopefully he would not have to go through another hot night in his house.  (We go on overtime at 5:00 pm).  The technician found the primary problem and responded by installing a part from his truck which was close to what was required but not the correct spec.  The temporary fix allowed the unit to run and cool the house overnight providing immediate relief for Mr. Hastie.  The technician did not charge for the overtime.\n\nThe part required was an odd spec which the technicians and many of our professional vendors do not carry locally (often an order Item).  The next day our technician searched among our vendors until he found a part locally.  He returned to the Hastie residence and exchanged the temporary part for the correct one.  Our technician also inspected the refrigerant charge and found a need to add some refrigerant to achieve the correct cooling specs per his instruments upon this return visit.\n\nMoreover, our technician did not charge Mr. Hastie for the procurement or travel time required to serve his needs.  For the more than 3 hours time involved working exclusively on Mr. Hastie's behalf our technician charge him only for a service call and 1 hour labor.  As far as the cost of the part:  yes we, like most service operations who provide a responsive service, charge a markup on parts.  We do not attempt to compete with internet pricing.  Our pricing structure reflects the convenience of having the part, our vendors supporting us to have a part available, and the network which guarantees and supports the quick response business.\n\nOtherwise, a client is free to diagnose his own problem, order his parts online and wait in the heat until the part arrives (hoping he did not make a mistake or that a wrong part was shipped.)\n\nIn conclusion:  Our technician followed pricing guidelines which have been satisfactory for our extensive client base for more than 40 years.  He waived labor costs in the hopes of establishing Mr. Hastie as a long term satisfied customer.  Mr. Hastie indicated to the technician that he was satisfied and grateful for the prompt service and relief from the heat.\n\nHad Mr. Hastie called to inquire about the charges, we could have explained to him and even offered him a coupon if he was still not happy.  Personally, I see this negative review as simply malicious with the intent of harming our otherwise excellent review status and without any interest in understanding or seeking a resolution with ACS, Inc."}, "gmap_id": "0x8862657b007200dd:0x7c27a392b36f81dc"}

I told him that it sounded like we needed to send a tech out for diagnostics.  He asked me what the charge would be and I told him the minimum cost of a service call and labor for a call out.  He then asked me an unusual question for our industry.  He asked me why we charged for diagnostics.  From having dealt with the public for 40 years I understood that he was not familiar with how service companies operate.  I proceeded to explain to him why a company had to charge to send a tech to a remote location, time, equipment cost, travel, insurance, education and training, overhead and all of the costs associated with a working company.  I explained that the tech, for instance, had to be paid from the moment he clocked in which included the driving time to a residence and back, hence the service call.  Nathan took offense at the explanation and told me that he did not need a \"lecture\".  I asked him then why he asked such a question if he did not expect or want a comprehensive answer, to which he abruptly hung up the phone. There was no profanity.  Moments later this negative review arrived in my email.\n\nPart of the service we provide is educational.  We are a very empirical and logic based company.  We deal with applied science.  When a question is asked we do our best to answer it thoroughly.  I often help clients solve heating and air conditioning issues over the phone at no charge when able.  I have recently successfully instructed non technical house wives in restoring their heat over the phone. My communication skills are very good.  In this circumstance it was very important that the potential client understood the charges and per his questions why there were charges.  If the customer does not understand that he will be charged for a visit and that he has an obligation to pay, or if he protests the value of the service prior to a visit by a tech, then we cannot send a tech to his residence.\n\nUnfortunately, part of the job of dealing with the general public is to screen the potential client to make sure that the interaction with the company and the technician is successful and satisfactory for both parties.  We will not send a technician into a contentious situation.  We would have liked to have helped Nathan but the initial phone interaction and the \"hang up\" indicated that the interaction would not be successful."}, "gmap_id": "0x8862657b007200dd:0x7c27a392b36f81dc"}

We spent several hours working in and around your septic tank. Plumbing is often a process of elimination, and you understood that there was a good chance the pump may still need to be replaced, however since it was fully functional when we finished you wanted to hold off on the more costly replacement.

Sostarted looking for a plumber. I found John Hearn Plumbing. They are open seven days a week and do not charge more for holidays. I gave them a call. They sent so meone out. The man looked at my water heater and gave me a price of $1100. I accepted it and told him to get started. He had a hard time getting someone to open up the place to get the heater. While he was waiting on them he left to go do work at Western Sizzlin. About two hours later he came back and left the heater on my carpool and went back to Western Sizzlin. Even though I was first I got pushed back for a higher paying job. He showed back up just before dark to put n this heater. He had to put it in by flashlight because at that time the light in the utility room was blown. When he took it out of the box it was broken. He fixed it an made a notation on my invoice. So I just paid $1100 fo a brand new broken heater. When he got done that night there was still water on the floor. Could not tell at that time for there was a leak or not.  A couple of days later called them back out because there was a puddle on my carport. The same guy came out in the dark again to find a leak. He looked at the heater and sad it was not it. He looked around and decided that it was my washing machine leaking and charged me another $125. I bought a new washer and hoses and had it installed. There has been water on the floor of the utility room ever since. Monday June 17 the leak that the sad I did not have finally got bg enough that I could see it. So around 3pm I called them. They said that they would send someone out the next day and would call me before hand to let me know. At five thirty Tuesday June18th I called them back to see why I had not heard anything. They acted like I hadn't called. Someone showed up at 8:30pm and sad that the leak is on the copper pipe and s not part of the water heater and would cost me $95. I sad let me get this straight I paid $1100 for a broken heater the a couple of days later paid $125 to have him come out to fix a leak that he could not find and now you want me to pay another $95 to fix the that should have been fixed the day the heater was put in?
