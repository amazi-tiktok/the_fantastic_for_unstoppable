I was being told prices for one, not the total for both. And have them circle and clearly state the quoted price before signing!

We set a high standard for ourselves in serving our clients & we're sorry that this was not met in your interaction with our business.  We strive to be as clear & transparent with itemized pricing on our service envelopes detailing parts, labor & totals along with a detailed description of work to be done as to remove any chance of surprise at pickup.  Regarding your visit, we created two separate envelopes because we provided two different services, one pair of earrings with 18k protector backs & specialty posts & one pair of earrings with 18ky screw posts & screw backs.  On each envelope, we included an in-depth description of parts & labor needed to complete your job along with the total.  Each envelope had a total written & differing totals ($257.10 & $300.70) due to different mechanisms.  We DID obtain your signature on each envelope as acknowledgement & confirmation of the details regarding the services BEFORE we proceeded.  We understand that your complaint is that our 10 yr. sales professional, Santana, did not give you \"the grand total verbally\".  It is very typical for a client that may want to pick up their services independently from one another, i.e.:  $257.10 one week & the $300.70 the next week.  Although we may have fallen short with \"verbally\" providing you with the grand total, we were completely transparent with our detailed written description & totals for each signed envelope.  We do value you as a new customer as well as your other family members & hope you will reconsider visiting Jewelry by Design in the future."}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c3ed9f2d5b:0x2fb4de104c11cb57"}

I walked into Jewelry by Design with my custom made, one of a kind engagement ring. It has 4 bands that meet in the back. My engagement ring had cracked where the bands meet and one of the bands had broken off. I still don\u2019t know how it happened but I was devastated so I took it in to get it repaired. I took it to Jewelry by Design because of all the great reviews and because the original jeweler was now retired. When I took it in, the service was great and I also asked to resize down 1/4 size because it had been fitting loosely. My first indication that something wasn\u2019t right should have been when they didn\u2019t check to see if they agreed that I needed it resized. When I came back for my ring, I could no longer put it on my finger after only going down a 1/4 size and they had bent the bands causing the halo for the diamond to be out of place. It no longer looked like the same ring and the setting for the diamond was crooked. I went back to them the next day and explained that I believed somewhere in the resizing process/repair that some of the bands looked a little out of place and asked if they would be able to fix it. I also brought a picture of the ring to show how it looked originally. The jeweler at this point was incredibly rude and even asked if the picture was of the same ring. I then explained to him that it was and stated again that this was a one of a kind ring and that it did not look like the picture and also didn\u2019t fit. He then proceeded to tell me that I had not needed to get it resized in the first place and didn\u2019t understand why I had gotten it resized. He also said that he had only done work in the back so anything that was messed up in the front was not his doing. He walked away at this point and his sales rep picked up the conversation asking if we wanted it resized. I said yes and that I would like it fixed to look like the picture. She relunctantly asked me to send the picture to the store email. I was charged more for the resizing than I had been originally and they told me it would take a week to resize it. I should have at this point taken it elsewhere but I wanted to give them a chance to fix their mistake. A week later I got a call in which the jeweler said that he had gotten it \u201cas close as humanly possible to the picture.\u201d He also said that the ring was unstable and that it needed additional structural support insinuating that it was poorly designed. My fianc\u00e9 picked up the ring and much to our disappointment and frustration it looked nothing like the picture. The 4 bands had originally been crossing and now they were parallel to each other. On top of that they removed the 14k gold stamp from the inside of the band. I hope that doesn't mean that they used some other metal when they resized it. I don\u2019t know how he thought that it looked like the picture. I have shown several friends and family members the before pictures and what it looks like now and they all agree that it\u2019s not even close. To make matters worse he added tacks to the ring saughtering the bands together. This was not part of the original design nor had we asked for it and he never called to ask before he modified the ring. The jeweler was again very rude to my fianc\u00e9 when he picked up the ring making comments about how the design was unstable and insinuated the damage to the ring had been some how done by my fianc\u00e9 between leaving the store and giving it back to me 10 minutes later. We believe that our poor treatment was due to our college age and that the piece was from another jeweler. The jeweler who had created our ring had designed most of my family\u2019s engagement rings, had been in business as a family for over 80 years, and was highly respected as a master jeweler for his unique design and pieces. So to anyone who has jewelry designed by another jewler or who is young do not go to this establishment because they are extremely arrogant and have no respect for you or your jewelry.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c3ed9f2d5b:0x2fb4de104c11cb57"}

In this case service was extremely good. The only reason its 4 and not 5 stars is because the clip I wanted wasnt in stock. Although Thomas insisted on ordering it. Fran and Thomas took care of me. This was the first time I went to this pawn shop after calling around Thomas was the only one that was polite on the phone and welcomed me and my husband when we went there. OMG, Fran was the best its nice to see a woman knowledgeable in ammunition. This is truly a team of experts Thomas was really amazing when to came to discussing products and services and extremely patient when I was changing my mind back and forth on my firearm.

The owner changed my battery and then admitted to me that he had broken the watch crystal (clear glass over watch face). He reassured me that he would fix my watch. He is a liar, thief and con-artist. In the almost two months that they were \u201cfixing\u201d my watch I went 3 times to try to get any information. Finally I just gave up and told them to give me my watch broken. The owner was rude, impolite and intimidating.\nWhenever; I informed him that I wanted my watch immediately regardless of the fact that 2 months later it was STILL BROKEN. He said that he had tried to \u201cmake it right\u201d and that he had been looking to buy me another watch from EBAY. The watch I have is a limited edition Android Prism watch that is no longer being made. He said that he had been unable to find any watch similar to mine. While I do not watch a watch from EBAY; I would like to point out that in the last 4 minutes I have found over 5 watches currently for sale on EBAY with the exact same crystal. These are not cheap Wal-Mart watches; he simply did not even try to find a similar watch.\nThe owner stated that since he had been unable to find a similar watch on ebay (lie) that he would have to send the watch out to Las Vegas to have a crystal custom made. If that was the case then why after 2 months was my watch still sitting on the counter? Why had they not already sent it to be fixed?  It does not take 2 months to drive to the post office. It is apparent that they had no plans on trying to fix my watch.\nWhen the watch was originally broken by the owner, it had a tiny chip in the upper right corner. The watch has received even more damage since it has been in their possession. The original chip has spread to 3 times the size along with a new crack on the upper left. The back is covered in DOZENS of scratches and the hands do not seem to be functioning correctly.\nThe owner did not even try to fix my watch. He did not even offer a replacement. Under no circumstances should anyone ever go to these people. Now all I have is a broken piece of crap, and no way to have it fixed or repaired. They broke my watch and refused to fix it.

I have never in my life had someone treat me the way this employee did. If I knew her name I would absolutely call her out. This was at the Trussville location and there were only two employees that I saw. But it was the woman that happen to be available when I came into the store. She was a straight up ass hole. Rolling her eyes when I asked a question as if it was the dumbest thing she had ever heard.  Or as if I was waisting her time. As I told her what I needed to pawn her attitude towards me was hateful from the start the least she could do is be polite and say that they were not interested in what I was trying to pawn at the time. Instead she said she would maybe give me a dollar for it. As she laughed under her breath. That behavior was so uncalled for. And then when I pointed out something on the clearance table that was still marked 60 dollars she stomped her foot and in a aggrevated tone said ok fine let me see it. Now I understand what she was telling me. And I understand why that product that was similar to mine was on the clearance table because it wasn't  selling well. But none the less it was still worth more than a dollar. But she apparently thought I could not comprehend that because of  her childish body gesture's. What she would not take the time to hear was that I had no intention of letting my item be sold in the store. I just needed to pawn it for a little while because life is not easy sometimes but thanks for making my day a little brighter. I wasn't looking for sympathy when I went in, but is it to much to ask for you to just be polite to someone you don't know.   Finally I said to the woman, \" you know what, I haven't done anything to you to deserve such a attitude. I will never be back to this store again.\" And then she had the audacity to reply with, \" good deal you have a great day!\" GOOD DEAL!!!! Are you kidding me. If you hate your job that much then go do something else instead of being a jerk to your customers I really don't think the owner would appreciate that at all. I know if I had worked hard enough to open three different location and had all that going the last thing I would want is people walking through my doors to be treated that way. But I didn't act a fool because I have more class than that I just kept walking and took my business to another pawn shop who did let me pawn my item and gave me way more than a dollar for it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890c6f9f2ccc9d:0x4a0af5af35d1fd24"}

Just recently one of the diamonds in the ring fell out and I told her to use Wilson's to get it fixed because of my previous experience with them. What a mistake... She has been trying to get a simple estimate to submit to the insurance company for two weeks. Each time we call to inquire about it we recieve the same old story... They will leave a message for Rebbeca (who they tell me is the owner) and have her call me back. We have left \"three\" messages and no one has ever returned our call to update us on the situation. This morning I called again to check on the status and asked to talk to the owner or manager. The lady I was talking with immediately got defensive and rude, and asked me where I was calling from... I asked her for her name and she tired to avoid it by asking me my name, even though I had already given it to her.  I'm in the military and have been to a lot of different jewelers, and this is by far the worst service that I have recieved. I was going out of my way to give my business to them, what a mistake.

I had a ring I got for our 2nd Anniversary that had gotten to small.\nSeveral other Jewelers told me it could not be sized. So it sat in a special case hoping one day it would fit. When I spoke to Amanda she said she thought they would be able to size it. Just bring it in and they would see. I found out that the reason my ring didn't fit was because I was sold the wrong size. Amanda sized the ring, sized my finger and checked to make sure none of the stones were missing. She was so polite and professional. I felt so comfortable with them I even gave them my engagement and wedding ring to be cleaned. Amanda did the same thing checked to make sure I wasn't missing stones or had loose stones. I got my rings back today and I am so happy with them. Diamond Depot is definitely where's all my jewelry will go in the future. And I already have my eyes on my next Anniversary present.

Didn\u2019t seem right so I decline and they didn\u2019t charge me for the new battery they gave me. I left with a bag full of watch parts. Later, I realized the gasket was damaged, I was missing parts, and with a battery that doesn\u2019t work. This watch is a standard Tissot, and doesn\u2019t need \u201cspecial\u201d parts to change out batteries. I will send my business elsewhere.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1595683816573, "text": "Hi Joseph.  In the 1000+ Watches we work on yearly, we do occasionally have a watch repair that requires a higher level of service than our on site Watch Repair shop feels comfortable offering. In those instances, we send the watch to our repairman in Texas, whom we have worked with for years, and they will repair and send back to us. The service is excellent and the pricing is very affordable for our customers.\n\nOut of all the watches we have replaced a battery on this year, yours was the only one that we needed to send off for further inspection. The reason was because of a damaged gasket (so it appeared) - but certainly it was beyond our comfort level of repair locally. Rather than continue to work with it locally, we felt the need to move it to a higher tier repairman so that we could offer the best service on your watch. Your response was that you had someone in Georgia who has worked on it before and could put the back on with the gasket, no problem. You seemed as if it was no problem and we assumed that was the case.\n\nIt appears that there your repairman in Georgia saw a similar issue that we did - that there was still a problem.   Our repairmen would have had no issue providing the service that was needed to complete the task but I understand that you didn\u2019t feel comfortable with us taking care of the problem for you further. I\u2019m sorry you felt that way.  We certainly do everything we can to provide a level of service that makes people feel comfortable with allowing us to take care of them from start to finish. I believe, as you can see by the reviews, that we have always done our part to make things right and offer a service that ends with satisfaction.  While you may have felt uneasy about letting us finish the repair for you, I do not believe we have any type of reviews or history that would warrant that feeling from you. Instead, I believe it\u2019s just the opposite - that we have a proven record (shown on reviews) of making sure all of our customers are fully satisfied and we work hard to maintain this level of service.\n\nEither way, we are sorry you were unable to do business with us and see our service through to the end. But we wish you all the best."}, "gmap_id": "0x888bb172c55c3801:0xdc319865b7fa1df6"}

I had a loose diamond that I wanted to incorporate into a unique engagement ring. I work in Atlanta, so I decided to visit a well known jewelry designer in Buckhead. She was very knowledgeable, but had her own idea for the ring, and didn\u2019t seem to listen to what I wanted.  Frustrated and disappointed after our third meeting, I decided to scrap the whole project.\n\nWhen explaining the bad experience to a friend, she mentioned that Terry had recently designed an engagement ring for a relative which turned out beautifully. Since I live in Oxford, I figured I didn\u2019t have anything to lose so I dropped in one day to check it out. During our first meeting, Terry really took the time to listen to me, made notes and offered suggestions when I asked for them.\n\nOver the course of the design process, I completely changed what I wanted, but Terry and Amanda were very patient and encouraging. When I decided that I wanted side stones, they arranged to bring in three sets for me to view with my diamond to find the perfect match.  After I received the original CAD rendering, I realized that there were a few things that I wanted to change. Each suggestion was promptly incorporated into the design and a new CAD rendering sent.\n\nI was able to pick up my finished ring on Christmas Eve, and it was more stunning than I had ever imagined. Even though this was a custom design that involved a lot of personal service, the price for the setting was very reasonable.  I have worked with various jewelers on other projects and I can say without a doubt that Terry and Amanda\u2019s design capabilities and professionalism are the best I\u2019ve experienced. Thank you guys for a beautiful, one-of-a-kind ring!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1592333188435, "text": "Michelle thank you!  I hope you're enjoying that beautiful ring!

I took it, along with the wedding bands she & dad wore, and her \"lucky\" ring. (The \"lucky ring\" was found on a trip to PCB some 25-30yrs ago.

Much closer than Atlanta or Birmingham.  Amanda our diamond consultant was INCREDIBLE!!!   She has an awesome personality and was so patient with listening to our needs and wants.   Amanda\u2019s knowledge was also helpful.  We ended up special ordering my ring and could not be happier. Just WOW! LOVE IT!  The Oweners were there as well and adds the nice family atmosphere.   I think it is important to support small local businesses, but We got to do this and get the best service and quality we were looking for.  Their prices and customer service are not beatable.
