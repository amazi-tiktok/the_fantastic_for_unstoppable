The worst place in Oxford is on the south side of Hwy 78 East. The BEST place is A&B and they are located on the north side of 78 just east of Hutch Touch. I'm in retail sales in the trailer industry myself and A & B Trailers is my go to source for information, parts, and trailers. If  I have a question about ANYTHING in regards to dragging a wagon... A&B Trailers.. Knowledge level? I'll put it this way; theres not anything they can't  cover on your trailer.  I promise, they will never lead you wrong. These guys are not pencil pushers that have sit behind a desk all of their lives. They are blue collar, hard working, hands on, highly experienced fabricators and they know their stuff. If you want to spend half of your retirement on junk just to have it fall apart in a few months, then go across the street and shop with Ward. Now if you want an extremely well built, solid piece of equipment at a reasonable price  from an excellent company that stands behind their product AND appreciates their customers?... Welcome home family!! You are in the right place. A&B Trailers. You won't find better people anywhere and let me just add this in there.... these cats are Perfectionists. I know. I have worked side by side with them in a fab shop and I am a perfectionist also, but these jokers....well they take it to a whole nother other level. I will take an oath to say, \"They do things at A&B with a whole bunch of heart and a truck load of pride. It's done once, done right, and that's the product they will provide you every single time. I highly recommend A&B Trailers for all of your parts, accessories,  tires, wheels, batteries, or even if you are looking to upgrade with a brand new piece of pride attached to your vehicle.. Come on down to A&B. I'm sure glad I stopped here. Received a solid product and made two friends for life. Where else can you get service like that? A&B Trailers. Ask for Andy or Barney.

Company & trailers. First of all the 16ft dump trailer I purchased was so poorly made that the decals were put on crooked, paint was sprayed spotty on & runs everywhere. I drove 3 hours to pick it up & it wasn't as described when I arrived. That was the dealers fault, but the trailer was built so bad it should have never been sent out for sale. The back doors would never shut all the way, it would not lift over 3.8 tons to be exact, the cylinders were welded on crooked so when you lifted it up the popped very loud from being out of alignment & then the frame broke where the dump bed pivots. all this within 5 loads hauled. Called the dealer & that was a no go. Called the factory several times & pretty much was told that they hired some unskilled contractors to build the trailers at one time & mine was one of them. I then ask Justin the manager what do I need to do because I have to have it to work we agreed that I would take my loss & Stryker would put in 1000.00 towards a new trailer that was safe & road worthy so I could get back to work. Even though that puts me thousands out of pocket to get back to work I was in agreement with Justin just so I could get back to work. I bought a brand new trailer, a MaxXd which is the real deal & now Stryker will not talk to me, help me or anything. I was able to talk to one guy on the phone since Justin & I made the deal & I was told that I was out of luck. Great way to handle business. I told Justin I wouldn't put a review as long as he stuck to his end of the deal, he didn't. Probably the worst company I've done business with. You would think if a company that sells trailers that are designed to go up & down the highway would make sure that they were safe, not say we had unqualified people building them.

You can get a much better built trailer for the same money. Trailer brakes and lights started working periodically. It\u2019s to far for me to take back for warranty so local trailer service place fixed for me.  They said they ran the trailer wiring with absolutely no slack in the wiring. When the trailer started flexing the connections to the brakes pulled apart. The welds on the ramps broke within a month of use. The tube that the ramps hinge on has warped and the ramps sit at an angle. The cross members are 2\u201d angle,  24\u201d on center instead of \u201cC\u201d channel . I got a quote for $600 to remove the deck and use \u201cc\u201d channel every 16\u201d on center and then screw the deck down. They didn\u2019t even screw the deck boards down, so they slide around. The paint rubs off if anything touches it. There are a lot of sharp edges that I had to knock down because it was just dangerous to walk around. Apparently the trailer that I saw and thought I was buying was \u201cupgraded\u201d and I didn\u2019t request that. I took it for DOT inspection and i had to spend $150 to have side marker lights installed on it. They didn\u2019t even build the trailer to dot specs. At the point that they finally got the trailer to me 2-3 weeks after I was told it would be there, I needed the trailer to work that day so I just signed the papers and took off.
