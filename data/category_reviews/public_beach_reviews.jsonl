I'm writing this because I wish that accurate, factual information about this condo had been available to me before we paid $1,000 per day for our week-long vacation over the July 4th holiday.\nMy wife handled the arrangements, but there was really no way for her to have known the truth about this place.  The first warning sign came early on when she was about to book the unit through VRBO, and the owners asked her to book our stay directly with them instead - cutting VRBO out of their deal might save a few dollars for the owner but it demonstrates a dishonest attitude and willingness to cut corners that were reflected in the owner's misleading description of the unit which caused us to rent a unit that we would never have considered if the true facts had been provided.\nConsider these few examples showing how the owners presented Beach Music 2 to prospective renters, and the true facts about the unit:\n1). Nothing in the description or the photos reveals that this condo is essentially a vertical floorplan with three levels connected by steep, narrow stairs.  In an apparent attempt to mislead, while the owners have posted multiple photos of the interior none of these photos show the stairs.  In fact, a commentor (who may or may not have been an actual renter) declared that this unit was \"handicap accessible\" and the owners of Beach Music 2 replied to the comment thanking the writer - the owners did not correct the incorrect statement that the condo was handicap accessible even though it is anything but.  Some of my wife's family members who were planning on joining us halfway into our stay had to cancel their plans because they wouldn't have been able to go up or down the stairs.\n(By the way, speaking about the stairs you should know that several of the balusters (the smaller dowels connecting the stair rail to the floor) were so loose they came out when touched - one more feature that made these stairs unsafe.  The same problem exists with these posts in the railings around the elevated decks and balconies.  If you have small children you should not consider staying at Beach Music 2 unless you can be by their side at all times for their safety.\n2)  The condo is presented as \"pristine\" but in fact, the unit was dirty (alcohol/beer containers under the couch along with a dirty sock) and the furnishings were the worst I've ever experienced including those in the cheapest places like I used to rent when I was a poor college student - one sofa had broken springs that left you sitting just inches from the floor; another sofa had a hide-a-bed that was stuck partially out so that the seat cushions were at an angle that caused one to slide towards the floor.  The bed in one room appeared to actually be a fold-out sofa masquerading as a bed - the mattress was thin, and the sleeping surface was only about a foot from the floor.\nMy personal favorite was the master bedroom, which featured a glass-encased mini-blind set hung over the door glass.  The first time we opened this door, the mini-blind glass set came sliding down to the balcony 6 inches below.  To close the door, I had to slide up this heavy frame until it cleared the doorframe.  I reported this problem to the staff.  Near the end of our stay, we came in from playing on the beach to discover that the door had swung open and the entire glass frame had fallen onto the balcony, smashing into a thousand tiny sharp shards of glass.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a042380a3e337:0x34404acd8d52330d"}
