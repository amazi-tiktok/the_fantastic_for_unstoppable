He then proceeded to tell my wife that our system was outdated and needed to be updated. He offered to update it for a $100 fee. My wife told him she would have to speak with me first before we agreed to anything resulting in a charge. Jonathon then asked my wife how long had we had our system. She told him three years in our current home and approximately seven years in our previous house (total of approximately ten years with ADT.)  He then said he'd go ahead and update our system for no charge, which he did. What was that about??  Offer to update the system for $100?  Would that be considered fleecing a client? And if he was going to update the system for $100, does he pocket the amount, since he updated the system anyway. Kind of \"sketch\" as the kids say these days.  I have not been impressed with ADT monitoring services in the past, and only continued service with them after the 2 year contract (at which time they were going to increase my monitoring price $10/month.)

I've been out of pocket for weeks trying to handle mom's business, grieve, and still live so I haven't had a chance to reschedule. ADT proceeded to still charge me two months of service at my old location even though they knew I had cancelled the service at my old house. When I caught it, the call center manager told me that they still bill you 30 days after you cancel. I asked about the other month and she said \"oh we prorated that and took it out of your installation fee.\" So I prepaid $100 for an install that I didn't get. And they took money out of my installation fee for two more months before I caught it. All this while they say sorry for your loss but...at least we gave you back the second month.
