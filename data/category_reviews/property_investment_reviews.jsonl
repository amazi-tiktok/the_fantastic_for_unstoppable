I have been renting with them for around 14 months now. If you qualify and meet their standards they are wonderful to work with. If you are paying your rent in full and on time, they will go above and beyond to meet your needs. However, if there is an unexpected life turn, even notifying them will not help. I was laid off at work and could no longer afford the rent. Even their qualifications say that you must make 3x the rent in a months time. I now make less than 2x the rent. I notified them of my life changes thinking that was right thing to do, but as I had forgotten, just remember they have a contract in place and that is what they will go by like any other business. They are still a great company despite my disagreements and misunderstandings on some of their business practices, but if are going into renting with them knowing there is even a possibility of financial changes in your life, I would not recommend them.\n\nAdding in response to owners reply. They did offer me release option, but ultimately that is continuing to pay the rent in full as usual until it is released, sold, or until end of your lease (which ever comes first). This is extremely risky option for someone who cannot afford the rent in the first place. Can\u2019t afford their rent, but they want you to pay two rents while waiting for them to find another person to lease. Great idea guys. Even when I offered to pay 3 months rent, plus them keeping deposit to end lease ( 6400 total).  They claim they can get it leased in a month or two (3200 total) so why not take the 6400 total and let me go? Hmmm, wonder if it\u2019s because they cannot/ or don\u2019t try to immediately lease it out??? Just a thought. You have to move out before they will begin to show, again paying two rents. Not a great option when I cannot afford their rent, so no that\u2019s not helpful as he claims. Not sure how that helps me at all as they are \u201chelping me out of a bad situation\u201d. And I have signed and returned the release option papers, so I am unaware of what that is about. I even got confirmation emails they were received, which I am happy to provide to anyone showing the dates of his post vs the dates of the emails. Also, I highly doubt I am the only person that has gotten frustrated from being in a financially binding situation, so not sure how that deems me the most difficult with this type situation. Again, great company, until you are in a financial situation where you cannot make rent.\n\nUpdate on this (today 7/30/19), as if the owner below saying I did not sign and return the forms in June wasn\u2019t enough, just got a call saying they did not have the forms (supposedly) and could not process anything. I told them I had email confirmation that all forms were received and would be glad to forward that over. Was told that worker was on maternity leave and they could not access email to get the forms. Not sure how that\u2019s my problem??? But sure, I\u2019ll redo everything again since you cannot properly arrange cover while employees are out on leave. \ud83d\ude04", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1561389386223, "text": "Cindy,\nThank you for clarifying the fact that we hold renters to the agreement that they signed.

We weren't sure - the door frame just splintered one day when opening, leaving the lock virtually useless. (The door was not in particularly good shape when we moved in.) We didn't file a police report as there was no evidence that a break in had actually occurred. When Rudulph repaired it and didn't charge us, we thought there was no issue, since nowhere in our lease did it indicate a police report would be necessary. We were a little shocked when we moved out several months later and over $400 was deducted from our deposit specifically for the repair of the door - without prior notification by the property manager of the cost of the repair, which only included a new deadbolt and a patch fix to the door and frame. Upon speaking with Mr. Rudulph, this was how they recouped their investment in the door repair.

After reviewing your concerns, we have determined that there have been no violations of your privacy outside of the lease terms you agreed to adhere by. After you reported the leak on Sunday, May 27, during the Memorial Day weekend, the leak was assigned to a third-party contractor for completion. Regrettably, the shower drain requires a special tool to repair and the contractor did not have such tool available at the time they were on the property on May 27 (the same day you reported the leak). Based on the documented emails and telephone calls between you, your husband (Mr. Forbes) and our office, we attempted to reschedule the shower leak repair multiple times during a time when you or your husband would be present. Unfortunately, due to several miscommunications by the parties involved, this leak was elevated to an emergency status that would allow access to be granted without your presence and/or permission as per the terms of your lease. We entered your premises on June 8, less than two weeks after you reported the leak, to complete the repair by the contractor while being supervised by one of our employees. After we entered your premises, several lease violations were then noted - including the presence of multiple breeds of pets that previously were not disclosed by you or your husband.  We understand your concern about our respect for our residents and their rights; however, the owners of the property also have a responsibility and rights to protect their property (and your home). After an extended period of time not being able to schedule a time when all parties could be present, the owner\u2019s rights to protect the property from continued damage from the leak were enforced - which triggered other property rights issues that we are attempting to work with you for you to bring into compliance with the terms of our lease.

I am sorry to hear that you experienced these issues. Your lease began on April 1st. On April 6th you contacted us with complaints about the smell of mold and the condition of the water heater. We considered this to be an emergency case and immediately contacted the homeowner. A vendor was approved to visit the property. Upon inspection the tech found no odor that would be related to organic matter. The home was in need of a good cleaning but there were no visible signs of organic matter as well. The water heater was unable to be checked due to no power being on in the home, the tech did check for leaks and found none in its current state. Other issues throughout the home were noted and included in an estimate, the owner approved for all repairs to be made at your earliest convenience. You refused to schedule with the vendor and requested to terminate the lease. The owner approved your request on April 15th, we are currently in the process of closing your account. If you have any questions please contact our office at 844-793-4948, we will be happy to assist."}, "gmap_id": "0x88891985f1bfc583:0xaa6f2e53245f2f24"}

The guys who do their maintenance seem very nice.  They've surely never been rude or disrespectful.  I've had a couple of situations where they came to fix something and didn't have all of the parts the needed, so they had to leave and come back- once even hey had to order a part and it didn't come until the next day, but they seem to be qualified and have always made repairs that meet my standards.   I've surely never been made to feel as if they don't care about me or my issues.  I see them at least once per month to pay rents.

The checklist we completed upon move in said the kitchen was filthy and hadn\u2019t been cleaned, the walls needed paint, noted the broken electrical outlets and the nails/holes left from the previous tenant. We had to SCRUB this place. Not to mention all the spiders we dealt with for a month because you hadn\u2019t been taking care of pest control. We would have noted the uncontrollable bamboo, but it was February and it wasn\u2019t growing in the cold months. How can you even begin to think we caused a bamboo problem? The owner himself said he had tried to get rid of it \u201cfor years\u201d. Exact words. Once again he himself saw the yard mowed before we moved out. When I went to check the yard on 5/13, it had not been TOUCHED since we left. All you do is blame your negligence on other people. From the yard to the unmanaged interior.\n\nThe water infiltration issue in the BEDROOM FLOOR was not due to \u201cmassive flooding\u201d. EVERY TIME IT RAINED, water came through the flooring. And EVERY TIME it happened, you were notified and offered zero assistance in fixing the issue. This is not something that happened just once. I will be sure to find the business card from the man who came out from community development and assured me that if I called him the next time there was visible water coming through that he could see with his own eyes that they would condemn the house until the issue was fixed. I also have two other witnesses who were at the house for that conversation. We told them not to worry about it because we were getting out of the house to which he said \u201cI don\u2019t blame you, I\u2019d hire an attorney\u201d. He also said that a mold expert would need to come out to test the MOLD AND MUSHROOMS. Even your maintenance man left the house to get himself a mask so that he wouldn\u2019t be breathing in the mold when you sent him to the house after LYING saying that YOU would send a mold expert out. This is all documented. Every single bit of it. You \u201callowed\u201d us to move out because you knew you were caught. Anyone with common sense will be able to see that. You said yourself \u201cthe mold will dry out. It\u2019s about to be warm outside\u201d.\n\nYou can try to justify it all you want, but mushrooms growing in a bedroom is not normal. I was sick for a solid week after stirring it up while moving.\n\nNot fixing a water infiltration issue that you\u2019ve known about for who knows how long? Negligent, irresponsible.\n\nBottom line- I\u2019m not here to argue with you as it clearly gets us nowhere. That\u2019s what attorneys are for. I can back up everything I\u2019ve stated, unlike you. I\u2019m here to warn other people of the sorry excuse of a landlord you are.\n\nAgain people, trust the negative reviews.

This house is in Albertville, an hour and a half away from our office, way too far to be a desirable listing. You begged us to manage this house with your tenants already installed, because you felt all the local people were criminal and corrupt. Against our better judgement we decided to help you out. You didn't want us to send you any rent money while tenant was there, hoping they would buy house and use those funds to help with their closing costs. Your tenants were dead beats, stopped paying rent and were promptly removed. They left the house in terrible shape, with rotting food in fridge, human waste in toilet, old rusting and broken down appliances, a severe cockroach infestation and a property resembling a land-fill with all the construction debris and trash strewn about evenly over an acre of land. The utility bill was attached to their final account with the back rent and other expenses. Their account was referred to collections when they refused to pay what was owed. When they were gone, you wanted us to list this property for sale. We reluctantly agreed to help you here as well. With your permission, we used the meager available funds as best we could to clean property and house for selling. This involved 2 guys over 3 days and 8 round trips with a 30 foot trailer filled with garbage hauled from the property. The house had to be seriously detrashed, scrubbed down and treated for cockroaches. We did the absolute best we would with what funds were available, spending more in fact than what was available in order to clean up completely. But, we were still about $10,000 short of what was needed to get the home ready for habitability, much less marketability and you refused to spend anything more. We 1099 for all the income received and also sent an end of the year statement which itemized all the expenses, leaving you with net income of $0 for tax purposes."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626b541142b879:0xeeab7a8b31596fa"}

I\u2019m here for this review to warn the next renter of the nightmare that is Darin Bashaw, and how poorly this property has been maintained. First and foremost, false advertisement. This is not a 3 bedroom home. It\u2019s a 2 bedroom (one of which is COVERED in mold) and has a sunroom that directs you to the back yard (that is an uncontrollable BAMBOO FOREST). It is NOT a clean home, but rather the complete opposite. This house is NASTY. When we moved out after only 2.5 months, there were MUSHROOMS growing in the bedroom and bathroom. Absolutely NOTHING was done about a water infiltration issue that we reported to Darin 3 weeks after move-in, which resulted in us having to send an official letter to move out without penalty. As if that weren\u2019t enough, we weren\u2019t informed of the uncontrollable bamboo growing in the yard. When we moved out, the yard was mowed, yet Darin stole $120 of my deposit that he was supposed to return \u201cdue to neglect of the yard\u201d THAT HE HADNT EVEN MOWED WHEN HE STOLE MY MONEY. He let that yard grow for TWO SOLID WEEKS after we moved out. The OWNER OF THE HOUSE saw it mowed with his own eyes when he came to check on his house after the CITY came and wrote them up for all kinds of things that needed to be fixed but weren\u2019t. This includes electrical outlets, DRY ROTTED WOOD, poorly sealed doors, the shed out back, and who knows what else. They have not had time to tackle the mold issue since we moved out. I know this because I was there last week 5/13 to get my mail and check out the yard. They hadn\u2019t even cleaned. I know this because the overflowed trash was still sitting in the carport and hadn\u2019t even been taken to the road for pick up. This was such a terrible experience that we now have a lawyer so that we no longer have to deal with this man. I have pictures and videos of this entire experience, which include Darin cussing my husband and being completely irate when we returned the keys. All I can say is TRUST THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. This man ROBBED me of my deposit and three months worth of rent and let my family move into a MOLD INFESTED HOME. He is a crook and a PITIFUL excuse for a professional. I\u2019m embarrassed for the company he works for.

You were responsible for the yard. Because you didn't maintain the bamboo is now out of control.

Went to view the house on Monday, Dec 3.  On Dec 4 I emailed that we were prepared to pay the deposit for the house and was told \"I can probably get it finished up for you to sign the lease on Friday.\"  Come Friday we heard nothing about whether the house was ready so text the property manager for an update who replies \"The lease was ready in the office today. You weren't able to make it?\"  Well, no, no one said it was ready.  We meet at their office Saturday to sign the lease, get keys, and of course hand over money...then we go to the house.  Not cleaned.  Text the mgr to let him know it's not clean and he replies \"The carpet and linoleum are brand new, so you should be able to move your furniture into the house. I will see if I can get someone back, though it has been cleaned and may not get any cleaner looking.\"  No, this isn't cosmetic, this is filthy and lazy. That evening I email several pics of the house and receive no reply.  Three days later still no reply so I call him.  I say hello and who I am, to which he replies \"yeah?\".  I say I'm calling for an update on the house being cleaned.  He says it is clean, just not to MY standards.  He says the carpet and linoleum are new, to which I reply that doesn't mean the house is clean.  I asked him about the pic I sent of the AC return vent.  His reply was that there's a filter.  Oh, so the filth caked up on the outside is ok because there's a filter.  I ask about the storm shelter.  He says they cleared it out.  Well, my pics show otherwise.  I ask about the closet with trash on the shelf and animal hair all over the floor, how a broom has never touched the floors and that I don't want to put my groceries on the filthy pantry shelves.  He replies that he has been doing this a long time, that any other person would've moved in already, how much they have already spent getting the property ready, and that I obviously require extra care so he'll send someone back out tomorrow.  After being insulted I suggested that maybe this isn't the right thing for us and what can we do.  He said we've already signed the lease so nothing.  I asked if this is what we should expect over the course of our lease and he replied that it's up to us, not him, said have a nice day and hung up on me.\n\n**And in response to the records indicating the move in is next weekend and you \"agreed\" to early move in...that is simply incorrect.  Your records may show that as an estimated date but then why would I be told on Dec 4 that the house could probably be finished up by Friday (Dec 7)?  Doesn't make sense. If the house simply wasn't going to be ready then I would've preferred that answer over being stressed that it really wasn't yet.

She moved into an apartment we had been managing for exactly one day. The first time I looked at unit was when I showed to her, it wasn't ready by our standards to move into, but she had a moving truck full and wanted it immediately. We honored her request and conducted the screening and had new lease prepared the same day, letting her move in to the apartment in existing condition. She complained immediately about a leaking sink drain in kitchen. The property manager himself fixed that sink within an hour. She had a couple of other minor complaints and was instructed to properly submit service requests through the tenant portal, so maintenance can can get on them most efficiently. To date, she has never submitted a service request appropriately. She was quiet until July 18, when she just came back from a trip and said the fridge went out and all her food was spoiled. I was going to send someone to take a look, but she also said it was working again. Next, she started texting the property manager after hours on Friday July 20th, and then angry texting on Saturday the 21st at around bedtime. She was informed that nothing can be done over the weekend and maintenance would check first thing on Monday. Maintenance did go out on Monday and determined the fridge needed to be replace, she also mentioned the water heater didn't work. Water heater was discovered to have a leak at electrical control panel, causing it to short which is something we considered an emergency, and water heater was replaced the same day that Monday. We have contractual obligation to address any non-emergency issues over $300 with owner prior to spending their money. Sometimes it may take a few days to get in touch with the owner for directions, which will delay our repair response time. This owner approved for a new fridge on Tuesday and one was ordered immediately. We also have a fiduciary responsibility to  owners and have found the most expedient and affordable way to get new appliances is to order online, where we can shop the best deals and take advantage of free delivery and hauling of old appliances. When we do order, we always order something in stock for next or 2 day delivery. In this case, for whatever reason, Lowe's needed a couple of extra days but still, a new refrigerator was delivered by the end of the week. We also have a legal responsibility to tenants to address any health and safety issues within a 2 week time frame.
