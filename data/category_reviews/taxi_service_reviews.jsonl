We were in contact with the driver and everything.

To add on, they then informed us that our driver now wouldn\u2019t be here until 11:30-11:45. This is poor customer service and they practically blamed us for the miscommunication and their faults in this process. We are just lucky we aren\u2019t supposed to be heading to the airport!

I am local in Chattanooga, so I know when I am being taken the long way, but it doesn't matter to these crooks.  I park exactly 2.2 miles from the airport on Shallowford Rd when I fly out .  I got a cab from the airport one evening , told the driver where we were going, and he acted like he didn't know where that was (he did), and as I was giving him directions, he intentionally took a wrong turn down 153, and then down I75N despite me asking repeatedly to turn around on Lee Hwy, and then got on Shallowford at Hamilton place, and drove all of the way back on Shallowford, all the while trying to act like he didn't understand what we were telling him.  Even when we were telling him to turn left or right, and would point and say, \"turn left here?\" and turn right at the same time.  He was 100% American, and English was his only language, he was just that shady.  The second time was two nights ago, three of us loaded our stuff into a cab, and when the driver found out where we were going, he said, \"it's $5 per person, which is $5, $5, and another $10.  It's $20.\"  I said, \"There are three of us, we are going two miles down a main highway with no traffic, and how does $5 times three make $20?\".  He was kind enough to say, \"It's $20, or you can get your stuff out\".  We took Uber instead, and always will from now on.

If you are a professional company and need to order transportation for your client, DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! I would have used Uber, but they did not go out as far as I needed. We had an emergency and needed to provide our client with transportation immediately. I lined everything up with their dispatch, including payment. I was assured that a driver was dispatched out and our client would be at our office at the requested time. Then, no one showed to pick our client up. the driver claimed that he had tried to call our office multiple times, but we had no evidence of a call from him. Further, everything was lined up, so I just don't understand why you didn't just go pick the client up like we had agreed. I will NEVER recommend this company to anyone.
