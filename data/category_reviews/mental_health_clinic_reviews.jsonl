I had to go there because a doctor who I saw put me on a very strong medication for anxiety and I had severe side effects and had to get off of it. I remember the staff there looked at me and told me the day before I was going home that every kid comes back at least 2 times, and that I'd be back in no time. My mom was told lies by the staff, I was mistreated, yelled at, and even punished for throwing up in the floor by accident. I was in the 3rd grade and the reason I threw up was because I was so stressed and traumatized by the things that were happening it literally drove me to become sick!! One day when I was supposed to get a visit with my mom, my mom drove and was waiting to see me and they told me I couldn't see her that she didn't come , and told her that I had done something and my privileges of a visit were revoked. I was crying in my sleep every single night and the staff claimed they came in my room and calmed me down , they told my mom that, but they never did that, they did the complete opposite, they'd open the door and told me to hush up and would slam it behind them. I remember the first day I was told my one of the staff members that you could put your shoe in the door when you were in your room so it wasn't shut all the way if you didn't like having the door shut, and every kid had done the same thing, well I heard one of the staff members telling a man that \"we got a new one\" he came in there poked his head in the door and yelled \"your door has to be shut\" and slammed it, and then walked off laughing. I barely remember what he looked like but he was tall as I remember, had a beard and I'm pretty sure had reddish hair. That place was horrible and no parent should ever take their kid there, my mother didn't know any of that would've happened and she said if she knew she would've have never taken me there. She was in shock and extremely upset after she found out everything that had happened. I was a little kid, only in the 3rd grade. Now I am 17, soon to be graduating and I'm becoming a police officer. My life is looking way up, and maybe when I become an officer I can get people like those who worked there , that abuse and mistreat PATIENTS like that, away from children. People like that do NOT need to work with children. This place does NOT help people, it messes them up even worse. I would not even take my dog there. The people who work there with people who are admitted should be ashamed of themselves and how they treat kids and patients. I've read all of these reviews and there's not even one good one here. People who treat kids that way should never be allowed around a child. EVER. That place needs to close down.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889106da33b0f29:0xbe116454db9fb0e1"}

I waited almost 3 hours checking in on and off trying to figure out what was taking so long.  I was finally told by the secretary that they FORGOT I was waiting (for 3 hours). Now this child is still there because they FORGOT I was there for 3 hours. Called me when I got home an hour and a half later (total of 5 hours) to say she was ready.....PLEASE GET YOUR CHILD SAFELY OUT OF THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS. I am heartbroken for this young lady in the hands of people that can FORGET she has a home after around 12 plus years of not having one. This is a shame. AND they will NOT admit to their wrongdoings.

I\u2019d rather go to prison for a year then stay 6 months in this place. I was on the adolescent unit for 10 days. I saw the worst of the worst. A kid that just got there said \u201cI want to go home\u201d and what they did was get 3 men to hold this kid down and a nurse come over and give him 2 shots in the butt right in front of everyone. And that happened at least 3 more times. Then I got a switched to another room and while I was there laying on my bed at rest period my room mate told one of the techs that I said a girl had a nice butt and that she was \u201cfine\u201d which never even happened and I got in trouble for it. And one day there was this really small and skinny kid he was like 13 or 14 he said something along the lines of \u201cI want to go home this place sucks\u201d and they asked him what he said and then he said it again and then they got 2 220lbs+ guys and a nurse to restrain him by sitting on him and giving him a shot that really messed him up he couldn\u2019t walk and barely could talk and was drooling everywhere and the tech asked him to get up and he barely even responded and so what they did was push down his arms on the edge of a rubber sofa type thing and and one of guys pushes his arm down with so much force it snapped this kids arm with *pop* sound and they didn\u2019t take this kid to the hospital till the next day. Another thing that happened was I had a major panic attack and all the staff did was sit and laugh at me. Another thing that happened was a kid just started punching another kid randomly in the face when he didn\u2019t even do anything and they gave both of them shots when the one guy did absolutely nothing at all. And one of the girls a day later was just sitting in the hall scratching her arm till it was bleeding everywhere and all they did was say \u201cquit\u201d and walked off even tho she kept doing it. And when my doctor prescribed me medicine they didn\u2019t even taper down which mad my jaw lock up and I couldn\u2019t talk for like 18 hours. But there was some things that were ok Dr. con was nice Mr. Scott was good and Mr rahshi I think his name was.

She said she would call me back after I told her to go ahead and cancel my appointment. Never received a call.

I will take the high road and not post names. But let me say for a first visit/interaction I found the office/clerical staff to be extremely unprofessional, I'll informed and overall combative. I should have followed my first instinct and just leave. But morbid curiosity set in and I actually wanted to see how Bad it would really get ( I had really left the afternoon open, so I at this point had no time restraints) I had no idea that by the time I did leave I would have become resentful of the 2 hours of my life that I could never reclaim.\nOnce the train left the station I found it to become more like a hidden camera reality show. Especially, when the only really delightful individual I encountered was unable to master the skill of getting my vitals. So much that out of the sheer awkwardness, I finally asked if she would like for me to \"just provide\" my usual blood pressure syst. /dia. data. To which she said please and thank you. She then documented the numbers I gave her and she just guessed what my heart bpm would be. Now let me inject here that I am 52 and have not partook in recreational pharmaceuticals in many many decades. Therefore, I found it oddly expected when this same sweet young lady proceeded to pop on latex gloves and shake the urine specimen I provided right there in the same lobby in view of all other patients (were there to be ANY OTHER PATIENTS).\nSo I can't say I was completely broadsided when the absurdity of a false positive for wait for it .... Methadone for heven sake. I had to search Google to get a clear understanding of what exactly it was.\nBy this point now the humor is subsiding and I asked what could cause \"clearly a false positive\" and to that I was given in what struck me as an Asperger's demeanor, Methadone would cause a Methadone reading. Now you can see why I was growing impatient with the entire experience. And I am completely for time sake, leaving out many other \"remarkable\" events. Needless to say  I left shortly after that vulgar abuse. Awkward totally and completely toe curling Awkwardness. Oh thank you Google, I saw on the very first answer to my search criteria of WHAT CAUSES FALSE POSITIVE RESULTS FOR METHADONE,IN A GUY WHOM HAS NO REMOTE POSSIBILITY OF INGESTION OF IT. And guess what sports fans, 100 to 200 mgs. Of your basic run of the mill dyphenhydramine\nIe: Benadryl will cause a false positive for you guessed it Methadone.\nNow do I have any concerns about the longevity of the Cullman office? Absolutely not. I can guarantee the end result of it. But the frustration of being in a situation in which a \"health care provider\" is not only giving me utterly impossible, inaccurate and offensive information regarding MY physical/chemical make up, well that is not just concerning, but irrehensible. I'm not certain how I choose to proceed, but I feel obligated to do something. In case you have forgotten by this point, they represent themselves to be providing Mental Health Care. Fortunately, I only needed a local provider for your basic low dose antidepressant and the same meds I have taken on and off my entire life for ADD. But can you even begin to imagine someone with a true need/requirement for accurate, mental health care. I intend to start with BCBS and file a suit with HIPPA. I sincerely will appreciate any and all suggestions or recommendations.\nThanks for anyone's time that may read this lengthy review. However, I have posted a similar review on the actual company website only to have it I'mmediately hidden as well as my own personal social media posts were trolled and somehow hidden. I'm not certain how that's even a thing. But obviously they do not want this information to be in public forum. Hopefully, Google reviews can protect it in only long enough for 1 person to view.

I have been going to the Psychiatry South for about a year. I have had countless issues. My last appointment was my breaking point. I received a message on the patient portal right before my appointment time stating that my doctor was no longer seeing patients for the type of appointment I would need. I already requested time off of work for this appointment. The office said they would call in my prescription (which is a 3 month prescription) and get back to me about scheduling with another doctor. A month goes by I still haven\u2019t heard from the office and I go to pick up my prescription and the pharmacy doesn\u2019t have anything for me. They did call in the prescription but only for one months worth instead of 3 months. I called the office and they forward me to the nurses line which they NEVER answer.I left a voicemail then I called back later in the day to see what I should do about my prescription because I am completely out. The receptionist was extremely rude and I felt like I was being rushed off the phone. By the end of the call I attempted to ask if they could please get back to me at the end of the day to tell me what I should do (considering I had already been waiting for a month to hear back from them)Before I could even try to complete that sentence I was hung up on. I called back another lady answered who was helpful and kind but said they couldn\u2019t get me in for another 3 weeks. ***That\u2019s 3 weeks without the medication that I have been taking everyday since I was a child.** she did say shes going to try to get my medicine called in to get me by for those 3 weeks. Unfortunately I did not hear anything back. On top of that they no longer take my insurance which was brought to my attention today so I explained to them I would pay full price until I could find another doctor I am in network with just to get me by. Had they of told me a month ago they would no longer have a doctor in network with my insurance I could have planned and had time to find another office that accepts my insurance instead of being in this situation and risking my mental health.\n\nBilling is a nightmare, in the past they have charged me for missed appointments when the office had changed my appointment and failed to call and let me know. Because of previous issues I started saving all of my emails and voicemails to prove my original appointment times. It took months to get them to\ntake the missed appointment fee off of my account.\n\nLastly a couple months ago I called the office to schedule an appointment. The receptionist asked me who my doctor was. I had recently switched to a new doctor because my previous one left the office. I told the receptionist I couldn\u2019t remember, the line went silent. I then remembered the doctors first name because I thought that might help. The receptionist (I\u2019m not exaggerating) yelled at me and called me SO disrespectful for addressing a doctor by their first name. I was in absolute shock that they would yell at a patient and call them disrespectful instead of simply looking up my name in the computer and seeing who I had seen my last couple appointments. After numerous issues with the office I tried to speak with the office manager. it was voicemail every time I called. She did finally reach out after I had left multiple voicemails. When she called I was unfortunately at work. I do not carry my cellphone on me during work hours. I called her back, left another voicemail and explained to her my work hours 6:30-4 and asked if there was anyway she could call after 4 or tell me a good time to call her and I could step in the back at work to take the call. I didn\u2019t think that would be a problem considering the offices closes at 5. After countless times of trying to get ahold of her I gave up.\n\nThis is the first negative review I have ever left for any office I have been to.

I gave information to my provider the first time--the  504 office didn't receive it. The second time, I literally hand-delivered the documents to the office with a note describing the urgency of my situation. Finally, the 504 office had to contact my provider on my behalf to get the needed information. I have multiple health issues that require vigilance on my behalf to manage. The 504 office could not act on any of my disabilities until all documentation was in place. Because of this, I was unable to do what was required for the program.

In a matter of a few months, we had a perfect treatment plan in place. For some reason, though, they later became completely incapable of communicating. You have to harass them with messages for weeks just to get a response. In December, I turned 26 and lost my insurance. Dr. Austin assured me that this wouldn't stop me from getting what I needed. Every time I needed refills, it would take weeks of calls and me cutting my meds in half to make them last before she finally called them in, and after 4 months of that, she stopped calling them in at all and I was sent a letter saying that they were dropping me. I am still uninsured and cannot see a new doctor. Once I stopped being a walking dollar sign, my health and safety no longer mattered. I am deeply regretting recommending them to people as they've had equally terrible experiences, and I'm horrified at this lack of humanity. Shame on you.\nUpdates: the nurse finally called me after I escalated it to a couple angry voicemails. She told me that she would call in one last prescription as I don't have health insurance and cannot get a new doctor right now. She explained I'd have a 6month supply of all 3 of my meds. That was a lie, she called in 1 month of 1 of them, forcing me to stop taking the others suddenly.\nToday I discovered that one of the drugs\nI'm on interacts terribly with birth control, rendering both ineffective and causing seizures.

I have been waiting for a response for over a week now on prior approval for my medication due to a new insurance carrier.  My pharmacy has faxed over the information 4 different times now along with calling and leaving messages with no response.  I myself have called multiple times and left messages for Kelly, the clinical specialist, and also with reception.  I have received one phone call back from reception who just sent me back through to Kelly who of course did not pick up the phone.\nI am currently trying to reach them as well through sheer persistence.  My phone call has been answered once and as I was explaining my issue, I was cut off midsentence.  I then asked if I needed to just speak with Dr. Anderson directly.  This was apparently too much information for this poor girl's brain to process as she then became confused as to which person I needed to speak with & began to argue with me about Dr. Anderson not having listened to his messages, blah blah blah.  I was cut off again as I was explaining to her the person I actually needed was Kelly and was only requesting Dr. Anderson so that I might be able to get something accomplished.  Sent back to good ole Kelly's voicemail, I hung up as leaving a message is apparently pointless.  I have since been calling back incessantly, hearing the same hold messages over and over again.  At one point, someone picked up and actually hung up on me clear as day.\n\nYou people run an extremely unprofessional business, especially seeing as how this seems to be a recurring theme which obviously has not been adequately addressed.  Not treating your patients with respect and letting them run out of medication that a MEDICAL DOCTOR has prescribed to them is astounding not to mention highly dangerous.  I would say it's pretty audacious for office staff members to have the kind of ego that allows them to think they possess even one iota of medical knowledge allowing them to in essence dictate when patients may get their medication. I've never experienced such in my entire life and I would imagine this kind of behavior would be embarrassing to whoever owns this establishment.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88892245bf7809c3:0xfacbdf228acd1932"}

Amanda Miller is so right about everything she said and I have went through the same nightmare!!\nUPDATE: I having stage 4 terminal cancer going through A LOT as a single mom...thank God I found another psychiatrist that cares! That recognizes PTSD. One that doesn't drug test you every single time, making you feel singled out like a junky, not every patient was drug tested every time!! *update again! E Campbell re your review 1st \"your not sure why Dr sugg has many negative reviews? maybe because there's a problem with him and you don't get it because you & only 2 others like him out of over 70 reviews, your judgemental too like him\" like ass-uming one is abusing their medication! I did NOT abuse my medication, even passed every pill count much less drug test repeatedly not that its your business. I referred to how he would test me monthly but not other patients, that is \"singling one out\" and if i was African American I would slap him with a discrimination lawsuit along with Psychiatry south who condones all the negative complaints of his behavior!! I asked him why he stayed on the laptop (i have no reason to make it up) and his reply \"he must update my medical info\" well my cancer is not for him to update that's for my oncologist! fyi I have stage 4 cancer and do not even take pain meds while you want to pass judgement, I see why you hit it off with him!  You need to stick to reviewing the doctor not judging other patients! I'd like to know why management brushes off the negative reviews only focusing on a positive one, probably shocked to see one! I mean when most reviews are negative among over 70, the common denominator is the doctor and or practice! I too asked to see another doctor in the practice, I know Dr. Austin is a wonderful caring doctor but no! i was told I would have to do an exit review with Dr. sugg to get such approval instead he pointed out my original google negative review on here and immediately began to cut my medication which is dangerous and clearly retaliation. I'm only on Wellbutrin and 2 benzo a day, my goodness, divorced single mom, ptsd and stage 4 cancer,  your anxiety/depression/ptsd would be bad too! Documenting is very important but not during the whole appointment never giving the patient attention and when given, uncaring and short with you! Also, a good psychiatrist documents in between patients but when the doctor is late that leaves him no time to do so which brings me to the time I came from Tuscaloosa all the way to Birmingham for him not to be there, however he did apologize when I had seen him at the next visit for no-one failing to notify me. I can appreciate that but it's a huge inconvenience after a bilateral mastectomy and 2 hour round trip! A doctor must find a balance between documenting and doctoring after all you are there to get help, to be listened too not to documented like you are in a court trial.. I get the DEA is hammering down but its pretty clear they are controlling many doctors to the point the patient does not matter only covering their as*! Well there are ones that can care for a patient and do it legally documenting keeping in DEA guidelines, balancing it out! Matter of fact when one documents to heavily you have to question why? As there's no reason to be concerned with overly documenting when you know you been ethical and management should agree, however they don't seem to care about ones who have been negatively affected only positive reviews.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88892245bf7809c3:0xfacbdf228acd1932"}

I then filled out multiple pages of paperwork. After an hour or so I asked the somewhat rude receptionist what was taking so long. She said I still needed to do labs! Labs, seriously for what? I have NEVER had to do labs to see a psychiatrist but whatever. After labs I waited another 30-45mins. When I saw Dr.Suggs I explained how I had been having more anxiety than usual due to some personal issues. He then asked all about the personal issues only to give me NO options to up the dosage of my anxiety meds or he said I could quit taking one of the medicines I've been taking for over 10 years. He said that benzo's are habit forming and benzo's aren't meant to be used for long term use. I asked him why so many doctors had prescribed these for over 15yrs without hesitation. He just shrugged and said he didn't know. I should also mention that Dr. Suggs literally has the personality of a robot. I would've been better off going to a doc in the box. He seems to think that the medications that he likes for his patients to take is the right medication for every patient to take. I've taken almost every med you can think of. My opinion of what has worked and what hasn't worked should matter. Also, he questioned me so much on dates and RX's that were filled that I felt like he was accusing me of Doctor shopping.

Let's start with my journey with Dr. Lane- Psychologist- I spoke with Lane 2-3 times total in my time at Psychiatry 280. She was over 30 minutes late to TWO of my appointments (not because she was dealing with another client.) At the end of my last session with her, she STILL did not know my name or anything about me. After my 2nd visit, I met with Dr. Polek for approximately 15-20 minutes. I was unsure of him from the beginning based on what I walked away with versus what I explained my issues were. After testing multiple different treatments with him, I called 5 Psychiatrists in the Birmingham area, and my previous Psychiatrist in Auburn- most of them knew of Psychiatry 280 and the ones that did told me they had only heard negative things about Dr. Polek. Each and every one of them were appalled at the treatment I received. I take medication very seriously- they can do SERIOUS damage to your health and even be fatal if not properly researched or if combined with other medications. Luckily, I was not harmed. FINALLY, when I requested my medical records after telling them how upset I was with them- they denied me my personal records 4 different times, stating that it was illegal for them to give them to me because it was a \"Psychiatry Clinic\". I spoke with an attorney who told me what my rights were according to HIPAA and contacted them one last time to inform them that it was in fact ILLEGAL for them to deny me my Psychiatrist Medical Records. (HIPAA Code 45 CFR 164.501) I DO NOT recommend this clinic to anyone hoping to find a doctor that LISTENS to you. It's sad that we live in a world where we cannot trust our doctors. On a nice note, Kristen the receptionist was the most professional person in the building and very understanding throughout my whole situation. On top of that, I just got a call saying that I \"owe\" $99 and I haven't been in since June 2016.

Definitely not who you want to trust with your issues and problems. THEY DONT CARE!\n\nBack story: First appointment, my fiances mother wanted to make sure I gave them the right insurance cards in order because she said they got misfiled in incorrect order last time and it took them over a year to fix so I told that to the receptionist when I got there and she snarkly responded \"I doubt that\". To which I responded... \"No it wasn't a question \"if\" ...it did..\". Then I was filling out the paperwork for my fianc\u00e9 and she said that he needed to fill it out hisself . With his condition he can't do that so I told her that was the whole reason we were there in the first place, and that he couldn't. She was super rude and snarky and judgemental the whole time. So we had to leave to find him an appropriate writing utensil he would use and he finally signed the papers. Fast forward to this time:\nHe has a 2:00 appointment, we arrive at 1:40... we sit all the way til 2:30 thinking Dr. Schwartz was just running behind. Then he comes out at 2:30 and calls a different patient back... so I ask Dr. Schwartz when my fianc\u00e9's appointment time is to which he says he doesn't know, so I go to the desk and ask and she tells me it was at two... but that he was running behind.. but she neglected to mention any of this for the fifty minutes we waited. So then my fianc\u00e9 asked how much longer it will be for him then, and she said thirty minutes.. so we decided to leave and go get coffee.. We come back in only twenty minutes and see the previous client leaving when we walk in. She came out the door and said \" Dr. Schwartz came out after he finished with his client and you weren't here and I was \"unsure\" if you were coming back so I went ahead and gave him his next patient. To which I responded... No you told us it was thirty minutes til he would be seen.. so we left and came back in twenty. She just kept blaming it all on Dr. Schwartz when all of it was literally her lack of professionalism that caused this whole scene. She never told us he was running late, nor apologized. She never told Dr. Schwartz what she told us about him being able to see him in another thirty minutes... like I have never in my life witnessed such carelessness and unprofessional from a \"professional\" practice. So Dr. Schwartz didn't even end up seeing my fianc\u00e9 even though we waited approximately an hour and a half. And he missed work to not even get his appointment due to the vendetta this receptionist had against him.

Your input is appreciated.\nYour perspective on the first visit is different than most of our patients but significant. The intake paperwork asks the patient to list all their symptoms and quantify their health complaints and instructs the patients to quantify their level of improvement over the next 12 treatments.... That is correct. The reason the paperwork addresses a treatment plan is so patients are aware from the beginning that holistic treatment is not a one treatment panacea, it's not a pill and it's not magic. It is a healing process and the specifics are handled individually with each patient.\nA 20 minutes face to face with a physician is unheard of these days and if you feel that was a short visit so be it. In a 20-minute visit we addressed the entire human frame above and beyond the chief complaint plus acupuncture and tongue analysis. The process didn't stop when you left the office but it continued as the tongue analysis was performed by OUM physicians in California and THERE WERE THREE EMAIL CONVERSATIONS REGARDING THE SPECIFICS. That was a step I take out of true concern for the health and well-being of my patients but it's cases like these that make excellent physicians become callus.\nBest of luck on your journey and next time find something to praise about the next person that gives a damn about your health and well-being"}, "gmap_id": "0x8892927a6c918d1b:0x6fa1927cce21bd5d"}

However, two huge issues. 1.) she seemed to be working on an almost assembly line sort of protocol and took a very short time to listen to my concerns and prescribed medications that gave me multiple concerns due to potential side effects I wanted to avoid 2.) the lady with whom they scheduled my appointment also did not have her insurance credentials in order so I ended up paying 155.00 out of pocket. I have excellent insurance and I would have had zero copay if she could\u2019ve accepted my insurance. I paid because they assured me that by the time my follow up appointment was scheduled they would have the situation remedied. I called before I went to the next appointment and was advised she still didn\u2019t have credentials for united healthcare so the visit would cost 90.0. I canceled the appointment and will have to find another doctor. This has also left me dealing with the side effects of those medications without any support in handling that. All around, I do not advise going here.

If anything they should have said come into your appointment and we will not charge you and will handle the insurance after the fact.

I was experiencing PTSD and extreme distress during my service and was admitted to this hospital\u2019s behavioral health unit twice within a year. Here\u2019s my story:\n\nThe first time I was admitted, it was voluntary...\nI was going through a lot on base, where I lived. My chain of command in the military allowed me to admit myself for a short period of time. They wanted me to get myself together and have me go back to continuing my service.\n\nThe neglect for patients here was disgusting to say the least. The staff allowed my chain of command to enter the unit without my password. They were the last people I wanted to see. I was sure that this was illegal and requested to speak to a supervisor, who told me it was my mistake for not turning them away. Being a soldier, I knew she did not understand that I could not do that and she clearly did not care about the law that her staff was breaking. This was not the only kind of neglect I witnessed/experienced. The geriatrics room was so sad. The older patients are sat down in chairs all day and night, in front of a tv. One of the older men was taken into a private room with a female tech. When they came out, he had a bloody mark on his forehead. Some of us patients noticed but felt that nobody would do anything about it. Another older gentleman in the geriatrics room died while I was there. Nobody knew the cause but he was wrapped up in a sheet and placed into a giant gray bin and wheeled away in front of all of the other patients!\n\nDuring this first stay at this hospital, there was a day where a group of student nurses were visiting to observe the staff and patients. They were observing a therapy group where the therapist was breaking HIPAA laws and verbally exposing each patient\u2019s diagnosis in front of all of the other patients, as well as the student nurses.\n\nThe second time I was admitted, I was court ordered. My command knew I was in distress and did not know what to do with me. I was sent to this hospital a second time and knew that it would not be a long stay. I was met by two giant men, telling me I have been court ordered to the psychiatric unit. I knew that something wasn\u2019t right and that the court order was not justified. This time, they admitted me to the third-floor. There were beds available on the second floor but had decided that I would be better off on the third floor. Anyone who has been to this unit, knows that the third floor is for patients with severe mental health issues... this time, there was a poster on the wall with all of the patient rights (that wasn\u2019t there before)... I read all of my rates and noticed that it said that I could request a patient advocate and a lawyer. When I approached the glass window at the desk, I requested Mary Anne, A wonderful recreational therapist that I remembered from my first stay- as well as a lawyer!... I was met with a nasty attitude and told to sit down because I was court ordered. At this point, I was panicking and angry so I threw a fit in order to get the attention of whoever was above this woman telling me to take a seat. When I got the supervisors attention, I requested that lawyer and therapist. The lawyer asked me if I had been \u201cBaker Acted\u201d but I had no idea what that meant. He pulled up my information on a computer and informed me that I had not been \u201cbaker acted\u201d and could leave anytime I wanted. I was out of there within a few hours!\n\nWhat a horrifying experience this was. The neglect and abuse here is disgusting and I would never EVER recommend anyone admit themselves to this hospital!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88928d9733f9a99d:0xdd43af3d45a5a602"}

Perhaps my previous doctors were influenced by the labels and words used to describe some of my symptoms which caused them to think I didnt need this form of treatment.. I dont know but there are medicines that will help you that you may never have heard of like me.\n\nIt actually makes my brain WORK the right way Versus just numbing it, and covering over the problem .\n\nI am now in a position that I am safely tapering off the medication that I dont truly need to be on(faster than I thought I could) and put that \"mistake\" in the past and I am focused on my life and my future for the first time in years.\n\nNever give up hope! Dont settle for bad help or mediocre treatment that just helps you \"get by\" each day as long as you have your \"meds\"\n\nIf you not thriving or on a path too it dont settle like I did for way too long.\n\nDont assume you know the only things that will work for you and be TOTALLY honest with the Dr so he can help you .\n\nIm even getting back into old hobbies and my next new career goals and even back into My Faith in God.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling please take this as a message of hope that its never too late and never hopeless.\n\nGod Bless and Thank you to Dr. Islam and Thanks to President Trump or whoever in the Government made this Tele-Medicine / new video conferencing option available. Without it I may never have found Dr. Islam.\n\nThank You Dr. Islam\n\nSincerely,\n\nMatt", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923d657d7a777:0xd29d293725d9d7a7"}
