My daughter attended preschool there from age 2 through K4. Tuition can be pricey & there can be a waiting list from time to time, but my husband & I believe it was worth it. The administration & staff are both knowledgeable & experienced. Admission to the preschool/daycare/after school care is limited. You either have to be buzzed in by staff or you have to have a security code to unlock the door. Children must be both signed in & out. Children are supervised at all times. Meals are nutritious & made on site by some truly wonderful ladies. Children are educated, cared for & loved by administrator & staff. We feel that our daughter's 3 years at FBCHPS has benefitted her educationally, socially & morally. She is 8 years old now & has been away from the preschool since she was 5 & what memories she has of her time there are precious to her. She misses it\u2764\ufe0f\n\nAlthough neither my husband nor I are members of FBCH, we have attended services there several times. We found the congregation & minister to be welcoming & warm. Congregants are kind & generous. There is ample parking for both the disabled & non. The church is wheelchair accessible & congregants are cheerful & helpful. This is a Community Oriented church. By that, I mean that the church & congregation are highly supportive of the Headland community & the schools of the City of Headland. I found the congregation & the staff of the preschool to be open, helpful & compassionate to the needs of members of the community once they were advised of needs.

I tried to lead a group but was told I had not been there long enough and they did not know me. I tried again months later and was told my walking group was not going to work.  The church did not fit my needs at the time in a new city. I was a regular in a small group but they never met outside the group. I think if you are a homebody, parent or a child the place is good. I have also emailed the church and never received a response back.

Then you mentioned reaching out to Pastor Kim and we have never had a pastor by that name at Passion Church, Montgomery, not even when we were formerly called Christian Life Church.  Since another church purchased our former property, my guess is that your experience occurred at our former building that was sold to them in January 2017.  That being the case and you have yet to find a church home, I invite you to visit Passion Church - Montgomery at 6825 Wares Ferry Rd. in Montgomery and ask an usher to introduce you to Pastor Norris or Cindy.  We believe in a miracle-working God who loves us and never gives up on us and here you will receive not just compassion, but an atmosphere where you can grow and mature in your faith and relationship with God through the redemptive power of Jesus, the work of the Holy Spirit and connecting with other believers in Small Groups.  We ALL need God and we ALL need each other, so I urge you \"not to forsake assembling with other believers\".  In any case, may God bless you and bring you to a place of wholeness & restoration and we would love the privilege of helping you get there."}, "gmap_id": "0x888c2bb9d2bc9159:0xbc4181d9d0461802"}

Will I go back no. Did I enjoy the service? The singing was way too loud the microphones could have been turn down halfway. A lot of screaming and yelling I don't know what they weresinging.  I saw about 40 members half of which were children. Five different people ask me the same question I explained I have COPD without the  machine. I repeatedly said please just let me sit down in the sanctuary. I guess I had on a large beautiful hat and they were looking for members. So that's what churches are doing now trying to reach you and size you up at the door wow. Maybe my big hat means I like my hat it doesn't mean I have a lot of money. That particular hat cost me $5 brand new  made by Essence  from the thrift store on Cooper Hill Road .It was a bad experience to go visit a church when each individual as I walked through I was asked where do you work where do you work where do you work then it was well where did you retire from where did you retire from 5 different people. Every time I looked around there was a different person it's cool with me to the sanctuary Give me a break after I greeted the pastor doing that very long walk which could have been much closer if they let you in the front door. For crying out loud. You would have thought that I was on a job interview I was just visiting on Easter Sunday. I had not gone to church on Easter Sunday since I was in my early 20s. At that time I was 64. The reason I stopped going on Easter Sunday is because all the preachers say the same thing you come to church on Easter Sunday to wear your new clothes. Well everything I had on was old real old nothing was new. That was another insult to injury from the long walk. Then I never ever heard any preacher from any denomination say this I Dare you to come back three Sundays in a row. I am 100% disabled I go to church when I'm Able. Not when the bishop DARES me. I tell you the truth this really is a New day. I think he should have been thankful for the people that came. No person is perfect no minister is perfect. I'm not a sensitive person however I could not wrap that around my head I dare you to come back three Sundays in a row who was he talking to his Members or his Visitors.These are things people are afraid to say. That should be a sign in the front yard of the church that says enter from the rear of the building I explained I was Disabled that was no secret when I looked at how far I had to walk from one ramp to another ramp down this long Hall to get to the sanctuary. Preachers preach about be careful of the tongue. That goes both ways. The Bishop voiced his opinion and I have voiced mine. Now I know why they want to know time you get there what church are you a member of or do you attend. Are they calling the church to get a reference on you this is ridiculous why.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889101789f26d75:0x228b94633a1fb71b"}

Thirsty, tired & hungry. God sustained me & when I was about to give up all together, instead God passed me along to this church, along my path & my burdens were given up to Jesus as soon as I walked into the door. Consumed with love & no judgment your beautiful ministry & church & new pastor & his administrative staff took me in your building as I walked inside and spoke with me, counseling me with great compassion & mercy. You fed me Mexican food from next door & gave me water to drink & even some soda. \ud83d\ude4f you all went out of your way to help me even when you did not understand what was troubling me, or why I had chosen to leave home. You did not push me to answer you or make sense of it. But you allowed me to rest, coming miles down the road in a place unknown to me by city. In a walking boot that my recovering foot was in. Your pastor gave me great advice & even the administration\u2019s licensed nurse checked out my foot, to make sure it was in tact & still in good health. You were patient with me. You all served the kingdom perfectly & I know when I was just about to give up Jesus led me a mile or more directly to you, & when I saw your building I knew in my heart that I would be okay & I had great peace. No one else would help me, or give me water to drink. Leaving behind three days prior a family members home after a great argument, leaving behind all my possessions, safety. And even my financial means & with no understanding why I would be doing what I was people everywhere looked at me with judgment as I walked up the roads of Prattville. In a walking boot alone I\u2019m sure I looked odd & also not understanding I had chosen this path & yet I was far from homeless. There is and shouldn\u2019t be any judgment upon the homeless or wandering any way though. I would say we all have fallen short and wandered for times in our lives, even if it was not on a strange and Public street.  But the truth is I have certainly been that homeless woman and many more types of people the world chooses to look down upon. But not our father in heaven, or his true disciples. Made perfect in Gods perfect will & love. Transformed by the renewing of our minds. & changed and transformed by Gods never failing or ending grace!  God assured me you all could be trusted and your pastor gently led me & made sure I was to make it back to my family.God will not forget your acts of kindness and even now he is providing superabundance and potent blessings and favors upon your church & all people involved with you evermore. Shalom family, I will never forget any of you & again thank you for your true acts of LOVE \u2764\ufe0fChrist calls us to live by and through.\nI am reminded of these verses from Matthew 25:31-40\n\n\u201cWhen the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.\n\n\u201cThen the King will say to those on his right, \u2018Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, \"I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.\u2019\n\n\u201cThen the righteous will answer him, \u2018Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe King will reply, \u2018I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.\u201d (NIV)\n\nSincerely yours,\nRachel N.

This garden where God and humanity were one is now recreated and populated by people from every nation, tribe, and tongue - all worshiping the slain Lamb with a unified voice. This is the vision that motivates us, and we are very serious about seeing that happen. And the good news is we know it will happen, because Jesus is going to accomplish His work.

I thought emergency shelters were for emergencies yet they expect you to plan tour emergency and call ahead and if you don't you are turned away regardless if there was no answer or if they have empty beds or not. The current guards have me waiting outside knowing I'm scheduled to have major surgery in the morning telling me that I did not register yet I spoke with the director here earlier this afternoon and register. Things like this happen often here they even turned a blind man away with spare beds. I'm currently gathering eye witness accounts of other episodes and sworn affidavits to present to the concerned party. I've talked with at least a dozen such people and hope to get more.

However Movement church in Madison, Al has spent the last 3 years priding themselves as being welcoming and forthcoming in the LGBT community. The pastors spoke at LGBT members weddings, baptized LGBT people, and allowed them to participate in various departments. As of this week, they met with LGBT members of the music department and asked them to step down because they choose to continue to sin and they can not hold roles of leadership in the church any longer. Not only that, but the letter that went out from the pastors made THEM seem like the victims in this. \"We cried buckets of tears\", \"we fasted for days over this\"...

The family of pastors at this church will make you feel like you finally belong somewhere. They will make you feel like family. They were pastors of a church in Eustis Florida called Family Bible church. They abandoned their congregation for fame from a new reality show, which completely tanked. Whatdoyaknow?  The amount of hurt and chaos associated with their decision to move destroyed the very faith that they helped build in many of their youth group regulars as well as their main adult congregation. I personally attended their youth group regularly. I practically lived at that church. When they moved and abandoned our congregation, I lost my faith. I now do not even know what to believe in anymore. It was almost as if our issues were too much for this family to combat anymore so they just gave up, packed their bags, and went on with their lives. I have witnessed the aftermath of the youth group kids that they left behind. The turmoil in their hearts and lives is astonishing. These were kids i considered family. These were kids that are now struggling because not only did their pastoral family leave, they completely cut ties and no longer talk to most of the kids that attended their church. They had no regard for the people who attended the church. Nor did they care what pastor they left their church with. It's hard to believe that such horrible, self centered people could create such a following in the bible belt of all places. You would think people from that area would be able to see and recognize false prophets and people who are only in the church game for the money. It's sickening. I'm just saying as a Speegle, Adgate, Windham family survivor that these people are not worth it. They don't actually care about you. They are in it for their own personal interests. There are plenty of churches in your area that have a pastoral staff that are in it for the right reasons and not just the money and popularity.  Their love for you is fake, the things they preach are false, and they will abandon you just like they abandoned us in Florida. \"Preach for the money, You're a waste of a preacher.\" Fin.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626519de80a40b:0x432f82bbe2b61b96"}

One might expect to be guided through the parking lot by smiling faces and greeted at a \u201cvisitor tent\u201d by other volunteers from the church.  Upon entering the foyer you will encounter more greeters and the aroma a coffee. It\u2019s not just free, it is also good too!\nFirst and second time visitors get a gift for visiting and these gifts are unlike any other! They are GREAT! The first one is something the whole family can enjoy together and the second, well it is individualized. I won\u2019t ruin the surprise I case you plan to attend a few times.\nHave kids? They have an excellent children\u2019s ministry for ages 0-5th grade. There is a check-in process for children that allows parents to know their child is secure and can only be picked up by them as well as an electronic way to notify a parent if they were needed. The children\u2019s ministry is interactive and has a high level of intensity. Your child will not get bored, and that\u2019s for certain.\nTo say the worship is contemporary would not be doing it justice. It is much more than that, it is alive, engaging, and compelling. It\u2019s hard not to at least sway back and forth. Worship at Church at the Crossing is an experience.\nThe messages are practical and applicable to every day Christian living.\nThere are two Sunday morning services times, 9:00 a.m. \u2013 10:15 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. - 11:45 a.m. Having options allows for church to fit a normal flow for you and or your family. Hey, if you choose the second service you are out by noon, hopefully beating that lunch crowd!\nChurch at the Crossing doesn\u2019t end with Sundays, they also offer Life Groups on a semester basis. This makes it easy to connect with people of similar interest or with others in similar phases in life.\nSpeaking of connecting, serving is a large part of this church. Not only do they make it easy to connect on a serving team but they also make serving fun!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892929ef679ab1f:0xa944927fd3625c3a"}

I was very, very grateful that the lessons covered by their classes teaches the same criteria to children, in their own understanding, as well as it teaches the adults. That is a togetherness unrivaled by my experiences up til now. Like I previously stated, at First Baptist Church everyone is on the same page so to speak. I love learning about God. This is a great place to gain more knowledge about \"The Rock\" in my life. This is a true home for building on and creating the perfect foundation.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a8a1c2e7d4661:0xa400b154ab4f4114"}

There's no way I could walk that far however if the Lord show me someone with the bicycle, i would ride it to be there on Sunday.

I go to church with her and my nephew Keith Posey faithfully. The past 3 months ( March,April, and May ) I have gone to many churches in my past but I just knew God sent me here cause this is the one where I belong. He knew if any pastor and Sunday school teacher could reach me... It would Chris our senior Sunday school teacher and Pastor Brother Mark Boyd. I am going to share an experience that happened to me one Sunday. Chris was teaching class and as soon as he started talking he caught my full attention that day.... never in many years has that happened to me!! I mean my mind didn't even stray for a second!! Then we were in church for our daily service... boy... can Brother Mark touch a soul...cause that day he really drew me into his God.  We sang a song Lift Up The Cross... oh what a touching heart felt song. Again Brother Mark caught my attention and I wouldn't astray from him. at the end of the sermon as we stood for those to come forward i felt a coldness run through my body as I then felt like I was dizzy,  light headed of course I got scared and started praying dear Lord please make this feeling go away...well it didn't my heart started beating fast due to anxiety built up I was starting to turn to my sister and tell het how I was feeling and needed to step out. But, out of no where a warm sensation went up my stomach through my chest and out of nowhere this most beautiful sensation went through me and I felt such a peacefulness and contentment within me. It wasn't until we left to go for lunch afterwards that started crying cause that was an experience I have never had. I told my sister about it and she said the Lord Jesus came into my soul. Let me tell you something... I will never forget that beautiful moment. For I will take it to the gave with me. This is not a made up story it really happened to me. I  finally talked to Brother Mark about my experience and he was amazing in helping me understand the Holy Spirit touched my soul that Sunday.He took the time to sit down with me and even read some verses from the bible to help me understand. so now I am no longer frightened if what I experienced that wonderful,day.\nThank you Brother Mark and Chris\nI can't wait to visit again to see all of you. My friends, my church, my Godly home. The people there make you feel welcomed and make you feel like you belong. And that's not fake either just love them all to pieces. I want to thank my sister for bringing and introducing me to her Christian family.\nMay God bless all and everyone of you.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88892476c99172e5:0x5d387bc3bc2e8d7f"}

If you chose to visit for the sabbath Saturday service, arrive 15 minutes early. Seating is hard to come by once the service begins. Very unique style congregation of folks from all various backgrounds. Saturday main service begins promptly at 10:30am. There are several segments of their service which are performed by different members. There are several Jewish songs and dance followed by more modern worship songs in English. They also recite parts of the Torah. Everything is projected on the wall for new comers. After each meeting, everyone eats and socializes. It is was an extremely welcoming place full of culture and Hebraic biblical teachings. They also have a segment where they pray special blessings over the children. There even Hebrew classes taught here as well. Visiting the Messianic Worship Center felt foreign for its diversity yet familiar like home. Would definitely recommend this place", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPIEB3tUvVe9iqWrCCNM_i82uxno1XjfQPnEV3=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3cW3OtaeRtG57i3gc-MzT7hbjmFynhCS0UURA=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFPfsJCk4xBYNcDVCGbl_gMHzx0zdcyfpNwGMb=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsJ3tAgy7OIuBUqQ8-p8833cTtZyLDJRUIZFA8=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxUOs0w-kmy6dH72katWmlLoL5M8TFgf0wWFZ-=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2S1anzoYQQ9wIu9YdQy7GUa0IDBI-vASmvxEh=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkczZJPUsO71PhAiRIu56X-y8qTzc2sT3qzH9Q=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPr9MMQe8W2dnJ5M0XdRtIt3J5HG-0upIT4b1kn=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892917c1fbcda93:0x8998d794385641ef"}

Worship  brings in the presence of God every time. I'd like to see more praying  and laying on of hands for salvation and healing and deliverance and other things that the CHURCH  is so in desperate need of. A church is just building meant to bring Polin to hear the gospel, to get saved, for Christians to get rejuvenated and recharge, but We the children of the most high God are THE CHURCH!!!! The pastor is the Shepherd of the sheep as it says in God's word. He is accountable for that sheet. He is held at a much higher standard. I understand that people interpret the word of God differently but pastors are held in a much higher understanding position. Having said That, it's imperative that he is totally led by the Holy Spirit and what comes out of his mouth for he will be held accountable. And Whitney, the sheep, are the ones to go out and beget other sheep to bring into the fold. It's not all on the pastors shoulders.

The two great things that I loved about this Church was that me and my guest felt welcomed and that the pastor did preach about Jesus :) However, I thought that it was unnecessary to play secular 90's music for the first 15 minutes of worship at the altar instead of Praise and Worship. Is this church praising God or the things of this world?! Why couldn't we used those 15 minutes to do an altar call for the lost instead of singing secular songs?!!  I was really disappointed in my brothers and sisters for doing this. God should get ALL THE GLORY AND ALL THE PRAISE!!! Church is about Seeking the Lost, Teach the Found, Send the Disciples. I felt like God was just sitting there saying \"Hey! Worship me! DON'T slap me in the face with this 90's crap at the altar!\" I had to humble myself and the Holy Spirit said unto to me this is why the Church is not as strong as what it use to be because of the things in this world has become such a distraction.\"\nHowever, this is a good stepping stone church for maybe junior high or high school kids and even those that are \"babies\" in Christ that recently accepted the Lord as their Savior.\" Since I have been a Christian for so many years, I really wasn't spiritually fed with the Word today as I would have when I listen to John Piper, Pastor Diego Mesa, Chris Wienand, and so forth... I felt like this pastor needed some more growth with the Lord and I don't recall seeing a Bible in his hand. It's one thing to have an Iphone, Ipad but it's another when you have the NKJV Bible, (the root!) in your hand. Again this is what makes us not look like the world. But I strongly stress an altar call and giving God extra time to worship, extra time in His word just to be close to Him gathered together in His name.\nIf Jesus wasn't preached today, Epic Church would just be a big, entertaining, social club.\nFor those that are mature in Christ, I strongly suggest another Church that you can get rooted, grounded and spiritually fed elsewhere. But for those that are young, kids, maybe early twenties this Church MAYBE for you. But, you HAVE TO grow.\n\nJennifer", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886286a722fad147:0xff3b2c7f1d1c3791"}

Also, I\u2019m on chemo and have a very low immune system which makes it extremely important for me to stay a distance away from people. I\u2019ve ended up leaving both times without seeing/hearing the service. If you come in a half hour late to service, please don\u2019t let the ushers make other people move who were there on time. These people have sat where they have for a reason. Won\u2019t be back.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d35f55bfda287:0x4bb2941ca47086e2"}

This means taking hard looks at our opinions and biases and taking everything back to Scripture, where there are many uncomfortable yet necessary truths. We are always found wanting when we compare ourselves to God\u2019s standard, but the Good News is that the grace of Jesus covers us as we are sanctified every day in our relationship with Him.\n\nWe are an intentional church. Here, we get into theology; we ask hard questions; we dive into the nitty-gritty details of life and we apply what we\u2019ve learned about God to our daily lives and relationships. Is it hard? Yes. Is it sometimes uncomfortable? Absolutely. But the point of our faith is not to be comfortable. It is to know the Truth and to lovingly live it out with the help and grace of Jesus Christ. And it is WORTH IT.\n\nIf that\u2019s not what you want, all the best to you in your search. But if you want a family of fellow sinners saved by grace who are all struggling together, held together by our faith and taking everything back to the Cross, then this may be the family for you.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a3c1a273e6d8f:0x546ab0bf6586be95"}

The first time I attended at Heritage it was still in back of the cabinet shop. I had already asked Jesus to come into my heart years before but, the night before attending Heritage I was watching a late, late church service on T.V.  at the end of the service they did The Sinners Prayer and I repeated it wanting to renew my relationship with Our Father ! A message came to me so clearly afterwards telling me to find a Home Church and worship with fellow Christians again! I told my husband that I was going to Church in the morning, he shocked me by asking if he could go to! I told him of course he could! He was the one who suggested Heritage because our friend Charlie went there, I was just going to go to Garywood. As soon as we walked into Heritage I felt like I had come home!!! The people were so friendly and filled with The Spirit of The Lord . The music is one of my favorite parts! But Brother Mark\u2019s sermon blew me away, I was really home. After a couple of years we moved to Gulf Shores, but Heritage still remained in my heart! I was one of the first to be baptized in the new church that my husband and several of our friends helped build! I\u2019m back now and will be returning home very soon! Also, anyone who has never had a relationship with God? This is the church for you! They are wonderful with new born again Christians! Everyone is treated as family, no matter what your story is, and many churches could learn from their example!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888e0d6ae275759:0x3525fbd40c0cdda5"}
