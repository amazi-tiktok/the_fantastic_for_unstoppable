After the customer stated he had some issues, we returned on 6/11/20 to address them. We called the customer to let him know that the issues had been addressed. Customer called again 8 days later on 6/19/20 stating that he was still not satisfied with the repairs. A crew was sent out at the earliest possible date, which was the following week. The owner visited the job site on three different occasions prior to 6/19/20. The first time he met with the customer's wife and with the customer via telephone, the two following trips were with the customer via telephone. We made every effort to address every issue that was expressed to us. We called after the last trip on 6/19/20 to inform the customer the job was complete. After several days of no response from the customer, he called us back stating that he would \"pay us when he felt like it\". Despite the fact that the customer's contract states payment is due upon completion, and there is a late fee after 48 hours of non payment, we were patient, accepting and waived the late fee due to issues the customer felt he had with his project. We also gave him a discount for his inconvenience, and waited another week before calling him again.
