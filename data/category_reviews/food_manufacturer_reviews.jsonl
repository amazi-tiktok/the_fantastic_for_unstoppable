Too many types of hot peppers thrown in which muddied the pepper taste (poblano, anaheim, jalapeno, habanero, serrano, red pepper flakes)  - and the result wasn't really that hot. Red pepper flakes were unnecessary and ended up in the teeth, with a bitter result.\n\nIMHO: Do a jalapeno version, or a habanero version, or a mild poblano version, etc. - don't try to stack on  pepper tastes that conflict with another.  Could have used more cilantro leaves and some sugar or agave nectar to cut the bitterness.
