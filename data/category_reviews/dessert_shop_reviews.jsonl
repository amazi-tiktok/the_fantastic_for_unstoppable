My wife and I are not in Auburn so we chose this company to deliver an arrangement for Valentines Day for my mother-in-law in Opelika. We ordered a higher dollar item other than the lower priced special. Specifically for the reason of having more fruit and less chocolate as we were hoping for something a bit healthier because of health issues. They charged our credit card for the higher priced item we ordered but delivered the lower price special with added chocolate and it was a smaller item. In addition to the wrong item - they did not deliver it on Valentines Day. We called several times and they acted nice at first and promised to deliver the item the next day. Late in the day mom called and said it was never delivered. We called back and it was being delivered late in the day - a day late - and it was the wrong item, not the higher priced one we paid for.\n\nWe called again and one of the employees admitted they went to the wrong house on Valentines day so somebody got the higher priced item. My wife called again to at least get a refund for the overcharged amount or to have the right item delivered. We were promised the right item would be delivered. The next day, no delivery.\n\nAt this point, several days after Valentines Day my wife gave up so I started calling, was promised a refund or a deliver of the right item. There was no refund or proper delivery. I was then promised at least a call back from the owner, then another promise, another promised call back. I never heard back.\n\nMy mother in law never received the correct item and and we never got the refund. We finally tried to cancel payment with credit card and to get a refund but they disputed it - said that the item was delivered. Did not mention that it was the wrong item, and that it was late, missing Valentines Day. I'm sorry that they delivered the item, possibly twice, to the wrong house, and then the wrong item to the right address. That's three deliveries, three trips, three items. However, those mistakes are not our fault. All I know is that my mother in law never received what was ordered.\n\nI would not recommend this company to another person.\n\nI would probably have written a different review if the owner would have called me back as promised by the several employees.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2ce2392dbe3:0xba2152bd50d19c00"}

It appears to be growing fast.\n\nAt the end of a bike ride, I stopped to try it out. It was a good decision. Their cookies are excellent.\n\nThey are served warm. For cookies, they are expensive but these are better than any other cookies I have had in a store.

No other details were offered to me, other than just \" delivery was unsuccessful \"... I know it was unsuccessful, duuhh!

After finally calling corporate I was told that the order would absolutely be ordered, likely by 9 PM (unacceptable in itself).\nAfter it still went unreceived and I filed a formal complaint on Saturday, I was informed that they would likely be open that day due to the holiday weekend and my order would *probably* be delivered that day. Again, my delivery went unreceived.\nSunday, I called the store all day, always reaching a busy tone, but felt confident that the company would at the very LEAST deliver my order first thing that morning, despite it already being two days late. No such luck.\nFINALLY today, three days after my intended delivery date, I was able to get ahold at someone at the store and let them know that I was displeased to say the least, and would like my order to still be delivered but would like the delivery fee refunded, as it did not arrive the day it should have. The person on the phone then said he cancelled my order completely (although I have yet to receive a refund), rang up another order, and charged my card AGAIN for the amount of the basket. By now, there has been $200+ worth of charges put on my card. But hey, they offered to give my mom a free box with 6 chocolate strawberries to make up for it.\nAfter speaking with my mother, we decided to cancel the entire order and, YET AGAIN after not being able to get ahold of anyone at the store for several hours, I called corporate and asked to cancel my order and was informed not only did they have absolutely no record whatsoever of my 2nd purchase (even thought they were more than happy to charge my card earlier today), MY ORIGINAL ORDER HAD BEEN CANCELLED BY SOMEONE ON THE DAY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DELIVERED. I was informed that I should try to get in contact with someone at the store (as if it's so easy) and my complaints would be passed on to the manager. This experience was absolutely DEPLORABLE as far as customer service goes and I am extremely disappointed with the lack of effort to correct the situation.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862132575d829c7:0x2cc57f2e8be23c56"}

I spoke to the barista about what happened and she let me know that she sat you right after I had left for the evening. We close early on Sundays so that staff can go home and be with their families for Sunday dinner, and the closing baristas are not supposed to seat guests after 5:45p. The employee who waited on you didn't want you to be disappointed by turning you (or either of the other two tables that showed up right before closing) away, so she sat you without letting you know the policy. Having experienced the stressful situation that followed, she now understands why we don't seat after 5:45p on Sundays. Your review helps to reinforce why the seating policy is in place, and I really appreciate you bringing your experience to my attention.\n\nAs for the cheese plate, I'm sorry it wasn't explained more fully. I do always present it with an explanation of what is being served, but the barista who waited on you had never presented a charcuterie before and was unsure of what to do. Again, I apologize for the confusion!\n\nI'd love to bring you back in sometime when I am on shift, so that I can extend you an apology in person and make sure you have an amazing experience.

Took an hour for my friend to receive her banana split dessert.  Despite us asking about it we kept being told \"they're working on it.\"  It's a banana split dessert.

She had a hard time separating our checks despite our party offering to walk up to the register to help her.\n- Our table was served food slower compared to tables that arrived 15-20 mins after us.\n\nHonestly I wish the food and service (both very subpar aside from desserts) matched the emphasis on decor.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb393b79e14f9:0x4b36df30e0221a91"}

I'm sorry to hear that you had a less than ideal experience. I hope you'll reach out to me and let me know what confused you about our restaurant and which meal left you hungry. We do try to keep our portion sizes to a reasonable caloric range that is both filling and healthy, but sometimes we miss the mark. My e-mail is Alice@TheWonderlandCafe.com if you'd like to reach out!\n\nTo address your other comments, yes!, you are correct that our restaurant is geared towards millennials. MIllenials are the generation born between 1980 and 1996, so those between the ages of 21 and 38. That is the generation that my husband and I belong to. There are many restaurants in town aimed at other generations, but as our generation heads towards our 40's you're likely to see many more Millennial-owned establishments springing up. As is the norm in our generation, we do aim to bring a fun, hip, and distinct vibe that you can't find elsewhere in town. If this isn't your thing, we totally understand! Not everyone is going to be feeling the vibe. ;)\n\nAs for the coffee, I will happily concede that if it's a standard cup of hot coffee that you're after, you're definitely better off going to an actual coffee shop, which we are not. I've been going to Carpe Diem and Satori for well over 15 years now, and agree that they're great! Wonderland is a brand new eclectic eatery and Bubble Cafe. We've only been open about a month and a half now! Bubble drinks are definitely a 'millennial thing' and very new to the Mobile Bay Area, but I fell in love with them when I travelled out of state for college in the early 2000's, and I'm thrilled to be able to offer this delicious treat to my home town.\n\nIf the Bubble Cafe part is what was confusing, I can understand that! We've done our best to break down the menu as clearly as possible, but being introduced to an entirely new-to-the-area food concept can put one a bit out of sorts, hence the idea of slipping into Wonderland. Some people find this fun, but I can understand that not everyone is about trying new things on a leap of faith. I hope that if you return, you'll ask your server for some samples and pointers. Bubble samples are always free to newcomers and are helpful if you want to learn about this unique beverage! If you're feeling less adventurous, all of our specialty drinks are pretty much calibrated for complete epicness, so they're an easy place to start- but they're likely not what you're looking for if you're just after a basic cup of joe."}, "gmap_id": "0x889bb393b79e14f9:0x4b36df30e0221a91"}

There is absolutely no mold in the walls. A few days before we took over the lease of the unit, we saw that there was bubbling in the paint on the walls. My husband peeled back the paint and we found a significant amount of mildew through the wall and down into the baseboard, caused by a leak at the neighboring business. We notified the landlord immediately that we could not take over the lease if the issue was not addressed. We took many pictures to document the situation, and sent them to the landlord. The following Monday, the contractor came in, fully sealed of the effected area in tapping with a fan to dry the wall, then removed the entire bottom half of the front west wall from the floor to six feet up. This removed the mildewed area, as well as the two feet above it. The inside of the wall was removed, and affected boards and insulation replaced, with mold block being sprayed in throughout the repair. New drywall was installed, primed, and repainted. I realize that the pictures I took for the landlord to show the original damage are circulating on Facebook, but please take two minutes to think about why they exist. Do you honestly believe that my husband and I ripped a wall partially down, documented the damage, and then paid to have a secretly damaged wall rebuilt? Doesn't it make way, way more sense that we took the pictures to document an issue that needed to be fixed in order to have the matter addressed and remedied by the landlord? Seriously, why else would we have taken so many pictures documenting the damage?\n\nAs far as you saying that I'm showing up at people's houses cursing and screaming, this is also completely falseYes, we have a past employee who was let go of last October and who continues to slandering the business the internet over. Her mother, who she lives with, lives down the street from me. Since this young woman cannot be reasoned with, and has continued to slander me, my family, my employees, and my cafe, I did in fact go over to speak with her mother, who is my neighbor, calmly and matter of factly explaining (mother to mother, neighbor to neighbor) that if her daughter does not stop posting untrue information attempting to ruin my business, I will be filing a lawsuit. I wanted to give her a chance to speak with her daughter about honestly and most definitely how not to react to being let go of by an employer.\n\nThe fact that you have written this  review, believing the absolutely bizarre things this young woman had said about me and my cafe, only further proves her guilt in what is fast approaching a lawsuit, should this harassment continue. Speaking the truth about a business is legal, spreading lies that damage a business's reputation and cause damage to the business is absolutely not. I would appreciate it if you would remove your slanderous review."}, "gmap_id": "0x889bb393b79e14f9:0x4b36df30e0221a91"}

When I first arrived the two staff members looked mortified that someone had walked into their restaurant so I waited outside. The owner later showed up with her toddler in tow. Her child was running all over the restaurant and screaming while jumping on a couch and throwing pillows. The table that was sitting behind them were seriously confused and kept making comments about it. Her daughter even came up to my table and started trying to mess with my daughter who I had brought with me. I was super excited because this seemed like a great idea for a restaurant but it's poorly managed and poorly executed. Small children have no business running around a restaurant establishment and touching things and bothering customers. The menu is overpriced and they think it makes a qusadilla fancy by putting it on top of arugula...which is pointless. Also, it needs more seasoning. The only good thing I can say at this point is the unbirthday cake was actually really good...so there's that. I would say venture at your\nown risk.\n\nEdit - I have since returned since opening night -even after your manager quit - and I contacted the health department after watching your child touch someone's food. My review has nothing to do with you stealing your employees tips, as I left that out. My review is based purely on my two experiences in your establishment. It's so disappointing because I had such high hopes for this place. Oh, I was like 5 minutes early and you were 20 minutes late. So there's that too. \ud83e\udd17 Best of luck with your business venture.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1528832615530, "text": "Hi Ashley, you were given a special spot at the free pre-opening event and let in early because you were good friends with a with one of the managers and you said you didn't mind it being a little while as we got ready. That manager then quit during our first day open and has been asking all of her friends to write one-star reviews now that we finally have our business page up on Google. I don't understand why she is so keen on ripping down a small family business and slandering my family to anyone that will listen, but it is what it is. You seemed like a really cool person with a great kid. I'm sure you'll leave this review up, but it is what it is. Hopefully, we'll start getting reviews from actual customers in the coming days.

Our basic beverages (iced tea, lemonade, etc) are $2.95 with free refills.

If you want to go crazy then, yes, we do have $10 specialty drinks, and you definitely get what you pay for! Sure, a large 24-ounce salted-caramel mocha frozen coffee with boba pearls is going to run you $6.25- but the price to make it a specialty drink really pays of. For the extra few bucks you spend, you get mocha chips in your beverage, a huge pile of whip cream on top, twice as much boba, high quality ghirardelli salted caramel mini chips, cookie sticks, brownie brittle, chocolate chunks, AND ghirardelli caramel syrup.

I ask the representative when was the soonest they could deliver the arrangement?  She told me they could deliver it around 12 Noon on Thursday, August 16, 2018.  I told her that would be great and to please get it there as close to Noon as possible.  She said they would.  I called Edible Arrangements at 12:30pm to see if my order had been delivered. The lady told me it was on the table being finished.  I told her it was supposed to be delivered at Noon and asked her when would it be delivered.  She told me by 2pm.  Bottom line, they did not get the arrangement delivered until 4:45pm and where they had to deliver it to was less than 3 miles from the Edible Arrangements shop.  I called and spoke to the manager and she didn't care at all about the problem and said there was no way they could have gotten it there by Noon.  I ordered it the day before. They open at 8am and you can't fix, arrange and deliver an arrangement by Noon and it is less than 3 miles from your place of business?  Something is wrong with your Business Plan then.  I called and complained to corporate  and they said they would have the owner call me from the Mobile, Alabama location but, I have not received a call yet.  I spent over $100.00 and the business delivered it when they wanted to not, when I wanted them to.  If I don't hear from the owner this week, I'm sending it to my attorney. I know it's just a $100.00 but, it's about the principle of the matter.  This business did not do what they said they would do and they have not even offered an apology, much less a refund.  Well, I expect a call and if I don't get one, it will most certainly cost them more than$100.00.

While waiting I read reviews and was waiting to have to wait a long time. Ten minutes after ordering I get a call from the store telling me my order was ready with the exception of one cookie flavor. They offered to bake me one if I wanted to wait or substitute another one and be on their way. I chose to substitute, and ten minutes later they were at my door with warm cookies and cold Icecream. My daughter loved her cookie dough icecream and my husband and I enjoyed breaking off a few pieces of cookie to try (so warm and good. Crunchy on the edges, but nice and soft/gooey in the middle) before making ourselves save them for the kids to enjoy tomorrow.
