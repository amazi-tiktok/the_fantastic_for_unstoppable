The store looks great and it's great to have a good hardware store so close. Also, the personnel were knowledgeable which usually is why I prefer stores like this over Big box retailers.\n\nSo I've had a day to consider my experience at this store. I was excited to have a reason to go to the new Ace store not too far from me. It didn't go well. And for perspective, I almost never strongly complain. But, to start, I'm exceptionally busy and need a place that is easy for transactions and returns. So, being busy, I went to the shed and found out I didn't have the key for the pad lock. I ran to Ace and picked up a small bolt cutter. Coming home, I tried twice on the lock and realized it was too small.\n\nReturning to the store, I tried to return the item within 30 minutes of purchase (with receipt) to buy a large Bolt cutter. This is when I found out about the 'no return' for used items policy. OK, I can accept that. I won't be able to shop there. But I accept that. The problem? From my perspective, the owner was rude. 'No, we won't take that back. It's used' he said. IMO, 'I'm sorry, we're an independent franchise and we can't afford to take back used items' would have been a much better response.\n\nOne other story. Last year, I bought a push mower at Lowes. I tried it and it wasn't sufficient. I took it back and got a more powerful mower. They took it back no questions asked. Had I bought it at this Ace? Nope, no returns on used items. I could be wrong but I also assume you can't  bring back defectives items (it's under warranty so deal with the manufacturer?) I could be wrong there. But again, with all that's on my plate, I need easy returns. With all that said, I wish this store well. We need you here.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626731237dbdcf:0x8034c16da2ee5c73"}

For good measure he also tossed in a few choice four letter words.\n\nI told him that I was having a difficult time being calm with him.\n\nTo that he pointed at the door and told me to get out.\n\nI then told him about my chain saw experience and that I had refrained from criticizing the store about the poor service because one of his young employees had been very nice to me during a weather emergency we had April 27th, 2011.\n\nOnce again I got told where the door was and to use it.\n\nSo, I proceeded to do so.\n\nAs I was opening the door he shouted at me \"You must be another one of those Terry's\".  I promptly told him who I was and spelled my name out for him.\n\nI try to support local businesses, but he effectively sent me next door to Tractor Supply (where I got everything I came to town for anyway).  Guess it will be Tractor Supply or Lowes in the big city from here on out.\n\nGood luck with your attitude Mr. Alexander.  It will take your business straight down!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862a0a85067aee3:0xd1a118ddfcb3dd9b"}

I called 11/20/19 to get a lumber package delivered to save some time. I knew it would be a bit more expensive but more convenient. Delivery was quick and early 11/21/19 unfortunately delivery is at wrong address 100 yards from where it should be and about 15 boards were incorrect. Still no biggie just let them know and I would think it would be taken care of. First call was 8:40 am. Left a message for Dino with another salesman and on his cell phone. Second call was about 12:30 pm, third call was at 3:00 I was told he was still with a customer. I asked the person on the phone to please tell him so that I could hear him answer I needed a call back today, and he did. 3:30 pm Dino calls I explain 15 boards were to be pressure treated and the delivery was in the wrong spot (address) I was then argued with that I didn\u2019t order pressure treated I wrote down the prices quoted and if it wasn\u2019t p.t it was expensive white wood. He put me on hold when he came back to the phone he said the contractor that came in and paid told him the location. I explained it was all done over the phone and there was only me. Where he described is exactly where I told him to put it. Unfortunately that\u2019s not where it was put. He said he would call me back and get it straightened out. No call back, so 11/22/19 I called and left a message with a nice young lady for the sales manager.(I was told his name is Jason).No call back!! I go to see if the package has been moved that afternoon. I have pressure treated wood but package not moved. So much for convenience. Now I will have to pay someone to move the wood.

My shipment is a pallet of 33 boxes of porcelain tile., plus 7 additional boxes they put on the same pallet. The right side of the pallet was coming apart due to the immense weight of the tile . The driver could not move the pallet down the truck. He was not going to be able to pull it up the small slope on my driveway. What on earth were they even thinking?They needed a fork lift. I called Home Depot and they got the Transport company on the line while I was on hold. I ended up being told the transport company needed to take care of this and they would contact me in 24 to 48 hours. Which they never did. I had to call them. On 3/5 Friday I called central transport and they told me the shipment would be delivered on Monday between 11 and 12. They never showed. I checked the shipment tracking and found that they changed it to Tuesday 3/9! I got no call, text, or phone call.So Tuesday 3/9 I message them to find out eta. They said the drivers hadn't left yet and to keep checking they will update me. That never happened.

Home Depot just subs out delivery to the cheapest company....and you can see the quality when your damaged items arrive!\nAnd I pray for you if you have ANY problems with your delivery or installation!!!\nCount on a couple of things: 1) You will spend hours on the phone getting to talk to the right person. Once you think that you have the right person, they will tell you they have to check on something and they will have to call you back. OR, the right person is \"on lunch\" and they will call you back. After giving them ample time for \"lunch\" (3 hours) when you call them back, you will be told that they were \"off today\" but they will return your call in the morning.\nBasically, it's a game of ping-pong and it takes days to get simple questions answered because, obviously, no one who works there wants to actually do anything.\nI can't believe I dropped over $7K in there and they can't even answer a simple question!!!!\nBuyer beware!!! Shop at Lowe's!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb240162a2a6b:0xb64868f9b73224ba"}

The atmosphere was several degrees better than your average pawn shop - very clean and well lit, customer friendly, and the folks running the place were very conscientious and genuinely nice. We actually felt welcomed and appreciated for just stopping by to browse. Even my wife and teenager really liked the place and they are both easily \"sketched-out\" by any kind of second hand store.\n\nI was really impressed with all the good stuff for sale. All of it was very nicely displayed too. There were guns of all kinds and other hunting equipment, tools, musical instruments, high-end sunglasses, games, sports equipment, rods and reels, portable air conditioners, TVs and other electronics - you name it - and LOTS of top quality jewelry. (I'm pretty sure wifey plans to sneak back over there without me :-0 )\n\nThe prices seem fair and are clearly marked, but don't be afraid to ask for an even better deal. I was able to negotiate a great price on a particular item I had been needing for a long time but could never bring myself to purchase. Now I am glad I waited.\n\nThis place is a 5-star business for sure.\n\nThanks, Family Jewelry and Loan!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1530287274206, "text": "Ralph Thank you so much for sharing your experience with us.

I have to say that the ring I found was an EXCELLENT deal - I am not a jewelry expert and was a little uneasy about buying jewelry from a pawn shop.  I was told that the shop would stand behind the ring and wrote the details about the ring on my receipt that they would guarantee.\n\nThe next day I went to a local jewelry store to see what kind of deal I got.  Man was I surprised - I not only got a confirmation of the details of the ring were 100% correct - I was told that the ring was worth 5 times what I paid for it......I couldn't have been happier.\n\nTo know that I got a great deal on a great piece of jewelry alone would bring me back to this store.  Then add the friendly, customer centered, genuine service I received from the staff and  I will be a customer for a long time.  In fact, I came back a couple weeks later and bought a cool watch.\n\nMake this your first or last stop and you will be glad you did.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1530290562835, "text": "Thank you Todd we appreciate your business and are glad your happy with your purchase.
