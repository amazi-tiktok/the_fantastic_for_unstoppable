The Gentleman at the counter explained their process and what items were offered beyond their meat selections. I bought some chicken, hamburger patties, and a hash brown casserole. The chicken was hands down the BEST ever! Hamburger patties were good too; (My BF stated they were a little too lean.) however, I wanted to go back the next day and stock up, but they were closed by 3:00 pm on Saturday and they don't reopen till Tuesday. Will go this Friday after work and stock up! It's all local and fresh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1569616979431, "text": "Glad you enjoyed Jessica!
