To safely scan a patient with one of these devices, proper monitoring must be performed during the exam, i.e. pulse oximetry or electrocardiography.  Please see below taken directly from their web site.  As you may notice, it is also required to have a defibrillator nearby when scanning patients with these devices.\n\nPacemaker and CRT-P Requirements: Proper patient monitoring*must be provided during the MRI scan.  An external defibrillator must be available nearby during the MRI procedure.\nICD and CRT-C Requirements: Proper patient monitoring*must be provided the entire time SureScan is programmed to On.  An external defibrillator must be immediately available the entire time MRI SureScan is programmed to On.\n*This includes visual and verbal contact with the patient and monitoring heart rate using instrumentation such as pulse oximetry or electrocardiography.\n\nAs an out-patient facility, we are not equipped to provide the level of monitoring required to perform MRI on patients with these devices.
