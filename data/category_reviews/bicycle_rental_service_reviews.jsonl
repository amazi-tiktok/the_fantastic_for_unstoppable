On a five point scale, you all earn a six.\n\nAfter all these years, I thought it important to write down how wonderful these folks are and what an awesome bike shop they have.  The Auburn area is most fortunate to have this asset in our community.\n\nI purchased my first mountain bike 5 years ago from James Bros when they were still located in the bank building.  Although a novice at the beginning, I was helped to find a bike that would meet my needs.  I was not oversold.  I was fitted both in terms of how I would ride, my budget and my overall enjoyment with the sport of trail / mountain biking.\n\nWell three bikes later, two for my daughter and one more for me, and I am still extremely satisfied with everything the team does for me and my daughter.  I have upgraded to soft tails and happy I have done so.  James Bros does an excellent job of keeping my bike(s) operating safely.  I cannot stress the term \"safely\" enough.  If you have loose or worn out parts, you are putting your life in jeopardy on the trials in the area.  The staff at James Bros makes sure everything that goes out the door is ready to ride - safely.\n\nEddie and Raleigh offer sound, professional advice.  They do NOT try to sell you something you do not need.  They DO make sure what you ride is safe and enjoyable.  They listen to you.  Really listen.  They find price points and products to fit your needs.  James Bros does not sell \"cheap\" products.  They offer solid value for the money for quality bikes and service.  If you need something they do not have in stock, they will find it.  They will service it.  They will back it up every time.\n\nOne example of how they help.   I needed a locking device for my new soft tail.  Eddie could have easily sold me what was in stock or even ordered a cable set.  However, that is not really what I needed.  So, he  suggested going a big box building store - Lowes - get a long length of plastic coated cable, a good lock and make the custom cable I needed for transporting and storing the bike in my truck.  Problem solved.  And he did it knowing he could have sold me a short cable set that would NOT have met my needs.\n\nEach time I stop by, I am greeted as if I were an old friend.  That is how they treat everyone.  I would like to think I am special.  Perhaps.  But they treat everyone as an old special friend.   There has been more than one time when I have arrived near closing time when the team went ahead, took the bike in, and had it serviced before the end of the next day.  Eddie even came in when the shop was technically closed to help me with a part that was misbehaving.\n\nOverall, I want to make sure folks know James Bros is a well respected bike shop.  If you need something, they will find it and help you with it.  Regardless of your skill or budget, James Bros will work with and for you.\nThank you for many years of a happy biking.\n\nSincerely,\nDanny Butler", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3957860c0f1:0x11d9dc83b7f994c3"}

I was looking for a great relationship out of a bike shop and, I finally found one!  It's hard to find that 'feel' that your business is appreciated. We're new to cycling and, it's a perfect way to exercise as I recover through paralysis and such. We live in Florida, but as Auburn grads, my wife and myself spend a lot of time in Auburn visiting my mother.  We decided to check it out and, we're very glad that we did! You won't be disappointed!\n\nThese guys HAVE to be commended on the personal service helping a handicapped man and his family. For instance, as I already mentioned being cycling newbies, we needed to find a car carrying method easy for us with my limitations and, find a specific trailer hitch/bike carrier that my wife can easily use without help.  A couple of phone calls later... the 'Hollywood Sport Rider' fit our needs perfectly and, showed up in two days! When we came-in to pick it up, they had ALREADY ASSEMBLED it for us!!  The thing is like a jigsaw puzzle! They didn't charge us to assemble it AND, the company is big on giving to the Active Duty a Military discount... I wish more American shops/stores/services etc., embrace the James Bros Bikes business model.  Thank you so much guys!  Can't wait until the next time!

He also took the time to point out great trails and sites we should see before we depart.  When we got the bike he took the extra time to fit the bike to our rider and make sure the shocks and tires all had the correct pressures.

He also gave us a history of Columbus. There are bathrooms and showers and a few lockers, a total of 3 showers and 2 bathrooms. I think they could probably use a bigger shower/bathroom/locker area. Inside they sell tea shirts, water proof shoes , water and some touristy stuff. They offer several levels , we took the classic trip and it was great for 1st time. We had a couple of fast currents but also plenty of tranquil waters. We got off the boat and floated down stream, it was extremely relaxing. Next time we will maybe step it up a bit. They also offer zip line which looked liked a lot of fun. We had a great time and the area is great to take a stroll and enjoy a gorgeous sunset. Great places to eat also.

We found them on Groupon and when I called to ask some questions the lady who answered was extremely helpful and patient with all of my concerns. My wife and I decided to do the Challenge Rafting Trip because we wanted the most adventurous ride. Our guide was Seth aka \u201cMonday\u201d and even though he mentioned he was a rookie, we felt very comfortable and safe throughout. Being a Firefighter/EMT I\u2019m always concerned about safety and I\u2019ve taken a couple of water rescue operations class and I know how powerful the rapids water can be. We had six people total plus Seth and from the beginning a guy sitting in the front named Dean seemed to have also wanted a more challenging ride after he had previously done the Classic Trip. Dean even asked to sit in the front, and made me think \u201cthat\u2019s my type of guy and we will have fun with this fella in the front\u201d. I was so wrong. Dean couldn\u2019t paddle for s@h#%! Our guide would ask for only 3 paddles but Dean would keep going like he knew better, he was extremely annoying and inconsiderate to the rest of the group. Seth kept the trip alive with his witty jokes and history telling. The rapids did not disappoint us, and they were very similar to the James River located in Richmond, VA where we are from. Once we got to the Class V rapids we all braced to the bottom of the boat but the flip was inevitable specially having Dean upfront doing his own thing. I think we all drank some Chattahoochee River Cocktail, regardless it was a lot of fun and everyone wanted to do it again except Dean, of course. Seth told us we wouldn\u2019t do it again to please him but to our surprise Dean ended up jumping off to the side walk and leaving us to have all the fun. If you are in Columbus area, I highly recommend these guys and the services they provide. Just wish there were better photos of our trip, maybe all the guides should carry a GoPro and I would definitely spend the extra money for some cool pictures.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccdb9fca487c5:0xe25789a2a58405ef"}
