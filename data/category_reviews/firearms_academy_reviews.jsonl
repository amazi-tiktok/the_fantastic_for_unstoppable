Had a hard time finding ammo before I arrived, but they happened to have a couple boxes of ammo i could use.\n\nThe staff is friendly, courteous, and very informative. They take the time to explain what it takes to fire at the range with ease, and have a cushy waiting area to view a quick training video. The whole process was smooth and easy.\n\nThe range safety officers are well on their game. I felt safe the entire time on the range, and they were able to quickly explain the touch screen track interface, and further explaining that safety is a top priority.\n\nI signed on for 30 minutes, and decided to fire my .40 before testing the shotgun. The touch screen interface has me sold on coming back to bullet and barrel. With just a click, the target goes the exact distance. Takes all the guesswork out of the experience.\n\nI fired my pistol, and was pleased with the range itself. The design is new and clean. And with the RSOs keeping an eye on everything, it's a great environment to enjoy your firearms.\n\nI tried the 88, and it performed beautifully. I added some extra cushion due to a shoulder injury. For those that would ask, you can't shoot bird shot here. But you can fire buck shot and slugs. But I'll tell you, it's fun firing a shotgun at this range.\n\nAfterward I wandered around and struck up conversations with some of the staff, and showed me a selection for sale. I was impressed with the inventory, as well as pricing. I see myself buying my next firearm from here.\n\nFor me, it's a bit of a drive from Madison. But good business is where you find it, and Bullet and Barrel is my newest one stop shop for all things firearms. Plus, open on Sunday!\n\nDont take my word for it, stop in and check them out today!

I returned the gun on Friday 1/22/21, at which time, i was informed that I would have to ship the gun to the manufacturer at MY expense as a \"warranty\" issue. I questioned their definition of warranty, being the gun had never even had a shell put in it. They employee then said he would attempt to REPAIR the gun, and would contact me. I was contacted the next day and told it was fixed. I told him I was unable to come to the store that day, but would contact them the following Tuesday, because they're closed on Mondays. Not wanting an out of the box repaired gun, I asked for a refund, at which time, my request  refused and was hung up on by the store owner.
