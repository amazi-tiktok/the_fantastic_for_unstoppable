I'm also very impressed with the two people who removed the door, came by a few times to refinish the outside trim, and reinstall the door.  They were so professional and very informative.

As soon as we replaced our old windows with new, efficient windows from Holcombe Doors and Windows, we could tell a HUGE difference not only in the appearance, but our rooms were no longer hot in the summer or cold in the winter!
