Now he\u2019s popular and well mannered clean and the harassment and embarrassment is approaching fast. He cannot go to class and back home without someone complaining about him! I don\u2019t like it! Administration is assuming that anything going on has to do with my child and it is very discomforting for him to be a 15 year old and not enjoy his high school years with people that favors 1 class of kids over the other! Be careful everything that looks good is not! Dealing with Ms Kidd has been wonderful but others not so much!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891dc019781abd:0x5dd0a0e2cfacbda8"}
