It was the job I'll never forget! And as a kid it was great pay and the area was remote as hell. used to hike through the woods around the site and find old homesteads and grave yards from the 1700s! Ancient hand chiseled stone grave markers were just laying on the ground, and walking through the thick woods would come across rock fireplaces where a house used to be, totally awesome! This was a project of Alabama Power Company. My dad was a crane operator and I was on the concrete crew, at-least 1 guy was killed on the job falling off the side of a pour where a form came loose. When they finished topping off one side of the dam, the river had to be turned, which left a dead section of the ancient river, it had deep holes that were full of giant catfish! Guys on break would wade out and catch them by hand! And the area was full of wildlife, beavers galore, deer, bob cats, possibly even bear, but I never saw any. Heavy machine operators sliced the mountain on 1 side creating a shear drop off, I watched a deer come running through the woods and fly off that new cliff, broke it's legs and a worker took it home. I moved away after the project was nearly completed and have never returned, some of the greatest memories in my life! Oh I certainly remember the day I made a grand entrance into the employee parking lot, rolling my truck down hill 6 times and landing upside down! Didn't get hurt except for my driving skills, and everybody laughed and asked my dad, didn't you teach this boy how to drive!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888b9def0ed87d5f:0xb20d53df47a8f9e2"}
