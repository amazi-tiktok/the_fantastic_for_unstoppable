The worst place in Oxford is on the south side of Hwy 78 East. The BEST place is A&B and they are located on the north side of 78 just east of Hutch Touch. I'm in retail sales in the trailer industry myself and A & B Trailers is my go to source for information, parts, and trailers. If  I have a question about ANYTHING in regards to dragging a wagon... A&B Trailers.. Knowledge level? I'll put it this way; theres not anything they can't  cover on your trailer.  I promise, they will never lead you wrong. These guys are not pencil pushers that have sit behind a desk all of their lives. They are blue collar, hard working, hands on, highly experienced fabricators and they know their stuff. If you want to spend half of your retirement on junk just to have it fall apart in a few months, then go across the street and shop with Ward. Now if you want an extremely well built, solid piece of equipment at a reasonable price  from an excellent company that stands behind their product AND appreciates their customers?... Welcome home family!! You are in the right place. A&B Trailers. You won't find better people anywhere and let me just add this in there.... these cats are Perfectionists. I know. I have worked side by side with them in a fab shop and I am a perfectionist also, but these jokers....well they take it to a whole nother other level. I will take an oath to say, \"They do things at A&B with a whole bunch of heart and a truck load of pride. It's done once, done right, and that's the product they will provide you every single time. I highly recommend A&B Trailers for all of your parts, accessories,  tires, wheels, batteries, or even if you are looking to upgrade with a brand new piece of pride attached to your vehicle.. Come on down to A&B. I'm sure glad I stopped here. Received a solid product and made two friends for life. Where else can you get service like that? A&B Trailers. Ask for Andy or Barney. NO need in referencing my review. They'll know who sent ya when you call them by their names \ud83e\udd23", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb1986beb8101:0x586c73bb92afd432"}

My husband was on the road so I went by late Feb to check on the status and it was barely started.  Hubby came home around Mid April and we went to check on it and again, not ready. Was promised we would have it time for Memorial Day Grilling. While my husband was on the road, he called frequently as did I.  Not only did we never get anyone to answer but no return calls.  Needless to say, it wasn\u2019t ready for Memorial Day nor 4th of July.  Because they would never answer the phone nor return calls, I went to the business several times to check on the grill and each time only a few workers were there and not the owners and each time the grill looked like a totally different grill.  My guess is they were building and selling it to other customers because they knew my husband was on the road.  Each time my husband came back home, he checked on the grill and because it would not be ready, the owner would throw in extra things. We finally put our foot down and told the owner that we didn\u2019t want the grill and he wanted our deposit back.  Miraculously the grill was completed with a quick paint job and they delivered it.  The owner also charged us several hundred dollars more for things we didn\u2019t ask for and we didn\u2019t get things that were promised on the contract.

That is too long for a service appointment. It makes me question how good the products really are...What good is the extended warranty if you can\u2019t use it?

Our salesman Spencer and the rest of the knowledgeable staff was able to answer every question that we had. The Staff also treated my wife with the respect that lacks in other dealer experiences . We left that day feeling like we have gotten a great deal and amazed at how friendly and respectful the staff is. We cannot say enough great things about the buying experience through Champion Powersports. The parts department has also been very knowledgeable and courteous while helping with parts and accessories for our ATV. The Polaris 570 utility edition that we purchased could not have been a better choice for our needs. This ATV has no trouble pulling the 950 pound trail mower we use on the farm or putting that smile on your face at the end of a hard days work . The 570 has more than enough power for the tough jobs or excitement out on the trail. The best way to describe the Polaris 570 utility edition and Champion Powersports is simple. The right tool for the job. Thank you to everyone at Champion for what you do.\nMatthew Porterfield", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88628b0cc039980d:0x789d8a26f66daf97"}

It took two weeks to get back about parts.  At that point the parts were out of warranty.  So we paid for them and shipping.  We got the wrong parts.  I even took picture the second time.  We got parts that look similar but size was wrong, would not work.  So Mailed them back along w one of the brake pads off the 4 wheeler and tracked them..  I found out that the package was delivered Thursday 4/28 .  I called and was told spouse was sick bit she sent picture to manufacture.  No call that we got them, they are working on it,, nothing.  This has been the way we have been treated.  You have to chase them down to get answers.  I asked to be called by the end of the week, with answers and a solution!
