They have a beautiful high quality selection. We worked with Stephanie and she was so sweet patient and professional.

We put it in layaway as our 10th anniversary was in December(this happened in June). I forgot to snap a picture of it while we were there so I called Stephanie and she happily got it out of the safe and put it on her own finger and sent me pictures via text message. She went above and beyond! We were shopping with our kids and they offered them chocolates and water. We called to have my diamond placed in the new ring on Wednesday of this week and they placed it on the same day we called and overnighted the ring to me for free. I live 6 hours from Gulf Shores. It was at my door the next morning. It is so beautiful! I am so thankful we went there to see about getting my original ring repaired and ended up with a gorgeous new ring that has special meaning since it was purchased at one of my favorite vacation spots.

To his credit, the jeweler was wonderful. I got my quote and was told it would probably be ready by Monday.\n\nMonday rolls around and it's not ready but that's okay. I understand delays happen, and it's not like I need the ring right this minute. I say thanks and on goes my day.. The next day I get a similar phonecall, but it's still fine, I get it.\n\nThe third day past due, my husband gets a call that the rings are ready and they're ready for pick up. He asks if it's all three. \"Three? Um, there's only two.\" No, there are two bands and an engagement ring. \"No, I only see two bands here. I don't see any engagement rings here. Let me look for the order I'll call you back.\"\n\nSo he looks. And he can't find it. Calls back. Some stern words are had regarding the fact that yes, we dropped of a ring for repairs and it should be there.\n\nKeep in mind, this is my grandmother's ring. She is deceased. I have no words for how upset I was during this whole exchange.\n\nEventually they call back. They found it. The order should be complete \"tomorrow\"\n\nNo phone call that next day.\n\nThe following day I called back and was told yes, two rings are here for you.\n\nI swear, I think I blacked out for a second.\n\nGrogan, get your act together before you give someone a heart attack.\n\nTo the jeweler's credit, the ring fits great and looks amazing.

I had a ring I got for our 2nd Anniversary that had gotten to small.\nSeveral other Jewelers told me it could not be sized. So it sat in a special case hoping one day it would fit. When I spoke to Amanda she said she thought they would be able to size it. Just bring it in and they would see. I found out that the reason my ring didn't fit was because I was sold the wrong size. Amanda sized the ring, sized my finger and checked to make sure none of the stones were missing. She was so polite and professional. I felt so comfortable with them I even gave them my engagement and wedding ring to be cleaned. Amanda did the same thing checked to make sure I wasn't missing stones or had loose stones. I got my rings back today and I am so happy with them. Diamond Depot is definitely where's all my jewelry will go in the future. And I already have my eyes on my next Anniversary present.

Didn\u2019t seem right so I decline and they didn\u2019t charge me for the new battery they gave me. I left with a bag full of watch parts. Later, I realized the gasket was damaged, I was missing parts, and with a battery that doesn\u2019t work. This watch is a standard Tissot, and doesn\u2019t need \u201cspecial\u201d parts to change out batteries. I will send my business elsewhere.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1595683816573, "text": "Hi Joseph.  In the 1000+ Watches we work on yearly, we do occasionally have a watch repair that requires a higher level of service than our on site Watch Repair shop feels comfortable offering. In those instances, we send the watch to our repairman in Texas, whom we have worked with for years, and they will repair and send back to us. The service is excellent and the pricing is very affordable for our customers.\n\nOut of all the watches we have replaced a battery on this year, yours was the only one that we needed to send off for further inspection. The reason was because of a damaged gasket (so it appeared) - but certainly it was beyond our comfort level of repair locally. Rather than continue to work with it locally, we felt the need to move it to a higher tier repairman so that we could offer the best service on your watch. Your response was that you had someone in Georgia who has worked on it before and could put the back on with the gasket, no problem. You seemed as if it was no problem and we assumed that was the case.\n\nIt appears that there your repairman in Georgia saw a similar issue that we did - that there was still a problem.   Our repairmen would have had no issue providing the service that was needed to complete the task but I understand that you didn\u2019t feel comfortable with us taking care of the problem for you further. I\u2019m sorry you felt that way.  We certainly do everything we can to provide a level of service that makes people feel comfortable with allowing us to take care of them from start to finish. I believe, as you can see by the reviews, that we have always done our part to make things right and offer a service that ends with satisfaction.  While you may have felt uneasy about letting us finish the repair for you, I do not believe we have any type of reviews or history that would warrant that feeling from you. Instead, I believe it\u2019s just the opposite - that we have a proven record (shown on reviews) of making sure all of our customers are fully satisfied and we work hard to maintain this level of service.\n\nEither way, we are sorry you were unable to do business with us and see our service through to the end. But we wish you all the best."}, "gmap_id": "0x888bb172c55c3801:0xdc319865b7fa1df6"}

I had a loose diamond that I wanted to incorporate into a unique engagement ring. I work in Atlanta, so I decided to visit a well known jewelry designer in Buckhead. She was very knowledgeable, but had her own idea for the ring, and didn\u2019t seem to listen to what I wanted.  Frustrated and disappointed after our third meeting, I decided to scrap the whole project.\n\nWhen explaining the bad experience to a friend, she mentioned that Terry had recently designed an engagement ring for a relative which turned out beautifully. Since I live in Oxford, I figured I didn\u2019t have anything to lose so I dropped in one day to check it out. During our first meeting, Terry really took the time to listen to me, made notes and offered suggestions when I asked for them.\n\nOver the course of the design process, I completely changed what I wanted, but Terry and Amanda were very patient and encouraging. When I decided that I wanted side stones, they arranged to bring in three sets for me to view with my diamond to find the perfect match.  After I received the original CAD rendering, I realized that there were a few things that I wanted to change. Each suggestion was promptly incorporated into the design and a new CAD rendering sent.\n\nI was able to pick up my finished ring on Christmas Eve, and it was more stunning than I had ever imagined. Even though this was a custom design that involved a lot of personal service, the price for the setting was very reasonable.  I have worked with various jewelers on other projects and I can say without a doubt that Terry and Amanda\u2019s design capabilities and professionalism are the best I\u2019ve experienced. Thank you guys for a beautiful, one-of-a-kind ring!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1592333188435, "text": "Michelle thank you!  I hope you're enjoying that beautiful ring!

I took it, along with the wedding bands she & dad wore, and her \"lucky\" ring. (The \"lucky ring\" was found on a trip to PCB some 25-30yrs ago. She spotted something shiny in the water and fished it out.) They took all the gold from the rings, plus some old necklaces and earrings, in as trade, and actually gave me $ back!

Much closer than Atlanta or Birmingham.  Amanda our diamond consultant was INCREDIBLE!!!   She has an awesome personality and was so patient with listening to our needs and wants.   Amanda\u2019s knowledge was also helpful.  We ended up special ordering my ring and could not be happier. Just WOW! LOVE IT!  The Oweners were there as well and adds the nice family atmosphere.   I think it is important to support small local businesses, but We got to do this and get the best service and quality we were looking for.  Their prices and customer service are not beatable.

I was told that the shop would stand behind the ring and wrote the details about the ring on my receipt that they would guarantee.\n\nThe next day I went to a local jewelry store to see what kind of deal I got.  Man was I surprised - I not only got a confirmation of the details of the ring were 100% correct - I was told that the ring was worth 5 times what I paid for it......I couldn't have been happier.\n\nTo know that I got a great deal on a great piece of jewelry alone would bring me back to this store.
