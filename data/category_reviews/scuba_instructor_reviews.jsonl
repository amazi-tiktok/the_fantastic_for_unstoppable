Visited with a small group earlier this month and was frustrated from the moment we parked. The man running the shop is clearly up charging for anything he can - $5 for a by standee to sit and \u201cbubble watch\u201d.\n\nThe rental shop itsself was a disaster from an organization, cleanliness and customer service standpoint. Thousands of dollars of expensive equipment thrown into the floor and in poor condition. I had the wonderful experience of using the restroom which clearly has never been cleaned. I knocked ants off of the toilet paper to use it. When I made a passing comment about the conditions of the shop and equipment, the man at the front desk stated \u201cyou don\u2019t dive in the shop\u201d.... doesn\u2019t matter. This is still a representation of you and how you run your business!\n\nWhen turning the overpriced and outdated equipment back in, the owner had the audacity to ask if we called the regs and if we didn\u2019t, that they would have been damaged in the rinse process. I assume the only way his equipment stays somewhat in tact is if his customers provide care for it rather than himself. Pictures have been added to google for support. Needless to say, we won\u2019t be back!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a47c3aa55ff3f:0x23c3dcc1cefe9d8"}

There are several platforms and a lot to see. There are concrete statues, beautiful large koi fish, massive boulders, aircraft all well within open water certification limits.
