The family that runs it is really nice, too.  The menu is pretty small but they seem to put effort into everything they sell.  Case in point, the roast beef is tender and the gravy homemade.  That same gravy graces the Glory Fries, and they are a savory alternative to sad regular fries.  Speaking of which, the fries here are not \u201cregular\u201d at all!  They are some sort of unusual ribbon cut that\u2019s folded almost in half.  It\u2019s a design that maximizes the outer crunch while preserving the interior\u2019s soft creamy center and holy cow why isn\u2019t everyone making fries this way!?  There are a couple of seasonings you can add to them; I sampled the Cajun one and it\u2019s slightly spicy, but my favorite will always be the Glory Fries since cheese plus gravy = heaven.\n\nThe bread for the po-boys is excellent quality as well.  Too often down here I\u2019ve eaten po-boys where the bread is either incredibly chewy to the point it\u2019s almost inedible, or so heavily toasted it dissolves into crumbs on the first bite.  But not this.  It\u2019s tender on the inside and has just the right light crispness on the exterior.\n\nI\u2019ve also had a cup of the gumbo and it really is some of the best I\u2019ve had anywhere, with several good shrimp and sausage bits in it, plus plenty of rice and a nice red pepper kick that made the spiciest thing I\u2019ve found on the menu so far.\n\nAt the time my family and I dined in, they were testing something in place of the regular coleslaw, that they were calling Swamp Slaw.  It was white corn with tomatoes, cucumbers and a homemade ranch dressing, with light seasoning.  It\u2019s not something I\u2019d want but my family member who tried it absolutely raved about it, since it was so flavorful and out of the ordinary.  She also had onion rings instead of fries and they were a thumbs up from everyone, too.  The onions were sweet and the batter was crisp and crunchy without being messy.\n\nThe other diner in our group had the spicy sausage po-boy and he enjoyed it, but complained that it was not the least bit spicy even by our bland local standards.\n\nWe\u2019ve also had a chance to try the beignets and they are very good, too.  They\u2019re not nearly as big as some of the ones I\u2019ve had elsewhere here or in New Orleans but they are cooked just right, with a fluffy interior and crisp exterior, and of course plenty of powdered sugar.  A fitting end to an excellent meal.\n\nOverall, a really good experience.  It\u2019s not a big place, and it\u2019s definitely out of the way but worth seeking out.  If there\u2019s one complaint to lodge, it\u2019s the lack of a fountain drink dispenser; they only offer bottles of Coke products and Gold Peak tea, which is not ideal.  Still, that\u2019s a minor quibble for what is an otherwise really, really good authentic New Orleans-style po-boy.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1572789786636, "text": "Thank you very much for all of your honesty we greatly appreciate it.

I'm glad cause if I had paid for them the level of disappointment would have been overwhelming.

There was so much grease in the bag and on the food I was afraid to try it!
