I even filled up bottles of their great alkaline water to drink at home! I feel amazing! I have been doing lots of reading about alkaline water, it is so good for you! Everyone there is so knowledgeable. After talking with Missy, Ingrid and Hailey I found that they have a strong health interest and conviction. I'm very impressed and have learned a lot from each one of them.
