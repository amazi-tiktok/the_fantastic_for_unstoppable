I am a very satisfied client and I would highly recommend Mr. Neil to anyone based on my own experience to people needing to file bankruptcy or other legal matters like closing on a home etc.. I didn't know him before I walked into his office. I simply did a web search and he was one of several that came up in the search results. I had already called several Attorneys before I got to him but no one answered at those offices. Not even a receptionist. They all sent me to an answering machines. When I got to Mr. Neil's number he personally answered (that was a good sign) I told him I was nervous about filing bankruptcy due to my financial situation had taken a dive and now I make a lot less than I use to. Yes, I even tried consolidation and refinancing but even with a great credit score of 720 the banks still turned me down because my debt to income was too high which was weird because that's the whole point or refinancing is to get your interest rate cost down so you can keep paying. Plus the government said I owed them $10k in back taxes which forced me into Mr. Neils office. After talking with him, I wasn't nervous anymore. He explained everything so clearly and plainly that even a bird-brain could understand. I learned more in 30 minutes from Mr. Neil than I did from several weeks of internet research. I came in his office thinking (incorrectly) that I would be filing chapter 13 because I wanted to keep all my valuables requiring me to make 5 years worth of payments to the court. That sucks! I also incorrectly thought I didn't want to file chapter 7 because from my research, I incorrectly concluded they take most of your stuff of value and liquidate it and give the money to the creditors when you file chapter 7. Well, all that turned out to be wrong. Mr. Neil gave me great legal advice informing me that based on my situation, I could actually file chapter 7 and still keep everything including my Turbo Porsche and be completely discharged in 60 days and never have to make any payments to the court. I extended trust to him while hoping I wouldn't regret it and in the end he proved to be ligit. He saved me from 5 years of bankruptcy payments and I kept all my property. Why would anyone in my situation file chapter 13? Answer: They went to the wrong attorney!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862842b2ae7bdff:0x230e37fd810d1e12"}

Our appointments usually last at least 30 minutes, which allows the attorney to go over the legal options that fit the client\u2019s situation, needs, goals, and expectations.  Keeping an open mind when you meet with a lawyer is the best way to get the most out of your meeting.  Coming into that meeting dead-set against an idea is a sure-fire recipe for disaster.  We regret that we were unable to represent Ms. Reynolds, but her goals and expectations were not achievable through the avenue she wanted to pursue. We fight for our clients every day and pride ourselves in making sure our clients receive legal representation and advice that meets and exceeds their expectations, and we feel the rest of our Google reviews strongly reflect this."}, "gmap_id": "0x888e8fb743b18e71:0xf87cceb6fff7808f"}

Half the time, they didn't return phone calls either. Halfway through the 'mediation' I got the distinct feeling that he was working for the other side. He obviously thinks he can make a living by gaining clients, screwing them over, and going on to the next victim. He must be too young and immature to grasp the concept that most people will need an attorney more than ONCE in their lifetime, and if he thinks he can be successful without the benefit of repeat clients, he is delusional. If he was the last attorney on earth, I would never hire him again. My divorce is final; I'm still missing half my belongings; he's promised me a refund twice and never delivered. On top of that, he suggested we file a contempt motion because of the fact that I was not given all the belongings I was entitled to. He didn't mention at the time that he planned on charging me an additional $1500 to do what I'd already paid him to do. In my opinion, the reason all his pictures on FB look like gangster photos is because he is a crook. He will stand there and 'listen' to you, but he is just pretending to hear you.

I was satisfied with the fact that I felt that I got what I paid for. I have used other law firms in the past for things unrelated to a bankruptcy, so I knew in advance what to expect from a competent, experienced and knowledgeable group of attorneys. They have always handled my legal concerns in a timely, professional and competent manner. They even went above and beyond, on more than one occasion, to assist me and did things for me that I really did feel were outside the scope of what I had paid them to do and I even expected to be charged more for their services and would have been happy to pay additionally for the services they provided to me. That is enough to warrant an excellent referral to the point I would be more than happy to recommend them to all of my friends and family, but that's not where their professional services ended. Truthfully what I am more impressed with and what has meant so much to me personally is the fact they have a \"heart\". When you get a letter in the mail that you don't understand and need help deciphering the \"legalese\" you can call and speak to someone like \"Morgan\". She's not just someone answering their phone. You helped me understand what it was that I got in the mail and set up an appointment to speak to attorney the next day. That all wonderful, but what meant the most was that she listened to me, the struggle I have had since the pandemic and how my financial circumstances have worsened. She helped me relax she offered an ear to listen to me and a heart to respond to me, not as just a client of their law firm, but as a human. She gave me kind hearted conversation that's given me the strength to relax until I speak to the attorney tomorrow. That is priceless! I don't know how you can assign a dollar figure for something like that, but it reinforces the opinion that I sought out the best law firm I could find to help me with this matter and \"Morgan\" cemented the opinion to me that I made the right decision. If you need a lawyer to handle your legal affairs, that watches out for your best interest, doesn't charge you again to assist you you when you have additional needs that arise out of your bankruptcy and most importantly to me, has your back and cares about how this is impacting your life and you emotionally, call Brock and Stout. They will take care of you professionally, legally and in my case emotionally when I absolutely needed it the most; you won't regret your decision. I never leave reviews for companies because I am usually so busy. Today \"Morgan\" just went so far out of her way, not just to answer the phone, not just to help interpret the letter I received in the mail, not even to set up a much needed appointment with the attorney; she helped me moby listening and having a heart so I can continue to make it through this very stressful time in my life. In the midst of all my financial struggles and hardship God has a plan and I know that calling Brock and Stout was part of that plan.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1589423145362, "text": "It has been our pleasure to help you.

When I was faced with mine in 2019, I was referred to Dani Bone through a coworker and friend that I trusted. I initially hired Dani because I heard he was the very best and he would fight for me. I called and even though they were extremely busy, they saw me right away. After hearing my situation, Dani was honest with me and said, \"You need Sam. \" My case was very complicated having both personal and business issues, assets and properties to divide, custody and other court issues . Sam took it as a challenge. He stayed with me and guided me through the whole divorce process. It was not easy, it was extremely tough but Sam knew how to handle every situation that came up. When going through a 2 yr battle, you need to know and  feel confident that your attorney has your back and has your best interest at heart. I emotionally fell apart many times and he helped me to learn to stand up for myself and it made me a stronger person through this process. All I wanted was what was fair- he got me exactly what I asked for! I was extremly pleased with services of Sam, Dani and their dedicated and caring staff. Amanda, Fredrick and Osha were just wonderful to work with. The whole staff made me feel comfortable and at ease through a very uncomfortable life circumstance.  While the other party had 5 attorneys through the process , I had one.  I only needed the one team- I had The Best with Sam & Dani Bone. Sam was honest, upfront, bold and encouraging. He never had to be ugly or raise his voice in court or trial and never once belittled anyone. I recall him saying, \"It doesn't have to be ugly\". Being a Christian, a professional, a self employed woman, a Realtor and a mother of 2, this was imperative to me. Sam treated both parties with total RESPECT always . That was very important to me.  I did my part and provided the true facts, evidence and proof- he did his part and presented my case with true professionalism , Integrity and no one was disrespected in the process. I would \ud83d\udcaf percent recommend Sam & Dani Bone if you want to be represented by someone who will always have your back and is not afraid to fight for your best interest.

Sam will be honest about your case, talk with you about the possibilities, and develop a plan to protect your best interests. Phone calls/emails are answered promptly and you are made aware of appointments and court actions. Even though my case was regular family law issues, it was treated as a priority.\n\nWhen emotions run high and people play dirty, you need an attorney that will keep you focused. It was nothing short of a blessing to have Sam\u2019s counsel during this time. Sam will listen and use what will benefit your case most, helping you to make the best decisions.\n\nThrough my experience, I learned that Sam is wise beyond his years and holds a unique combination of qualities that make him an excellent attorney. He is a younger lawyer in comparison to many of the veterans in the area, but his expertise speaks through shrewd discernment, both in and outside the courtroom.\n\nIn retrospect, I know that employing a professional, well-versed attorney who gave honest legal advice was a valuable asset to me. My case only involved family law, but I would recommend Sam Bone in every area that he practices.

I called after court later that afternoon and ask the receptionist which he have Mr. Starkey give me a call I was charged $40 for this call of being displeased  and asking for him to give me a call and she said we're not able to get in contact with him.
