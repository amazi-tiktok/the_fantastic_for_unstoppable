Then I came home to find that the grate to catch water coming off the sidewalk was about 1 and a half to 2 inches away from the sidewalk, requiring the water to run over dirt before entering the grate.  The owner tried to tell me that it would be no problem and the bare dirt would not erode despite water constantly running over it.  I insisted that concrete be put between the sidewalk and grate to keep the water from washing out the dirt.  When I came home, I found they had used a type of caulk between the grate and the sidewalk, and had done a messy job of it, I don't know if that much caulk will ever cure.  After two days it is still soft.  Additionally, where they cut through the curb, the re-concreting was extremely poorly done.  It looked like they didn't even use a trowel, much less a curbing tool.  It looked like they basically packed the concrete on with their fingers and left it.  Part of the contract called for doing a brick border along the sidewalk.  After I paid them for the portion of the contract for the drainage, they informed me that they were waking away from the contract and that I needed to find someone else to do the edging.  The pity is, the subcontractor they had lined up to do the masonry work actually sounded very competent.  Bottom line, this is a company that, in my opinion, cut corners at every opportunity, poorly designed the project, provided shoddy workmanship, and then walked away with nearly half of the contracted work unperformed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626519de7ef85b:0x4b6cae1b92594858"}

I contracted with them to do drainage work, a sprinkler system and landscape lighting.\n\nI was told this would take 3 weeks to complete, with each phase occurring on consecutive weeks. The project as a whole took almost 12 weeks to complete, and this was only because I hounded them with calls multiple times per week.\n\nThe drainage work was the first part, it seemed to be fine, though the French drain was not placed the complete length that was discussed originally. Also the fingers of river rich were put in to stop erosion, but almost no grass seed was put in afterwards, so nothing but weeds grew in between the river rock.\n\nThe second piece was the sprinkler system. This was put in during a day, but the ground was not backfilled properly and they needed to come back out to fix it. We were told that they would put down grass seed after the lighting job was completed. The lighting work was not completed for another 8 weeks, and there wasn\u2019t any seed put down afterwards. They were also supposed to aerate and oversees the lawn, but since they could not get their mower into our backyard, they told us they would come back with a smaller mower to pull the aerator later. This never happened.\n\nI had to call them 2-3 times a week for 8 weeks to get them to complete the lighting. Part of it was landscape lighting, the other portion was putting in a fan and spotlight in/on our screened patio. The wiring was placed so shallow, that it came out of the ground within a week and they had to come back to fix. The light and fan was supposed to be put in by an electrician, but was just put in by the owner and his friend. They put a cheap conduit over the electrical wire that didn\u2019t even cover the wire.  They sent an electrician out to fix the wiring, but he just rigged another kind of conduit on the bare wire to cover it up.  The uplighting for the trees was sold to us at $65 a light. I just found the lights online for $45 for a 4-pack of lights.\n\nWe just gave up with this company and figured we would just be stuck with this work. Over the last year, I kept burying and covering up the wire as it came out of the ground and have been trying to repair the grass in the area where they did sprinkler and drainage work. We are still fighting massive weeds from the lack of follow through on planting grass after their work was completed.\n\nI am writing this review today after I just finished replacing 3 lights that stopped working and half of the wiring that was put in for the landscape lights. Turns out they believe that wire nuts are not necessary and you only need to tape wires together with electrical tape before putting it in the ground.\n\nIf you are looking for a company to do landscaping work for you, stay very far away from this company. You will only be sorry if you choose them.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1533529694432, "text": "Thank you for bringing all of this to our attention.  Unfortunately scheduling can be a challenge when dealing with different elements and sometimes issues arise.  For example the drainage was delayed due to an unmarked water pipe, flooding the drainage trenches.   The ceiling fan was installed by a certified electrician, as was the wiring for the fan, flood lights and outdoor switch.  We would be more than happy to provide the name of the electricians that provided these services.   The contract states that there is a year warranty covering defects in workmanship and materials.   Is regrettable that we did not have the opportunity to fix the issues that you were having with your lights, thus alleviating some of your frustration.

We love it so much we have actually had 3 separate installations already - one for our trees, another for our sidewalk areas, and the last to highlight our front yard and house. It's really given our entire property a \"resort\" type of feeling and added so much to the enjoyment we experience.Visitors constantly comment on the lighting / vibe in general when coming over in the evening, too which has been a total plus. It's been a GAME CHANGER for us and worth every penny.\n\nOur experience with Cliff has been so phenomenal.

I actually interviewed 8 people about the landscape lights, and found Cliff to be by far the most professional, on time, and highest quality company in the North Alabama area. There are SO many people who can install a light for you...don't fall into that trap. The difference between that and what you will get with Cliff and team is the QUALITY. Your house won't be lit up like a 7/11 quickstop with \"cheap\"   light quality. Cliff gives a great deal of consideration for the shadows, angles, and fixture placements. The lighting is very strategic and intentionally placed, similar to what you would see at a 5 star resort.\n\nI am telling you, if you are looking for landscape, tree, area, house, or any exterior lighting, don't look any further than Cliff and team!! You won't regret it, I can promise you that!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1590708821165, "text": "You are AWESOME! Thank you so much for your kind words!

So, what a wonderful surprise when I came home - a beautiful, subtly lit landscape that makes me feel safer and more secure on my own property. When I installed a bubble rock for all my wild birds, Cliff designed lighting in the trees directed to the bubble rock, so that at night it looks like it is lit by the moon!  Recently, I had some construction done and they were a bit careless with my landscape lighting, damaging many of my lights. When I notified Cliff, he had someone in to repair the work within 48 hours, reestablishing my lighting and restoring my sense of security.

They did an outstanding job with the design and installation of my landscape lighting. Cliff and his team were extremely professional from beginning to completion and kept me informed throughout the entire process. I contacted Landscape Lighting by PRO-CUT on a Friday and to my surprise I received a response later that day stating I would be contacted early the following week to set up a consultation to review my needs. The following week I was promptly called as promised and an appointment was set up for the following day. Cliff showed up when he said he would ON TIME and looked over my landscape, he gave me several options to choose from and did not try to upsell me on anything I didn\u2019t want or need or the most expensive option. He listened to exactly what I wanted and made very professional recommendations for the look that I was chasing. Once the options were presented, I identified what I wanted, and he got me on the schedule. He informed me that he had a few jobs before me and that it would be a few weeks weather dependent on when they would get me installed. Cliffs professionalism and consideration to my schedule at this point already far exceeded my expectation. On the week of my installation, I was contacted a few days prior to inform me that he would have a crew out on my lawn to start my install and this required nothing from me but more of a courtesy. WOW! Customer service and courtesy again on point. His guys showed up as stated he got the job done over the course of a few days which was quick considering the inclement weather going on that week. The design was as stated, he used quality fixtures that complimented the stonework on my home and added a sophisticated ambiance to my landscape. Once the install was complete, they went above and beyond to ensure that my yard was left just as they found it if not better. Once the installation was complete Cliff returned in the nighttime hours to verify that everything was working properly and to further finetune the placement of the lights, not necessary but just another testament to the professionalism of this company and the degree of work that they perform. At this time, he also gave me the opportunity to go over the operation of the lighting and because I was not present, he explained it to me over the phone. I am beyond satisfied with the finished product and I can tell that my neighbors are as well. The prices were in my opinion incredibly reasonable for what they provide, and the quality of work is second to none. If you too want to give your yard that WOW factor, I highly recommend the services of Cliff and his team at Landscape Lighting by PRO-CUT. They provide great pricing and great results.

They laid new sod and it looked like a picture from Home and Garden magazine.\n\nThrough the years I have visited my brother and his family and he\u2019d take me on job sites with him. I was amazed to see the complexity of installs he was undertaking. The attention to detail David gives to each install is second to none. I could write a few pages just on that subject.

Offering fountains, fish ponds, fish of course and swimming pools from the store, has only broadened the DSLD complete landscape portfolio.\n\nI have to tip my hat to my brother and his team of professionals. His sons Zachary, Miles and Cole play a major part in this well oiled machine as they each have a part in most every install. They are dependable, punctual and treat each job as if it were being installed on their property.\n\nRather you have DSLD perform their expertise on your yard or not, you have to admire how far they have come.\n\nWishing you all continued success!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88893e19213388e5:0xeb3f3999b720c596"}

This review is coming at the end of the only season where I used Superior. Throughout the year I wasn't impressed with the invasive weeds that continued to sprawl in the back yard. Normally I was not home when the service was rendered, but one time I stop the person doing the application. He was rather dismissive and said they would get taken care in the future weed control applications. I am not a professional lawn person(hence the reason I pay them)so I had to assume he was telling the truth.\n\nToday, I was home when he came to do the final application. The truck was out front for less than 10 minutes. I have a reasonable sized lawn, front and back and a very difficult gate latch to contend with. There is a zero percent chance that he would have been able to disembark the truck, prep his application material, mange the gate, do a proper back yard treatment, latch the finicky gate latch, do the front and tag my door in that amount of time.  Suddenly then it clicked, this is likely why the back looks terrible - other than the one time I was here with the gate open, the work has never actually been done. (Included below crab grass photos taken today - after $432 in applications you should not see an increase in the amount of weeds - these patches are 2x what they were in the spring.)\n\nIt is evident that Superior does not instill in their employees a sense of pride in their work. I've had the same person so all the applications and a reputable business would develop a culture of doing the right thing. The application person should be invested enough to actually correct the problems a customer and ask for support if needed. Clearly this is not the case with Superior. The operations manager had the approach of blaming me for not bringing it to their attention at an earlier time and after consideration, I believe he couldn't be more wrong. If the applications aren't effective, his employee should be responsible and proactive enough to address this internally and find a solution for the customer.  Obviously these are not priorities for their organization.\n\nCaveat emptor.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMy4-LTuRrGXDNNTQpAp8cJeGNZM6R6wv4XCW6a=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMho-gmsg-5oiMvEhcU7dZYQQf60m_tBAUnM0Gp=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88882b00ada4e425:0xca3738802127df8b"}
