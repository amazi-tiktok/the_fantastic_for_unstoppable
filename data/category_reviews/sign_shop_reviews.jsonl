The ATT representative told me they didn\u2019t have a issue so I go back in the store to see if their system was back up. A older lady that I helped in the store before leaving stopped me and said the Caucasian guy behind me earlier had a package he was shipping back to At&t as well.

I asked the representative when I walked back in the store was the system back up, she replied no it\u2019s still down. I asked could she hold my package and ship it when it come back up, she replied they aren\u2019t allowed to do this.\n\nI replied but you just did it for the Caucasian man who was sending a package to At&t to.

I even have my own personal Fed Ex account.  However about a year ago Fed Ex must have brought in a new female day manager or supervisor and she behaves like a shrew.  I was believe her name was Helen.  She misquotes Fed Ex's shipping policy and refuses to use \"banker's\" boxes and other good boxes that are actually more sturdy than she sells at that outlet. She says it is FedEx's policy and I have since found out - it is not FedEx policy, but may be the individual store policy.  But she says it is FedEx policy.  However, she is most loud and belligerent and actually refuses to ship unless in boxes \"like she sells\" and pulls off the shelf \"because Fed Ex will no longer accept those boxes\".  Not true.  She won't accept the boxes.  She claims my boxes are not as sturdy (not true) and it is FED EX's policy not to accept those boxes.  Not true.  I've checked Fed Ex's shipping and packing policies and my boxes are very acceptable...and they are more sturdy than the boxes she is trying to force me to buy.  I will no longer ship there but ship through my work and have the charges deducted form my payroll.  Fed Ex is happy to pick up my boxes at my work without trying to make me buy boxes from Fed Ex.  My work place ships many boxes like my boxes (that's where I get my boxes) without any problem.  Someone needs to retrain or terminate the weekday supervisor or manager at this office.  I have read of many complaints about the personnel at FedEx-Kinko locations since Kinko and Fed Ex combined their locations.  I will not go back to this location with Helen there.  When I can't use my work place for shipping (as when the boxes too heavy for me to take in), I have driven 35 miles round trip to drop off my boxes elsewhere instead of dealing with this unpleasant person...what a shrew.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b9130ca25b5:0x5bd40fa6ae8c11d"}

But when I called him on a Wednesday trying to get my Tesla done for a Saturday show, he made it happen, despite being booked solid. I dropped her off at 5 on Thursday and he rolled it in to get started that night, and the next morning the job was done.\nNot only does it look AMAZING, but I'm running my AC a good 10 degrees warmer to achieve the same comfort. These brutal summer days were pushing it to the limit, even with a fresh recharge, but now I can actually set it to the temp I want and it'll get there instead of struggling. So, not just a great aesthetic improvement, but a real boost to efficiency, meaning I can drive farther on a charge and spend less overall. I'd go back in a heartbeat, and I'd recommend him to anyone I know as well.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626887a92b74ed:0xd7059ad52757ca70"}

From the start, I was uneasy about the experience, but I went ahead with it. Huge mistake. I drove by today and a woman who said she was the owner's friend and acting manager waited on me. I asked her to inspect my car to put tint on the driver and passenger windows only. She inspected them and we agreed on a tint grade and a price. Then I walked down the street to the library to wait. About an hour later I decided to head back, and got a call from the manager on my way. She was agitated, and demanded to know if the car had ever had tint on it before. I replied that it may have, I bought it used. She said that they had already started applying tint to one window when they discovered that there was residue from old tint below the window sill. When I got back to the shop, the manager was in a frenzy. She pointed out the residue, and kept going on about how they had \"wasted $50 worth of tint\". I remained calm and asked them to finish the job. She said they would have to charge me $10 per window extra as a cleanup fee. I refused, saying it was their mistake and they should have inspected the windows more closely before starting (they are the experts, after all). She became very upset and began to shout, again blaming it on me for not telling her about the residue (which, again, was below the windowsill line and not visible). I stood my ground and insisted that it's not my job to know everything, that's why I brought it to a professional. She blew up, began to curse, shout, and refused to look at me in the eye. She shouted at the tint specialist to reassemble my car and send me away. I knew it would cost me even more at another tint shop to have them clean up the messed up tint that was already on my window from Tint Spectrum, so I reluctantly asked the tint specialist what it would take to get the job done right and get be out. He said it would take another $20, so I agreed to pay it. This time, I sat down in the shop and watched them the entire time. I'm not a tint expert by any means, but in my humble opinion, neither are these guys. One of them (who I later found out was the owner) was eating pizza over the hood of my car and asking me whether it was pink or red (it's obviously red). The tint specialist who was working on my car had to rip the tint from the passenger's window, replace it, install tint on the driver's side, rip it off and replace it, and then replace the tint on the passenger's side AGAIN. I'm not sure what he kept messing up, but if each one of those sheets was $50 worth of tint, he easily wasted over $200 worth. The manager continued to stomp around the shop shouting and cursing. The owner didn't seem to care. The tint specialist left lart \"3M\" logos on my window's right in the middle. The manager asked me if I wanted those removed (who in the world would WANT 3M logos in the middle of their window?).\n\nWhen it was all said and done, my final bill was $140 before tax, which was $20 higher than agreed upon earlier that morning due to absolutely no fault of my own. The manager remained rude and loud the entire time, and I must have waited in the shop for well over an hour after I got back from the library. The manager offered no apology other than something about \"didn't mean to snap earlier\". I don't think there is anything in the world that could make me go back to this place or recommend it. The manager is rude, loud, inappropriate and unfair. The staff are very slow, appear to be outrageously incompetent, and are all dirty on top of that (the tint specialist kept spitting tobacco juice on the ground right behind my car). The owner didn't seem to care about anything. I think the quality of the tint is good, since it's 3M. But the service and the installation quality were absolutely not even worth the one star I am forced to grant them. Do not take your car to this place. You will regret it, especially if you have to deal with the manager.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889293004402c64d:0x5a3bd58c8045da98"}

The so-called co-owner, Pauline I believe her name is, took it upon herself to take on my order. I was in charge of the decorations for my 20-year high school reunion, and one of my tasks was to have posters made from our old year book to set up for a display. I figured Fastsigns would be the place to go since they specialize in that type of work. I was assured that the posters would be of high quality and on time. However, when I came in to pick up my posters, they weren\u2019t even ready and were horribly distorted. I was very perturbed to find this out seeing as how I was spending over $300.00 on these posters. Pauline, who was in charge, wouldn\u2019t even personally confront me about this issue, she had one of her employees who was more helpful than Pauline was, bare the grunt. Pauline was also unprofessional as I saw her talk down to one of her employees and treated her poorly right in front of me!

This story takes place in the relatively small parking lot of the hotel I am staying in.\n\nBefore we get started though, know that I tried to resolve this issue directly with the company. The responses I received from them began with a man named \"Andrew\" responding to my initial email with \"who the heck is this\".\n\nIn the attached pictures you will see what their workers did. Things the company clearly considers acceptable, because their attitude towards the situation was condescending at best.\n\nThing #1: You'll see 3 trailers here. One is a different company, one is Scott's Services (the middle one) and one is unmarked. It's not easy to see how many spots they are taking up, but at least 6.\n\nThe drivers were there, and were aware of the problems they were causing. People were actively driving around the lot trying to find parking spots. You can also see the company name on the truck here.\n\nThere is another truck here that is apparently also theirs. After the front desk agent of the hotel asked them to stop blocking parking spaces, they refused, claiming they were stuck. After the agent left they had a good laugh about it, and then moved into the unmarked truck.\n\nThing #2: This is the other side of the parking lot. Another of their vehicles. A much smaller vehicle. One capable of fitting into a single space, and yet they managed to take up two with this one as well. Surely this truck was not stuck as well. What stopped them from fixing this one and freeing up a space?\n\nUpon reporting this behavior to the company, I was told by the person named Andrew that I had a personal problem, and that the hotel should deal with the issue if they feel they need to. I should also stop trying to get hard working people in trouble just because I cannot park where I want. Because everyone knows only Scott's Services' workers are hard working - none of the other patrons of the hotel they inconvenienced were hard working people as well.\n\nIn the adult world we do not get \"in trouble\"; We get held accountable for our actions. The company's refusal to hold their employees accountable for their behavior is a clear declaration that the behavior is condoned by the company, and that these actions accurately reflect the values of Scott's Services.\n\nConsider these things when you consider working with them. This is how they might choose to behave.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNotWXTHDswMaStIri7oO1KYTHcdDg-iMZM7EcH=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIccL5azPhSQVorayMuH0fSQ-MeP3tLWdwfrfu=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYlAUxH76tGUHIMWgqp0OIhoIpA1rtx96Fa9j5=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890d91da79e17f:0xb7995bed26179105"}
