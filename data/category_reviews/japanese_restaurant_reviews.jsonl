It was failure after failure, and I have never before been subjected to such poor customer service.  That\u2019s the short version.\n\nThis is the full story. I ordered (and paid for) delivery from Asian Rim through Yelp Eat24 and, after waiting an hour and a half without getting any food or as much as a phone call, I called the restaurant directly to ask when I could expect my meal. I was informed by Colton that there was no order because they don\u2019t associate with Yelp Eat24 at all. Understandably, this freaked me out and lead me to believe I had been scammed. I then called Yelp Eat24 and demanded a refund after telling them what Colton had said. While they did quickly offer a me a refund (which \u2013side note-- I won\u2019t be getting for \u201cup to 5 business days\u201d), they were adamant that they did in fact work with Asian Rim and that their restaurant had actually already confirmed the order before I had called. I was still falsely placing my faith in Asian Rim at this time.\n\nAfter hanging up with Yelp Eat24, I hurriedly called my bank to inform them that I might have falsely been charged. All of this was quite time consuming and anxiety inducing. On a whim, I decided to call Asian Rim back again and relay to them the information I had been given by the representative at Yelp Eat24 for their own benefit. That\u2019s when Colton then informed me that they did actually work with Yelp Eat24 after all. He just hadn\u2019t known a third party, Backdoor, was also involved and it was their name coming up in his system. He unapologetically told me the food I had originally ordered would be at my house shortly.\n\nBut was it? No. So after even more time elapsed, I called Asian Rim a third time to ask what was going on. I was told by a different person that I should \u201cjust try calling Backdoor.\u201d I had to flat out demand to be told if the food had at least left Asian Rim yet. She finally said \u201cyeah.\u201d No apologies were given and I was rushed off the phone.\n\nThen I called Backdoor and was told that they did pick up the food from Asian Rim, but then realized the order had been cancelled. Aside from the refund Yelp Eat24 says they will give me, no other amends have even been attempted to be made. To reiterate-- his whole ordeal lasted about 3 hours from the time I placed and paid for the order to the time I was definitively told that there was no food coming. To say this place, and Colton specifically, handled this poorly is an understatement. I adamantly advise everyone reading this to refrain from ordering from Asian Rim.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889179da3445e5b:0x39c8686e22b7dc4c"}

No problem, that's on us. They arrive within 10 minutes and we let the host know we're good to go. She says they're just waiting on a table to be cleared. We wait 20 minutes outside and check back.

We wait another 20 minutes, and are finally seated. The grill they take us to is not set for 12, and the other side of it hasn't been cleared. We grab some extra chairs and plates ourselves, and wait again. 15 minutes goes by and we still haven't been approached by anyone for drinks or anything. I go to the counter and ask if we even have a waitress. She asks, \"a waitress? let me go check\". I sit back down at our table. Another 10 minutes goes by. at this point we called a restaurant down the street to see if they could quickly accommodate us and they said to come on over. As we are leaving, a member in our party asked to speak to a manager. THEY REFUSED TO COME OUT AND TALK TO US! They said they didn't want to deal with it. I'm sorry, but are you Freaking kidding me!?

The girl on the phone asked if we wanted a grill, and I asked if we could fit 12 people at a grill, she said yes.\nWe arrive just before 6 and let them know we are waiting on 2 people from our party, as they wouldn't seat us until everyone arrived. No problem, that's on us. They arrive within 10 minutes and we let the host know we're good to go. She says they're just waiting on a table to be cleared. We wait 20 minutes outside and check back. The 3 hosts are arguing with each other and no one seems to know what is going on. there are two open grills, but they are waiting on a party to finish eating to seat us there. We wait another 20 minutes, and are finally seated. The grill they take us to is not set for 12, and the other side of it hasn't been cleared. We grab some extra chairs and plates ourselves, and wait again. 15 minutes goes by and we still haven't been approached by anyone for drinks or anything. I go to the counter and ask if we even have a waitress. She asks, \"a waitress? let me go check\". I sit back down at our table. Another 10 minutes goes by. at this point we called a restaurant down the street to see if they could quickly accommodate us and they said to come on over. As we are leaving, a member in our party asked to speak to a manager. THEY REFUSED TO COME OUT AND TALK TO US! They said they didn't want to deal with it. I'm sorry, but are you Freaking kidding me!? You lost out on a $800+ tab for the night We waited well over an hour past our reservation time and had the WORST service imaginable. I felt embarrassed for even making our friends deal with all of that. I will never give this place my business again.

Great place for couples or friends. Good place to eat in Columbus!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccb44b2e9a50d:0x2f342cb678860a06"}

Let it slide, not that big a deal. She walks me to a table and needs to wipe it down. Sigh. Then she hands us 1 menu, so the three of us take turns.\n\nIt took nearly 15 minutes to get our drinks. And when the server came, he brought the 2 sodas, and claimed they were \u201cstill pouring\u201d my beer. What? Oh well, we did need extra time since all three of us had to take turns with the one menu they gave us.\n\nIt was at this point we started to realize we weren\u2019t cooling off from being outside. This place is warm, and the flare ups from the grill weren\u2019t helping. Seems the owners are trying to cut down on the electricity bill by turning the AC to \u201cvent\u201d.\n\nThere were no napkins at the table, nor any utensils. When we asked for them, he just walked over to another table and grabbed one napkin that had a fork inside. I guess the three of us can share a napkin?\n\nYou would expect this if the place was super busy and they were short staffed. There were a few servers clearly with nothing to do. The table side wasn\u2019t even half filled, and we were one of two tables that weren\u2019t already eating. The grill side was very busy, but again, if this were the problem, why are there 4 servers just standing around by the sushi bar flapping their gums?\n\nI order a refill on the beer just as the first arrives. You know, because it won\u2019t take me 15 minutes to polish off a half pint. Our food didn\u2019t take very long, about as long as it took for our drinks. The refill on my beer was nearly instantaneous. Things are looking up.\n\nI had to ask for my menu when my food came. The description and what I got didn\u2019t seem to match up. It didn\u2019t. Okay. Fortunately the chicken katsu I got was essentially a plate filled with chicken, so it wasn\u2019t like they were skimping on the meat, just the sides. It was very good. The other two ordered ramen. Ramen is not their specialty, apparently. Make some instant ramen at home, pour in some sesame oil, and top it with some chives and your protein of choice... you will do as well as they did. The ramen was also as expensive as a bowl of top notch ramen at a ramen shop - if you are going to charge high dollar for a bowl of ramen, do it right. We got a side of steak... very good. It was the hit of the table. The sushi we had was also good, and I felt it was fresh and reasonably priced - more so for us because this place offers a military discount.\n\nThe next time we see our server is when we are all finished. With our sides, our food, and our drinks. I\u2019m Not one for servers being pests, but stop by for a refill every once in a while. I didn\u2019t want to complain, I just wanted out. By this point I am sweating from the heat and just want to get in my car so I can blast the AC.\n\nOverall, the service was the kicker for me. I think all the talent is working the grill side of the house, and may even try that someday. But the table side was irritating.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccb44b2e9a50d:0x2f342cb678860a06"}

We sat with a group of ladies and a small child. In my group it was my husband, our two children (5&3months), and myself. One lady from the other group ordered some type of sushi, which was completely raw when brought out. Nothing out of the norm except she thought it would be fried.  She declined the dish and didn't want to be charged. The waitress then had the manager come out to our table and told the lady she would have to pay for the dish since it was ordered. The lady began to state that she wasn't going to pay for something that she didn't eat. They exchanged some words at the table. I couldn't help but to overhear since I was the closest to the other group. The manager then said she was tired or \"you people\". Not sure how to take that. Did she mean \"you people\" as in trouble, or \"you people\" as in trying to get out of paying, or did she mean \"you people\" as in black? About this time I was thinking oh heck this is about to get real. The lady in the group then said something in the line of \"you people\" back to the manager. Now mind you this manager is at our table yelling back and forth with this customer while all her customers are watching things unfold. The poor guy cooking is trying to cook our food and get the heck out of the way. Everyone around has stopped enjoying their dinner and watching this as a spectator sport. The customer said just give me my bill for my drink and I will leave. Case closed you would think.....nope! The manager then walked off and and I do believe the customer at this point said something about the managers attitude and how it was disrespectful. Next thing I  know the manager threw the plate of sushi at the wall and started yelling back at the customer. A waitress then put her arm around the waist of the manager in an attempt to hold her back. Somehow the manager became free and decided to come stand over my children at the table and get into a yelling match with this customer who was still sitting in her chair at our table. The manager at that time bumped into my childs car seat that was sitting atop of a highchair. I finally had enough and was worried about the saftey of my children and told them that this was enough and if she knocked my childs carseat one more time it would be over. Mama bear had enough. At this time my husband had removed himself from his seat and told the manager to leave from standing behind our children. Finally the customer left. The manager never once came\nback to apologize after 20 minutes my husband had to track down the waitress to refill our drinks that were completely empty. After paying we stopped by the desk to speak with the manager about how unprofessional this was, especially in front of our children. The manager just looked at us like we were wrong. I just told my husband to come on and lets head home it isn't worth it anymore. The manager and two male employees then said something in their native tongue and started laughing. This place if very unprofessional. The sushi was what, about 12 dollars. This could have been handled better by the customer and the manager! Not worth it!!!!

Since I asked for my filet to be cooked rare, I was given my rice & steak first, while everyone else at the grill sat there drooling, wondering why they didn't have one morsel of food on their plate. The vegetables didn't show up till the very last minute. We asked to talk to a manager & her only comment was can they make us something to go. REALLY lady???
