We took my car to them and they had it 4 days.  Finally after a lot of phone calls they said it was done.  It tried to sync my phone and it did but no sound out of the speakers.  They couldn't figure out the problem so the installer promised he'd call the manufacturer Monday morning and call me.  No phone call.  I called him and got his voice mail.  No return call.  I called the shop and was told they would call as soon as he got in .  No call.  I also called Sirus to have that transferred from my other radio but they didn't hook it up.  So here I sit with a very expensive radio and CD player.  At this point the ball is in their court and I'm waiting to see what they do.

They half installed the speakers. The volume controls were not ran and the speakers were not set up for his car stereo settings. When we got home we had to work on it for an HOUR ourselves to get them to work properly. The volume controls are now in the back of my sons car where he cannot get to them to adjust them as he\u2019s driving. he has to pull over to adjust his bass now. The underglow lights didn\u2019t work from day one with the app. They would turn on, But the app never controlled the lights properly. Blue would be red for example. Maybe sometimes. Purple would be green sometimes. red and blue under lights are illegal. So he has NO idea what color he\u2019s getting from inside the car. He again, has to pull over to poke around on colors in the app to get a color he wants. And last week in the freezing rain countrywide freeze, he had to stand 20 minutes in that rain to even get them to turn off because the app is so faulty. Now, 3 of the 4 sides dont even work at all. They\u2019re unable to be turned on at all. First week one light went out. Now, a month later, 3 are Completely out and not functioning. They quoted him at $150 and charged him $240. We filed a claim with BBB and they refused to refund. By the way, you guys should look them up on BBB. Their business rating and reviews there as well. That\u2019s ok tho because I\u2019ve costed them WAAAAY more than $240. So far I have stopped one adult from going there and 2 of my kids friends from going there and one student that I tutor from going there. Turns out, if you have a LOT of friends and you have junky underglow lights, your friends bring it up everytime they see you. And that means you\u2019re constantly getting to tell EVERYONE about it!!! We are a driving billboard for toy store customs awful work and business ethic. We\u2019ve been able to bring up the store and the horrible work they do MANY times. I have several nephews about to turn 16 and get cars, and they\u2019ve seen what toy store customs has done. This entire circle of friends is into the car scene and modding their cars. So I will continue to send them somewhere else in fort payne. A great shop we\u2019ve found. So Toy store customs denied a $240 refund (even if we took the lights back to them) and it\u2019s costing them 10 times that much LOL.

This is my first time hearing them doing sound but not happy with it.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1571689598056, "text": "Tyler thanks for the review. We havent done an event at Hutton and Smith. We do rent gear to other companies in town! Our engineers do freelance with other companies. Sometimes the bands will bring their own engineer and dont have time to tune a rig before they start the gig"}, "gmap_id": "0x8860663ae51502b7:0x6dd351b5ed3b34"}
