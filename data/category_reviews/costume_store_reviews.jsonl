On Saturday October 26, 2019 my 23 year old daughter, my 9 year old daughter, and my 1 year old granddaughter went into this store. After browsing and finding a costume but not all of the needed accessories they left without making a purchase.They returned after visiting another Halloween store to purchase the costume. The manager then accused her of shoplifting and admitted to following them around the store. After my daughter willingly allowed her to look in her purse, finding nothing, the manager still called the police. My daughter stayed and waited on the police asking to see any video showing her shoplifting. The police officer then examined her purse and found nothing.The police officer asked them to leave and said that the manager did not want them to return to the store. I'm a little confused because I did not know that you could be banned from a store for trying to spend money, because my silly daughter was still wanting to purchase the costume.The manager never apologized or admitted to being mistaken, but she did say \"that she know what \"you people\" do and that she was going to jail and told my 9 year old that she and her niece were going to DHR.\" I'm glad that the people that had these great  experiences were not the \"you people\"  that steal. I do not recommend that people of color shop at this store our money is no good there. I GIVE THEM NO STARS, I ACTUALLY NEED 5 OF THEM BACK, BUT THE COMPUTER WANT LET ME POST WITHOUT ONE!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d7051daf501:0xe419cb096c09222d"}

My daughter needed a costume for a school project and every other Costume store was either closed or had a limited childrens selection because it was so far from Halloween season (early march)... I totally forgot until the day before so I didn't have time to order a costume online. I Called maybe a dozen places before I got in touch with these guys. Not only did they help me find something that worked, they had it in stock, and even though I was only buying 60 dollars worth of costumes, they drove over an hour to meet me so that I could get the costume in time for my daughter's school project. Then they drove another hour back. I can't imagine it was worth it monetarily for them to do something like this, but they did it anyway to help out. I can't imagine any other halloween mega store would do something like this...If great customer service and spending your money with a business run by good people means anything to you, I would reccomend you go here for costume/Halloween needs. They deserve your business in my opinion. Much more than your average local/seasonal Halloween chain franchise. 5 stars... will be driving out of my way in the future to shop here.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889cbcde048b04b:0xd8eab5c503cbcf3"}
