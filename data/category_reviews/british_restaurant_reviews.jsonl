When this team was just a food truck and popping around town I liked them, but did not chase them around much. Then they started to throw down some roots in West Homewood...and they have done a marvelous job so far! They do a splendid job of bringing the fun/neat things about London over to Birmingham, AL. (Including the epic double decker red bus which maybe you can eat in?)\n\nAnywho, let's talk about the here and now. They have delightful food, the people are great, and they're putting everything they can into making business work right now; and it's a beautiful/inspiring thing to see. They eventually want it to be a full blown pub (but with all of the pandemic happenings it's kept them from fully realizing the dream yet), but for now it is a beautiful takeout/carryout/to-go restaurant with bakery and other local vendors' goods and more of their own take and prepare at home foods. Check out my photos to help make sense of all of that :)\n\nSo far I've loved:\nBeef Pie\nVegetable Masaman Curry\nChips\nBread Pudding\nMixed Leaf Salad\nChocolate Pie/Tort Thing\nScone with Clotted Cream and Jam\nThe Strawberry Shortbreads are amazing (my family wanted way more)\n(Nuzzi Gelato at least for now I guess)\n\nI'm not really a huge fan of fried fish, but I know other people like it.\n\nI would recommend calling ahead for your order unless you are just wanting to peruse the store for 15-30 minutes while you wait for your food. Or you could just get some of the food yourself from the freezer or fridge and take it home to prepare it. I love the versatility of this place and the resilience they have to do everything they can to try to get this bus rolling in the midst of a pandemic.\n\nTop marks to these chaps.
