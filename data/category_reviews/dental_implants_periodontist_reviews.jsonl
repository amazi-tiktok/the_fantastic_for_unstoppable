Because of this my pain threshold is high so if I say something hurts it really hurts. My previous dental office was aware of this yet the hygienist chose to ignore the pain I was experiencing. After speaking with the office manager I decided I would not complete my appointment and later called back and canceled any further treatment with that practice. I called my insurance company and located the office of a previous dentist that I loved and I am so glad I did. I called Bryant Dental on Bob Wallace and even the interaction over the phone was pleasant. Whitney was able to schedule me an appointment quickly and educated me on the processes and procedures and what to expect. I could hear her smile through the phone. The day of my appointment, the entire staff was absolutely wonderful! As a new patient for the practice I knew I would have paperwork and would probably be there for a while but as soon as I finished my paperwork my hygienist was waiting for me. Chelsey greeted me with smiling eyes (she had on her mask), explained the process in depth and after reviewing my x-rays she recommended the best next step to help with my issues. She listened and made sure to understand what I was experiencing and throughout my appointment she made sure the process was not causing too much pain. With tender swollen gums pain is to be expected however if the hygienist knows what they are doing the patient will experience minimal pain. Chelsey knows what she is doing! She took a potentially mouth throbbing, tears running uncomfortable situation and made it a pleasant and educational experience. I went in with my mouth feeling awful and because of what Chelsey did my teeth feel so much better. Because I am a cancer warrior my teeth and gums have gone through some major changes. Chemo, radiation and long term medication has caused damage that I thought was going to take radical treatment to repair but Chelsey explained how to minimize further damage and what to do to get me on a path of recovery. She was absolutely amazing! I highly recommend Bryant Dental on Bob Wallace, you will not be disappointed.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1621012488256, "text": "Wow to that wonderful review!

They use Transworld System collection agency when Tonya makes a mistake with your treatment plan and tells you your insurance will pay half and you pay the other half ($560) and then it turns out TONYA read it wrong but expects the patient to pay for her mistake you will get turned over to a collection agency! I liked Dr. Bentley and was very disappointed she let her office manager get away with dirty office practices, so I had no other choice but to find another dentist for my son and I. Tonya wouldn\u2019t let me speak to Dr. Bentley she twisted what happened to fit her narrative and let Dr.Bentley think they were doing me a favor by cutting the bill in half when all along Tonya knows this is on her! And she sent a $240 bill to collections on a procedure that wasn\u2019t even done correctly (we were told my son didn\u2019t need a crown turns out he did but because of Tonyas error reading our policy which is her job by the way we never went back to Dr.Bentley after getting a $500 bill in the mail no phone call Tonya knew I would be upset and she knew exactly what she told me) and the tooth had to be extracted after all of that! So NO  I do not recommend you go there! Not because of Dr. Bentley but because you cannot trust Tonya to do your insurance and billing correctly! Do you have an extra $1000.00  laying around when you get a surprise bill from Tonya? When I asked Tonya why she didn\u2019t catch that the insurance wouldn\u2019t cover that procedure she said to me well neither did you! Wow!! Tonya claimed to have gotten an approval for the procedure when all along root canals weren\u2019t covered within the first year of coverage (so that was a lie to cover her mistake) I would have thought an office manager and the person who is supposed to verify insurance would check that first thing!

They followed all safety measures against COVID and I felt very safe. Dr. Lane has a great chairside manner. Very caring and does not rush his exams. He makes recommendations and provides advice on maintaining healthy gums. My hygienist, Kathy, does a terrific job in analyzing my gum health and cleaning my teeth. She does an extensive cleaning and ensures I am comfortable. Staff is friendly and personable. Insurance filings with my primary and secondary insurance usually go without a hitch. If there is an issue, they work hard to resolve. They are good enough to file for me even though they are not a preferred provider with my primary insurance.

I recently cracked a tooth, and I was referred to a local dentist, so I decided to give them a try. Folks, just because someone has a fancy office does not mean that they are a reputable business, at least in my experience. It is not typical of me bad mouthing a local business and I will keep their name out of this review, but they are an embarrassment to the noble profession of dentistry. When I was seen by the hygienist, she responded, \"Oh wow that is bad, you will need to have that tooth extracted immediately\". My initial thought was \"I didn't realize that a hygienist was also a doctor of dentistry\". Then when the dental assistant took the x-rays, her response was identical! What made matters worse the doctor backed up what they said and wanted to extract the tooth right there and then!!! I was concerned and confused so I asked what the cost would be. They brought in the \"closer\" with the three options. Just yank it, yank it and create a cap with a bridge like a denture or the option that I would probably have chosen, yank it and have an implant which would have cost over three thousand dollars, oh, by the way they have a company that will finance.\nThanks, but no thanks!\nSo, I walked out and I waited, maybe too long because I got a bad abscess. Now what do I do?\nI researched and talked to many folks. I decided to give Southern dentistry a try and thank God I did. They got me in the next morning. Everyone that I came in contact with was very professional and friendly. From the receptionist to the dentist. The dental assistant took the x-ray and told me that the doctor will be with me shortly. Most of my experiences with doctors or dentists are that if you have an appointment be prepared to wait an hour or two before someone sees you. I was seen within a few minutes. Dr. Jessica Robinson was great, very professional and to the point and explained everything in detail. She recommended against extracting the tooth. She believed that the tooth can be saved. Her recommendation was to perform a root canal with a crown at a cost of less than a third of what the other dentist recommended! Very short and to the point treatment plan. NO FINANCING NEEDED!\nHow refreshing and what a great place. For once a dentist that understands CUSTOMER SERVICE! I highly recommend Southern dentistry. You will not be disappointed.\nRAVING FAN", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1626896010651, "text": "Thank you"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a42208bd7a8c1:0x31556a24d6a98934"}

{"user_id": "112224890650932522378", "name": "Alyssa Stellmaker", "time": 1624936690983, "rating": 3.0, "text": "This review is in response to a request sent to me after a dental procedure and included a side note that a review of less than 5-stars should be called into the office rather than placed online.  Dealing directly with the office was unresponsive. I\u2019ve been a patient at Southern Dentistry, with Dr. Nebrig, for 3+ years, with numerous procedures performed. I don\u2019t expect perfection; but, when a business won\u2019t/can\u2019t get you in to see the dentist for pain related to work that he performed and waiting too long could cause further or more serious damage, those little, previously forgiven imperfections compound.\n\nCons:  scheduling and communication.  Can\u2019t get in to see a dentist; even as an established patient, for a dental emergency, or to get a newly placed crown adjusted. If there is a problem with dental work that was completed there-such as a crown that\u2019s too high, pain/possible tooth infection/root canal needed after dental repair 3 weeks prior but persistent pain when chewing, the office will, literally, tell you that they are \u201ctoo busy\u201d to see you. You have to schedule a regular appt, which is many months out.  Neither pain, facial bruising, nor new pain at the contact tooth will matter. One of the assistants who places crowns will ignore a patient\u2019s cry of pain in hopes of rapidly finishing the crown fitting on a raw tooth. When the crown felt a little high during it\u2019s placement, the assistant didn\u2019t dry the tooth before using the chalk paper and told me to wait until I wasn\u2019t numb and to give the teeth time to adjust; they\u2019d move around a bit and I could easily come back in to get it adjusted. The amalgam fillings have a rough/sandy texture that leaves the tooth constantly feeling dirty.   The wait time before work/cleaning begins is often 45-60 min.  If insurance covers at 50%, you overpay before the work is done at a 40% coverage. This policy is left to the patient to discover. When questioning the math for the estimates and lack of refunds or j completed work, they say they will reimburse the difference after all the insurance claims have paid.  After all of the work that\u2019s been done, I\u2019m aware of only one reimbursement.  Perhaps, the overpayments were applied to other procedures and they forgot to tell me. My insurance claims for one procedure showed that I had overpaid Southern Dentistry by something like $86 and the front office confirmed the same amount a couple months after the claim. When I was at my next procedure and asked to have that $86 reimbursement applied to the current procedure, the office said I had $8 owed to me and my \u201cinsurance must not have paid fully for an X-ray or something.\u201d  (They didn\u2019t apply the $8 toward the current procedure or give me the money back.) Providing patients with a break down receipt that shows the portions the patient and insurance paid, and the refund owed to the patient would enhance trust and clarity.  At one appt, the office was in such a hurry to get patients out the door that they skipped my annual X-rays and said they would do them at the next cleaning, in 6 months.\n\nPros:  Dr. Nebrig has a charismatic and laid back, jubilant personality. He does a great job numbing the area that will receive work and calming an anxious patient.  He takes pride in and enjoys his work, and completes the procedures quickly.  Same day crowns drastically improve an unpleasant and time consuming dental procedure.  The office location is convenient. Silver fillings aren\u2019t used.  The hygienists, assistants, and dentist are friendly and gentle.  The sport-top water bottles provided  after a procedure exemplifies attention to detail and patient needs. The facility is clean. The office accepts a lot of different insurances. The business wants patient feedback.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1626896853017, "text": "Thank you"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a42208bd7a8c1:0x31556a24d6a98934"}

I was a little upset that I had to call to reschedule my appointment, originally for 4/6, (due to COVID)... I guess I just thought that the patients in pain, would at least get a call FIRST to reschedule any important procedures - that didn't happen. Thankfully, I called in late April & was able to get an appt for today, 5/27. I get there at 10:20, my appointment time, let them know I'm there, only to be told, \"You're appointment is scheduled for 11:10\". This was due some type of system issue they were having (understandable, not their fault). BEFORE they take payment, she goes over what they are doing today + how much it would cost. I immediately asked if that price included the nitrous oxide gas (my cost $50). She said no and amended my new payment to include the gas. After waiting for way longer than usual, I was called in and told, \"I'm sorry, the truck hasn't delivered the oxygen\".\nYes, I had about 2-3 panick/anxiety attacks in the chair but after 2 hours of crying, it isfis .... for now.\nNow, I'm in lots of pain and I can't even begin to describe it ... I can't open my mouth + chewing is OUT of the Question!!!!\nI really hope Dr. Nebrig and his staff makes this right bc I thought I FINALLY found a dentist that I can trust + does good work at good prices.\n***********************************************\n(August 2019) Dr. Nebrig and his staff are MARVELOUS. The environment is very relaxing. I was called back as soon as I arrived (literally no wait time in the lobby - not used to such a quick call back once I check in at other facilities I've visited in the past \ud83d\ude43). I was greeted with smiling faces and just felt \"Welcomed\". The girls were the most amazing assistants with my VERY FIRST root canal! They went over + above to ensure I was in as little discomfort as possible. Sidney even brought me a blanket while I waited on my crown to be delivered. Dr. Nebrig has an amazing bedside manner and is very kind and considerate. The staff called me the next morning to check and see how I was doing.

Rhonda was scheduled to see her, but was spending a lot of time reviewing a complicated treatment plan with her patient.  Faye had a cancelation at that time, and volunteered to see your daughter instead (to try to avoid any longer delays).

The pain persisted after placing the permanent crown (on the second try, and it still did not look great on the X-ray).  I gave up on you as a dentist after the third or fourth bite-adjustment that did not solve the problem.  On the most recent visit (after my new dentist told me to go back to the person who placed the crown to get it re-done), you said that this crown is \"perfect\" and told me to go to an endodontist.  You also mentioned that you had told me before that the root could be damaged from previous tooth decay - you had not told me this about this specific tooth in the past, only a different tooth on which you had already performed a root canal.  According to the endodontist that did perform a root canal, the roots were in good shape - there is a crack in my tooth underneath the crown, which was the source of pain whenever debris got in the crack and irritated the root.  Whether this crack was because of a poor bite when I first got the crown or something else, I guess I'll never know.\n\nZero Stars: You lied to me.  I am listing several instances here, in no particular order:\n\n1.  As I already mentioned, you did not discuss this tooth and its root with me in the past as you stated at the most recent visit.  The assistant at that visit even looked for it in the chart notes and could not find it .\n\n2.  After the insurance claim for the crown was denied the final time, I asked you about the dentist's narrative on why it was necessary that should have been included in the files that were sent to the insurance.  You said you typed a full page for this, your receptionist said it was a few lines handwritten.  Neither of you could find a copy to provide to me.  When I was filing the appeal to the insurance company a few months prior, I asked if there was a narrative, and was not made aware that such a thing existed.  One or both of you lied directly to my face.\n* If you did not file anything because I was on the \"patient appreciation plan\" which states that you won't file insurance while I'm on it, you could have told me that and I would not have had an issue.  This was why I filed insurance on my own after paying you for the procedure, expecting them to reimburse me the covered percentage of what I paid; admittedly, I did not realize the amount of paperwork and effort needed for this.  Instead your office told me that you did file all the needed paperwork, which the insurance company never received.\n\n3.  I'm not even convinced that this crown was necessary (and there apparently is no narrative to state that it was).  Your office seems to put a higher priority on crowns and other high-dollar work than on fillings, which seems backwards to me as I would think that you would want to do a filling as soon as you find it so the tooth does not get bad enough to need a crown.  Another tooth of mine which you said would need a crown (which I never got from you because the pain on the other side of my mouth never stopped) currently has a filling from my new dentist.\n\n4.  You said an endodontist can remove and save the old crown to place it back on later.  This is incorrect, both endodontists I visited stated that they drill through the crown to perform the root canal.  This may not have been intentional, but I'm counting it as another lie.\n\n5.  After I got the root canal, some porcelain chipped off of another surface of the crown.  I called your office to ask about what material the base metal is (and if I should worry about corrosion) and was told that ALL the crowns you perform are pure zirconium and not porcelain-on-metal.  When I asked how that could be if mine clearly has exposed metal, the person on the phone got quite defensive ... like accusations of lying (perhaps not unfounded) is a common phenomenon.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1600008293148, "text": "David, I'm sorry you are unhappy. I do hope you at least realize we tried our best to provide all the Care that we could. If you don't mind, as you leave us one star would you mind elaborating on what you wish we had done better? That would be helpful for me and anyone reading this. However, respecting your privacy, I don't want to elaborate on what I think your experience may have been.\n\nUpdate: David, I am so happy that you have found a new dentist with a relationship that you have confidence and Trust in! Thank you for taking the time to share this with me.  It will do neither you nor I any good for me to make a defense of the experiences that we had together.

And I'm not a relative, I swear.\nI live in Austin Texas and was visiting Huntsville and had a dental emergency. My crown post broke and I was left without a front tooth. I went to Dr. Cook for options and after extensive discussion decided to put a new post in and a temporary crown so my dentist at home could then replace the temporary with a new crown. But when Dr Cook got into the process he discovered an old-school resin that had been used  to fill the root canal and determined that the chances of success for a new crown were significantly reduced. Rather than continuing with the new post, he simply glued the old crown back in place and suggested that I discuss my options with my dentist at home. Wow... He had the opportunity to charge me for a new post that probably would have been unsuccessful but instead was honest and told me that I would probably need an implant.\nPatient before profits. For me this is something significant and something I was extremely impressed by. On top of all of that, the office was friendly, extremely organized, and seamless throughout the entire process.

I have never had a bad experience at a dentist office before. I first thought it was weird that they were begging for 5 star reviews when i first started going here. That explains where a lot of these reviews came from.\n\nOn each visit I felt like it was more about up-selling you on the products they offer than focusing on my actual teeth. They were always mentioning teeth whitening, special mouth wash, special tooth paste etc. I am in the sales world so I get it, but don't be pushy. You can usually tell when a person is uncomfortable about the topics. Which I was.\n\nI received a quote for invisalign about a year ago, and decided to save. They quoted me 1800ish without insurance for that visit. Then this past visit they quoted me 3,325 after my insurance pays 1000. I thought that was a bit dramatic increase especially since my insurance now covers a grand.\n\nI go to my dentist every 6 months. I might go two months over, due to work scheduling, but I go regularly. I've never had cavity problems so 8 months ago when I was told I had 6 I almost fainted. I actively brush my teeth and floss multiple times a day. My family and friends make fun of how cautious I am when it comes to my oral health. I want to keep my teeth so I do care for them.  I was told I didn't floss enough and that I needed to start when I asked how it was possible to have 6 cavities. I felt like i was being degraded.  So I started brushing 3Xs daily and flossing after every meal. When I came back 8 months later (2 months over because of a work scheduling issue)  I had 4 more. Only then when I almost started to cry did the Dr. ask about my medical history. I have severe acid re-flux. Apparently that can cause the cavity issue. He then up-sales me on some ORA-Care mouth wash and told me to use it until my next visit. When I return to the next visit if I have additional cavities we will re-evaluate. I'm not sure that I would want to wait another 6 months to see if i get additional cavities even while using the mouth wash.\n\nWhen I went to schedule my filling appointment they told me I had to pay a percentage of the $250 cost before they scheduled me. I told them that I didn't have the money even though I did, and decided right then I would go back to Dr. Sonja Gill's office.\n\nI felt this office is only concerned about the money that goes into their pocket. I get businesses have to make money, but I have never not paid them. Even when I missed an appointment I paid them a $55 no show fee with no hesitation. I felt like I was their personal ATM.\n\nI will never go back to this practice again. I am going back to Dr. Sonja Gill where I am greeted with a smile, and they don't hold out their hand for your credit card every time you walk through the door.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1583345035967, "text": "We apologize and will be contacting you to see how we can make it better for you."}, "gmap_id": "0x886268e976bb6b43:0x3c4d92c0b50a4a2c"}

Content with the service, I decided to have Divine Expressions as my primary and only dental care. And for the most part, it was good. The staff are incredibly friendly, extremely accommodating and very gentle during each cleaning. Not to mention the breathtaking, home magazine worthy office.\n\nWhere it pains me to write is related to Dr. Laurentis Barnett's procedures. Every procedure that dealt with a crown of some sort, always came off. It resulted in me either having to leave work early, take an extended lunch, take a day off and/or come back multiple times that same week. While the staff and Dr. Barnett was very accommodating and flexible with scheduling, the process were still very inconvenient. A particular case was getting an implant for one of my teeth. For starters, the tooth itself was shaped very oddly. It did not look or feel like a normal tooth. It also always popped off, even though the office used dental cement.\n\nWith every visit to either add or replace, I never received an answer as to why this kept happening. Dr. Laurentis also hinted that it was possibly my fault that the tooth kept coming off. I'm not opposed to thinking that I could've been doing something wrong, but after speaking with friends and colleagues with dental implants and explaining to them my daily routine and lifestyle, I was suggested to get an second opinion from another dental professional.\n\nI sought treatment elsewhere and unfortunately had to pay for another tooth implant. The implant printed from Divine Expressions leaves my new dental office with many questions as they have never seen such an odd shaped \"tooth\". My current implant from my new dentist has been in my mouth for nearly 2 months. I had not returned once for a re-application.\n\nThe purpose of this post is not to defame or deface Dr. Laurentis Barnett, it is simply to write a review I felt needed to be written. I wish him and his office the best of success and hope that maybe this review will leave some food for thought. I'm glad there are a good number of patients that are satisfied with his service.

However, I am not pleased with the run around I received as if I didn't know what I was talking about. Every time I called the office in reference to the same tooth/problem I always explained in detail what my concerns were. I repeatedly went in and each time you would think I was a new patient. I saw 4 different dental assistants and none of them had a clue as to why I was there. They didn't even know which tooth that I had a root canal on in there office just 1 month prior (this happened twice). One time I called, I was asked what the doctor told me on the last visit I went in.....this is disturbing considering they should keep record of what the doctor says each visit and overall what is actually going on. Also, it would seem smart to keep record of what a patient says for the reason they are needing to see the doctor again so that there is an overall knowledge with other office staff on the situation/patient. I was always greeted by a friendly smile (wish I could remember her name) but once I got behind the door everything seemed surfaced even with Dr Barnette.

Dr. Barnett has done an amazing job with establishing a family culture within his practice and with staff as you will witness when you come here. His staff has nothing but great things to say about Dr. Barnett and once you meet him you will see why. I highly recommend Divine Expressions to anyone who demands nothing but the best for their teeth.

This was my first time ever being put under for a procedure, so the lack of connection and trust I felt with the doctor did not sit well with me. My other complaint is in regards to how I was treated on procedure day. First, my wait time was astronomical: probably 3-4 hours, which is a horrendous wait prior to a fasted procedure. When I was woken up post-procedure, I was basically yanked out of my chair as soon as I could open my eyes. Due to the meds, I couldn\u2019t walk at all and was dragged to my car by two nurses on either side of me, catching me as I fell. It would have been nice to have been given 5-10 minutes to wake up and regain consciousness before being forced to walk.

From the moment we walked in the door, we were greeting with compassion and understanding, and assured that they could fix her crowns.  They immediately scheduled an appoint for that same week to do her evaluation.  In that first appointment, Dr. Wilson laid out exactly what needed to be done, gave us a time frame for the work to be completed with cost estimates, and hand made her a set of temporaries that looked better than any of the final crowns from the other dentists we had worked with.  He performed laser dentistry on her gums to give her a bigger smile, used the KOR whitening system to give her a bright white color to her teeth, and put on two new crowns that he gets from a lab in Hollywood, CA.  I can proudly say today that my wife has a beautiful smile that she is so proud of thanks to the work of Dr. Wilson and his staff at Signature Smiles.

I scheduled my appointment with the dental rep and asked what I could expect. She told me to plan to be there about an hour. They would clean, polish and then give me the Sheer Whitening treatments. Wow, I thought, pretty good prize. I proceeded to ask what kind of whitening treatments they used, 5 day strips, ugh, I thought, oh well.\n\nUnfortunately, I arrived for my appointment about 10 minutes late, however, not intentional. The receptionist was a bit unfriendly and I thought maybe it was because I was late. Shortly, a dental assistant came to me with a clip board and 5 pages to fill out. I completed my basic information and soon realized they were wanting more info than was totally necessary to claim a prize. I began scanning over the pages and stopped immediately. They were asking me everything from signing to consent to pay for the charges they would render to me today and insurance could not be filed to authorizing them to obtain my dental records from my current dentist. I proceeded to the receptionist and told her there was obviously a mistake, I was asked to fill out patient paperwork and that I was only there to redeem my gift certificate. She told me to proceed completing the paperwork so that they could keep it on file. I looked at her in disbelief and sat back down placing the pen under the clip. I guess she signaled the assistant who came out and retrieved my paperwork. I waited for over 30 minutes before they called me back. I followed the assistant back to a dental room and she handed me a box of strips and about 5 minutes of instruction. Do you have any questions? I said, \"Are we done?\", she said yes that's it. Hmm, so they led me to believe that the cleaning and polishing were part of my prize when really they were going to bill me for this when they were finished. I guess I didn't fall for their trap. Talk about deceitful, a good reputable business does not do business this way. I will not be back. I will still use my strips, but could have got them at Wal-mart for $12.00. What a joke.

When I returned home I made an appointment with a DIFFERENT dentist office to have the tooth/filling looked at - the filling was cracked and missing parts in 3 places and when this new dentist started taking it out - it was obvious that the filling material never set up properly as the filling was soft.

Dr English and his ENTIRE staff are the most professional, kind, knowledgeable, and compassionate people I've encountered in my life! No lie, I'm a complete wimp when it comes to dentistry. I've suffered from dental anxiety all of my life. I've always opted for extractions over getting a filling, and i had to be put under anesthesia first. I was a true phobic, until yesterday. The second his staff called to confirm my appointment, i truly felt in her voice that i wasn't just some faceless voice over the phone. She was so genuine and could relate to my fears. Upon arrival, i was continously greeted by the most beautiful, empathetic, professional staff. Every single person was not only physically beautiful, but genuinely beautiful from the soul. Now, you can't learn that. Thats something thats ingrained deep within and it simply flows out when you're doing something you love.  I don't know about y'all,  but I've literally been around the world and unequivocally, I've yet to frequent an establishment where EVERYONE makes you feel, like you're the only person there! Got my teeth cleaned and didn't feel a thing! She was AMAZING! Never has this happened before, to me. My gums normally hurt for a few days. Yesterday, Dr English took my hand and he promised me that my procedures this morning wouldn't hurt. I was so very skeptical. When i walked in, i felt like a jitterbug! I was literally having a secret panic attack. Well, Dr. English and his staff had me covered. When i say, \"yo, it didn't hurt\"...what I mean is, \"it really didn't hurt!\" At one point, i felt a little pressure, but he was all over it in 2 seconds flat! Bottom line up front: Dr. English and his staff are all easy on the eyes, beautiful from the heart, extremely knowledgeable, professional,  and courteous.  I went back to work and told everyone i saw about them at Apex Dental in Madison,  Alabama! No, I'm not sponsored. Wasn't paid for this review, and my opinions are all my own. If you need quality dental work, want to experience pain free dental, and patronize an establishment that \"brings customer service back\", then look no further! They have it figured out! I love these guys! The entire staff rocks...everyone of them! Don't just take my word, please go see for yourselves.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626898d2e3a36d:0x2edc316b6e854265"}

So it took me 30 minutes to get there because of traffic, they had me wait for 15 minutes in the office, and they told me they couldn't help me at all...  the only reason i was in the office that day was because they requested me to come in for an earlier appointment.  it was a huge pain to ask off to get to their office and for them to put their time schedule far above my own time schedule was incredibly rude.  i will never never never go back.  horrible experience.  if you go here, you better never be late for an appointment and like migraine headaches.  i'm 35 years old i've been to many many dentists, the service i received at apex dental literally makes me sick. i've never been treated so badly in my life.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626898d2e3a36d:0x2edc316b6e854265"}

However, when I first switched to Northcutt, it was because my previous dentist retired.  I was told that a filling I had received needed to be replaced.  I was reluctant, because it wasn't giving me any pain or problems, but I had it replaced.  After the replacement, the dentist said he needed to replace his own work (no charge)  so he did.  Then I started having a lot of pain from the 2nd replacement.  He worked on it a 3rd time.  The last time I went in, he expressed that the whole tooth needed to be crowned - lest I eventually need a full root canal.  (this time charged of course)  Needless to say, I will have to be getting a second opinion.

Like I said probably my own fault for trusting someone else to have my best interest in mind and to be on top of something like that but lesson very painfully learned.)\n\nOriginal review\n\nI have terrible dental anxiety but everyone at Deerfoot Dental has gone above and beyond to help ease that. I highly recommend Deerfoot Dental especially to those who are generally nervous about visiting the dentist. The team here from the girl doing your billing and appointments to the nurses and doctor are all genuinely warm and kind.

We came to find out that most dentists are closed on Friday..and it was Thursday evening when this occurred. My son has been a patient at Deerfoot Dental since his teeth really started coming through. We left a message after hours and Dr. Grovestein called us back! He asked us to text him photos of my sons teeth. We sent the pics and he called us back. He reassured us that it probably wasn\u2019t as bad as it seems and he would meet us at his office the next morning. So he opened his clinic for us on his day off! I mean who does that? He gave us instructions to care for the tooth, we made a follow up appointment, and left. Needless to say..our sons tooth looks great. It actually straightened out almost back to its original spot. We went to our follow up appointment and got the good news that his teeth looked great and to just keep a watch on it.
