The woman at the counter shouted across the room that we needed to wait and she would get with us (me and my wife).\n\nShe then shouted across the room about who our insurance carrier was? My wife provided that information and the lobby \u201cboss\u201d we\u2019ll call her because that is the nicest I can describe her attitude.\n\nThe Lobby boss then shouted we don\u2019t accept that, my wife replied \u201cyes, you do\u201d my wife checked before making our appointment. The lobby boss then made us shout our  SSI numbers across the room so she could check. Violation of our privacy.\n\nLobby boss then ordered us to adjust our masks as they did not meet with her approval. Shortly thereafter the \u201clobby boss\u201d then got into my wife\u2019s personal space and the ordered here to replace her mask as it did not meet with the \u201clobby boss\u2019s\u201d approval.\n\nAt that point my spouse and  I elected to leave. We were going to have vision checks, buy glasses, purchase contacts and have lenses replaced buy two pairs of glasses. That was conservatively a $1,000.00 bill.\n\nGetting into paying customers personal space, treating them rudely, treating personal private information without care is unacceptable.\n\nAvoid this place at all costs.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1615572728099, "text": "I apologize for your experience in our office.

Excellent quality glasses (except for cons, see below)\nCons - I'm 61, worn glasses most of my life, and have had various coatings. These coating have never come off, not once.  It's happened with both sets of lenses from Vision First.  Now I just have annoying streaks across my lenses.  Don't know if I can get a pair without the coating because I can never get through to a real person and never a person from the Pell City clinic.  I've left messages but to no avail.  Very disappointed.\nUPDATE Apr 2021 - Went back for an exam and received the same excellent service.  They're just really good.  I also learned that the coating was an anti-glare coating that was coming off.  5 stars for the staff.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890dc3b91a8d2b:0x2da8de973ada304b"}
