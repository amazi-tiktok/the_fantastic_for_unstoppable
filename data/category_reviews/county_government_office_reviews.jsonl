Felica Powell, Sam Gambino, Renigia Coleman,  Petra Ellis, Mena Rueso, are all guilty of not helping clients. Money is being taken out of every  single one of my child support checks. Thousands of dollars each year. The DHR cant tell me where the money is going. Bruce Ikner who supposedly retired had been endorsing my child checks and money has been missing. They claim they keep no bank records.  Asked for a State hearing with their hearing officer who had to record meeting because she was falling asleep during the meeting. A hearing should be held with someone who doesnt work for the crooks at the DHR. No wonder why they keep getting sued.

My social worker threatens Foster care NON STOP.  We weren't home one day when she randomly popped in unannounced and our kids are threatened to be put into Foster care.  HOW IS THAT EVEN LEGAL?!  She's trying to make everything damn near impossible for everyone involved ..why...? So she can take my kids to Foster care. I mean every week, something new arises. Some problem she comes up with, she searches for issues against us(me) or comes up with some new rule we must NOW begin to follow or else. Or else what? Foster care of course. Making it extremely difficult or damn near impossible why? So we fail, mess up, and BAM. Her wish comes true- Foster care!  I know there's other kids out there that are probably being beaten, starved, and exposed to God knows what. But those are the poor kids that slip thru the cracks and thru the system.

Then I called and scheduled a second appt, and got that in the mail....only 2 days after receiving my 2nd appt notice and when it would be, they sent another letter saying my fs application had been denied bc I didn't keep my appointment and failed to call the office to schedule another one!!! So I tried calling back up there, yet, to my surprise I couldn't get a hold of anyone and tried 3 different numbers. Someone or multiple people there obviously don't know what's going on and need to get organized. I understand I am dependant on them for help...but how am I supposed to get help when no one is available to ever help me, or can't keep an appt date and time correct. Someone is dropping the ball and I'd like to know what management is doing about this! This is NOT OKAY TO TREAT PEOPLE LIKE THIS!!

If they think you will cave, they will threaten you with a Safety Plan and make you think they are putting your kids in Foster Care, if you do not sign it. Do not trust DHR. If DHR contacts you please get an attorney before you go see them. BEFORE YOU TALK TO DHR, PLEASE HAVE AN ATTORNEY.\n\nIf you do cave and sign it, they might tell you its only 45 days and its all over, but thats a LIE. Its 45 days for the case worker on the Safety Plan to create a petition against you that an Attorney has and presents to a judge against you. There is actually 60 days till they decide to drop it or make charges. They may say they will get you a free attorney, but get your own before they can cause any trouble to begin with. Also the attorney that is free is for your children so that DHR can make sure the children are safe. Safe against who, well that is you of course. You are getting a free attorney to prosecute you. Thanks DHR.\n\nBut wait there is more. During your so called Safety Plan they are going to want you to come in after 30 days and sign a ISP. That is an Individualized Service Plan. But you are on a Safety Plan already, so why do you need a new plan.  Well its so DHR can threaten you again. We were told they could have Foster Care there that day to take the kids. So you still don't have an Attorney and they scare you again into signing a new plan.\n\nWell its 2 months into it now. DHR will make you take Classes. Any class they can to prolong the case and assure they are making more money. The longer the case is open, the more cases they can show they have and get more money from the state. You will have attended another ISP and most likely through out all of this DHR will have told you very little and you half of what they told you is a Lie. They might say they were super busy and sorry I sent you the wrong document. Sorry I never said that time, and change you visitation times. Sorry I meant you both need to take these classes now, but you said only I had to.\n\nWell by now, you have finished your Classes and after trying really hard to have DHR get back with you, so your kids can come home, you finally get your kids back. Its been 3 to 4 months now.  Things are getting better.\n\nBut wait there is more. DHR can still investigate you another 90 days. Or so I was told. Maybe it is 90 days until she says my carpet is to dirty and adds on another 90 days. Who knows but they will continue to investigate you and your child's school for months, to a year, or even years.\n\nHopefully if you get Attorney before you ever speak with DHR. Your attorney will tell you what to NOT SAY and what to NOT DO so that DHR doesn't have any AMMO against you.  Get an Attorney to go with you to meet DHR. Do Not Go Alone like me and get abused by DHR. I am still paying for it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b41ab08b873:0xfe4d5b6d2bee2ce7"}
