She didn't even get any pictures of the bride and father dance, none of the wedding favor's table, or food table.  All those pictures came from family who took their own pictures and sent it to the bride. The bride was very upset because of the money she spent to capture her one and only wedding day and to be told that most of the pictures were destroyed only after she kept hassling the photographer for months. Nothing was destroyed, she just realized that she was doing more eating, smoking and drinking and didn't have enough pictures.  Thank god family and friends were there to help capture the moments.

Nothing was destroyed, she just realized that she was doing more eating, smoking and drinking and didn't have enough pictures.  Thank god family and friends were there to help capture the moments.

Chris provided us with a little extra decor which was absolutely stunning and I am forever grateful for all of the hard work they put into making it perfect. I especially love that this company only does one wedding a day because in the event of rain they would be flexible on the time frame. It\u2019s the beach and you can\u2019t control the weather so I\u2019m grateful for this option. ALL of my guest enjoyed every moment of our ceremony. Many saying things along the lines of  \u201cYou see this on TV and it\u2019s beautiful, but actually being there and experiencing it is completely a different experience\u201d I almost wished that I was a guest at that point after all of the compliments we had gotten. We aren\u2019t a traditional couple by any means and it wasn\u2019t your normal traditional wedding. The ceremony was indescribable and it was nothing short of a dream. Since we have gotten married two of our friends have also decided on beach weddings, so if you\u2019re looking for a wedding that everyone will be raving about this is the company to go with. Also, Ally did a wonderful job with our photos. My wife and I are truly blessed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a04d616335ad7:0x6d4c09f1e061e845"}

Nothing was destroyed, she just realized that she was doing more eating, smoking and drinking and didn't have enough pictures.  Thank god family and friends were there to help capture the moments.

I couldn't be happier.  She also offered our family and guests a discounted rate for family pics while we we were in town.  We plan on coming back in a few months, as we just found out we are expecting and want her to capture the start of our family.  If we can, we plan on coming back every year and doing family pics.

They were extremely thorough and professional, ensuring that every part of our day had good flow from a DJ perspective.  We met with our DJ (Geoff) in person after filling out an initial planning form.  He made sure every detail was covered.  On the big day, everything flowed so smoothly it was incredible.  The ceremony was absolutely beautiful with no \"hiccups\" that always seem to happen with DJs.  The reception was so much fun! Geoff was incredible at reading the crowd, sensing when people needed a little motivation to come back out and party.  I would highly recommend JAMM to anyone needing a DJ for their wedding ceremony/reception or any event!

However, I did not do that with regards to finding a wedding disc jockey in the Birmingham, Alabama area.\n\nWhy?\n\nA lot of couples put a lot of energy into all of the other vendors that support a wedding, sometimes leaving the selection of the DJ until very late in the process when both time and money are short. That's a huge mistake because the disc jockey establishes the mood and tone of the wedding and the reception. Pick the wrong wedding DJ at the last minute and you'll be sorry.\n\nWhen I contacted Jamm Entertainment Services about my daughter's wedding they patiently answered all of my questions, recommended the right services, and delivered exactly what they promised - a smooth, perfectly orchestrated wedding service and reception with a consistently packed dance floor that we'll remember for the rest of our lives!\n\nI want to thank them in particular for their patience in answering all of our technical questions about the video and photo files we provided because they were a critical part of my daughter's wedding event.\n\nIf you're looking for the best Birmingham, Alabama disc jockeys, you'll be delighted with Jamm Entertainment Services just as I was.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891764f5f60a81:0xe98ab25cc34c3d64"}

Fresh, juicy tomatoes burst with sweetness along with pungent garlic. The sweetness and acidity of the balsamic add another layer of flavor and fresh basil turns it up with herbaceous flair. Rating: 4.5/5\n\nBrie and Marmalade Bites starts with a phyllo cup filled with orange marmalade, brie, and herbs. It is a light bite and would be great as a passed hors d\u2019oeuvre for a wedding or corporate event. The creamy brie combined with the sweetness and citrus flavor of the marmalade pair perfectly together. Rating: 5/5\n\nCaesar Salad is made with fresh romaine lettuce tossed with house-made Caesar dressing with anchovy. I love Caesar salad but it is very hard to find a place that makes it correctly. If you do not like anchovies, do not order a Caesar salad. It is just not a Caesar salad without it. Chef David makes a great Caesar salad dressing, not too thin and not too thick. The perfect viscosity to cling to the lettuce. I love that Chef David makes a crostini seasoned with butter, salt, and pepper instead of chunky, clunky croutons. It\u2019s easier to eat and elevates the salad as well. Chef David, you need to bottle and sell that dressing! Rating: 5/5\n\nChicken Marsala is made with mushrooms, shallots, garlic, and parsley served over angel hair pasta. The chicken gently bathes in the sauce and really infuses the flavors into the chicken. It is tender and unlike any chicken marsala I\u2019ve ever had. But that sauce is like liquid gold. It clings to the angel hair pasta like silk sheets. You can\u2019t help but lick the plate afterwards. I could see this on a fine dining establishment\u2019s menu. It is so refined and delicious! Rating: 5/5\n\nChocolate Fondant (Americans refer to this as a chocolate lava cake or molten chocolate cake) is basically a bi-product of a flourless chocolate cake and a souffl\u00e9. Chef David served his with macerated strawberries and strawberry coulis. If you go to my Instagram, I have a video of the chocolate \u201clava\u201d flowing from the cake. I have tried many of these in my lifetime, but I think this was the best. I don\u2019t know if it was because I had right out of the oven but it was just amazing! The perfect ending to a perfect meal!

Lecia, my day of coordinator, made sure that all of the d\u00e9cor for the reception was taken care of two days in advance and set everything out-it looked absolutely gorgeous. Everything she did relieved me and my mom of so much day-of stress. Hannah, my bride's assistant, was at my side during all of the pictures before the ceremony, holding my flowers when I needed help with my dress, adjusting my train, pinning my hair back and making sure my veil was in place at all times. She was truly a lifesaver and made it so easy for me to enjoy taking pictures and had everything you could possibly need from bobbie pins, to a mirror, to a glass of water. Tina is extremely honest and straight forward, which I LOVE. I always felt that she had my best interest in mind and would give me the best advice so I could make decisions regarding all aspects of the wedding. I am not from Chattanooga, so I had questions about almost every vendor and she never steered me wrong. She was so much fun to get to know and from the beginning, I felt at ease with her, knowing she was going to be on top of everything for the reception. Since I had a church ceremony, she did not coordinate for that, but she made sure to know all of the details and really took my vision and made it a reality for the entire event. If you are looking for a coordinator, and don't want to spend a fortune, In Style Weddings is the way to go. They do not sacrifice professionalism or quality of service, they are extremely helpful, can fit into almost any bride's budget, and are absolutely worth every penny for the peace of mind they provide!

We visited the venue and after meeting Yolanda, we immediately said \u201cthis is the one\u201d. We looked no further and this is the only venue we visited. It is as beautiful in person as you see in the many photos on their website and in other bride's pictures. I cannot wait to get our pictures/videos back.

We moved to the south a year before getting engaged and decided to have everyone come down to us for a good ol\u2019 southern wedding.

We rented out the mansion for the immediate families and wedding party to spend the night with their guests and when we pulled up, we got nothing less than Ooos and Ahhs about how beautiful and serene it all is. Every vendor Yolanda has in her arsenal is remarkable and a joy to work with - she wouldn't have it any other way and that is how you know you're looking at the right venue/planner. The day-of coordinator (Terri) is a MUST-DO for Brides. We actually ate at our wedding! We had our first meal as husband and wife and no one even knew and just assumed the wedding norm ( that you don\u2019t get to eat the delicious food you hand-selected!) It was absolutely incredible. Everyone was so surprised that she answered all of their questions, let them do whatever they wanted within reason and even partied and had a blast with us. You will not find a more flexible venue/planner anywhere. There were bridesmaid's guests that were not a part of the wedding party and while we were off taking pictures or getting ready, she let them hang out, swim in the pool and generally do whatever as if they were at their own homes. In terms of the wedding, she was willing to go above and beyond to make the day special for us. She found us the perfect officiant who let us do a cultural element as part of our ceremony \u2013 something they were equally as excited to see executed. We wanted to light off lanterns at the end of the night and she said absolutely. Nothing was out of the realm of possibilities or \"against the rules\" and that is how your wedding day should be - exactly as you want. Everywhere else we looked there was a \u201cNo-no\u201d list of things you cannot do \u2013 be out by 11, no open flames, no loud music, etc etc. That list does not exist at Oak Island and they will try to accommodate all of your requests within reason.\n\nIf you are looking for a one of a kind wedding experience with seasoned professionals, listen to their advice (they've done way more weddings than you!) and go with Oak Island Weddings.
