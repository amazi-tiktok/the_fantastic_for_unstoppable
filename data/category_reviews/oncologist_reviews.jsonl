From the bottom of my heart I want to thank each and every one of you here in Andalusia. I pray for you everyday that's passed since Amy's passed on, you were her strength and her one personal hope to succeed in always fighting her leukemia. She always spoke highly of you Dr. Boatwright, and the whole team with you. Towards the end I wanted to let you know I had become so angry with this cancer of hers and a part of me wouldn't listen to any kind of words of defeat and I want to apologize for anything \ud83d\ude1e I may have said or done at the time! I pray that you could find it to forgive me one day for not doing more when it meant the most. I'm very sorry... If you can't then I absolutely understand and I would do the same if I were who I used to be. Amy didn't really have a great deal of friends or family besides her kids and their dad was always using them against her. I watched day in and day out of her struggle and almost everyday I had to go hide for a little while and cry my eyes out. And I knew it was coming in my mind and that haunted me so bad because I didn't want to live without her. To this very day 4 months after the grief and this horrific game of circle is at an all time high and her death has been difficult to bear. Thank you \u2764\ufe0f Sacred Heart for always being there for her and for going above and beyond for every detail of her struggle! I'll forever be in your debt. They'll never be another day that I don't thank and pray for all of you. And if anyone out there has need for there care I promise you'll be making a very wise decision here!

They were more than helpful.\n\nFirst of all, the nurse was very helpful in walking me through the steps necessary to book the appointment whether it was a referral, or a second opinion. Then, she began to ask me about the problem that my child was having. To my surprise, she handed the doctor the phone. I immediately felt as if I was being heard by the medical profession,  which is something that we have lost over time.\n\nWhen the doctor picked up the phone, it was as if my son was already a patient of his. He asked me everything that was going on from the timeline to his symptoms. After listening to me, he assured me that I was on the right track with the colonoscopy.\n\nHe had every opportunity to schedule an appointment just because he could, as we were at such a vulnerable state. But he didn\u2019t, and I respect and appreciated that. I can tell that this doctor really cares about his patients, their care, their results, their well-being, and he loves what he does!\n\nIf you watch his video, what he says lines up with what he delivered to me over a simple phone call. I can only imagine being his actual patient.\n\nIf you are looking for a proctologist, he is highly recommended!\n\nThank you Dr. Bornstein and you\u2019re nursing staff!\n\nWe had my son\u2019s colonoscopy, and everything came back well!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1623353237294, "text": "Thanks for the great review!
