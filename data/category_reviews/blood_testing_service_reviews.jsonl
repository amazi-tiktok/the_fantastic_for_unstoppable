Because of their error, I was billed $200 extra. After long waits on the phone with BCBS, I found out the story above.\n\nAt 9:30 am today I called Stopwatch to ask about how we could have been charged if we confirmed at the front desk that we were covered. They told me they would contact billing and return my call. When I didn't hear back from them in 30 min, I stopped by the office to ask in person about the error. After waiting for 20 minutes in the waiting room, I ended up calling the billing office myself and actually having to pass my phone to the receptionist to get their error fixed. After all that, they admitted fault and adjusted my bill.\n\nMy kid was sick when I went in to talk about billing, so I thought I might as well have him seen now that the billing issue was worked out.\n\nWe waited a reasonable 20 min, they did a flu test, and released us with an RX called in to CVS.\n\nI had to call twice, but they finally said they were resenting my RX. I assumed it'd be ready in an hour.\n\nWrong again. After trusting them to call in my prescription twice now, I went to Walgreens around 12:30, only to have them tell me that it hadn't been called in. So I had to call the office a FOURTH time now, and get them to actually call my prescription in.\n\nStopwatch forgot to cancel the RX at CVS, so I had to call CVS for them and ask them to cancel that prescription so that my finally called in RX could be filled at Walgreens. I got my kid's medicine at 1:30, after sitting in Walgreens for an hour for a prescription that was supposed to be called in and picked up. My sick kid fell asleep sitting up because of how long we had to wait.\n\nDragging my sick kid all over town and having to wait multiple hours because of Stopwatch's errors makes me positive that I'll never use this Urgent Care again.
