It happened to be 10 points higher than a test administered to me days earlier by Dr . Izer.  He wanted to prescribe medication. When I said I just had the test 4 days ago by another doctor, he got very upset and told me there is no reason for me to come back since I saw the other doctor. Apparently he doesn\u2019t like a patient getting a second opinion. He is insecure or threatened by a second opinion, especially when there is such a disparity in the result.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2c817b9add49:0x2ee5464c8c08183d"}

Don't know if I can get a pair without the coating because I can never get through to a real person and never a person from the Pell City clinic.  I've left messages but to no avail.  Very disappointed.\nUPDATE Apr 2021 - Went back for an exam and received the same excellent service.  They're just really good.
