I never had to wait on a drink and he was polite and I could tell he knew what he was doing. He is the sole reason they even got 2 Stars. The food.....Oh the food. It was absolutely terrible. It was my wife's birthday and she really wanted to go here. It was my first time. I ordered some lobster tails she had the ultimate feast. When I got my food a $40 meal, my lobster was like a rubber band ball it was disgusting. I could barely rip it apart with my fingers. It could literally bounce. I had to cut it with a steak knife. I should have been fluffy, buttery and savory. I know it's not an ocean side restaurant but with a name like Red lobster I figured the lobster would be decent. I was so let down. Please make sure your cooks can at the most cook lobster. How is a place named Red Lobster serving such terribly cooked lobster. Your chef clearly doesn't belong at your store.  My in-laws ordered fish and chips. The fish had to have been dipped and breaded 15 times before it hit the fryer. When they finished they had almost an entire plate of batter that they picked and pealed off their fish. I was so embarrassed taking them here. My kids ordered the sirloin steak, they claimed to like it but they are kids, kids like anything. The steaks looked pretty beaten up and over cooked. Thank you Arthur for offering to replace the meal with a better cooked one,( \"which I turned down\" ) and thank you for being a fantastic server! I know that's a tough job. You were worth the $50 tip I left you. But Red Lobster I beg you to hire some efficient chefs and focus on training your cooks how to properly prepare lobster, steak and even a simple fish and chips. Find people who want to be there and who care weather their food is good. I'm not asking you to fire this person that cooked our food tonight but at the very least spend hours retraining them to cook your food the way it should be. I can't imagine how much money your company wastes throwing away food that was cooked terribly. I'm not sure I'll ever go to another Red lobster again which stinks because my wife raved about it, but it was just upsetting. I hope anyone who reads this doesn't have the same experience. I work too had for my $$$ to have someone not care how their food turns out. I don't blame red Lobster as I don't know their current situation but they have to know that their cook is not very good.

I was taken aback and perhaps this is on me for simply not getting up and walking out or bringing it up real time. This whole situation we all find ourselves in is awkward for all involved.  However, it is not on the customer's shoulders to enforce state rules. I just don't get it since it seemed most if not all of the other employees had appropriate facial covering.  Rationally I can tell myself that the exposure risk was probably low. On the other hand should I be having to go through that because a restaurant/employee couldn't be respectful of their customers?\n\nUpdate 3 weeks later:  Although I never received anything other than a canned response on Yelp in spite of contacting them via their website, I made a visit last night in hopes of finding improvement and dinning. Well, incredulously, it was worse!  The State's mask orders are still in effect. Opening the door and entering this time even the host doesn't have a mask and the first server we see - no mask. We turned and walked out.  You have to ask yourself what kind of corporate/management approach so blatantly violates an obvious and easily implementable order. And if they have this disregard about the things you can see then what about those things you can't even during non-pandemic times.\n\nThis can be done correctly. I've witnessed it at many other both local and chain establishments.

It all started when I asked for water, no lemon, and get brought back water with lemon. Not that big of a deal, it happens, simple mistake. I very foolishly paid for our food at the table tablet early as we were a bit short on time and wanted to leave as soon as we were done. Our food arrived and the steak was over done like shoe leather, the lobster tail was like eating a rubber band, and the side of fries was missing. The shrimp was at least alright. Our waitress was not seen again for 20+ minutes. She finally came back around, we mentioned some issues, and she vanished again. After several minutes, we caught some other waitress nearby and asked for a manager. After another 15+  minutes of no manager nor our waitress being seen, we left as we simply had no more time to waste dealing with this ordeal, we were already late at this point. We didn't get all the ordered food and half of what we did get wasn't even edible.

The Red Lobster there literally has the same qualities, defects, pros and cons as the one here in Huntsville, AL. Both lack in cleanliness. At peak hours the bathrooms become disgusting.

There\u2019s nothing fresh about it. I have nothing negative to say regarding the staff. They seem like they work extremely hard. Sometimes it seems like they\u2019re just holding on. Much respect.

The server was very obviously annoyed that we were in her section. She walked up and introduced herself with an irritated vibe (she also added to her introduction that she was going to get us out of there fast due to the bad weather, which wasn't that bad) and asked for our drink orders then walked away without another word. Any time she came to the table she barely spoke beyond necessity, we would thank her for various things and she did not once acknowledge us. She brought half of my order out and I suppose my face expressed a question and she stared at me... the appropriate thing to say is, \" Can I get you anything else?\" I finally said, \"Is the soup coming out now or later?\" Her reply? \"No, it's coming out now...\" and a brisk walk away. To make dinner less enjoyable the staff were definitely not using professional language when they were in the kitchen (my table was next to the kitchen).The food was decent (hardly agree with the price verses value) but the service made the whole experience...

We ate here because we got a giftcard for Christmas and it turned out to be a big mistake. We ordered an appetizer, soup, salad, and dinner entree. Our appetizer came out and the waiter set it down on the table and quickly walked away as I was trying to tell him he didn't give us any plates or forks. So from the get go I was irritated. We tried to flag several people down and were ignored each time. So after getting no help we started eating our shrimp appetizer with our hands. Finally a different server helped us and got us some forks. But still no plates. Our appetizer was gone by the time our original waiter finally came back to the table and mumbled \"I shoulda been brought these out to ya\" at me and finally got us plates and biscuits. Then our dinner entrees were brought out by yet another different server. We tried to ask for our soup and salad but she turned and walked away so quickly I don't think she heard me. We had nearly finished our dinner entrees by the time our original server came to check on us, and instead of apologizing for the mistake just said \"yeah I know\" when I said we had ordered a soup and salad. If you know, then where is my food? We both finished our dinner entrees before he brought our soup and salad out and by that point we were already full. I paid $8 for a bowl of soup I didn't even eat. The manager comped one of our meals but I will never go back there after that experience.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1550685082849, "text": "Hi,Caitlyn Hoppe.

I Ordered food online was late to make sure the food would be ready (9:52) the food wasnt brought out until after 10:15. No problem.... Things Happen...but then the biscuits were burned (paid for these extra biscuits, I wish I could attach pics) asked for new biscuits and decided to order a chilled shot of patron. The bartender PUTS ICE WATER IN GLASS (in a poor attempt to chill the glass) and pours the warm shot in the glass. This is not chilled, strike 2. Asked for a lime after we had to wait to get her to turn and we were the only 2 people at the bar besides the bartender. The bartender LITERALLY brought a lime with her BARE HANDS and said here you go. No napkin, no tooth pick, straight hand to hand contact. Clearly she should have not been working the bar. Didn't even want the drink just wanted to kill time until the food came back that they screwed up. Paid for the drink and she says have a good one. WHERE ARE MY BISCUITS???? she NEVER brought them back out. I said forget it and left with the burned biscuits which are inedible. This is the LAST time I will visit this red lobster. Until they revamp and retrain their staff... They have lost 2 customers. I mean the carpet even stinks here, you can smell it reeking and there is so much dust your allergies with not like you.

I've gone to Red Lobster numerous times, too many too count. I have had many instances of unsatisfactory service (the latest being 5 minutes ago) but I give them chances because they are one of a few seafood restaurants in this area. And I love my snow crab. I Ordered food online was late to make sure the food would be ready (9:52) the food wasnt brought out until after 10:15. No problem.... Things Happen...but then the biscuits were burned (paid for these extra biscuits, I wish I could attach pics) asked for new biscuits and decided to order a chilled shot of patron. The bartender PUTS ICE WATER IN GLASS (in a poor attempt to chill the glass) and pours the warm shot in the glass. This is not chilled, strike 2. Asked for a lime after we had to wait to get her to turn and we were the only 2 people at the bar besides the bartender. The bartender LITERALLY brought a lime with her BARE HANDS and said here you go. No napkin, no tooth pick, straight hand to hand contact. Clearly she should have not been working the bar. Didn't even want the drink just wanted to kill time until the food came back that they screwed up. Paid for the drink and she says have a good one. WHERE ARE MY BISCUITS???? she NEVER brought them back out. I said forget it and left with the burned biscuits which are inedible. This is the LAST time I will visit this red lobster. Until they revamp and retrain their staff... They have lost 2 customers. I mean the carpet even stinks here, you can smell it reeking and there is so much dust your allergies with not like you. It's a shame you spend all this money for subpar quality. Shame on you Red Lobster!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b4242329453:0xaf13e57fcb31a1d7"}

He is 85 and a veteran from World War II, Vietnam, and Korea. He retired to   Huntsville almost 30 years ago. He has been going to the Red Lobster there for 30 years.  We had our meal and he insisted on paying the bill. He handed me his wallet which had 3 crisp 50 dollars bills inside. He asked to take two and put them in with the bill.... he wanted to pay the 47 dollar bill and get change to tip the waiter.  I removed the two bills and he ask that i lay them side by side in the envelope so that they did not get stuck together and so the waiter could see there were two and not just one. The lunch was slow taking almost two hours to complete so he finally asked if we could make our way to the car while my wife stayed and waited for the change.  i brought him to the car and we waited for another 20 minutes but my wife did not come.  Finally she did come out and was blown away.  The waiter came back by the table and through the plastic bill holder on the table and said there was no bill or money inside and that he was reprinting the bill for my wife to pay again. I went back into the restaurant to talk to the waiter, but he wouldn't even talk he left for a bit and the manager came out to talk to me. He said that i must have dropped the money and the bill and asked if it was in my pockets. I explained that I knew for sure the money was there because my dad had asked be to take the money from his wallet and to lay the bills next to each other so not to have a mis understanding and that i had closed the plastic envelope before is left and my wife had not even touched it.. only the waiter had touched it.  The manager did not seem to know what to do, but said if i left my number he would call if it turned up. It was a bad situation for everyone. The lady;s sitting across from us leaned over to my wife and said ' we saw you pay the bill\"...  I finally decided that having my dad at the restaurant for 2 and a half hours was too long for him to be up so I just told them to keep our money and i left.  I guess i was hoping that the manager would say here is your 40 dollars change you asked for and we will find this mis-placed bill and work it out... i understand it is a bad situation but my dad now will never go back after 30 years and is telling everyone he sees about the lost of  his money.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b4242329453:0xaf13e57fcb31a1d7"}

It would have been nice to have a complimentary appetizer or two brought to the table by the manager to appologize for the excessive wait time. Nope. So we resorted to asking the waitress for bread which they despise because they are not supposed to bring them out till after you order.

The service was very poor (despite not being particularly busy, in the ~2 hours of our being there, the server only voluntarily visited our table 3-4 times).\n\nAs for the meal itself, the iced tea I was served tasted funny. The dish I ordered had a choice of New York Strip or Filet Mignon and, despite not indicating a preference, the server never asked me which I\u2019d like. The Caesar salad had maybe 3-5 shavings of parmesan on it and the lettuce was rather limp and not crisp. The shrimp scampi was fine; it tasted of garlic and not much else. The wood-grilled shrimp was meh; it was lackluster in terms of flavor, due in part to its complete lack of seasoning. In general everything was pretty bland.The \u201csteamed\u201d broccoli was instead maybe half-steamed, i.e. it was half-raw, therefore rather crunchy. And even the ~$11 Lobster Tail was over-cooked, dry, and bland (also it wasn\u2019t served with butter).\n\nBased on this experience, I would recommend going to a different location or, if you find that the quality does not improve elsewhere, pick a different restaurant altogether. 3/10.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b4242329453:0xaf13e57fcb31a1d7"}

There weren't that many people there. Stopped at the hostess stand and she was on the phone talking to someone about a lost article. No big deal so we waited several minutes while she finished her phone conversation. There was also a male employee who was stacking menus who just ignored us. The female hostess gets off the phone and seats us. We look through the menu and make our selections. I realized that we still had not even been greeted even though 3 other tables had been seated after us and were approached by their waiters and were given drinks and biscuits. Still no waiter even though there were two waiters standing by our booth right behind my husband. Our booth was at the end so they were just a couple of feet from us and I am sure that they could hear our conversation wondering why we didn't have a waiter. At that point I pulled out my cellphone to keep track of the time. We had been sitting there for almost fifteen minutes when a female waiter passed us and said our waiter would be there in just a minute. A few minutes more went by before a female waiter who had an order of food to deliver paused at our table and asked if we knew what we wanted to drink. I told her that we had been sitting there for quite some time and already knew what we wanted to order to eat. She said okay that she would be right back and would take good care of us. I saw her deliver the food and then go to another table to take their order. My husband and I just looked at each other and got up and left. I can't believe that there were waiters standing around and nobody had waited on us in all that time. It was inexcusable and I will be sure to let everyone we know what poor service we were given.

This time, Niadja, our waitress was caring; but she gave us dinner pricing when our visit was at lunchtime. Is it legal to charge dinner prices at lunch claiming that the sizes are larger without notice or consent from the customer? We never got the towelettes we requested until the end, either.  In Japan, for instance, a nice hot cloth towel is afforded to the patrons prior to eating. On the same note, Japanese peeps don\u2019t wear shoes indoors either so why would we expect for an American restaurant to provide us hand wipes prior to eating? Our seats were too close together, so we moved. But, the table we moved to wobbled and caused damages to us as well as to our belongings. Thomas, the manager was rude and indifferent. Niadja was to apply a $4.00 coupon which led to our finding out about the pricing deceit. Our hot-spot was being used; but Thomas wouldn't let us use their DSL to get the $4.00 coupon from our Trash. Thank GOD $4.00 won't break us since GOD has given us so much. It's the principal of the matter, though. On our visit previously, a man came in seeking stuff and it was not until he started to bother other guests did management ask him to leave. Plus $1000 was stolen from an acquaintance of ours from her purse while she and her friends were eating there a while ago. On second thought, the people there are very unhappy, the waitresses never smile and purposely catch your eye only to give you a mean look.
