My scheduled appointment time ended up not working so we rescheduled, he called me and said something had come up and got me in immediately which worked perfectly for me. I appreciated his ability to fit me in so quickly.\n\nHe is very professional, well spoken, and knowledgeable. I knew I was opening an account, my wife was with me, she wasn't planning on investing but thankfully ended up doing so after a short talk with him. Can't say enough good about him, already made a great return on my investment.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889cbbef80cfdf1:0xa1f7dc3d030440a3"}
