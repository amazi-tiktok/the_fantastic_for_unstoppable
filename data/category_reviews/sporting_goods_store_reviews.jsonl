After talking with Ben, the manager, I was pretty impressed with the business and the level of knowledge and technical skills the staff demonstrated.  I was impressed enough that I returned last week with my Canyon for a much needed tune up and preventative maintenance.  JT and James took a lot of time with me to ensure that they fully understood what I wanted while simultaneously inputting their maintenance advice to absolutely ensure that my servicing plan was exactly what I needed.  I valued their advice because as part of my service I wanted new cables, chain, front disk brake (slight warp), and new wheel bearings.  They agreed with the cables and chain but went out of their way to straighten the disk brake and clean, inspect, and re-grease the bearings, which of course wound up being a much greater value for the money, at least on my side of the deal.  I have around 100 miles on the service and the replacement parts and the service adjustments and tuning are perfect. These small things combined with the quality of the final product earn Trek Bicycles of Auburn a great deal of trust from me, which in turn ensures that I will make that tedious drive every time I need service for my bike.  Additionally, for new bike purchases and bike accessory needs the store has many bikes on hand and nearly every accessory that one should want or need.

As soon as he tried it it was obvious one shifter didnt work at all and the rear derailleur was never adjusted. Tech refused to own that they didnt check it well before sending it out. Ordered shifter never called me to let me know. Installed shifter, never called me to let me know it was done. When I picked the bike up the rear tire was missing entire sections of tread and both tires have red mud on them even though my son only rode in the grass. Again, tech refuses to take ownership of the problem and points to me. Taken my bike there twice for repairs/adjustments but nothing is ever fixed. They also take over a week to receive brake pads for bikes they stock. Why on earth do you not stock such a common part? Service guys cannot handle a task as simple as documenting my phone number.

I could get deployed today and have to fight for the very person who does not look at me as a part of the military!  I was going to let it go, but I couldn't. I called the business this afternoon and expressed how I was offended. His defense was that he was told that a reservist in the military is basically nothing but a part time position. He did offer me a full refund, but I told him that it wasn't about the money for me. He needs to do more research on his own and take care of ALL military members or no one at all!

I explained that I had read about the business online and wanted more information about renting guns and test firing on the gun range.  It was at this point that I was told there were new requirements to be able to use the range.  First requirement was to determine why I wanted to use the range.  Second requirement was that an individual had to have someone with them with a pistol permit, to which I replied that I did.  At this point it all started to seem like he was just making things up because he had decided he wasn't about to let me use the range.  He then asked how many rounds I had shot.  I explained that I had taken a course with my local police department and had spent time shooting a 9mm, a .40 caliber and my .38 special.  I told him maybe 100 rounds to which he said his requirement was 150 rounds.  He told me to bring an experienced person back with me before I could use the range.

I bought the rifle at another gun shop for $60 more, but I'll gladly pay more for service.  I have two other guns I'm thinking about getting in the next year or so.

Well if you were there asking questions, then you must not know to much. If you do know that much, Why were you in there asking questions? Get over yourself. To the guy who said he has the only gun range around mobile so he thinks he can charge what he wants.... You sir are an idiot. There are a total of 4 gun ranges in mobile. Do some research before you pop off at the mouth degrading the way some one runs there business. The other gun ranges in mobile all charge the same amount to shoot. You too can get over yourself. I have done business with robert and many other gun stores in mobile. I prefer going to robert because he takes care of me. I may not agree with some of the things he does or the way he does things but in the end, I got what I came for and got it at a good price with friendly service.

And by all means it should have been half that time. There really weren't many people in the store. Crafts that were supposed to start at noon didn't begin till around 12:30 and the craft person was stale and thoroughly uninterested in their job. Before when we had come there was quite a bit of interaction and Mrs. Clause even came over to help.\nIt was a total waste of time coming out here. Their restaurant isn't even open anymore.

They were marked down from $44.99. I went and did about 15 more minutes of shopping and went to check out (at 0925 AM). At check out the item showed up as $44.99 and I said I would take it over to refund for them to research the price further. The associate at the refund desk stated the price was never $17.99 and there was no sign there showing it was ever that price. My wife walked back there and could you imaging the signs mysteriously vanished from the time I picked up the item at the rack to the time I went to check out. I was made to look like a liar and a cheat by the refund associate and Bass Pro. The only thing they had to say was they had mistakenly left the sales signs up from the weekend and I would have been okay with that. Instead I had to listen to the other refund associate say I was in the right and the signs were removed late but she could not make the other associate listen to her. Funny how they want to thank you for your military service one minute and then make you out to be a liar in front of other customers the next. I will no longer be shopping at the Bass Pro Spanish Fort location and I would suggest that all customers take photos of sales prices on the racks for they are to be susceptible removed at a moments notice to prove the customer is wrong and vendor is in the right.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a430e72ad1fc5:0xde568058c6022035"}

It had been a while since I was last in there.  I have never had an issue before but this time I was there to spend some money.  I went up to look at a  rifle scope that I had been looking at online.  I went upstairs and took the long way to get there.  We were greeted properly walking in so didn't see any reason to think anything else.  We walked through the bows, then walked past the rifle racks to the scopes.  The guys working the counter were working with other customers so I looked around, I found the one I wanted to see.  In that process, I found another that I was interested in I looked up to see the status of the salespeople and they were over on the other side talking to each other and what looked to be looking at a phone behind the counter.  I left the counter went to check on kids who were by the aquarium.  We walked around and I decided I was going to get both of the scopes I found.  I went back and both salespeople were talking to one person.  So while I was waiting, I found a third scope I wanted.  The lady they were talking to left and they went back to the other end of the counter and did what they were doing before.  Now I don't like when a salesperson hovers over me, but I have worked in retail enough to at least let a customer know I am there to help.  I couldn't even get that out of them, so we walked away.  They missed a out a $4K sale.  I am not going to beg for them to help me.  They weren't busy.  The way I see it is they were just busy ignoring me.  Walking to the exit, I found a gear bag for a decent price and decided to buy it.  The man at the cash register was awesome.  If the guys at the gun counter were, Bass Pro would have sold me a lot more than a $12.99 bag.  I will go back again.

He went into the tracker boat section, spoke with two elderly gentlemen, he doesnt rememeber his name but the gentleman that let him back in the building after looking at the boats outside didnt say anything to him, just opened the door and walked away. So he approached another gentleman sitting at the desk, asked about one of the boats they had outside and about financing, the gentleman\u2019s response was if you dont have a 700 or better they wont finance you and they wont finance anything under $5000.00. Assuming because of how my husband looked that his score was under a 700. So my husband went inside and started looking at kayaks, he was up there for close to an hour and was not approached one time by a sales associate to see if he needed help, at that point he left the store. So not only did you lose a possible sale on a boat you also lost out on the sale of a kayak.

I received a notification that they had primers in stock, so I went to place an order. They were asking $315/1000 for Federal small pistol match primers and $250 for Federal large rifle primers. These normally go for about $50 and $40 respectively. They are 100% trying to take advantage of people due to the shortage. Between this and the fact that they are probably one of the worst reviewed companies I've ever seen I can't believe anybody gives this place a dime. It'd probably be less painful to burn the money you were going to give them and throw yourself down the stairs.\n\nEdited to add:  Your response is laughable. All the reputable stores (Midway USA, Natchez, Brownells, Cabelas, etc.) are still selling primers for regular price. They just sell out as soon as they get them in stock so you need to have in stock alerts set up and be ready to buy immediately. You look even worse for trying to justify being a price gouger.\n\nEdited to add again:  I see you've changed your response from justifying your price gouging to now claiming there is some coordinated effort to attack your company.  I personally don't know, nor have I communicated in any way with any of the other reviewers.  If you think reviews from perspective buyers who opted not to buy from your company due to shady business practices are irrelevant, then you are a complete moron.

You and the public set the price.  If these primers were any lower cost, you would not be able to buy them because some else would have already bought all of them.  The only reason you have any chance at all buy some is due to the fact they are priced at the low end of the market price, any lowered and they sell out instantly before you even get a chance.  So is it better not to be able to buy any at all, or is it better to be able to pay a little more and just buy enough for you immediate needs.  The public sets the price they are willing to pay.  When the goods are priced lower than market, they are gone instantly ad most people never have the chance to buy any at all.  More often than most people realize the market price for some things is far below cost and dealer and distributors end up selling them at a loss.  The good must continue to move, it does no good to eave product on the shelve that doesn't, it gets discounted until it reaches the market price and ten it will finally sell and if that is below cost we have to eat it.

I ordered an item from Amazon. an air purifier. It was sent \"adult signature required\" in error by the warehouse. That is different than \"signature required\" shipping. Adult sig required  means no changes, no address change, no local UPS store pickup. LG outdoors tried to change it on Thursday. I tried to have it re-routed and couldnt. Saturday delivery was not even an option. I had no way to sign for the package without taking time off work. I could only pick up from a UPS hub that was over an hour from my house so I had UPS return the item. The item arrived back to them on Friday. On Tuesday I told them to just send the item back via regular shipping. A man from customer service and I had a pleasant conversation about this on Thursday. This week Shelly has been in. On Tuesday she said she was waiting on the warehouse to respond to their emails. Today which is Wednesday I sent another email asking for an update since I was suppose to hear back by end of business on Tuesday. Shelly told me they were still waiting on the warehouse and I should hear back by the end of the day today. I told her that is exactly what you told me yesterday. She then said they were waiting to hear back from me on if I wanted a refund or return shipment. I told her that we had emailed yesterday about just sending it back and that everything she has told me so far has been a lie and all seems repetitive. Shelly then raised her voice, changed her tone to a very condescending one. After you all made an error and I still was patient and tried to work you, you give me the customer and attitude and hang up the phone? So yes. #$%* you just give me a refund. I even called back to give her another chance. She answered the phone with an attitude. Look at their feedback on amazon and on here. It seems Shelly has been losing more business than her services are worth.  Their negative reviews are increasing according to their amazon profile. 20% over the past year and now 28% over the past 6 months with less reviews being left. My advice is to close the doors on Shelly or close the doors on your 20 year old business. I will work with you to correct an error and we tried that until she got involved.

Although the gun came quickly and sales staff is friendly the owner himself seems a bit off balance.  I am active duty military stationed in AL and when I went to pick up the rifle I showed my military ID and my AL concealed carry permit.  The owner wanted a copy of my USMC orders bringing me here to AL and when I stated that is not something we generally carry on our persons, he stated it was federal law. When I questioned him in an attempt to get a better understanding of the law and using as example in the last 18 months I have purchased weapons from Walter Craig, Gulf States Distributors, and Gander Mountain in Montgomery with no requirement to furnish a copy of my military orders, he no kidding exploded!  Literally told me to get the (f-bleep) out of his store and he would charge me for a restocking fee!  This was one of the most insane and oddest moments I have ever had in a retailers shop.  This experience is difficult to describe in believable terms and was rather off putting.  As far as I could tell he was the only angry person on the premises.\n\nI was able to talk to his sales staff and they explained that it was his policy.  I understand that and the information upfront would have been extremely helpful.  I want to comply with any reasonable store policies and would have had I known this was an issue for the owner.  In the end my wife was able to email me a copy and I completed the transaction.  His salesman saved the purchase and I truly believe he is a sincere and helpful person.\n\nHaving said all that I really think purchasing from this establishment is a mistake and I wish I would have walked after the verbal assault and string of profanities.  If you do decide to venture into his place of business be careful; He appeared genuinely angry (which should concern any responsible gun owner), completely narcissistic, not open to any conversation that would question his authority, and is armed!  This man went from 0 to 100 in a nano-second over an issue that I still can\u2019t quite figure out.  Could be he is not a fan of the Marine Corps or the military in general...hope that is not the case and he was just having a bad day but I won\u2019t trust him with my business again.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1482593794721, "text": "We have an A+ rating on the BBB\nhttps://www.bbb.org/us/al/wetumpka/profile/sporting-goods-retail/lg-outdoors-0463-90021317\n\nIf you want true reviews of our company then please check out our reviews at resellerratings.com where we have over 3,726 reviews with an average of 4.72 out of 5.\nhttps://www.resellerratings.com/store/LG_Outdoors\n\nWhen we send out our customer satisfaction emails we use Reseller Ratings.

When I arrived, fresh from having an MRI which made me hurt even worse from laying flat, I saw a ride along cart and got on it. I was having a very hard time walking. The cart was over half charged but the only one on that side. (Of course plenty were left out in the parking lot, guess I should have gotten one of those.) Anyway, as I'm starting to go, a greeter tells me, ma'am, that was is being charged, and needs to continue charging. Made me feel like I couldn't use it. So I took it back, and hobbled to shop best I could. I couldn't get everything I needed, because the pain was excruciating. She did not offer to find me one, either. The more I hobbled around, the more it irritated me. I should have gotten her name and contacted corporate. I know who to contact as I used to work for Wal-Mart before I became fully disabled. I am so disabled, I had a \"tough judge\" and they concluded that I couldn't work ANY job. But this lady made me feel as if I couldn't use the cart which was well over half charged. I know she was a medium complicated, a bit heavy set and wore glasses. I will still contact corporate over this. I had a helper with me, but couldn't stay in the store long enough to finish shopping. My helper had to just take my groceries to checkout for me as I hobbled back to my handicapped parking spot to wait in the passenger side. It's already bad enough that the store was out of a lot of stuff, but the thing I am really upset about was being treated like I didn't need the cart. Next time I will be quite rude instead of my usual nice personality. That lady should be put in the backroom on cap 2 where she belongs. A greeter, who is part of AP, should be very nice and accommodating. When I worked at Wal-Mart I always went above and beyond for customers. Customers are who buys the things that pay employees. If I didn't live 40 minutes away from a Wal-Mart I would go back and get her name. I do plan to, but will go ahead tomorrow and contact corporate. I will not go back to whittlesey rd Wal-Mart ever again, except to get her name. None of my family, nor myself will ever shop there again. Do better, and don't treat people less than, it will only lead to write ups and dismissal. Very dissappointed and hurt honestly. Wish that lady had to live in my body for a whole week. She would be crying in pain every day and see why she should treat people better. And anyone reading this, when you are treated badly at any Wal-Mart, go and complain to CORPORATE. The managers may not do anything, but corporate takes things like this seriously. And know that the Wal-Mart employees make at least $13 an hour now. They should be doing MUCH better.

Before the door could shut, Jenn walks out the other door behind the register and greets me with a friendly salutation and asks, \"How may I assist you today?\" I'm thinking, \"Am I actually at Walmart?\" I tell her, give her my order number and ID (which she politely requested), she finds the info on her screen, and before walking to the back asks, \"Would you like some water while you wait?\" As she reaches behind her.\n\nWAIT, WHAT? Did she just offer me water? I decline, she excuses herself to fetch my package and I look behind the counter to see a small fridge. SHE DID offer me water... I had to check the sign to remind myself that I was at Walmart and not some fancy schmancy store.\n\nShe brings the order out, confirms it, does whatever she has to while making small talk, I sign for it and I'm out...took less than 7 minutes.\n\nStill in a daze, I walk to Electronics to find the Apple TV thing.

He quickly, without hesitation, stops whatever he was doing and promptly unlocks a cabinet, all the while greeting me and informing me about the item I've requested.\n\nSo now I'm really paranoid, cause he has actual KNOWLEDGE of the item...this has got to be the TWILIGHT ZONE! He rings it up along with my other stuff while chatting away. Everything done, he thanks me for shopping at Walmart (really) and I'm out!\n\nI still don't like this location and wouldn't go back unless by force, but this was a great experience for which I HAD TO write about.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccb4e83b2b117:0x1b62484355485945"}

On two occasions I had to wait until the next day. Today my groceries were to be ready by 9am. I knew they were running behind so I arrived at 11am. I sat in my car with my 8 year old daughter for over an hour before I could get an employee to talk to me and no on would answer my phone. By the time my groceries were brought to my car it was 1:05 pm AND my car battery had died. When I told the Walmart employee that my car battery had died because I had waited so long I received a blank stare and he walked away. Thanks to the kindness of strangers who were also being held hostage waiting for their groceries I was able to get jumped off and on my way after sitting in your parking lot for almost 2 1/2 hours. My advise to you is to communicate clearly and quickly with your customers. Making them wait for over an hour before you even acknowledge them is unacceptable. You had my money and you had my groceries so what choice do I have other than to wait when no one will communicate to me when I should expect my groceries.\nI have been a loyal Walmart grocery online customer since the program started in my area last October, check your records. I use this program because I am a working mother of 3 and this allows me to spend more time with my family and less time walking up and down aisle of the grocery store. Well on three occasions now I have waited an hour or more... I could have done the shopping myself. Needless to say I'm done. I was a loyal Winn Dixie customer before online grocery and since it is no longer a reliable, time- saving service I will be headed back to Winn Dixie. I was nice while it lasted but if you continue to conduct business in this manner you will lose more customers than just me.\nBest of luck!\nName: Heather Davenport\nCustomer ID: 56782149", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccb4e83b2b117:0x1b62484355485945"}

My partner was at the coinstar machine & it took his coins without giving an accurate count. There was a customer service center employee by the name of Virginia Love that came to his aide because she saw it happen too. I walked up as they were on the phone with coinstar customer service, but what blew me was the fact that an employee by the name of VONICE was tasked with helping them solve this issue and she had a horrible attitude about it. She wasn't looking us in the face at all, and when we asked her questions, she'd mumble something and walk away. She wasn't giving us direct answers AT ALL, and she was getting upset with my partner as if it was his fault the machine malfunctioned. She was speaking to Miss Virginia Love SO disrespectfully. it was disgusting how bad her attitude was, ESPECIALLY with how rude she was being to Miss Love, who is visibly older than her. Everyone knows not to disrespect your elders. Miss Love was only trying to help my parter so they would know he wasn't lying. I understand that there is only so much they can do with the coinstar machine without a coinstar vendor present, but VONICE had an attitude from the start. There was another very round woman that came to unlock the machine, she had an attitude as well, but her name tag was flipped over so I couldn't see it. She called my partner \"shawty,\" as if that was professional. she said \"scu'me shawty\" WHAT? Why is that your preferred choice of communication when interacting with customers? The whole experience was mind blowing. However, I am very appreciative of Miss Virginia Love for all of her support, considering how rude the other employees were. It's quite obvious that Miss Love should've been in a higher position as opposed to VONICE who clearly needs more training.

This is getting beyond ridiculous, especially after asking about the products to an employee and being assured it would be there on X date and it wasn't.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888959c2010cabad:0xcfc4c03312773777"}

I don't know if I'll have space for this story so here's the abbreviated version. I have to say 1st that I have always loved Walmart, in general. Cheap prices and they have everything. I won't get into all of the politics of it. I just loved them. Went here at 11:30 pm to get a pre-workout protein bar. Parked, turned off my SUV, (which has heavily tinted windows) and was looking for my headphones. Guy tries to open my passenger front door. I hop out and he immediately bolts and jumps into another vehicle. So far, nothing here is Walmart's fault. Went in to tell the manager that someone is breaking into cars and to call the police. I'll never forget the manager's response. \"You'll have to call them yourself. It happens so often that they don't even come when we call them anymore\". So, there are times when one of my kids needs diapers or medicine and everything else is closed so I'll go. And there are times during the day when I need something that costs twice as much every where else I've checked so I'll go. But, I never go alone and it's always super quick. Here's the point. It's a Walmart. Just like every other Walmart. But when the employees aren't even willing to go through the trouble of picking up a phone for criminal acts happening on their property, then I'm never going to feel safe with my family at that store. We all know Walmart has cut way back on security in order to cut rising costs (caused in large part by theft). I'm just one person in, what I am assuming is, a sea people that have actually felt the sting of those cutbacks.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888959c2010cabad:0xcfc4c03312773777"}

I was sent to sylacauga after waiting 5 and a half hours to have a battery tested and returned. Yeah, I admit it was about 20 minutes after the tire/ auto center was supposed to have closed, but I was told by the Talladega employee that a manager at the customer service counter, in sylacauga, would go back and swap out my battery.\n\nSo, I mule in this battery to the customer service desk. The cashier told me the auto dept was closed. I replied that a manager was expecting me. Cashier called the customer service manager up, I explained things to her. She said id have to come back tomorrow as well cause they lock up their batteries at night. I asked if anyone in the building had keys. Frustrated she had to do her job, she hops on the phone. Just a few minutes later she yelled across the customer service area, and said I had to follow her.\n\nSo I tried, she made sure that she was a good 20' in front of me so she could talk with her coworker without being overheard. Im a disabled veteran. I have to pick and choose when I can hurry, and after hauling this heavy battery around for the better part of a day, I was all out of get up and go. And I especially don't care for your small town, holyer- than- thou attitude cause you \"have to turn a key\". It's called doing your job.\n\nAnyways, so I make my way back to the battery area. The manager there went on to state several reasons he couldn't do the exchange. From me not having a receipt (handed it to him, with the last exchange receipt) to the battery being old (the color coded sticker dates it back to November of 2018), and finally the managers settled on being unable to do the exchange because the computer says it's already been exchanged. That's 100%, I traded the last box of garbage for this one.\n\nI'll be calling corporate after lunchtime today.\n\nSummation: the employees are killing this big box store. Don't visit Talladega or Sylacauga. They are both garbage and could care less about the customer.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888959c2010cabad:0xcfc4c03312773777"}

There is absolutely NO REASON for a customer to have a cart full of one hundred items of clothes and food, to ever be in the self-service lines. There is not space to accommodate so many items. There must be a limit of NO MORE THAN 25 ITEMS AT SELF-SERVICE REGISTERS. ALL OTHERS MUST BE RE-DIRECTED TO CASH REGISTERS WITH WALMART ATTENDANTS. Doing so will reduce Walmart theft, reduce costs to customers caused by theft, and will allow lines at self- service registers to move quickly, which is the purpose for self-service in the first place. I have seen a husband with one cart and his wife with a second cart, with 6-packs of drinks dangling over the top of carts. This practice must be stopped by Wal-Mart.

After waiting in line for several minutes and making to that front the young lady says \"cards only\" I tell her I'm paying in cash and she tells me \"I guess you will have to go get in the other lines\" and turns away. So we go to one of the self checkout with the belts and when we make it there it too says 'card only'. Next we try customer service but there is a customer having trouble with a return and they turn the lights out on us so we finally go to the tobacco line. Probably should have done that to begin with. So on the way out I call the 1800walmart number to complain her answer was the cash shortage that happened a few months ago or she said \"at least that's what they tell me\". I'm sure it was someone that has to count down the cash from the self checkout at night decided they wanted to leave early so they pulled all the cash and switched the registers to card only.

So I will be going back. I just wanted you all to know how lucky you are to have such a kind and helpful employee.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862119337809d89:0xf73913acf5ad4f61"}

On Sunday, I arrived at 12:15 and saw 3 other cars waiting in the designated spots for pick-up.  When I pushed to red button to let the crew know of my arrival, they sounded confused and told me \"we'll work it out.\"  About 10 minutes later, an employee came out to my car and very humbly apologized that my order and the one for the man in the truck next to me had not been noticed, but that they would get the man's order out, then mine would be next, as quickly as they could.  Fifteen minutes after that, the employee pushed the man's order out to his car, unloaded it, and proceeded to have a TWENTY minute discussion with that customer!!!  They were hidden from my view by the man's massive truck, but I could hear them talking - just in regularly toned voices, no yelling or sounds of anyone upset - couldn't hear what they were saying, however.  When the employee finally went back inside the store, it was another 10 minutes before he got my order out to my car!  He again very humbly apologized and blamed the man in the truck for \"needing to talk about something\".  At this time, I had been waiting almost an HOUR!  I could have gone inside and done my own shopping, then been back out to my car by then!  I was NOT happy, as  it was lunchtime, and my whole family was at home texting me and asking when I would be home with the groceries for lunch!  This service sounds like a convenient option, but in my case, it wasted a lot of my time!  I'm not sure I'll use this service again if I risk having my order overlooked.

The reason I say that is because they have no cashiers. Everything must be self checkout.  And the problem with that is there are not enough self check outs for the number of customers in the store. In addition the self checkouts  do not all work.  The few that are open and they do not seem to have anybody available to help. I actually saw 1 customer  Leave the store with a full shopping cart as he CV old not pay or get help. I was considering leaving as well. But   I really needed the items so I left for 10 minutes and then came back and was able to use the self check out.\n\nWhat is the purpose of being open 24 hours if you're not going to be  staffed?  They seem to have plenty of people on the floor stocking shelves but no cashiers.\n\nPerhaps the are trying to cut back on pay roll because of the holiday is but that's terrible. As I said if you're gonna be open 24 hours you need to have employees working.\n\nAlso on another note the service desk closes at 10 so customers cannot do any returns after 10pm.\n\nTarget is a much better run store and company.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888903f508190cb3:0x56624955ad684461"}

If I\u2019m checking myself out, I need a discount. Not everyone was made for checking yourself out. Most all of the scan and go were full. Well I found a scan and go open. Found this lady with a yellow vest on and ask about paying for my pictures. She tells me I will need to go to the back to the photo department to pay for them. I said okay, I\u2019ll check myself out and then I will go pay. So I proceeded to check myself out. Well unfortunately I had a item that didn\u2019t have a price tag. So what do you do? Is there some way I can call for a price check? Nope! So I proceeded to look around for help. Found someone in a yellow vest. She called some other guy in a yellow vest. She stands there in my way of checking myself out looking for a price on something  for another customer. Anyway, the guy ask me where I got the 2019 item. I said, in the back. Then he said, I don\u2019t know the price on this item.  I said, that\u2019s fine I will just leave that here and not get that item.\nFinished my self checkout. Go to the back to pay for my pictures. Walk back there and they are changing out the register. The lady says I can check you out in the back. Looks at my pictures and tells me I need a copyright to the picture I took of my sons graduation picture.  She said I can\u2019t give you this picture. So already irritated from my whole trip and wondering were this lady was the hour I had sit here looking for help. I said, that\u2019s fine. Shred those, that\u2019s fine. I just want to pay for the other pictures. She looks at me like I\u2019m crazy. I said the ones you have in your hand. I have several pictures there that doesn\u2019t have a copyright. I want to pay for those.\nI have never complained about any store or any customer service.\nYour customer service is terrible! Scan and go is ridiculous!

What's funny about that is that they run out of stuff that isn't common items, there are always people stocking day and night, and they can be out of an item for over a month (with me checking every week for over a month).\n\nTo list a few of uncommon items they were out of for over a month is tarter powder in the baking section and evening primrose oil in vitamins. There is absolutely no way that for over a month every bottle of tarter powder was bought up. And I don't mean at Christmas time, I'm talking about in June they are out of spices. Ridiculous. The manager or the ordering system doesn't do its job properly. That's the only reason why these things would consistently be out of stock.\n\nWorkers are always stocking items which means they have pallets of items all over the floor even at rush hours when people are getting off of work. The floor itself has too many floor displays which makes it really hard to navigate around them and the large amount of people that tend to be there.\n\nThere is also a huge lack of items regardless of what department you are looking in. The kids clothes is always understocked and has horrible selection. The home section with pots and pans is always lacking anything you could possibly be looking for. I literally couldn't find a basic set of salt and pepper shakers. I've even had to search for basic toothpaste because they were out of all Colgate.\n\nWhen it's time for school shopping, the aisles that contain those items are very clutter and disorganized. You can never find anything. And even when it's not school shopping time, there is still a lack of items where you can find them.\n\nThe electronics section sucks as well. If you are looking for a particular item, they never have it. Period. I even struggled a few months ago to find usb drives. Seriously.\n\nThe meat department never has the cuts of meat I need, even down to the kind of ground beef I buy.\n\nThe whole store is barely worthwhile to go to.\n\nThe only reason I shop here is because it's the only store in the area unless you want to pay triple the price at Publix. This Walmart is more like a Dollar General when it comes to availability of items. The only reason this store succeeds is because no other store has moved into the area. Fingers crossed that we'll get a Super Target or something in the next few years.\n\nFor clothes and any kind of real shopping I drive to the Walmart in Trussville. It's well worth the drive because they are very organized and the selection is always great.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888903f508190cb3:0x56624955ad684461"}

I can have 10 items on list and you can bet they are out of 4 or 5. Some have been out for weeks. Thankfully we have a Publix, Foodland and Winn Dixie in area. Walmart only has a minimum number of manned registers open, they are trying to force everyone to use scan n go and bag their own groceries, lift them into your cart etc. I am a very healthy and very capable, very good mind 82 year old female but I refuse to ck myself out and bag them after paying the high prices for the few items they happen to have.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888903f508190cb3:0x56624955ad684461"}

That being said, the only thing keeping me from giving them a different is for these reasons:\n\n1.)  a single star rating is whenever I\u2019ve had an issue, they fixed the problem to make things right. It didn\u2019t matter if we did online ordering or in-store shopping, it was corrected by whichever one handled the original order.\n\n2.) a 2-star rating because the last 3 or 4 times I\u2019ve been to the store the cashiers were wearing genuine smiles and greeted me when I came up to their lane, were friendly and held a pleasant conversation while they worked, bagged my groceries the way they should\u2019ve been bagged, and seemed like they were there to work and not just be there for a paycheck. The cashier lanes weren\u2019t overly packed. The last 2 or 3 times I was there, the staff stalking shelves asked me if they could help me with something rather than me having to ask them for help or me walking away frustrated which was actually pleasant for a change. The staff that I did ask for help from were awesome too. Both sets of stalkers went the extra mile and did what any person in the customer service industry should do for a customer.\n\nThank you to those wonderful individuals who worked the last few times I\u2019ve been to the store. You guys were awesome and WalMart should have more people like you! Keep up the excellent work!\n\nOverall, what keeps them from getting either a negative star rating (if only it were possible) or even a 4-5 star rating is for reasons listed above. Especially since 9 out of 10 times they are out of the majority of everything, they are massively understaffed, most of the employees are rude and can be even ruder if they feel you are a nuisance when asking for help or interrupting their personal phone conversations, you can\u2019t get through most of the aisles because there\u2019s pallets of stock everywhere, and when we order online the store substitutes items that either is nowhere remotely close to the ordered item or doesn\u2019t use their noggins and give the correct item from their shelves because the item became out of stock online (which means staff if you have it on your shelves, even if the online item says \u201cout of stock\u201d, substitute the same exact item from your shelf and not something entirely different), or they gave my order away to another individual. Yes I know you have the option to reject items but when you go into the store and find the exact same item you ordered on the shelf it kind of irks a person off, especially if it happens more oft than not. There has to be a line drawn somewhere because patience one\u2019s behalf and ignorance on another\u2019s only goes so far.\nFor the record, it was explained to me this way:  when you do your shopping online their stock is a separate entity from the actual store\u2019s stock. In other words if it\u2019s out of stock online it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s out of stock in the store.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888903f508190cb3:0x56624955ad684461"}

I have trouble getting my own photos developed there, because they are continuously falsely accusing them of being professionally done.  I can request them from the Walmart website and have them delivered without question or harrasment.  They purposefully denied an enlargement for a wedding gift.  The photo had two men getting married in it, so I question the employees reasoning for not allowing the enlargement.  Throughout the years, I've complained to management.  But management does not care and never wants to hear it.  They will not back their prices.  One time, they had a display of socks marked at one price and at the register I was charged another.  When I noted it to the manager, she just rudely ripped off the pricing sign, charged us the higher cost, and seemed more upset about me having some perceived audacity of complaining.

I had the best experience in 20 plus years of playing golf and having a few fittings in the past.\n\nThe young man Mark Krystyn was a superstar, when it comes to professionalism and product knowledge. He gave me an iron fitting and had me walking out of the store very satisfied. The only problem I had with the entire session was that it had to end.\n\nLiving in Florida was the only reason that I did not pull the trigger on the purchase, and Mark never pressured me to purchase, what he did say is because you live in Jacksonville Fl area (4 hours away) if I am not satisfied with wanting to purchase the irons in Jacksonville he can order the irons and have them delivered to me.\n\nI told him, my issue is if I need something done To the clubs the distance is to far from my residence.\n\nTop notch Fitter and Organization. KUDOS to Mr. Watson for having Mark on the team.\n\nUmar Abdul-Hakeem", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889292697ea71383:0x1f72d9e8857369d5"}
