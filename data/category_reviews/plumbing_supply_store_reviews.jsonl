Nice , clean,  professional and $350 less expensive.\n\nI should point out that I cannot judge the quality of their work. All  other reviews indicate they are good at what they do. Their inability to not show without notice was the cause for my low review. We had family plans related to their work.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1563560476089, "text": "We regret that we could not get to you last week on Thursday, the day you scheduled for, and that you elected to go with another company. That day all of our plumbers except for the one assigned to do the work at your home already had very time sensitive, pressing, all day jobs that were presceduled to get started on early in the morning. Although the plumber assigned to you was called out to an emergency job early that morning we still had every intention of having him still come out to install your regulators and the extra line for your home as planned for that day. It wasnt until the morning started to progress forward in time that he realized he would not be able to get to you as planned due to him still diligently working to restore water at an elderly lady's home where she called very early that morning and said she had been without water since the day before so we had him rush right over. It was around mid morning at the time that he realized he wouldn't be able to make it to you as planned and we had to make the decision to attempt to reschedule with you since her emergency took presidence. Each and every customer and each job is truly important to us, we care greatly about the work that we do, our customers and how we serve them. We take pride in striving daily for complete satisfaction with every customer so we are very sorry to hear about your dissatisfaction. Sometimes there are circumstances and emergency situations that arise out of our control to where we may not be able to stick to our schedule as planned. Normally in a situation like that we would have just had one of our other plumbers come out that day in his place but each of them on that specific day were already on very pressing jobs that would take all day. That was a rare occasion but again sometimes there are circumstances that arise out of control to where true emergencies take presidence. Under these circumstances I do not think a two star review is warranted in this situation considering we gave you a free estimate, you called us back a couple weeks later after getting multiple other estimates from other companies to schedule a day for us to do the work at your home and we were unfortunately not able to get to it that day due to the circumstances listed above so we attempted to reschedule. The attempt was denied which resulted in us not performing any work at your residence. Again, we are so sorry if you were inconvenienced, we would love to speak with you more about this matter.

However, our recollection of events is a bit different. We initially arrived to install a pressure regulator at a rate that was half what you had been quoted by our competitors. We complete this work and you were seemingly satisfied! You then informed us that your nearly 60 year old shower faucet was leaking so we agreed to attempt to fix it as after you denied the price quoted  to replace it 350$. We replaced all parts that are available for your particular faucet. Then on an additional visit in an attempt to try our best to ensure complete customer satisfaction we proceeded to replace the same parts again for free (we purchased the new parts and did not charge any labor and did not charge you for the purchase of the parts) because we thought they may have been defective. It ended up being that it was not defective parts,  the leak was due to it being an almost 60 year old shower faucet.   Our total cost in parts at this point is over $60 however we still honored the original price quoted and informed you that the you needed a new faucet that we would purchase and replace the old one with for $350 . You responded that the next homeowner would have to deal with that issue. You paid and we were on our way. Since\nyou posted this review we have attempted to reach out to you multiple times and you have ignored us and tried to chargeback the entire 130$. We strive for complete customer satisfaction but sometimes we may fall short due to circumstances out of our control. However,  we attempted to contact you to no avail. Again we will still be glad to attempt to come to a resolution but communication is vital. We hope to hear back from you soon."}, "gmap_id": "0x888bc98fca445e2f:0x5fc3eb024a9e72c2"}

Truly, 53 HW saves me money and time.  Many home projects where I discover, elbow deep in it, I am missing one little fastener or that one piece to get done, 53 HW comes through.   Hey, they mix paint as well!  Good stuff to boot.  Recently they mixed a color for me that did not come out right. They took my number as they were closing.  The next day I received a call from the owner to let me know they figured it out and it was ready for pickup.  That kind of service with excellent price point and products is what you get from this store l.  Overall, 53 Hardware saves me a lot of time, frustration, and money.  That is well worth my short drive to 53 Hardware for that \"one thing\" at a good price, if not better than the big box.  If I know they have what I need, 53 Hardware is my primary place to shop for home DIY and other garden needs.
