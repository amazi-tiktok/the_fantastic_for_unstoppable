Great, but the issue here is that no one communicated with us that there would be a delay.  He talks in circles for a few minutes first blaming us, then the workers then he says he has \"no idea why they didn't come this morning\" ?? What?

It did not get complete because some of the wood did not match our floor (100% understandable!) We were told they would be back this morning to complete the work.  My husband takes the morning off of work and we have a photographer scheduled at 1pm to take photos to put our house on the market.  The morning passes and we never hear from anyone.  Finally my husband messages the worker directly and he said that they erew coming this afternoon instead.  Someone from James Carpets was supposed to reach out to us.  My husband has to take the full day off work and now we need to wait to put our house on the market.  Here's where the problem happened:\n\nI call the store to see what happened.  When I explain the situation to the lady who answered her reply was \"well, those phones fail us all the time dont they?  Is there anything else you need?\" I asked for a Manager to call me. Someone called about an hour later and his response was almost unbelievable.  He explained that they had to change the wood. Great, but the issue here is that no one communicated with us that there would be a delay.  He talks in circles for a few minutes first blaming us, then the workers then he says he has \"no idea why they didn't come this morning\" ?? What?  We all understand why they didn't come the issue is with why someone didn't communicate this to us which caused a major inconvenience.\n\nI do not recommend this company.

We understand your frustration with the initial installation of your flooring which resulted in our decision to terminate the original contractor. Obviously we were frustrated as well and we spoke with you at length over the phone about this. The errors he made have been corrected.  You called again with concern that the carpet was not fastened correctly in one area and, though after inspecting we determined there wasn't a problem, we still agreed to have a contractor come and re-stretch it in an effort to resolve your concern.  We disagree that \"they destroyed all the door frames\".  Yes, there was some slight damage done to some of the door frames but they were far from being \"destroyed\".  Your salesman offered to repaint those areas himself but you declined.  We have gone as far as discounting your invoice three times in an effort to appease you.  We have a two year labor warranty and we stand behind it.  The quality of work performed by subsequent contractors to correct the errors of the first was excellent.  Hill's Carpet & Floor Coverings has been in business at our main location since 1986.  The original owner sold the business to his nephew some 9 years ago and the original owner remains active in the business.  We are proud of our history of serving the greater Birmingham area by offering quality products, competitive prices, and professional installation.

Very pleasant experience with Clark with setting up my consultation. Cullen came out and did the consultation with me and my husband. It went well, and the price was very reasonable. He advised me that he would email me the proposal and to call him when we were ready.\n\nI waited for the email but never received it. However, I still called a week later and let him know we were ready to schedule but that I still haven't received the proposal email. I didn't feel comfortable calling to pay my deposit over the phone without a proposal. He wasn't at the office when I called but was going to call once he got settled. When he finally called, I wasn't available but I still didn't get a proposal email.\n\nSo I waited before calling back. Then Clark called and left a msg asking if my consultation went well and if I was ready to schedule. At that time I was not because I wanted the proposal on paper with the amount I was quoted. Never heard back.\n\nSo I called again Monday, 10/12 and spoke with a gentleman about scheduling (yes I was still willing to use this company because the price I was quoted was the best). He got my name and address and tried to look up an invoice or proposal and guess what, there was none!! He asked who did my consultation and I told him Cullen. He said he would get him to call me. Days later, I'm still waiting on my call.\n\nThe other 2 companies I've contacted this week have been very responsive and gotten me proposals within the same day of the consultation.

A week later I called back and spoke to sales person who came our days later to look at it. It took another week to get a call back where salesman asked for a convenient time for installer to come back. I gave him 2-days and timetable around my work schedule. Salesman said he would call installer and get back with me on day & time. I was assured installer would be back to repair on one of the days I provided but he would call back to confirm.\nOn the day installer was suppose to be here for repair I received a call from installer saying he was calling to set up the appointment. What?! You were were suppose to be here....\nI called the store and I got excuses from the lady sales person saying the installer was trying to call me.\nDon't bother calling these people..they don't know what they're doing and they are not customer service conscious. I won't be using them again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88628a63126bfe57:0x9447fbe40b350d14"}

They are not for the customer but only want to make a sell. My wife had a list of exactly what was needed from the person who was installing the flooring in our house and she showed the list to the people who work there. They showed my wife flooring and she picked the color she likes. Not knowing the type of floor was wrong. Remember these are the \u201cexperts\u201d. We unloaded all the floor at the house the next morning the person installing asked why they gave us the wrong stuff. We ended up having to return the floor which we would have purchased the right floor from them but they charged us a 20% restocking fee because they sold us the wrong floor. Knowing what was asked for and needed as my wife showed pictures of the subfloor.\n\nNonetheless they lost our business and stole 20% because they should have fit that bill due to their lack of of professionalism and customer service.\n\nIf you want the cheapest price maybe they are the place to go, who knows.

On that list were the items that they needed for a remodel and there was a quantity of flooring that they needed not a specific floor but just a quantity. We asked her what type of floor she was looking for so we helped her get a waterproof floor that she asked for. She had over 100 options to choose, yes we have a great variety at great low prices. Theirs was a 5mm/20mil wear layer at only $1.49 Sf by the way. She even took a sample of the entire piece. When they came to return the floor the installer came with her and he said that he seen the piece when they brought it to their home, he said that he seen the sample  when he was at the store. Why he did not mention he could not install that type of floor in that house we do not know (this was before the purchase was made). We gave her the floor she chose not a wrong one. She also read and signed a receipt that she still has that specifically says **no refunds** that\u2019s why we let people take samples so they make sure they take the correct floor for their home. As many people here know that this is a family and USMC veteran owned and operated store and we treat people with respect. We have extensive knowledge about flooring and helped her get a floor that was waterproof that they did not want to install. We then proceed calling our supplier which does take returns at a 20% cost. Which they claim we stole but we have to give that to our supplier to return the floor just like any other store that charges restocking fees for special orders. We tried to help them and get their money even though we do not take returns and they accepted the 20% from the supplier. We never sold a wrong floor. The customer saw and took a sample and we gave her that exact floor that all the names and numbers match to the sample to the receipt and to all the boxes they took. We never sold a wrong floor. We\u2019re just following store policies that she was well aware of when she signed and payed for her floor."}, "gmap_id": "0x888925dfcab2f593:0x34e9f2c50edd6c0b"}

Within the first few months the floor visibly began to cup and buckle and remains that way today. \tThe owner said he would, \u201cmake it right!\u201d \tWe have had to contact Old Gin Carpets over and over trying to get them to address this problem. However, well over a year after installation the problem with our floors remains. Our business with Old Gin Carpets has resulted in a loss of over $10,000 to repair the problem.\n\nAs part of a remodeling effort in our home, we had Old Gin Carpets install wood flooring in our main living area. After a few months we noticed a problem that I will refer to as \u2018cupping\u2019 on the new flooring. This effect was evident in all areas of the floor and worsened also resulting in \u2018bowing\u2019 in places where the floor raised high enough that it became a tripping hazard. I provided photos to Old Gin which was eventually followed by a visit from the owners, They told me that they had never seen anything like this and that they would do whatever needed to be done to, \u201cmake it right!\u201d I had hoped that such a strong statement by the owner would surely lead to a resolution.\n\nUnfortunately, months followed and it\u2019s been well over a year now since the flooring was installed. During that time we have lived with the constant embarrassment and humiliation of having to explain to guests why our floors are messed-up and why in all this time it hasn\u2019t been fixed. Old Gin has had multiple flooring inspectors look at the issue, but no exact cause has been mentioned. I have consulted with 2 licensed general contractors who have independently concluded that the lack of installation of a proper vapor barrier beneath the flooring is the most likely cause. It was also determined that there were no existing water leaks. I have also examined the National Wood Flooring Association and the flooring supplier\u2019s own Installation Guidelines, Methods and Instructions that validates what I was told by these general contractors that more preparation should have been done prior to installation.\n\nOld Gin was paid in full at the time of the installation. Our expectation of a North Alabama BBB A+ rated company would be one that would stand behind their products and service. It seems like it has been impossible to get resolution and it will end up costing us twice as much to repair as we will now have to remove the damaged floor and install a new one. This problem has taken far too much time and effort to address and many excuses have been given for the great delay in fixing the floor.\nWe feel that Old Gin has not been truthful in providing their products and services and that they have not met our expectations. Relative to the ideals listed by Old Gin Carpets on their website, we certainly have not been the focus of their business, we have not been happy with the product and we have received zero value for our money. In fact, we feel that they have flat-out taken us for our money!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886212bb9c084277:0xcfa30894660c0db6"}

Even with those obstacles, they maneuvered the sofas through there without scratching anything.  I was impressed.\nWhen they setup the sofas, they installed permanent protective cushioning on the feet to prevent future floor damage.

Who my leasing management contracts with has nothing to do with who enters my apt. Management keeps a key sign out sheet for all residents. Your company was the only one on that list since I moved in 3 months prior, with the exception of maintenance. You told the judge that you never had my key. (I did have this sheet during court) Wheats and the employees name was signed on the the key sign-out sheet. I made a police report. I had an investigation done, you were contacted. In addition, you did not complete the installation. My bedroom and closet was to be installed, only my bedroom got installed. Why? Because the closet was full. Why? Because there was no notice of your arrival. When your men came through the door and realized that my apt did not look prepared for their arrival, they should of picked up the phone and called. They did not. My gold necklace was in pure sight. Literally right in the way of the items in which your men felt comfortable to move without permission. I\u2019m not in the business of ruining businesses, I am also not in the business of paying for a service and getting robbed. If wheats wanted to make it right, management would of contacted me and apologized, wheats would of replaced my necklace and/or fired the employee who stole it. They did none of those things. Wheats has denied these allegations from the very beginning. Why? Imagine, Coming back home with my house looking crazy, all my personal items were all over my living room floor. Imagine the trauma that I have had to endure since that day. This is something I will never ever forget. It was totally traumatizing, degrading and unexpected and the worst part is, there was no apology. Only denial, denial, denial. No resolution. This could of all went away with a phone call, resolution and apology from management. They didn\u2019t even call and apologize. Nothing. It\u2019s one thing to make a mistake, it is a whole different thing to not acknowledge it.\n\nFYI: I wore that necklace almost everyday, I didn\u2019t that day. Why would your worker think I would not realize it was missing! I knew the second I walked in the door on that Tuesday that it was missing! Why would I make this up?!\n\nInitial post: Wheats furniture stole my gold necklace. They entered my home without proper permission from the renter. They signed out a key from the property manager after then denied ever having touched my key. We went to court, they lied and said they never touched the key even after showing them that they were the ones that signed my key out of the office. The lied. They are criminals. They stole my items and traumatized my whole life. It\u2019s a whole year later and I can\u2019t even allow anyone in my apt...do maintenance, showing, ect, without me being present. Everyone makes mistakes, wheats can\u2019t control what their workers do but they could of made it right. Instead they lied and brought their big time lawyer to a small claims court hearing \ud83d\ude12 traumatized isn\u2019t even the right word to describe my experience with this company. Good luck.\n\nAlso, my apt paid for the carpet to be changed in both the bedroom and the closet. They completed the work in the bedroom and did not touch the closet, but charged for both the bedroom and the closet. They didn\u2019t even return the items back to my room. Imagine coming home and seeing your items all over the living room floor. I first thought I was robbed, then realized I wasn\u2019t, then realized moments later that I was indeed robbed of my gold necklace. It was in plain sight before I left the house that morning. It was in the direct view of where they were doing work, it would be hard to miss. If there were proper notice to me, and proper responsibility taken by Wheats, this could of been resolved properly. Wheats completely denied it, lied on the stand and continues to act as if they are loyal franchise. Never ever again.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1607440599584, "text": "Hello, Andrew.

Also because multiple subcontractors, from other companies contracted by the apartment complex, including their people were in and out of your apartment at the time of installation any number of people had access.

We were never contacted by our sales rep to tell us that one of our tile selections was on back order.

The crew started laying final flooring while the other crew were doing rip out of tile with dust and particles everywhere and walking/grinding it all into the new vinyl plank flooring they were installing.  I noted my concerns and this only made the installers upset and also called the store.  When it began to rain they left, I walked in and they were gone!  I had told them they needed to clean up before they left and their reply to me was they only clean up once at the end of their job and they weren't done!!  This wasn't a construction zone, they were doing a job in my home where I was to cook and sleep!!  I was upset as you can imagine and called the store.  The store manager and the salesman that sold me the product came out and video taped it and said they would discuss this and stayed an hour to clean up so I could eat my dinner and sleep.  The next day the same went on.  I noted one plank installed was damaged their reply to me was it came out of the box that way?  Well I don't know about me but that should have been thrown away and if the store didn't order extra (where there was no pieces left over)  but they should have ordered more encase of such and their solution was to pull out a \"stain marker\" and color it so it wasn't noticeable!  I paid $8,358.51 for new installed product not damaged and painted!!  This product is warrantied and said if we are at any time unhappy with it or find problems with it they will come back and re do.  As much as I hate it because its a huge inconvenience but we have found more damaged boards and a lump under the flooring that is probably debris from the doing construction and install at the same time.

At any rate, they didnt complete the job in one day, then attempted to pull the \"crew\" onto another job the next day.

They agreed to let us pick out new floors and have their A crew with non stop management watch the second install. Never choose a company that offered lifetime install. It\u2019s bc they do it right the first time. Also in another review I read don\u2019t ever use somebody that requires all money up front. Our nightmare lasted a year. Their defected flooring caused moisture issues bc of laying on a crawl space. We paid an engineer and another flooring place to inspect. It was proved that it was because on the product. The LVP flooring as pages of bad consumer reports. In December 2018 we ended with getting a little more than half of your money back. Leaving their poor product and many new issues on sub floor. They kept 4,000$. We could have won in court but didn\u2019t want to spend another year fighting them. The owner Don is a very rude person. Talks to women they are stupid. He lives out of state so forget him helping when he messes your house up. I\u2019m a hair stylist in town and I know 7 other people that they have screwed over.

Please read full review to understand the situation...\n\nApproximately two months ago my husband and I came to Kemp's to try to find a transition piece that would match the pre-existing laminate flooring in our house. Upon entering Kemp's, we were immediately taken care of. We were super impressed by one of the ladies being able to look at the sample of our floor we brought and have an idea right away of a color that might match. She said she would have to order a sample and took down our information and said she would call us sometime the following week when it would come in.\n\nWell, two weeks go by and we hadn't heard anything so we decided to stop into the store and just see what was up. We weren't mad or upset at all, but just curious. The store manager was actually at the front desk and she was not aware of the situation entirely, but she promised to get it sorted and she personally took down our information and promised to contact us the following week. Well, after that I received at least 3 phone calls from her in the following weeks explaining that the specific laminate was on backorder and she would call me whenever it came in. This was all fine and we appreciated the constant contact. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there...\n\nWe waited at least two more weeks without hearing anything from them before I decided to call again and see what was going on. By now, it had been over a month and we still hadn't even received a sample of that color of laminate to see if it matched, let alone the floor transition piece we actually needed. When I called, I spoke to the receptionist and she said she looked me up in the computer and that our piece was on the truck to be DELIVERED THAT DAY and she would call me when it arrived. I did not receive a phone call that day.\n\nAgain, we let at least two weeks go by and heard NOTHING still. So, my husband calls them just trying to figure out what was going on and the lady he spoke to on the phone was VERY rude. He thinks her name was Barbara? This lady told him that the person who originally helped us didn't work there anymore and that they had no record of the order and it wasn't even possible to get a sample of that flooring in. My husband tried to explain to her everything we had been through and all the things (apparently lies) we had been told and she just kept interrupting him. He asked to speak to the manager and she said the manager was busy. She ended the phone call basically telling him that they couldn't help us and to try going somewhere else instead. Really?? Literally two months, if not longer, dealing with this place just to be told to go somewhere else and they couldn't help us and basically everything we had been told was a lie!\n\nSorry for the long post, but it is important to know the full story because I would never leave a bad review unless I am extremely dissatisfied.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886268e87c4a5629:0x92bdbda918bc578f"}

While the two employees working the office could not provide a solution to my issue they asked for me to leave my contact information with them, and provided the business card for a coworker that might be able to help. I was told they would have that person give me a call to set up an appointment to have someone come out to my house to see if they can troubleshoot my issue and possibly come up with a solution. After nearly a week there has been no communication from them. Instead, I had to call the person on the business card only to then be told he was not the right person and that he needed to have someone else call me back instead. Still waiting on that call back. My problem is that I bought a set of glass fireplace doors for my fireplace that I should be able to easily install myself, but they do not fit by just a few millimeters in height. I have double checked that I got the correct doors. I know the manufacturer and model number of my fireplace, so I bought the coordinating doors for my fireplace. I am worried that the fireplace and/or tile surround was not done properly and therefore might be the cause of my issue.

When they were forced to call me back, I felt like my problems had been resolved, and my appliance would be delivered. The next day, I received an email that my fridge was ready to be picked up. After calling the store AGAIN, it was finally sorted out. I think I got lucky and spoke to someone who cared that it had been nearly two months of waiting.

He had no info - not even on the process and we explained we had a bad experience before.

We went in to return a work desk that he had purchased yesterday, only to come home and find out that pieces are broken and missing. When we arrived at the return desk we were greeted angrily by a lady named Shelia (her tag said CSA Front Desk). She was in the process of helping another gentleman with a wheelbarrow at the time we arrived so I shrugged her attitude off as frustration to begin with. By the time she got to us she took the receipt from my husband, asked angrily what was wrong to which he informed her that the desk portion (the main part of the item) was broken down the middle and pieces were missing. She rolled her eyes, mumbled a few things, then started to walk away and as she was walking into another room yelled back at us \"you know it's a clearance item right?!\"  She then came back out of that room, struggled to get the lid off the box and then continued to tell us in a displeasing tone that our kobalt work desk was on clearance. I then stated \"so does clearance mean that pieces are broken? If so, lowes should not be selling clearance items\". She then argued with me that clearance items are usually returns with missing pieces and I restated that the main portion of the item is completely broken in half. I don't care if it's clearance or not, it was not marked down nearly enough to compensate for a complete useless, damaged piece. She then slammed a refund receipt down and asked my husband to sign. She never asked if we wanted to swap it with a usable piece. She never asked anything, actually. During this entire transaction she was rude and everything anyone in customer service should not be. She was also complaining and cussing under her breath about no one answering the phone around there during our entire few minutes with her. When we were leaving there were 2 more men waiting patiently behind us and just staring in disbelief at what they witnessed and would unfortunately encounter. I told one man good luck as we walked off and he said it looked like he needed it.
