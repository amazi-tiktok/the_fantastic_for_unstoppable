It may be a bit long of a read but if you want a current and an honest review on our experience here then please read this.\n\nThe property is absolutely beautiful and has a lot of historic charm. The house is spacious and can probably accommodate any event. It's an older house so the layout is different but still functioned what the event needed. Thats pretty much the only positive thing I can say about our recent experience here. My friends recently, as in yesterday, got married at this property and the staff, one in particular, were rude, inappropriate at times, unprofessional, condescending and over bearing all while smothering the bride, groom and wedding party along with all the guest that were staying and attended the wedding. The staff never left at any point and hovered over the guest making it feel uncomfortable and uninviting as possible which is not the proper tone for a wedding. They gave conflicting rules on the fly such as no smoking on the property and to go to a spot about a 100 yards away which was actually public property and could lead to you getting arrested for public intox if you want to be technical not to mention extremely inconvenient. Another example: one of the guest that was staying in the house was told to leave the inside of the house as its only for those who are staying here. She was reminded more than once that said person is indeed staying and has his own room in the house. Later that night another guest who was also staying was standing in the kitchen and was told it was more of a prep kitchen and not a hang out and get drunk kitchen and to remove himself from the kitchen area. The staff constantly complained about every little thing we did and without being biased at all and being completely honest, we were extremely respectful of the property as we were there to have a wedding and were there to celebrate two of our close friends getting married and wanted it to go as perfectly as possible. The staff made that a challenge but luckily we're a resilient optimistic group and continued to have a good time even though the staff never left and are even in the majority of the pictures that were taken through out the evening. So if you want to be bombarded with random rules and a cramping and hovering staff that will provide you with zero privacy and add stress to your visit then this place is absolutely perfect for just that.\n\nUPDATE: All they keep saying is the same exact response in each review which is very poor management and not EVER reaching out to the customer! If this was my business and had MULTIPLE people saying the same thing then I would at least find out what is wrong and fix it. NOT GIVE THE EXACT SAME RESPONSE!

I had the ability to go when our youth camp decided to come for summer camp. The camp is run through Student Life Camps and has an amazing group of staff and individuals that help the camp run. The guys in our group including me stayed in Mount Moriah, which is one of the many lodging buildings available to stay in. The rooms were clean and fresh bedding was provided, although we brought our own. I opted to use the provided bedding. The rooms had two bunk beds for a maximum capacity of 4 people. The lower level of Mount Moriah (we stayed in the top level--a two story building) has a nice little lobby area with some chairs and a couch. Some guys in our group thought it would be funny to take the couch upstairs and place it in front of our leader's room. We returned the couch afterwards.\n\nThe rest of the camp was very beautiful and well kept. There were some lawn care professionals maintaining the grounds while we stayed.\n\nThe recreation area, known as the \"Adventure Camp\" was very nice. The pool was large enough for our group to comfortably play in, as well as others. A diving board added to the fun. The Tennis courts and Basketball courts were very nice and well kept, but you will need to bring your own tennis supplies, as they are not provided. There was a small \"lake\" on camp grounds, with paddle boarding, and some water inflatables. We did not decide to go on these as they cost an extortionate amount of $8 for 30 mins of play. Not worth it.\n\nIt would we worth nothing that everything is fairly spread apart and there are some very intense hills throughout, which took a toll on our legs and knees. Golf Cart rentals were available for $35/day, but we had too many in our group that it would cost too much, so we didn't do it.\n\nThe food service was very nice, the food tasted adequate and there was always a variety to choose from. It is a self serve food line, so you are free to eat what you choose. A nice addition is the unlimited complimentary Soft Serve Ice Cream available at each and every meal.\n\nOverall I have to say Shocco Springs is one of my favourite camps that I've been to. Sure it's a little hot here in Alabama, but that's fine. Just bring some water, and going swimming can help tremendously.\n\n-Matthew J., age 15 at time of writing. Visited From June 1-5, 2016.
