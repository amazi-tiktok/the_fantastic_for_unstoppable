Most of their patient are either hurting or weak and that's a given or else they wouldn't have any patients, that being said they hand each patient 10 pages to fill out and say 'just a refresher' and once they fill it out and bring it to the desk, the woman says, hold on, takes the last two pages and says these go to your nurse. Oh so now it's my job to make sure my nurse and doctor receive my information?.... Sit down only to have the woman leave the desk and bring another parent and say the nurse will also need this. Now, I am only keeping my mouth shut and dealing with it because my grandmother likes Dr. Angel. Who we haven't even seen yet even though we've been here an hour, 45 minutes past our appointment time. I am not impressed and highly dissapointed that they could know that anyone coming to third desk is only there to maintain, figure out, or treat a majoir issue inside thier bodies, and have the gaul to lolly gag on their phones and conversate.

The radiology technicians that do the treatments are extremely professional. They do everything possible to make sure you are comfortable during your treatments. These technicians are extremely thoughtful and polite. The nurse is absolutely amazing, she is very much an important part of the treatment process. She will take the time to listen to you and answer your questions. She gave me the feeling that she actually cares about the patient. She is truly a special young woman. I believe that having my treatments done at Gulf Coast Cancer Center, was the best decision possible.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0def7ce45755:0x2b12704459915d75"}

From the bottom of my heart I want to thank each and every one of you here in Andalusia. I pray for you everyday that's passed since Amy's passed on, you were her strength and her one personal hope to succeed in always fighting her leukemia. She always spoke highly of you Dr. Boatwright, and the whole team with you. Towards the end I wanted to let you know I had become so angry with this cancer of hers and a part of me wouldn't listen to any kind of words of defeat and I want to apologize for anything \ud83d\ude1e I may have said or done at the time! I pray that you could find it to forgive me one day for not doing more when it meant the most. I'm very sorry... If you can't then I absolutely understand and I would do the same if I were who I used to be. Amy didn't really have a great deal of friends or family besides her kids and their dad was always using them against her. I watched day in and day out of her struggle and almost everyday I had to go hide for a little while and cry my eyes out. And I knew it was coming in my mind and that haunted me so bad because I didn't want to live without her. To this very day 4 months after the grief and this horrific game of circle is at an all time high and her death has been difficult to bear. Thank you \u2764\ufe0f Sacred Heart for always being there for her and for going above and beyond for every detail of her struggle! I'll forever be in your debt. They'll never be another day that I don't thank and pray for all of you. And if anyone out there has need for there care I promise you'll be making a very wise decision here! God Bless you all and may everyday of yours be blessed. Sincerely Rody", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8891ec0677771add:0x7b0539872c727be3"}
