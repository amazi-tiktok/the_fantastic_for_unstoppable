Well, to my surprise, this time I was told they could send out a serviceman the very next day (which they did). The repairman was very courteous and knowledgeable.....and the dryer has now been repaired.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDid not show up for first service call. Said truck broke down but we never received a call. Sears said they texted us...but upon further investigation, Sears said they transposed our telephone #, so who knows who received the message that said they weren't going to show up. Wasted one day waiting for repair man. Then after almost 2 weeks later, a repairman finally shows up. He was nice enough and seemed to know what he was doing. Said that a part would need to be ordered. Okay, fair enough. Part came in almost two weeks later; however, was told it will be almost another 3 weeks before Sears can send someone out to install the part. Customer service??? I don't think so. Bottom line: Almost 7 weeks without a dryer that's under Sear's Home Warranty program is a very POOR indicator of this company's ability to honor their agreement.

The fourth person couldn't help me and transferred me back to the third person and they 'dropped' the call.  Two hours 18 minutes... no, I did not call back that day.  Finally got through to the proper division for the mower service contract.  Got the service time set up with my complaint and requested service ordered.\n\nThe serviceman arrives and I tell him what I had asked for and he says he was only told about the broken belt.  No new blades, no new cut grass shield, and NO service.  He starts to replace the belt and I quickly saw he did not have the correct belt.  He had been given the belt that turns the blades, not the drive belt.\n\nSo off to the hardware store to get the correct belt.  Once he gets back, the drive belt repair was completed quickly.  Two days later, a different service tech comes by to look at the mower to get the numbers to order the shield.   He promises me that he will put in the request for the annual service.  A week later, someone comes out to my house and installs the shield on the mower,  No service, no new blades.  My son and I go get some new blades and put them on ourselves.  At least I can cut grass now.\n\nSTILL WAITING ON THE SERVICE.  I would take this back to Sears, but.....", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cce7cdbd0ff65:0x244b0c8bf7d42e3"}

When one of my two HVACs went out in my new home, I called the company that installed it and they said the earliest they could come was three days.  When I called ACS, they were there the next morning.  I have been calling on ACS ever since.  During a heat wave, after Robert explained he would have to charge overtime, ACS fixed my HVAC on a Sunday morning.  Whenever ACS was at my house to fix my HVAC, after analyzing the problem, they were clear on what needed to be done,  how long it would take to fix it, how much it would cost, and why.  If necessary, they also provided a variety of payment options so I could choose what best met my situation.  So when one of my two HVACs needed to be replaced, ACS was one of two companies I called for an estimate.  While the other estimate was flowered with discounts for various reasons, the ACS estimate was clear, concise, and competetive.  Robert Akins spent a lot of time explaining options and whether they were worth the expense.  The unit ACS proposed has a lifetime condenser replacement warranty if the compressor ever fails.  An option ACS had that the other did not was a ten year warranty on the labor for warrantied repairs.  Finally, when the competitor said it would take at least a week for the replacement HVAC to come in, ACS had my new unit installed the next day on December 22, the week of Christmas!  So whether you are looking to replace your current HVAC unit or just repair the one you have, I highly recommend Robert Akins and ACS.  They have always been there when I needed them and taken care of the problem efficiently and professionally.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862657b007200dd:0x7c27a392b36f81dc"}

Unfortunately, occasionally, due to whatever reasons whether by our fault or other circumstances, a customer is dissatisfied.  In this case we did not learn of Mr. Hastie's dissatisfaction until he posted a negative review.  There was no phone call, no inquiry, no attempt to communicate or seek a resolution to his complaint, just a negative review.\nAfter speaking to the technician and reviewing the statements associated with this service I found the following facts to be true:\n\nMr Hastie called to report his house was hot and his air conditioning was not working late in the afternoon.  I diverted a technician to his house after 4:30 pm to help him so that hopefully he would not have to go through another hot night in his house.  (We go on overtime at 5:00 pm).  The technician found the primary problem and responded by installing a part from his truck which was close to what was required but not the correct spec.  The temporary fix allowed the unit to run and cool the house overnight providing immediate relief for Mr. Hastie.  The technician did not charge for the overtime.\n\nThe part required was an odd spec which the technicians and many of our professional vendors do not carry locally (often an order Item).  The next day our technician searched among our vendors until he found a part locally.  He returned to the Hastie residence and exchanged the temporary part for the correct one.  Our technician also inspected the refrigerant charge and found a need to add some refrigerant to achieve the correct cooling specs per his instruments upon this return visit.\n\nMoreover, our technician did not charge Mr. Hastie for the procurement or travel time required to serve his needs.  For the more than 3 hours time involved working exclusively on Mr. Hastie's behalf our technician charge him only for a service call and 1 hour labor.  As far as the cost of the part:  yes we, like most service operations who provide a responsive service, charge a markup on parts.  We do not attempt to compete with internet pricing.  Our pricing structure reflects the convenience of having the part, our vendors supporting us to have a part available, and the network which guarantees and supports the quick response business.\n\nOtherwise, a client is free to diagnose his own problem, order his parts online and wait in the heat until the part arrives (hoping he did not make a mistake or that a wrong part was shipped.)\n\nIn conclusion:  Our technician followed pricing guidelines which have been satisfactory for our extensive client base for more than 40 years.  He waived labor costs in the hopes of establishing Mr. Hastie as a long term satisfied customer.  Mr. Hastie indicated to the technician that he was satisfied and grateful for the prompt service and relief from the heat.\n\nHad Mr. Hastie called to inquire about the charges, we could have explained to him and even offered him a coupon if he was still not happy.  Personally, I see this negative review as simply malicious with the intent of harming our otherwise excellent review status and without any interest in understanding or seeking a resolution with ACS, Inc."}, "gmap_id": "0x8862657b007200dd:0x7c27a392b36f81dc"}

I told him that it sounded like we needed to send a tech out for diagnostics.  He asked me what the charge would be and I told him the minimum cost of a service call and labor for a call out.  He then asked me an unusual question for our industry.  He asked me why we charged for diagnostics.  From having dealt with the public for 40 years I understood that he was not familiar with how service companies operate.  I proceeded to explain to him why a company had to charge to send a tech to a remote location, time, equipment cost, travel, insurance, education and training, overhead and all of the costs associated with a working company.  I explained that the tech, for instance, had to be paid from the moment he clocked in which included the driving time to a residence and back, hence the service call.  Nathan took offense at the explanation and told me that he did not need a \"lecture\".  I asked him then why he asked such a question if he did not expect or want a comprehensive answer, to which he abruptly hung up the phone. There was no profanity.  Moments later this negative review arrived in my email.\n\nPart of the service we provide is educational.  We are a very empirical and logic based company.  We deal with applied science.  When a question is asked we do our best to answer it thoroughly.  I often help clients solve heating and air conditioning issues over the phone at no charge when able.  I have recently successfully instructed non technical house wives in restoring their heat over the phone. My communication skills are very good.  In this circumstance it was very important that the potential client understood the charges and per his questions why there were charges.  If the customer does not understand that he will be charged for a visit and that he has an obligation to pay, or if he protests the value of the service prior to a visit by a tech, then we cannot send a tech to his residence.\n\nUnfortunately, part of the job of dealing with the general public is to screen the potential client to make sure that the interaction with the company and the technician is successful and satisfactory for both parties.  We will not send a technician into a contentious situation.  We would have liked to have helped Nathan but the initial phone interaction and the \"hang up\" indicated that the interaction would not be successful."}, "gmap_id": "0x8862657b007200dd:0x7c27a392b36f81dc"}

My wife met with Cason and we went into wanting multiple options which i thought were all fairly presented and well explained without any pressure of which to go with. I have a close friend who worked for many years for both Trane and Carrier with many of the dealers throughout Birmingham. He gave me a list of 3 companies he would have out to his home personally. Skelton was one of those, another company that i liked very much, and then one we didnt have a great experience on the quote with. Between Skelton and the other competitor, although Skeltons price was higher we were sold by the labor warranty and some of the other written guarantees, along with the rec from our friend. Installation - I believe it was Mark, my wife was the one on site - went way better than i could have imagined. We arranged last minute to have the unit moved to a new location. All of the work was very well done. I had an idea in my head of what \"the aftermath\" should have looked like and the equipment involved in the move and all that, and i probably would have been satisfied with a lot less. Its obviously a lot of money for most families, so I was bound to have some mix of buyers remorse and hesitation about whether or not we'd gone with the right people However, when i got home and saw the quality of the work, how neatly and efficiently and professionally everything was done, i immediately felt entirely confident in our decision and knew we had some true professionals out at the house. I think its the first time in my life ive spent that much money on something and dont have any regrets or second guessing about who we chose to spend it with. Kudos to both Cason and Mark's teams.

Their technician was very thorough and discovered a bad switch and capacitor, which he replaced on the spot. He checked our Freon levels and said they were still perfect. His extra effort and honesty saved us from having to buy a new unit at this time, even though he could have easily convinced me we needed a new unit. (Two other companies also provided quotes on new units, but neither of them discovered the underlying issue.) Honesty and integrity, and a desire to serve the customer\u2019s best interests, are important to me. Skelton\u2019s proved it by their actions.

I am sitting here in a hot house waiting on the a/c man... it's almost one pm my time and he calls me just before and tells me that he isn't coming out today I needed to call the warranty company and have them schedule someone else to come out. there are plenty of contractors in Phenix City that could come out today (did he call them and ask to see, hell no), he tells me that there is no way that he can come out he has an emergency at the hospital. that is understandable but why can't you send someone other than yourself to check my unit? He tells me that it isn't that hot outside that it could wait till Monday. This man knows that I have seven month old child as well as a four year old and he has the balls to tell me that it can wait because it isn't hot? The next time my baby throws up on me I will make sure I call him so she can do it to him. she can't be in the heat she has too many problems for it and he is not worth the time of day or the money you will spend.

We are so very happy with our overall experience with this company. In fact (no lie) less than two hours after the final hook-up, there was a sudden storm, the electricity went out and the generator came on. It was seamless!!! We did have a misunderstanding with the salesman but once we brought it to the attention of Steve Dukes, the business owner, he quickly and decisively took care of it. Because we are on the Bay, we wanted the generator elevated so that, should there be flooding, the generator would be safe. That request hadn't been conveyed to the installers. However, when Mr. Dukes was made aware of the oversight, he actually constructed a metal stand for us himself. Plus he did this very quickly so that the delay was minimal. We were thinking they would build us a wooden platform, but the metal one is much better \u2014 both functionally (as it will last longer) and aesthetically. We are from Michigan and we had no intention of being here through hurricane season but we had traveled here with my 94 year old mother and, because of the coronavirus, she couldn\u2019t fly back and she can\u2019t physically tolerate such a long drive.  I was afraid that, because of the misunderstanding, we would be relegated to the bottom of the list and have to wait until they could \u201cget around to it\u201d because they were so busy...not so! There was only a slight delay while the frame was fabricated. So, fast forward to the present time: We had \u201cbugged out\u201d when Hurricane Sally was about 100 miles South of us and just now walked into the door after Sally had passed through. There is no electricity on either side of us but we walked into the door with the generator humming reassuringly beside the house. I don\u2019t have to worry about Moms Bi-Pap or oxygen condenser working. She will be able to sleep comfortably tonight...and so will I. Mr. Dukes made sure we had the generator installed the way we wanted it and in a timely manner, smoothing out the bumps along the way. I definitely recommend getting a whole house (Generac) generator and I highly recommend doing business with Mr. Dukes of Baldwin Heating & Air Conditioning. He knows his business and is a man of integrity.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1604097541449, "text": "Kathy thank you so much.

So we called Baldwin HVAC.  They sent a guy to come out and look at it.  He looked briefly at the unit, walked around the house for a few minutes with a thermometer, and quickly pronounced that there was nothing wrong, and that all we needed was to change our air filters.  So they charged us $39 for the visit (the fee they quote you) plus $50 for \"labor,\" which I guess is that guy's rate for walking around your house for 10 minutes.\n\nObviously, I keep my filters changed, so I was suspicious, but I assumed that he knew what he was talking about.  2 weeks ago, our AC stops working completely.   Before calling anyone, I go into the attic and check it out myself.  The coils were completely frozen.  And not only that - they were clogged with dust and mold.  This was due to our blower motor malfunctioning, which had been happening slowly for some time at that point.\n\nI took a photo to show how bad it was.  Naturally, I called Baldwin HVAC to ask how their guy missed something so obvious.  The manager, Anthony, said that the initial $89 visit \"didn't include\" looking at the coils, even though it took me - an ordinary guy with no HVAC expertise - literally 5 minutes to open up the blower and look in there.\n\nLike an fool, I believed him, and so hired them to come out and fix the blower motor that had gone bad.  Their guy John came and he was nice and did a good job.\n\nBut the next day, the same AC unit goes dead again.  This time, the problem is the outdoor compressor.  So I call them to come check it out.\n\nThey charge us yet another $89 to come and look at the same AC system they'd worked on the very day before.  This time, we resist their high-pressure sales tactics (\"It's 4 PM, so if you want the AC working tomorrow, we need to order the part now! \") and call a different company to work on the compressor.  Baldwin HVAC quoted us $822 to replace the part (which was covered by warranty).  We went to Climatemp instead, and they charged us $550 for the exact same job.  They got the part that same day and had a guy out there the very next morning.\n\nLong story short: I'd recommend someone else first, if only because these people charge more than other companies, and in my experience, the quality of the work just wasn't sufficient to justify the extra cost.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a69f62d949da1:0x9a9bd9e00f87db88"}

I couldn't have asked for a better respectful young man. He was professional, knowledgeable, and understanding to my family's situation. I was also able to purchase a new thermostat for my home from him. Within little to no time, my new thermostat was installed. Michael then showed and explained to me how it worked and informed  me if I ever have any problems, not to hesitate and give the company a call. I was referred to give this company by the Savages. I most definitely see why. I, myself will highly recommend Adam's Heating and Cooling to others. This company's professionalism even goes back to when I first spoke with Savannah when I first made the initial call. She was very patient with me because it took me a minute to figure out when they could come and check out my unit. Overall, I would give them a 10.

So when it came time to get a new unit we started looking around. We had 6 different companies come quote our new system (large and small companies). We didn't stop our research there. Whenever possible I went and looked at a system each of those companies had installed to get an idea of the quality of their installers. I had never heard of Carden before,  but they came very highly recommend and after seeing their quality work and receiving the quote I understood why. We considered several of the quotes, but Carden offered a far superior unit at a better price than other quoted for a cheaper unit. They came and installed the unit the next business day and they did a phenomenal job. Kyle quoted our system and he was here for the install to make sure everything was taken care of just as we discussed.

The Carden team services my two homes as well as the homes of the clients who rent homes from me.  The communications team is always kind, helpful, knowledgeable, and organized when I need to schedule a Carden visit.  The ground team is friendly, knowledgeable, and offers very high quality workmanship for very fair prices.  The entire team is great at explaining technical issues that are often beyond what I know and understand about HVAC systems!\n\nCarden has been able to capably fix every heating and cooling issue that I or one of my rental clients has ever had.  One particular issue was pretty involved and complex in an older home this past summer, where, due to a prior installer doing shoddy work, my client was unable to cool her home and was receiving sky-high bills.  The Carden Team came in and fixed the entire system and duct work, and her bill has gone down by HUNDREDS of dollars!!\n\nOne final note, and this may make me favorite thing about the Carden family:  I work with a vulnerable, low-income community, and it is often difficult to hire service workers to come into the communities where we need things fixed.  I have actually had service workers tell me directly that they would not service one of my clients\u2019 homes due to their address.  It is heartbreaking.  Carden has never made my clients or me feel like they were not good enough.  They come, with a smile on their faces, prepared to do good work every time for every person.

They went so far as to tell us they don't money in warranty repairs, even when we had an extended warranty for 13 years. They told me to call someone else to come and do the repairs. The catch in all this was that our extended warranty covered both parts and labor. If we had to go to a different Trane dealer they would not cover the labor costs, but the parts were at no charge. I read several good reviews about Carden and decided to go with them. Our repairman was by far one of the most professional, kind and courteous people we have ever had the pleasure of working with. They gave us an estimate before hand and I had already checked the average labor costs to change the compressor out and their rate was very reasonable.

They were able to get us financed for and entire new HVAC Unit within our budget!\n\nDaniel and Drew were both very pleasant and very knowledgeable, as they answered every question I had.

He's also trustworthy and the kind of guy you would want to represent your company. Most importantly, he was able to diagnose my heat pump problem quickly and efficiently...10 to 15 minutes. The HVAC was over amped.\n\nThe company that installed my TRANE XL14 heat pump in 2007, Alabama Climate Control (ACC) of Huntsville, apparently did not notice that the heat pump was rated for max amperage of 40 amps because they did not bother to change the 50 amp circuit breaker in the panel in the garage. One would expect a professional HVAC company to do a basic electrical circuit check/test to ensure the electrical circuit is compatible with your NEW heat pump...right!?!?\n\nAnyway, this oversight by ACC resulted in a fried circuit breaker in the junction box at the heat pump. Opie said we were lucky this situation did not result in a burned up motor or worse a burned down house. After all that, Opie tried to give me a $25 discount because I'm a veteran.\n\nThank you for the sentiment Opie, but also thank you for identifying a problem that has caused me great anguish over the years. I had to replace 3 or 4 compressors on the original heat pump (a Rheem) about 15 years ago when we first started renting out the house.\n\nThe HVAC company (same ACC) kept replacing all those compressors under warranty at $250 to $300 a pop for labor, but just couldn't figure out what was causing all those compressors to burn up (the same 50 amp circuit breaker in the breaker box). Then, I was dumb enough to hire them again to install a new TRANE in 2007. Remeber, the TRANE is rated for a maximum of 40 amps, but ACC left the same old 50 amp circuit breaker in the breaker panel. Voila...we get a fried junction box this time.\n\nIncredible...that it took a young 23 year old tech with a lot less experience (but more common sense and intelligence) to recognize that a 50 amp circuit breaker is going to eventually cause some problems if it is not compatible with the rest of the circuit.\n\nThe cautionary tale here is...be extremely vigilant and careful about who you let work on your electrical systems and watch them like a hawk when they do...until you find a company like SMS that has techs like Opie.. Thank you SMS and Opie for saving my house from a potential fire.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1462206716420, "text": "Thanks Dwight! We are very happy we could take care of your heat pump needs!

There's nothing else I can do for you then.\" I needed my ac running so I gathered up every cent I had and told him to go ahead with the repair. He then came in and told me that the thermostat wasn't telling the unit to kick on so we must have fried the new thermostat also. He left the base plate wired up and told me that it was wired correctly and I just needed to go get a new touchpad and it would work. He is a professional and I trusted his word so I paid him the $600 and he left without it working. It was late Saturday night so I ran and got the new one first thing Sunday morning. I put it on the wall and it would not work. I had to call another repairman to come out and fix it Sunday. There was nothing wrong with the 1st thermostat.

I would like to give a special \u201cthank you\u201d to the three men that came to our home in the past two days, John, Brody, & Steve. All three men delivered top quality customer service, while also allowing me, as a stay at home mom, a sense of trust and comfort that the service being provided to us was one we needn\u2019t question. These gentlemen were very thorough with their original diagnostic visit, and also very kind to answer all of my questions. I have hired companies, prior to Bradberry , to repair our HVAC unit, and many a time I have been left feeling \u201cswindled\u201d or ignored. (I.E. rather discuss the business at hand with my husband). We\u2019ve had multiple companies, even just send out a salesperson, instead of looking at all possible cost saving options for our family\u2019s financial situation. I have been disheartened by other companies, to say the least...\n\nThat\u2019s why I am so honored to write a five star review for the company of, Bradberry. They have gone above and beyond meeting my expectations. For years our family has \u201cband aided\u201d our AC unit, we knew it would be in the near future to get a new unit, however, Bradberry, and their service workers, still gave us multiple different options to consider.\n\nAfter much deliberation, my husband and I did decide to replace the HVAC UNIT. All diagnostics, financing, and installation were done in 24hrs. (Keep in mind this is also at the end of May, in Alabama, when the heat is unbearable). These gentlemen had a kind smile on their faces the whole time, while also giving clear and concise details on what to expect going forward.\n\nLike I said, I cannot say enough wonderful things about the customer service and products that Bradberry delivered to our family.\nThank you to the three gentlemen and the company of Bradberry for exceeding my expectations. I am truly thankful, and so much more comfortable!\n\n-Mary Sutphin", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1622746402552, "text": "Thanks for your business Mary Catherine!!

They came out and were straight shooters after evaluating the unit that day, and determined it had to be replaced. After taking the time I needed to make a decision on the unit they promptly scheduled a service date and installed the unit.\nI had an extremely high power bill the following month, and to their credit the technician came out on a Saturday in the middle of potential severe weather and identified and hopefully resolved the issue that caused my power bill to be so high.
