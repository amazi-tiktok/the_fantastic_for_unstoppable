If you able to contact the manager at this store he states that he has nothing to do with the billing and fees collected. That's between them.

The staff helped at the front with changing my membership from another location. There seemed to be plenty of space. I didn't have to wait on anyone, which is number one for me at any fitness center. Social distance measures were decent, as can be expected. The only real issue that bothered me was that one employee was talking to a customer waiting to go into the spa while I was trying to leave, and he walked in front of me three times going back and forth from the other customer and the counter, as if he couldn't see me. He didn't speak to me at all. I didn't find it very professional to be cutting customers off repeatedly and not saying excuse me or anything, just expecting me to continue to move and go around after already changing directions without even acknowledging me there. It would've been much better if he had the conversation with the customer at the counter, at the table, said \"excuse me,\" or even \"sorry about that,\" anything really to let me know I was valued as much as the person he was talking to and not just in his way. Things like that irk me, especially as a customer. Other than that though, pretty great first-time experience. If it doesn't get too much busier without being expanded, then I'll plan on this being my main gym. Oh, one more thing, I wish they had the treadmills like Midtown. Only having an up and down and not a keypad is annoying when trying to change interval speeds. The other features were nice too, but not a huge problem.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88861da7e49718f3:0x39f41bddcd915eb5"}

I had known that CrossFit was a community of athletes and I seriously wanted to be apart of something GREAT. Well I decided to google CrossFit in my area and I landed on this location. I was nervous but I decided to give a GO, I called the number above and the reaction and engagement I got was fantastic. The professionalism of their staff had made me feel eager to get down there and begin training. First day I was amazed by the community, I was welcomed with smiles and assistance not just from the coaches but the members as well. I truly felt that I was apart of a Team. The amount of effort you put in you will get the same energy back ! I highly recommend for beginners and for those who are new to the area and want to feel apart of a community.

In the past, it had been a chore getting him to attend on a regular basis... but after participating in a few sessions with Cary at Renew, he actually looked forward to his visits and wanted to attend. My grandfather had an excellent outcome because of his excellent experience. Cary is a great therapist and not only provides top notch treatment to his patients, but does so in a fun, interactive and engaging manner. My grandfather felt like he was a celebrity each time he walked in to an appointment because Cary and Tara were so engaging! I would highly recommend Renew Therapy.

The cardio machines are on the bottom floor with some boxing bags and a water fountain. The facility is wheelchair accessible.\n\nThe middle floor has all the free weights and weigh machines. And there are about 200 different machines on this floor. If you can't find what you need here then you don't belong in a gym.\n\nTeddy Zane is the owner and he is an awesome dude,He is very helpful person if you are a novice lifter. And he doesn't tolerate any bs in his gym such as leaving weights lying around.\n\nThey constantly update the machines and move more in. They aren't all brand new but none of them are in bad condition whatsoever.\n\nThe top floor is a cardio boxing class that they offer.\n\n10/10 love when I get to come to this gym.

I have recently moved back home again and cancelled my membership again because its too far of a drive. I had some issues with my pregnancy, and could not use my membership. A medical hold was put on my account for 2 months which I appreciated while I was in the hospital and back and forth with my daughter in the NICU, so I obviously had no time or need for a gym right now. This was in April. I understood that I was obligated to a year with the membership. My year was up in August 2018. I called and spoke with Chris, cancelled my membership, I was told to send an email explaining why I needed to cancel my membership and what I wanted to do. I thought everything was good and my membership was cancelled because that is what I was told over the phone. I have since been charged numerous times and my account has gone into overdraft because of this. I have tried to contact this place numerous times to talk with them about this, but I can NEVER get an answer. I have called from both my cell, and work phone. I finally gave up and called my bank. Thankfully, they reimbursed my overdraft charges and refunded the money for this. I checked today and there is yet another charge for this, AND another overdraft fee. Thanks to this, I got turned down for a loan that I needed for college due to having overdraft in my account from a membership that I was told was cancelled.  I am not happy at all and I hope this place fixes their communication issues and gets some better customer support, so this does not happen to anyone else.

He proceeded to say he would refund my money but to never contact him again or have nothing to do with his business. Which is fine.

They are currently doing renovations/improvements on items that need it. In my opinion, they are not OVERLY nice and they are not rude. They are polite, professional and basically just a \"no bullsh*t\" gym. They have the most workout equipment I've seen in any gym of Mobile.

It started off pretty good and then it went down here, but I blame corporate for that. Back when they first opened, they were charging $55 a month for this place which at the time, made sense because all the equipment was new and they have four and five of the exact same machine; ensuring that no matter what you did, you always had a free machine. However, as the equipment started to crack & deteriorate, it has not been maintained right. That was too much to charge so people left and now you can start off here for about $34 a month.\n\nApparently, the owners don't like this because they shut down the smoothie shop. They've closed off a lot of the rooms that we used to be able to go in and use and multitude of requests have been put in to fix certain equipment that never gets around to being fixed. They just got weight pins because people kept taking weight pins out of some machines to use them in others and we had to beg for about a month to get that. The yoga room used to be open to me where I could go in and use the exercise balls (because the ladies only room has only one ball and it is severely deflated.) I never messed up the room, but others did and now everyone else is being punished and is not allowed to use the room, but our dollars pay for the equipment. No one seems to know where a damn air pump is so they can inflate their own balls. It's ridiculous. If you going to the theater room, there is a graveyard of broken equipment and that they refused to fix or replace. They also have torn up machines in the food court and in the rooms that the clientele don't normally frequent. Why keep it if it's broken and you don't want to fix it?\n\nTo add insult to injury, we have to pay a $40 fee once a year for the equipment, but a lot of this equipment looks like it hasn't been changed out in years. To literally lock away a room full of equipment from members who haven't messed it up is wrong. Meanwhile, they have a set of high school kids that come in here tearing up the equipment all the time and being loud and using slurs that everybody has literally complain about, yet they are allowed to continue working out here. All of the quality Equipment is sealed off in some room somewhere while everyone else is left to use what's left.\n\nThere are ants in the ladies sauna that I ask the boys to tell the head girl about so it could be taken care of. They never told her and I had to tell her myself. I ended up getting bitten and I have welts on my arms from the ant bites. It has been about 4 days since I told someone about it and it still hasn't been taken care of. The manager here is really cool, but he doesn't move unless corporate gets involved.\n\nFurthermore, they won't stop hiring college kids to work here and they're not paying them all that much so they're simply not going to do the job. On the weekends, they work out on the clock  when they don't think they're going to get caught. Trash is overflowing in the restrooms, dirt is on the floor and a lot of the equipment is jammed up when you try to use it. They don't regularly check the paper towels towels or anything. There are far too many $10 a month gyms running around here for this. Between Pro Health, Sportsplex and the YMCAs, I'm sure I can find somewhere else that will find equipment that is quality.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d6b22fa2ab5:0xc12047c9fedc974d"}

Online waiver was simple to fill out the night before. Easy to find the location.\n\nStaff working the front desk was very helpful. She did a great job taking the necessary COVID precautions, and gave me a brief but helpful tour of the facilities.\n\nThe routes here use a 1-5 \"dot\" grading scale, plus a smiley face for beginner routes. 1 dot is easy; > 4 dots, I'm not even sure Spider Man could do. + sign is in-between dot \"grades\". Simple enough, and similar to the color / ski slope systems I have seen elsewhere.\n\nMost routes seemed to be in the 2-3+ range. Normally I am a v3-v5 climber, depending on the route and gym. I was able to do every 2 I tried, and one 2+. These routes are tough!\n\nThe setting was done well, with a strong mix of holds and problem types. I wish I was good enough to do some of the harder ones! They looked really fun. But even their 2 dots had some challenge to them, and forced some flagging, hooks, dynos I wasn't expecting on initial read. The geometry was comparable to Walltopia, very curvy, lots of inversion, which definitely adds to the difficulty in many cases.\n\nThe Forge area looked amazing. Moon boards, spray walls, campus walls, it was truly a sight to behold. Biggest I've seen anywhere. Unfortunately I did not have time to train in this part of the gym but rest assured I will be firing up the moonboard app and failing miserably here next time I'm in Birmingham area.\n\nOverall, I'd say B2 is pretty top-notch.

For example, at first my card was on the account and then we changed it over to my fianc\u00e9\u2018s card! (We had to fix this 5 times because the front desk staff could never get it right!) There were multiple times where we were having problems booking classes because the people that had taken our card information and supposedly switched it did not save/submit it to their system!\n\nLater to find out, they were charging us random charges! These random charges were repeat charges of our memberships repeat charges of 12 and $15. It got to be so bad they were charging us all throughout the months that our bank called us and told us that it was suspicious activity and that they were going to ban orange theory from charging us. we then tried to get in contact with the owner to give them a chance to make it right because we loved it so much! And she was very rude and did not do anything in her power to make it right. When we asked her what the charges were for she couldn\u2019t tell us the exact things that the random charges were for, which was SKETCHY!\n\nIn addition to this, it is very hard to book classes! We were always on a waiting list! And it we didn\u2019t feel like we were getting our money worth! I got so bad that we would try to book classes while we were there in person and sometimes the front desk staff would say that we\u2019re booked for weeks ahead of time and we weren\u2019t!\n\nOrange theory is a great work out overall and we saw great results! But this location is not professional, does not care about you or your finances, and they are extremely rude when they mess up and you confront them.

I referred several friends to this business because I loved it so much. The technology is great when it works and allows you to see the calories burned during your workout routine. However, it seems to glitch often.\n\nAdministratively, this place is not client friendly. If you sign up for a class but have to miss for any reason (in my case it was always a sick child issue or schedule change), they charge you $10, so it's best to not sign up for classes in advance and just pop in. Also, if you want to cancel your contract, you have to show up in person and tell them that you would like to cancel. Then they have to send an email to their manager letting her know that you would like to cancel. Their manager will then ask for you to come back in and fill out the required paperwork.

Not allowing people to use the machine the bags are on. I\u2019m not one for rules, but this just hurts gym etiquette and makes lifting here an annoyance.\n\nThe movie \u201ccardio\u201d room is pretty cool and a huge selling point of this gym over others.

They have a ton of classes and a cool cardio cinema all for free. It is really clean and has new up to date equipment from TechnoGym, Precor and FreeMotion. The track is really cool for running instead of always using boring treadmills. I did a few \"sessions\" with trainer Kyle and he definitely knows how to give you a good work out, you won't be disappointed. The two of us have a pretty regular thing going on now. The location is convenient just far from downtown if you're coming that way, and it can get pretty busy after work. I would suggest if you can try and go later in the evening to avoid the crowds and get an appointment with Kyle then hit the sauna afterwards for some small talk and hot relaxation. Also the steam room is great for extra privacy. There's no juice bar or anything like that but Pub 261 is just a minute up 31 and a great spot to loosen up a little bit instead of just going home and straight to bed. Kyle is also very skilled in deep tissue massage due to his strong grip and thick forearms, so if you are sore afterwards it's a good way jumpstart the recovery process and get you in the right mood if you know what I mean. I try to sleep 8-10hrs whenever I can but Kyle has so much stamina he keeps me going all night! It makes me feel like we're in college again. There's also a lap pool and racquetball court. It's so nice to have such a close connection with your trainer, kyle makes me feel comfortable and loved plus he is super funny and handsome, the total package but he is all mine boys!

I spoke with someone to make the appt. for the class but never got a confirmation email, follow-up call, etc. after the initial conversation and providing my CC info. I was told to arrive at 4:45. I arrived at 4:53. Now I understand that I was a bit late, I get that. However, the class did not start until 5:15 so you would think a place looking to make an impression and gain 2 new clients would at least try to make it work or offer an additional time or option for another class.  However, Alyse immediately let us know we were too late. I said ok and started walking away. My brother asked if there was anything we could do (i.e. giving her a chance to offer another option for a class or try to work with us in some way) Her reply was, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, class is starting really soon. There\u2019s no way we can do everything we need you to do\u201d So, we said ok and left. I called back to get the young lady\u2019s name because I was so dissatisfied with my experience. I was baffled that I was flat out turned away without her taking any opportunity to reconcile the situation. When I spoke with her she mentioned my brother told her I wasn\u2019t a resident earlier as to allude to the fact that perhaps maybe this was the reason she was less concerned with retaining us a potential client. To the contrary, I grew up in Tuscaloosa, have been living in Atlanta for the past 9 years and made the decision just this past week to pack up my life and move back because my mom is battling Pancreatic Cancer for the 3rd time in 4 years and not doing well at all. I probably would have signed up on the spot today because for the last year I\u2019ve been a member at F45 in Atlanta and am very serious about transitioning to a gym based in Tuscaloosa that also has locations in Atlanta. This would be so I can workout when I commute back to Atlanta 2-3 days a week as I still hold my corporate job there but will work remotely here in Tuscaloosa for the most part. To say that I am extremely disappointed with the service is an understatement. I was truly hoping to have a great class, lock down a contract with a new gym that would fit my needs during this difficult and transitional time in my life, & then try to enjoy what was left of my birthday. Sadly, this was not the case. Very poor experience.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a8303485c039:0x950b72dc7f30e396"}

They absolutely blare music throughout the building and you can't escape it even with noise cancelling headphones. There is also just a general culture that empowers everything newcomers fear about gyms. Steroid dudes screaming, mirror selfies a-plenty and an empowerment of that type of behavior. That may be more of a turnoff for some than others, but it is worth noting.

I understand some equipment is just something you should buy yourself, but it\u2019s such a pain to pack up 10 different things in your backpack because the gym has minimal equipment.  They realllllly push the personal training and nutrition services on you which can be off putting if you feel uncomfortable being firm with them and declining. I wish they had wipes or paper towels for cleaning instead of towels. The towels are always very dirty when I go and I feel the need to sanitize my hands after I use them because I know 15+ people probably used that towel before me.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1614612514605, "text": "Grace, thank you for your honest review.

We apologize if our team seemed pushy in regards to personal training, we just really care about our member's goals and progress!

It\u2019s like an escape! You walk in, and everyone is literally amped up, haha. The energy and professionalism is there and they treat everyone nicely. So, from experience since they opened, that friendliness doesn\u2019t go away once you sign up. That\u2019s just how they are! I did end up getting the personalized training set up, and it\u2019s been worth it for me since I was a beginner. I\u2019m noticing big changes. I\u2019ve met most, if not all trainers, so you got great options. They paired me up excellently when they asked about my goals and personality.\n\nAnyways, the basics: They have tons of equipment. The small things like bands, rollers, etc are at the desk- just ask! The smoothies are actually really amazing?! And those ax3 classes are crazzzy good. I noticed most of the <5 star reviews are about the music; it\u2019s a typical gym playlist, just bring headphones if you need to.

He then comes back as if he never walked away and started making side conversation about my husband and I to his coworker and eventually started arguing with my husband after my husband addressed him for disrespecting me and walking away! So then Logan Roberts walks up and starts stating he\u2019s the owner of the gym, never bothered to diffuse the situation or see what the situation was, he just immediately told us to \u201cGet Out of his Gym\u201d!! He then calls the police on us forcing us out of the gym! I told Logan, your employee Darryl, started this and your not even bothering to see what the situation is! He insisted we leave because it\u2019s private property! Eventually Darryl attempted to apologize and stated he was wrong! Even after that Logan insisted we leave and they waive our cancellation, I informed him, we were coming to Sign Up, Logan told us WE WERE NOT WELCOME AND WE NEEDED TO LEAVE!!! JACK(OWNER) if your reading this!!!! I hope this is not protocol on how you treat your customers! WE WONT BE BACK! We will take our business elsewhere!

I travel to the Birmingham area for work once a month and was looking for a gym/box that has hours on Sunday.  I had heard some not-so-great things about a few boxes but I hadn't heard of Forge Fitness/ CF Shades.  Not only is CF Shades the only place with Sunday hours, but they were above and beyond wonderfully welcoming when I showed up unannounced during their open gym period.  Upon first glance, the gym was very clean, which is not very common among CrossFit and Crossfit-inspired facilities.  The owner, Rich, jumped up from a staff meeting and gave me a tour and after learning of my CF history, invited me to use any and all of their space as well as invited me back through my duration of stay while in town.  They have an awesome workout space out back with a platform, squat racks and a rig and the running course around the building is super safe.  I also met coaches Caleb, Josh and Rebecca who were all very accommodating and friendly.  When I returned for a class, Rebecca coached and I really appreciated her attentiveness.  I'm a CrossFit coach in Denver and because I move relatively well, I tend to get left alone - but I love being coached when I drop into new places and Rebecca was great.

I was close, but even though I failed, I was offered to apply the money I put in towards a membership... The gym even has given me a rain check to apply it in March after I get my tax return, so it's more affordable for me. (so not really a loss when all is said and done!)\n\nThe people (coaches and members) I met have been nothing but encouraging. The workouts were well designed to keep you moving to accomplish in less than 30 minutes what many other classes, at other gyms I've attended, it has taken an hour to achieve (which is nice when you are low on time in your day!)\n\nI have a knee injury, and in previous gyms, my disability has made me feel inadequate or ashamed that I could not do what the rest of the class was doing. The coaches knew about my injury (and no matter what class I attended (morning or afternoon) with any coach, they were already well informed of my needs without the embarrassment of having to say as much at every new encounter. They were discreet and quick to tell me alternate exercises I could do, so I didn't feel as if I was the odd man out waiting to be assigned something different or taking away from the class by holding up the rest of the members, so that a coach could assist me.)\n\nMembers are at all different fitness levels, and the coaches are very attentive to every one's individual needs, and they are watching you and your progress making sure that you are on point doing the exercises CORRECTLY! (which as long as I've been working out, I hadn't realized how many simple movements I was doing incorrectly!)\n\nI could write a book on all the good experiences I have had just in my six weeks of attending, but I will wrap it up here with a final statement that I highly recommend this gym. It's changed my outlook about what I need for my own fitness journey, and I look forward to returning in March! I actually feel incredibly sad that I have to wait that long to return to my new fit fam!\n\nSpecial thanks to Matt and Zack for your tireless tutelage and positive attitude/feedback (I know I was all over the place lost on too many occasions! \ud83d\ude02) And thanks to all the members who were so very welcoming to me, I'm truly grateful and am already missing you!\n\nKeep at it! 3,2,1 TRIBE!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889218815457ad9:0x2a2e6920b4bf4b44"}

Overall the program itself is really good, and the coaches were wonderful.  I did get excellent results during this time in weightloss, body fat percentage reduction and high lean muscle.

I was sold that the 98% of challengers meet their goal, the meal plans are customized and that if for some reason you don't meet your goal you could apply to future classes. What I found is that ITF monthly fees are extremely high even with the so called Challenger discount, There seem to be very few challengers that actually meet the goal and the customized meal plan is merely based on starting weight and goal of weight loss, body fat percentage or muscle gain. There is no consideration of gender or age, which can be a huge factor in weight loss. The only offer is to apply your hefty deposit towards a minimally discounted 12 month commitment, so I am parting ways with ITF. Due to the way I feel they misrepresented this program.

I find it the most difficult, challenging, and fun workout I've done in my life.  I'm still on a learning curve, but I can say that I've also made progress!  Before I signed on, I was very worried about re-injuring my rotator cuff.  I let them know about my past injury, Zech and Jon showed me ways to modify my workouts.  As my shoulder got stronger, I've not needed some of the modifications and according to my chiropractor and orthopedic doctor,  my shoulder has fully healed.  I hate weights...really.  But I'm now swinging the 35 pound kettle ball.   The biggest weight I had lifted prior to Irontribe was a 15 pound dumb bell for bicep curls or deadlifts.  With these guys, I've done a 2 max rep 165 deadlift, and I'm learning to do beginner handstand pull ups!  The group environment is fun.  They keep me going.  We cheer each other on.  I find that when you do something difficult, share a difficult experience, like a WOD lol,  we feel connected to the each other and we want to see one another succeed.  We get excited when someone reaches a PR or finishes a tough workout. I'm a school teacher, so I was initially concerned with the cost.  I've found the monetary, time, and physical investment to be worth it. The coaches are the best, they make me smile because they challenge me, they challenge me to put on more weight or work with me on my nutrition and check up my attendance and progress.  Zechariah and Jon, Jen, Brandon, and Joe really care and they enjoy what they do.  They're not only about the paycheck, they're about making better athletes and building a community.

Even with minimal equipment, I loved the workouts.  More so, I was impressed with how the team leaders and coaches took interest in truly getting to know the people who stopped by for a free workout.  They have officially been open for a few months now and the workouts continue to impress.  The burn, build and box options allow for variety and can be tailored for any fitness level.  The coaches are approachable and motivating.  You can tell they love what they do and care about each member's progress.  They  encourage fun and sportsmanship each workout while pushing each member to be their best.  Regymen's passion for fitness also extends to the local community. They participate in local drives and advocate for members to do the same.

Does it cost a bit more than a typical gym membership?  Yes it does, but you get a lot for your money:  A great variety of instructor designed and led workouts; some of the same benefits as having a personal trainer as they will help you towards your personal fitness goals; A great calorie burn and muscle build in an hour...I typically burn 700-900 calories depending on the workout.  The best part is, I don\u2019t have to think about it.  I get there and everything is set up.  It\u2019s not a chore, I look forward to it, and feel great and more productive for the rest of the day.  All of the instructors and support staff are great.

This gym is a high school gym at best. One of all the equipment they have and they was not taken care of. There are holes in benchs, pads missing, weights that are bent, the equipment is old and out dated, ECT. I have worked out here for two months and have gained only fat. The place has no gym vibe, in fact at night it's kinda creepy. There is no saunna, no showers; nothing a real gym would have to help you. The few people that are in there spend more time talking then lifting which wouldn't be a problem if they ain't sitting on the on piece of equipment you need or they distract you from your workout. The only reason many people use this gym is the fact they can go to the gym at midnight.  This is a piss poor gym that the owner should be ashamed of.

I apologize if that was not made clear when you purchased it. At no time during the conversation when you requested the $5 refund or any other time during that month you were a member, did you express concern about cleaning or broken equipment at our facility - so I am unable to understand what those specific issues are or what equipment you think we're lacking. Our cleaning and repair personnel are very thorough and also work out daily at our facility and our members know them by name. When issues are identified we take care of them as quickly as possible. We clean the facility and the showers daily but we do not clean/rinse down the showers after each person using them, so I hope everyone is courteous to the next user after they leave a shower! Some things we can't control, and I'm sorry you're upset that we did not refund you the $5. We've been a \"real Gym\" in Pell City/Riverside area since 2004 and many of our members have been with us from the beginning, nobody's perfect but we try very hard to make our members happy."}, "gmap_id": "0x888bd7c6db9d8113:0x1feeb839120e3e9e"}

I can give you a summary so you understand everything that was done to help you solve this. Your very 1st draft on 6/1/19 was rejected by your bank because the account # you gave us was not correct. Our billing company tried to contact you by letter, but it was returned undeliverable. On 6/18/19 they called you by phone and your phone service did not allow them to leave a message. You contacted us on 8/13/19 due to a negative credit report filing - that was the first you were aware of the issue as you explained that you don't reconcile your account so you didn't know the payment wasn't being drafted. We immediately put you in touch with the billing company on 8/13/19 and the notes in your file state the following problems were corrected on the very same day. 1) All fees were removed from your account and they received your payment to bring your account current and a correct acct # for future billing. 2) Negative Credit Reporting was removed  3) Your address and phone was verified to ensure it was correct for future contact. I understand your negative feelings about this issue as no one likes to be inconvenienced by mistakes, but I also hope you are satisfied with the end result, as all the problems have been resolved very quickly."}, "gmap_id": "0x888bd7c6db9d8113:0x1feeb839120e3e9e"}

One shower stall (maybe two by now?), so if you're planning on getting a morning workout before work, you're mostly going to have to go home to change and shower.  It definitely works for some, because the place has it's crowded times. But at those times, the stretching/straps/floor area is just about unusable and first come first serve. But why did I give it a two instead of a three?  Because if you have to terminate your contract, they will add several fees that are not in your original terms.  When you call their billing department, they will refer you back and tell you you have to get your answers from the gym. Most annoying part -- when I went in in person to close my contract, the guy didn't offer a receipt.  I actually had to ask for email confirmation, or he wasn't going to show me anything.  When he agreed to the email confirmation, I asked to see the final tabulation of charges.  He printed something out and literally whisked it on front of me and kept moving it back away from me in one motion such that I couldn't even examine it.  He was otherwise very polite, and I didn't want to think the worst, so I just told myself I'd settle for that email receipt.

Your last key fob swipe also was from July of 2018, prior to our new owners taking over as well as prior to the club remodel and equipment upgrades. Since your last workout we have made many updates and equipment upgrades and class time changes.\nWe would have appreciated if your review were based on the club presently under it\u2019s current owners. It is unfortunate that your review does not reflect the club\u2019s current owners, culture, equipment or amenities\u2026. Writing a negative review from an experience from over a year ago just doesn\u2019t seem very reliable or fair.\nWe are not a big box gym nor do we try to be. We treat our members like family and try our best to provide a private upscale training environment for members looking for more of a relaxed and convenient environment away from the masses.\nRegarding your words about our cancelation policy, we provided to you a very specific cancelation request form that outlined the charges you would be assessed prior to your account being closed out. We offered to provide to you a copy in the club which you also declined. It is apparent that your review here, does not reflect our conversation when you came in to cancel, which is a misrepresentation to the public and very unfair.\nBefore any new member signs up for a membership agreement we make sure to cover every aspect of the contract including our club cancelation policy. Because you signed up under the previous owner, we were regrettably not afforded that opportunity in advance.\nHad we been the individuals to sign you up for membership we would have very clearly covered each aspect of your membership as well as our cancelation policy, and if there was anything you didn\u2019t understand we would have urged you to ask questions or not sign up.\nWe understand that it is also not possible to satisfy every demand of every person who comes through our doors, even if we try our best to do so.\nOverall we wish you well in your health and fitness journey."}, "gmap_id": "0x886268e9d0083be7:0x57539e2f5aa143b3"}

Access to top of the line machines and free weights\n.\n2.) Tiered group classes based on fitness levels and goals. \u201cBase, Build and Burn\u201d, something for everyone at every fitness level.\n\n3.) 24/7 gym Access rain or shine to 4K plus Anytime Fitness locations world wide. If you are a member at one location you have access to all the others, no questions asked.\n\n4.) Camaraderie and Coaching. We at Anytime Fitness Madison offer 1 on 1 coaching to help you create a strategy to crush your goals.

Relations with both of our trainers were terminated and communication by owners to us about trainers was non existent.  Agreements were not kept and in my opinion a general \"don't care\" attitude was exhibited.  At the end of our 30 day notice, my wife was billed for training and we were also billed for our next month membership.  We were refunded our training fee as \"a courtesy\".  Not sure how this was a courtesy since she had not trained for a month nor do I recall anywhere that we were on the hook for 30 days of training after the notice.  The membership was not refunded because it was billed during the period of our 30 day notice ... really??  Membership fees are for the next month ... it should have been prorated based on when our notice was given.  It's too bad because in general I really liked this gym and it's convenience to work.

We understand that you are upset with the changes made to our team that impacted you, however we have not broken or misrepresented any written agreement we had with you regarding your personal training sessions or membership.\n\nWe are also under no obligation to disclose the reasons for terminating past team members. Such disclosure regardless of the potential validity thereof, would be unprofessional. When we assigned another trainer to service your remaining sessions you and your wife regrettably declined to have them serviced and willfully forfeited your remaining sessions.\n\nOur membership agreements and club policy requires a thirty-day cancellation clause that is a necessary step in our cancellation process. This a standard practice for most franchise & big box gyms. Dissatisfaction with a particular clause in a membership agreement does not make for an invalid process or invalid agreement. It is standard practice that membership dues and or additional managed services that fall within a thirty-day time frame also remain billable.\n\nMembership dues are billed monthly and are not prorated because they are not billed according the amount of days in a month, rather they are based on a flat rate.  We find it interesting that you complained about a refund for personal training dues. This refund was issued as a courtesy since you decided to cancel your membership and personal training the same day. When we became aware that your membership and personal training would expire and thus no longer provide you a gym to use your remaining sessions in, we issued a prompt refund the same day.\n\nAlthough we retained the right to bill your account for the remaining sessions that fell within the thirty day notice window, we considered your circumstances and issued a refund. Although it was not our prerogative to look out for your personal financial obligations, we did so in order to prevent a customer service issue. It is unfortunate that the value for your refund was not appreciated in the same tone in your review as it was when you expressed appreciation over the phone.\n\nWe do however wish you well and hope that your new discount gym will be able to meet the demands that your require."}, "gmap_id": "0x886268e9d0083be7:0x57539e2f5aa143b3"}

No matter your fitness or experience level, or your training goals- you will have questions. Kramer will have answers. If Kramer doesn't, one of his patrons will. Between Kramer and wife, Kim, you will find a depth of Champion-level knowledge in powerlifting and bodybuilding, as well as D1 athletic preparation. Across the spectrum of patrons- Ironman competitors, triathletes, college athletes, special operations military, law enforcement, et al. Bring your ego. Let someone there crush it- and then they will help you build it back up. You will be humbled, and become humble- and if you stay long enough, you will do the same for someone else. You will find that Kramer's Gym is very much a community within the community. If you are looking to train for the first time- I implore you to start here, and ask any question. Someone will have your answer- guaranteed. There is a reason Kramer's has stood the test of time- it is not a corporate-chain gym.

That is our policy for safety and security of our members.

I spoke with a young man who said he was a grad student. He did explain they needed somewhere until he could use the Rec. They were not looking for a permanent gym. Unfortunately, it overcrowds our gym which is not fair to our members or potential members. I love college students I have plenty of them as members of our gym, but I don\u2019t want  the gym to be used as a Free place to work out until school starts.

As we\u2019re walking away, Dalton (owner) asks if we\u2019ve done Crossfit before and my friend says \u201cno\u201d as Dalton then kinda puts his hand in his face and says \u201cOh my goodness.\u201d I was pretty shocked...as an owner of a box, you have the opportunity to gain maybe two members but after that first impression, definitely not.\n\nWith that said, the workout was great! The coaches were super helpful to my friend and we definitely got a good WOD in for the day. Potentially would go back, but definitely not for who owns the place. Afterwards, I heard a few other people say not the greatest things about the owner, so hopefully he learns some people skills and grow his gym more in the future.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2ea2816e7f9:0x54ff9eb004aa51a8"}

I'm not comfortable with them being exposed to naked men or having to expose themselves. Probably a lot to ask for a kids dressing area or family room.

He's even a member of my board.\nLast year, after attending one of the fundraisers Live Ready hosts for us annually, I saw pictures of myself at the event and realized I needed to take control of my life and be the healthiest version of Lisa I can be. I started doing workouts in my home and making better food choices. By May of this year, I'd lost 41Lbs, but the scales had stopped moving. I reached out to Elliott and he told me I was most likely in a calorie deficit.  I recall my response; I laughed at him. He encouraged me to sign up for  a \"Love to Eat Challenge\" Through this challenge, I was taught what to eat and how my plate should look. I am happy to report that I won the challenge and to date, I have lost 64lbs. I am wearing the smallest clothes I've ever worn as an adult. I recently had surgery and  Elliott has asked me to start training with him once my Doctor clears me to do so.  In the past, I would have said, \"No way.\" Now, I have the confidence I need to accept the challenge.\nIf you are looking to make positive changes in your life, I urge you to contact Elliott and his team. They are not only the best at what they do, but some of the nicest and most encouraging people you will ever meet. You won't feel pressured or intimidated.

That's $1440 for a year. I think what turned me away was the amount of willingness to work with folks like myself, whom are rarely here due to work. It was pretty clear that $120 was the price and nothing less than military orders would change that. Even then the offer sounded less than ideal. So, that's the business side.\n\nThe workout side of this facility seemed... Alright. The facility was great as were the staff and customer personalities and support. Going back to the money, I definitely don't believe the training I saw warranted the price. I saw more flexion in lower back than I care to see-not just from young/new members. My fear of CrossFit gyms is always seeing atrocious form, and although that wasn't the case here (form wasn't... Terrible...) It still wasn't good enough for the hefty price. I could get a personal coach for the same and get precise, individual training for less money and same or better quality.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1507482201039, "text": "We are so sorry to hear that you do not agree with the price we charge.

We also realize that people\u2019s form are less then perfect but everyone comes in moving different, with different mobility problems and different degrees of fitness and athleticism. Some of those people take years of work to make the smallest change but I assure you that our coaches work tirelessly to do so and our athletes make dramatic improvements in quality of movement and life!

The coaches are skilled both at challenging the younger, stronger athletes while also making newbies feel comfortable and helping those of us who may be further along in age learn, develop, and get stronger and faster, all while staying safe. And the cost? I wish I knew then what I know now - I can't afford NOT to go.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889196467bf7ca5:0x195e9df231279337"}

I'm not sure how they are always in such a great mood. They can really will turn around a bad day. The coaches will improve your mental and physical ability with the solid understanding they have. All you need to do is show up and give a 100%. The other enjoyment is friends you will meet to compete with and pull you along.

The coaches are great and work with and they are in it to help you  achieve all of your personal goals. MOST of the coaches are warm, inviting and friendly. My experience mostly took place in the Homewood location. Although I enjoyed the classes I did feel that the class I attended in the evening had a \"clicky\", \"club-like\" kind of feel to it.\nThey do offer a lot of products, paleo meals, clothing and other accessories branded with their name but I felt that was pushed a bit much. I also felt the more they started growing the more flashy and uppity some of the staff members became. I would occasionally see some of the coaches out and about on my daily runs and routines and it was rare they even aknowledged me.\nThe gym is way overpriced. After about a year I decided it was not realistic for me to continue paying the rate they charge. I very much wanted to continue crossfit and found a few other gyms, one of which I am a new member now, that offer more than Irontribe offers at a significantly lower rate. The membership I have now allows both me and my husband to go unlimited for the same cost of one membership at Irontribe only allowing me to go 3 days per week.\nWould I recommend Irontribe? Probably not. There are just too many other crossfit gyms in the area more feasable and some offering even more than what Irontribe has to offer and at a much lower cost without making you feel like you have to belong to a club to fit in.

The eight-week nutrition challenge, that started in January, gave me so much insight and knowledge surrounding my diet. The challenge has shown me the best way to manage my diet and food in-take without being controlled by food.  I would encourage anyone out there, no matter where you are in life, to give CrossFit shot.  It is the best decision you will make in life.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1579852963044, "text": "Thanks Landon!! You are a beast!!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888962b7ac8c1931:0x5a1056ca94f78dbc"}

Still the best decision I have made.\n\nI was a member of Crossfit Trussville several years ago. I absolutely loved it but I moved and changed jobs and just could not make myself drive out of the way. Since then I have tried other gyms, working out at home, and nothing was working for me. I could not stay motivated. I was about to force myself to drive out of the way to go back to Trussville. Then the greatest thing happened, Andrew and Braden decided to open Crossfit Pell City. Working out is fun again. I see results again. This place turns into your home away from home. The members turn into family. The coaching and programming are top notch. It doesn't get any better.

Tons of cardio things treadmills, etc.\n\nCons: The workout equipment is spread out all over in various nooks and crannies and different rooms causing you to have to search for equipment to work different muscle groups. Would be great if machines were more centrally located. Perhaps it's done this way because of covid 19? Also this place is very expensive compared to comparable gyms. $47 per month. Ouch! If you're alumni the price drops to $42. Still too high. I guess that's why there's no start up fee. Also, hours of operation are a bit strange to me.

The only contract you signed was for the term of 12 months. A while after your membership expired, your wife contacted us in order to buy another year in cash. When we informed her of our current cash price for a 12 month membership, she decided not to purchase the membership. If a member signs a standard contract with us, their membership will draft at the original rate until that member decides to terminate their membership. We, however can not promise that our paid in full cash memberships will remain the same price as they were seven years ago.

I took the first fit test on day one... I failed the test (I didn't complete the test within the allotted timeframe). The coaches (yeah, there're coaches there every step of the way) told the class that this is a benchmark test. We will take MINUETS off our time by week three. My pride was hurt (so was my lungs, legs, and everything else), but I kept going to class. They taught me moves (they corrected some of what I thought I knew, and introduced me to a lot of new ones), encouraged me, motivated me, and kept me accountable to every rep. I took the fit test again at the end of week three and completed it in 11:42 sec (down from 17:19)! After that, denying the program was out the window. I signed up and attended classes everyday they were offered (unless I was on travel - I still completed my workouts while TDY - they have travel workouts for you).

I was unable to afford a membership at the time due to two kids in braces, and when I called to cancel they said I had to give a 30 day notice. I only went to the free class, I never attended a real class. I spoke with the manager, Abbie, who was no help. She basically told me that 2 months will automatically be charged before it is cancelled on their end. And when I told her I couldn't afford it, her response was, \"that's not my problem\".... Yep, that's what she said. I politely asked if I could get the number to corporate, but she wouldn't provide it. She would have her manager call. Very frustrating. Bottom line, if you try it and love it, please read the paperwork before you sign. Don't let them talk you into signing it and then email it to you. I'd hate to know how many others got caught in this situation as well.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d74a29b3a93:0xf473023f77efce12"}

Orange Theory is the place to be! It was a very challenging workout but yet you can complete it because you can do it at your own pace. The first person I came in contact with was Deanna at the front desk. She was very sweet and gave me the first run down of how Orange Theory worked. Then I met my coach, Heather. Heather was awesome and was understanding of any orthopedic issues that you may have and had variations for some of the exercises. The music was great and Heather always continued to motivate and push you though the workout. There was a moment when I had to slow my own pace and that was okay, the workout continued and I finished it to the end. Overall Orange Theory will be my gym of choice for years to come.

If you've never been to an Orangetheory class, I can explain it simply - in my own words, it's a 60 minute 5 zone heart rate based group personal training session that includes cardio and weights. I've never been much into cardio but the class provides you ways of doing cardio through walking, jogging or running - you choose. I LOVED that! I really like the group exercise classes, because they always make me push harder than I would on my own. In addition to that the use of heart rate monitoring is unique and something that enabled me to track my performance and challenge myself...which I really enjoyed.\n\nOverall I would def recommend this place to anyone.

They offer a great mix of free weights as well as machines, they have a cardio room that's great for stretching, and now has a punching bag in it (major plus since no other gyms in the area has a punching bag). They do have some good personal trainers, and offer classes. One major benefit is its 24/7. You can work out on your own schedule to fit your lifestyle.  I prefer working out at 4am, and this gym affords me that luxury. I've never had a wait time to use any machine, that's also a major plus.

This type of environment is one of my favorites to train in. The members are mostly powerlifters and bodybuilders. Everybody in here is working hard toward some goals. It's inspiring. Newer folks need not be shy though. I found the community super welcoming. They don't care how much you lift, just that you are in there working side by side.\n\nThe leg room includes a squat cage, GHD, reverse hyper, calf raise, etc. The deadlift room has a platform, iron, bar jack, and some super grippy, high quality deadlift bars. The arms area has dumbells (up to 150lbs at least!), various machines, and a few bench press stations. The conditinung area has a yolk, farmer's carry handles, a sled and lots of turf.   There are also places to Olympic lift and do basic cardio.\n\nOn top of all that, the staff was super helpful and friendly and the drop in fee was small.
