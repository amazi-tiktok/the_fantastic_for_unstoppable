But I saw more interaction with me from Sierra and Ryan than Kim ever did. I felt I should have had either of them assigned to me but if Kim did not have an opening I could not make an appointment. My foot for which I was doing physical therapy was not improving mainly because what I was doing did not work for what my problem was. I have stopped going because of time that I do not have to do it now and until or unless I can see improvement I will not be back. I prefer Ryan or Sierra anyway because they paid attention to the patients and made sure the patients were doing what was prescribed for them to do. I also think there was something else that could have been done for my foot swelling like it does. I do NOT want Kim back since she hardly paid any attention to me anyway. I more or less did what I wanted as long as she did not have to bother with me. Maybe I did not have enough money in my bankaccount to suit her. I don't know and don't really care.

I couldn\u2019t lift over 5 pounds when I first began treatment at Results PT.  Madeline Arnall was understanding when I tried to explain my pain and limited mobility in laymen\u2019s terms.  She shared her plan for treatment and, along with Ms Lori, helped me regain flexibility and strength.  The two of them equipped me with information that applies to more than what initially brought me there; I learned more about my lifelong health and longevity during my appointments.  Physical therapy is challenging, and it was nice to have patient, understanding therapists to help me through the hard days.  We made plans to overcome setbacks and celebrated steps forward.  Looking back over the past few months, I would say that I am stronger now than before the car accident.  I showed up to my appointments and committed fully to their instructions and am glad to say that I am back to my busy, physically-demanding routine.\n\nThe rest of the staff was always respectful and professional.  Katie is fantastic at explaining all account information and it was fun to share a few laughs with her.

I had back surgery in 2009 (L5-S1 discectomy) and was strongly discouraged from running by a PT I saw after my surgery.  I had been feeling pretty good getting back into it, but was worried about possible injury both to my back and knees.  Andrew's running assessment and subsequent muscle strength assessment were extremely helpful.  He gave me a couple of things to change while running to help prevent injury and a list of stretches to strengthen my leg and core muscles.  A few weeks ago I ran my very first half marathon.  A few weeks before that, I had tweaked my back doing something stupid and was afraid I was going to have to give up running the half.  I emailed Andrew who encouraged me that all was not lost.  With his expert advice, I not only ran the whole way, but ran faster than I was expecting!  I have since run a 10K and have 2 more half marathons and a 10-miler on the horizon.\n\nSeriously, make an appointment with Andrew!  For anything!  Not just if you're a runner or athlete.  He can help with normal (and not so normal) life pains, post-surgery issues, etc.  Not only is he knowledgeable about how the body works, but he also takes the time to explain the whats and whys and hows.  My only complaint is that he lives in Alabama while I'm in Colorado and therefore I can't very easily make appointments with him!

I've been to Andrew 4x in 5 months and each time he observes me and then prescribes new exercises for me to do at home. The meetings are over an hour and he is very patient and engaged. It is not like any pt I have been to in the past. Most of the work you do at home, so there are not a lot of appointments. I've been doing my exercises regularly and my pain has receded and I'm back to running. Andrew not only correctly diagnosed the problem, he takes the time to explain exactly what is going on. I've worked on my running form and with my exercises, I'm a better, faster, more efficient runner than before I got injured.

His approach is very individualized and specific with lots of feedback over email, fb messenger and texting.  I struggled for years with an ongoing hip issue and it got to a point were it interfered not just with sports, but also with my work and daily living. I followed his blogs on social media and finally contacted him in December of 2017.  I am so glad I did!  He responded almost immediately and as soon as I had a referral I was good to go. He assessed my strength and abilities and identified multiple problems.  He methodically works on one issue at the time and helps me build my hip strengths up.  Instead of going 3 days a week for several weeks (which is really hard to do if you are working), I was set up over a longer period of time (once a week, then twice a month, then 4 weeks/6 weeks later).  The phone exercise app he provides, allows me to track the exercises I have to do.  He is very encouraging especially at times when I think I'm not making any progress and teaches you self release methods to relieve pain.  I am now into my 4th month of therapy  (6th visit) and I'm running again!  My hip feels stronger and I'm looking forward to many more miles on trails and roads in the future.  Andrews approach does take self motivation because you have to do the work on your own rather than at office setting for an hour 3 days a week.  But being pain free is a great motivator.  So if doctors visits haven't worked out for you, I would highly recommend you contact Andrew.

I had bought my Trifecta Pass just a few weeks prior after assuring myself that I would recover in time to race.  After weeks of ineffective self care I went to my family doctor. After an X-ray and no real good advice they referred me to an orthopedic doctor. He confirmed I didn\u2019t have anything major and gave me the same useless advice and a prescription ointment that didn\u2019t do much. By this time it was all I could do to walk around the house. I was heartbroken to think that I wouldn\u2019t be able to race. Thankfully I found Andrew through his insightful Facebook posts and gave him a call last January. His wholistic and long term vision for getting better and staying better was exactly what I was looking for. The running analysis he provided revealed so many things that could have stalled my fitness goals indefinitely had they been left unaddressed.  I travel a lot for work as well, so his \u201cwork on your own\u201d method for physical therapy exercises rather than multiple visits per week was a perfect way for me to augment my existing exercise routine without disrupting my work schedule. By March I was able to finish the Atlanta Sprint race - still walking more than I wanted but at least I was on the course and it only took about 30 minutes more than usual.  After about 5 or 6 visits I had made good progress and was on my way to pain free running. By July I was able to run the Asheville Super and only had to pace myself a bit on the downhill portion towards the end of the race.  In August I started having shin splints.  I reached out to Andrew via Facebook Messenger and within an hour had a new set of exercises that took care of the problem in a few weeks.  No \u201cmake an appointment with the receptionist\u201d or other nonsense like that.  The last time I had shin splints they lingered for months and the only advice I got from my doctor was to take a few Advil every day and stop exercising - not an option for me. Now in November I was able to run the Carolina Beast without any pain.  Achieving this goal would not have happened without Andrew\u2019s help and seemed impossible when I was limping out of the store with a knee brace last December.\nAt first I was worried about not being able to have insurance cover my therapy. In retrospect, the investment I made with PhysioWorks is going to save me so much money in the long run.  Andrew\u2019s approach was exactly what this Spartan needed to finally join the Trifecta Tribe.  If you\u2019re an Obstacle Course Racer and have any pain that\u2019s keeping you off the course, I highly recommend you give PhysioWorks a try. Andrew works with a local Crossfit business as well, so he can help with more than just running.\nThanks Andrew!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1509839627753, "text": "Thanks Tag!

My grandmother was admitted to Marshall Manor for rehab. Shortly afterward we found out she had lung cancer that had moved into her bones also. They consistently served food that was horrible, and in some cases unidentifiable. She was bed bound and had to push the nurse call button for assistance to use the bathroom. Once it was an HOUR before anyone came to help her. Finally, when we were trying to coordinate transportation for her appointment at the cancer care center, they were absolutely unwilling to help until I enlisted the help of the ombudsmen and threatened to file a complaint with their corporate office. They went so far as to lie to the scheduler from the Cancer Care Center when she called herself to try to arrange transportation. They claimed my grandmother was \"very mobile\". She was totally bed bound. When the Dr and the Cancer Care Center saw my grandmother, he apologized profusely and said he had been misled about her condition. He had her admitted immediately to Shepherd's Cove (a hospice facility).

I have suffered accelerated degenerative disc disease (DDS), spondylosis, and stenosis  in my spine, since age 38. In the past 15 years, my condition has necessitated a spinal fusion (L5-S1), a microdiscectomy (L4-L5),  and a neck (cervical) fusion (C3-C4).       The surgeries were successful with the last neck surgery sparing me from becoming a paraplegic or death. I have been blessed with excellent surgeons and caregivers. I'm grateful.\nI had tried chiropractor prior to my surgeries. The chiropractor worked diligently with me. I also worked hard doing all to help myself. The effort did not help. I would suppose my spine had too many mechanical issues at that time.\nAs I aged, my condition worsened until I was bed fast 18 hours or more each 24 hour cycle. One day as I was laying in bed , the latter part of 2015, I thought maybe I should try chiropractor services again. After all, the surgeries had alleviated some of the worst mechanical problems in my spine. I had 7 primary points of pain. The pain between my shoulder blades was the worse, a grating, stinging type of pain. My thoughts were, If I can knock out 80% of that pain, I would be 30-40% better overall. Also, this pain would mushroom into total body pain, unless I was able to quiet the pain. Laying on ice gel packs would help quiet the pain.\nI obtained the services of Dr. Anthony Houssain at SpineCare.  My first meeting (Jan. 2016) with Dr. Houssain, I laid out my objective. My objective was to lessen the pain between the shoulder blades by 80%.  Dr. Houssain set me on a treatment path to help me accomplish my objective. He was encouraging and very knowledgeable. Dr. Houssain believed he could give me back a part of my life that I had lost.\nOn my second visit,  Dr. Houssain manipulated 3 vertebrates in my thoracic area. I went home and lay down. I had a first, two hours pain free between the shoulder blades. Now, I had hope and believed we were on the right path to accomplish my goal. He has helped me not only to obtain my objective , but to exceed my objective. At times, I do have pain between my shoulder blades. When I experience the pain, I execute the home part of Dr. Houssain's treatment program. Dr. Houssain's treatment program with other tools in my toolbox are sufficient to manage and mostly alleviate the pain between the shoulder blades.\nI love the game of golf. Seven or eight years ago, I was having a good day for me. My son and I decided to play a round of golf. My whole body was in pain after the round. I got home, went to my room, shut the door, and cried my heart out. I was in total body pain and believed I would never play golf again. This was my last round of golf with my son. I did not hit a golf ball for another 7-8 years.\nAfter the pain between my shoulder blades was mostly alleviated and/or pain level lessened, it was time to attempt a round of golf again. On April 19, 2016, I played golf with my son, shooting 89. I was sore, but did not have any serious side-effects. I now play golf, about once a week. I am now able to be up more hours per day.\nMy objective was accomplished with Dr. Houssain's help. In fact, it would not have happened without him. I am not well, but I have a much better life. Will I continue to improve or will the good ride end? I don't know, but I know it been a much better ride since April. I thank the good Lord for putting people in my life to help me, Dr Houssain being one of those people.\nI know every one is different, and one may obtain better results than me, or not obtain as good results as me. But, I always have kept trying to find any nugget that would help me be better. I hope those who read this, will keep trying to find that nugget for themselves. If one keeps trying, they may well find the nugget that makes their life better.. Keep on, keeping on.

I never imagined the experience would become so personal.  At my first visit, I met with Robby to discuss all my issues.  He has a genuine nature, a respect for where you are in the process, and a drive to see you return to wellness.  He took the time to evaluate me and was methodical in his design of a plan that worked not only in the clinic but could be transitioned to home. He championed me through tough times with kindness, professionalism, and a warmth that led to a trust which is necessary for the recovery process to be successful.  He is a credit to his profession and an asset to TherapySouth.\nThroughout the following weeks, I worked with Abbey.  Abbey is truly a pioneer in her field.  She is focused and attentive during every session, kind, compassionate, knowledgeable, and helpful.  When I was doubtful, she was always there to encourage me, being honest with me about the challenges I would face, yet reassuring me that I would one day be able to return to a life filled with many athletic endeavors.  Abbey is understanding and genuinely takes a personal interest in how you're feeling.  She always made sure to explain every exercise in depth and also how it would aid in my progress going forward.  I feel lucky to have been guided by Abbey along my PT journey, for it was her encouragement that pushed me through when I was at my lowest.\nHannah is also extremely helpful and efficient.  Being the face you see when you first walk in, she is cheerful and always greets the patients by name.  TherapySouth has an amazing team and, more importantly, great teamwork.  It is modern and very nice, clean, and an extremely well-run practice.  I couldn't be happier with my experience with something I wasn't at all looking forward to.\nThank you to the TherapySouth team for always answering my questions with interest and patience.

Since our regular Parkinson's neurologist is in Atlanta, Dr. Wilson said that he would refer us to a neurologist and forward the records.  As of today's date, we haven't heard a word from anyone.....we would assume that if there was an issue with a new appointment, we would have been contacted by Dr. Wilson's office.  I am sure that The Orthopedic Clinic and Dr. Wilson are very good at what they do, but we would have appreciated at least having a follow up of some sort.  Was the referral ever made?  We have no idea since we don't know the name of the neurologist he was referring my husband to, so cannot call that office for confirmation.  I don't feel I should have to call Dr. Wilson's staff to make sure the referral was even made.  We will be seeking help ourselves elsewhere.\n\nUPDATE AS OF OCTOBER 3, 2018  We finally received a letter from a neurologist in Auburn giving us an appointment date.  No phone calls, nothing.  Just a letter telling when to be there.  And by the way, the appointment is scheduled 11 MONTHS after our appointment with Dr. Wilson.  Seriously?  January of 2019.

He didn't even examine her.  She requested a report from the office, so that she could give it to the next doctor she saw (she would never set foot in this office again) and it said all these things about how much movement, flexibility, etc. she had in her shoulder, as if he had examined her.

When my mom asked him about disability (again, she was in too much pain to move her arm, and my mom is *not* a complainer) he told her to go back to work, and if she couldn't do it because of the pain, to find a new job.  She pointed out that if she did that she would lose her health insurance, and he just shrugged.  So, that was our experience.

So an MRI, I was told I may have Multiple Sclerosis. hundred's of pills later, I was about to give up. One of the side effects of the migraines had been severe stiffness in my neck and shooting pain. So after a few more trips in the MRI tube, They found nerve damage and herniated discs. Years of flying and poor posture got me.

I've been through 2 rounds of PT at Nesin Therapy over the past few years.  I describe them as \"miracle workers.\"   Before I reached out to Nesin for therapy, I had been sent by an orthopedist for a hip injection at Crestwood and also had injections into the SI joint by a pain management doctor at Sportsmed, both without any relief at all.  I would recommend that before you resort to surgery or injections that you see a therapist at Nesin.  They are top notch at diagnosing problems on the very first visit.  Both rounds of my therapy were the result of tight, weakened muscles in particular areas.

The \"hands on\" manipulations to the affected areas were the answers to my prayers both times.

Being an active person who likes to hike and lives on a farm, I immediately went to the doctor and was referred for physical therapy. It didn't help at all. Over the last five years, I have tried different doctors who have referred me to different physical therapists, with no change in pain level.\nAt my last doctor's appointment, my primary doctor asked if anything was bothering me and I told him I still had plantar fasciitis. We talked through my experience and he suggested I try a different podiatrist, Dr. Stark. Dr. Stark immediately referred me to Therapy South and asked that I see Robert Harris. I went to the appointment not expecting any different outcome but I am so glad I went! Robert was encouraging, saying he had a plan and he felt confident he could help me. We started with therapy three times a week, addressing first the plantar problem but then working backward to involve the parts of the leg and hip that caused the injury in the first place. Robert gave me four exercises to do twice daily at home and I logged exercise sessions through an easy to use app. Each appointment has been a teaching experience. Robert asks how I'm doing, I tell him how I'm progressing or having problems and he immediately explains and teaches me a stretch or exercise that will help. Robert's goal is to teach me strategies to address problems independently in the future. Each week finds me feeling better, my plantar fasciitis pain now almost completely gone.

The injury happened around 1 year before I became their patient.  During that year, I had no luck controlling the pain with pharmacological therapy, cervical steroid epidurals or a previous round of physical therapy. I found myself in bed and in tears almost daily due to the pain the pain I felt. It affected my schoolwork, my social life, and my ability to do general everyday activities like driving etc.\n\nI was very apprehensive about physical therapy when it was prescribed to me for a second time. The first time around (at a different facility in the Auburn area) physical therapy left me feeling defeated and in more pain than ever. However, after my very FIRST visit with Robert, I knew that TherapySouth was the place to be. He took his time to get every detail about my pain level, mobility, daily activities and most importantly, my end goals for therapy.\n\nHe created a workout and therapy plan tailored to my specific needs and abilities.  After every session I felt increasingly better. Nine months later, I am able to do most activities that I want/need/love to do without ANY pain and I have gained muscle strength and flexibility that I so desperately needed.\n\nI really don't know what I would have done without the physical therapists Robert and Emily, their interns, and the wonderful staff at TherapySouth-Auburn.

A year and a half ago, I could no longer live with my shoulder pain, both sides due to torn rotator cuffs.  My orthopedist said surgery was likely the only way to successfully heal.  I did not want that and asked for a PT referral.  I began therapy at TherapySouth in January 2018 and was surprised at how thorough and caring the folks were.  I was asked detailed questions throughout my initial evaluation and follow-up questions during each exercise.  Robert and Dreher would adjust exercises according to my limits and evaluate my ongoing recovery at each session.  By April, I had almost full motion in my arms/shoulders, pain was gone, and I even could reach around back to scratch my shoulder blades!  All without any NSAIDS or other drugs.\n\nSo when I began having elbow pain this year, I asked my doctor for a referral to TherapySouth.  Once again a thorough evaluation of my pain and its source was done by Robert.  By the second session I was already experiencing significant relief from pain that was serious enough to keep me awake at night.  And no drugs!  During my last session, I menbtioned that I also suffered from occipital neuralgia.  Robert did not seem surprised and showed me how complex the relationship with all the tendons, muscles, etc in the back and neck can end up causing pain and trigger points.  Here I am two days later with reduced pain throughout my neck, back, shoulders.\n\nIf you are injured, TherapySouth is the place to go for Physical Therapy.  I've literally been to dozens of therapists over a lifetime.  No one comes close to these folks.  If I could give them 10 stars instead of 5 I would do that.  I'm lucky to have found them and grateful for all they have done for me.

Both were done by the same surgeon. My first surgery was in November of 2015. I did physical therapy at another Hoover clinic (not a therapy south) and I grew to hate physical therapy, physical therapists, anything associated with them. I honestly believed the profession was a crock because of the poor care I had received at that clinic. I didn\u2019t know any better! My hip never got better, it was much weaker than before, and three years later, is still in pain and lacking the function I had prior. My skepticism towards physical therapy as it turns out, was just because I went to the wrong place. After a shoulder surgery in May of 2016, I was referred to Chris and Corey from a friend and my outlook could not be more different now. Not only did they cater my shoulder rehab to my specific sport (weightlifting), they also helped me repair my hip and alleviate some of my pain. I\u2019m a true believer in physical therapy now, even going as far as changing my career path so I can also change someone\u2019s outlook.

I have been to a few other therapy centers over the fast few years, and they are by far the best. I chose this location because I heard about a treatment called, dry needling. I have 2 herniated discs in my cervical spine and I have tried everything to relieve the pain from massage therapy to multiple steroid injections, a nerve ablation and even CBD oil with no relief. I am currently scheduled for my 2nd cervical fusion surgery in a few days, and prior to dry needling and this round of physical therapy, the pain in my neck and shoulder was at an 8 out of ten on the pain scale. I chose dry needling because as anyone with cervical spine issues knows, the knots in your upper back and shoulders are ridiculously painful. Today is my last day of physical therapy, in just 9 sessions of therapy and 4 dry needling sessions with Haley, my pain level went from an 8 to a 2, which is amazing.
