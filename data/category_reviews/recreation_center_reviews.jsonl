The rooms were clean and fresh bedding was provided, although we brought our own. I opted to use the provided bedding. The rooms had two bunk beds for a maximum capacity of 4 people. The lower level of Mount Moriah (we stayed in the top level--a two story building) has a nice little lobby area with some chairs and a couch. Some guys in our group thought it would be funny to take the couch upstairs and place it in front of our leader's room. We returned the couch afterwards.\n\nThe rest of the camp was very beautiful and well kept. There were some lawn care professionals maintaining the grounds while we stayed.\n\nThe recreation area, known as the \"Adventure Camp\" was very nice. The pool was large enough for our group to comfortably play in, as well as others. A diving board added to the fun. The Tennis courts and Basketball courts were very nice and well kept, but you will need to bring your own tennis supplies, as they are not provided. There was a small \"lake\" on camp grounds, with paddle boarding, and some water inflatables. We did not decide to go on these as they cost an extortionate amount of $8 for 30 mins of play. Not worth it.\n\nIt would we worth nothing that everything is fairly spread apart and there are some very intense hills throughout, which took a toll on our legs and knees. Golf Cart rentals were available for $35/day, but we had too many in our group that it would cost too much, so we didn't do it.\n\nThe food service was very nice, the food tasted adequate and there was always a variety to choose from. It is a self serve food line, so you are free to eat what you choose. A nice addition is the unlimited complimentary Soft Serve Ice Cream available at each and every meal.\n\nOverall I have to say Shocco Springs is one of my favourite camps that I've been to. Sure it's a little hot here in Alabama, but that's fine. Just bring some water, and going swimming can help tremendously.\n\n-Matthew J., age 15 at time of writing. Visited From June 1-5, 2016.

My husband had to beg for the WiFi password they advertise as free with moving in, even when we got the password  we only had a small WiFi signal half of the day while the landlord lives it up on the same WiFi.

They have a very nice clean pool which my daughter and I took advantage of.  She's also played with all the children that were here. Needless to say she had a good time playing on the playground and with the other children. Laundry and bath house are clean. About 8 Dollars to wash 3 loads of clothes and dry them. Not bad.  Once again this is a RV park not a resort. People live here. They do have trailers to rent they are dateded.  They have full hookup cable lots of channels. Lots. Disney jr. Football anything you might want to watch.  They are making improvements. Covered concrete slab to park your fifth wheel or diesel pusher. Bus. Or camper. All in all this place was a great place to stay. People are friendly and helpful. My husband, daughter and I will stay here again if we are ever in the area. Also. This RV park is in the middle of everything . The uss Alabama is not far and dauphin park is close also the gulf coast.

When you first go in the woman at the desk named jill will try to act really nice and friendly, but she is really not!!! We stayed there for a few days and we got such a weird feeling staying there that we decided to leave and we had already paid them up for a month. We went and told them we wanted to leave that we need our money back and she kept saying she would have to talk to the owner to come back the next day so we did and she kept saying she couldnt get ahold of him and she doesnt have the key to the safe. So she told us to come back the next morning and still she couldnt get ahold of the owner then she ended up getting ahold of him and she started telling my husband that they could give us our money back and that my husband had agreed on $350 and my husband said no i never agreed to that she said yes you did i have it on camera where you did my husband said well roll the tapes back then i wanna see it and of course she didnt do it ! Anyways somehow she still couldnt get the money because the owner couldnt come again to meet us til like the next week i think it was and my husband explained to her that we cant do that that we needed our money back so we could get back home that was a 10 hr drive and that we had no place to go and she said i will go ahead and let you stay a week for free i know the manager will get mad but im gonna do it! Well the manager ended up comin by our camper on a four wheeler and told us to be up there a little bit before the week was over and we would work something out and my husband said ok. Well we went to the office and still he wasnt there to meet us the woman called him texted him... He still wouldnt come to the office to meet so we could talk to him and finally told the woman to get the money out of the safe, but all she gave us was like $300 and said she would send us $50 in the mail and my husband and i told her no that isnt right you owe us like $580 then she said well he says thats what he owes u my husband said no it is more than that we figured it all up on a calculator right in front of her and she said ill tell u what i will give u the $300 now then send you the rest in the mail even if he dissagrees i will get it out of the safe myself and send it to you so we went ahead and agreed cause we were tired of arguing knowing that we are more than likely going to get ripped off but we were so ready to get home that we just did it. Anyways we get home and call her at the time she told us to and of course jill told us oh i wont be able to give u the $50( she owed us like $280 not $50) because we didnt clean the camper before we left which we did she said that is a $40 fee and we had forgot to give them the key before we left so that was a $10 fee and might i add she was laughing as she told my husband this! So my husband told her she would be hearing from our lawyer and hung up the phone. Oh and one more thing i want to add the second time my husband went to the office to try to get the money back he went by hiself and she went off on him when he asked about the money started hollering and screaming at him my husband said mam i am not raising my voice or nothing i am talking ti you calmly and you are being very rude i just want my money back! My husband ended up just walking out and came back to the camper where i was. And the woman acts like she is under the influence of some kind of speed she talks jerks around really fast!

Coaches usually have no true knowledge of the what they're coaching or are just lazy.  Don't even teach the kids basic rules of the game.  Teams not established with equal or close to equal number of players.  The Director(Kyle) is not truly concerned.  He has admitted that he has applied for a city utilities position, so his promises to resolve the issues are merely words because he's hoping to get away from this \"little job\".\nOne team roster will have the exact minimum while another team has 3-4 excess (basketball for this example).  Softball season has the same issue.  Last year our team had 9 while 3 opposing teams had 12-14 players each. This is a known issue at the beginning of the season, but it never gets resolved!!\nMore detailed description of issues: My daughter is the only kid that showed up for a game on Friday, so we borrowed an entire other other team that just happened to be there early.  The next day, neither team coach shows up, only my daughter and 2 others on her team, only 3 from the team we were supposed to play.  NONE of us heard anything about cancellation.  That following Monday, my daughter's coach calls and says that he will be out, but he has someone that can fill in.  We go to the game expecting to still play, only my daughter and ONE other kid from her team show up.  1 kid from the opposing team and NO coach.  NOBODY informed us that they decided to cancel.\nSoftball season, we struggled to get all of our 9 players to be present because of poor player roster distribution established by the Rec.

I am absolutely appalled at the staffing of this establishment. My son and his friend (both 10) were physically assaulted by a group of teenagers (15). Now I know, kids can be wild but I had several adults that I didnt know run to find me when this happened. My older nephew attempted to intervene as these children were stomping on my sons stomach and forcibly holding him under the ball pit. I was informed by multiple adult witnesses who confirmed this was in fact what was happening. When my nephew tried to tell the boys to leave my 10 year old son alone the boys ADULT father bowed up on my nephew making threats yelling in his face. My nephew is also A CHILD. There were ZERO staff members to be found and when I was finally able to talk to a manager (Tiffany) I was disrespected and cut off mid sentence. She refused to hear my concerns. I was completely rational and calm as I was just trying to speak with someone in charge and have the cameras viewed so I could find out what actions should be taken. When asked to speak to someone above her she refused to give me any name or contact info and WALKED AWAY mid sentence. We have always enjoyed bringing our children here, but if I am paying for a party that large with that many children I would expect my guests to be SAFE. I would love to speak with someone above the managers on staff due to the absolute lack of professionalism they displayed. It is not my intention to be tacky or tasteless but I am shocked at how children being visibly injured was met by \"management\". This establishment should be well staffed for the level of children it sees on a nightly basis and all of the children should feel and BE safe. Staff members do not supervise in any way, like other trampoline parks do. spending close to 500$ for a 2 hour party, my child and his friend were jumped on kicked and bullied by 5 teenage boys and the manager (Tiffany) didn't even offer an apology or ask the children if they were okay.. nothing. My experience was awful. Tiffany would not hear my concerns, would not review the cameras and let me know the severity of the situation. Due to this, 5 kids left my sons party and I was left feeling a HUGE lack of customer service. The chosen manager of this establishment should put children first, listen to the concerns of paying patrons and have solutions. She was the most disrespectful manager I have ever met. I had my  son and his friend upset right in front of her and she barely looked at them, didn't ask if they were okay. She walked away.\n\nafter reaching out to an owner, I was not offered any resolution or an offer of looking at the camera. Simply \"I'll speak to tiffany about this\" and s\"orry this happened\". finally got the apology that should have happened days before but too little too late. what resolution would you expect if this happened at a party you were hosting and it was your children being hurt?\n\ngreat leadership comes from the top. get it together. while I know these specific incidents are isolated, you should know how to handle these situations and so should your staff. view  the cameras, even if the patron cannot. have a resolution.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890db69088959d:0x4332f45319ad0a5e"}

(Don't get carried away .. No matter how much you enjoy it... If you do more than 20minutes, your body is probably going to be sore the next day or two) for a little extra money there is also a rock climbing wall and a zip line that will send you across the building to one side and then whip you around back to where you started from instead of just going straight across so that was really cool. There's an area where you can be tethered above for safety but being able to walk across small platforms or climb across a web of rope... they're just a lot of things to do. I saw the children of all ages they're having a good time. ( my 15 yr old going through one of those phases where nothing entertains him...

Please do not enter the building while anyone is in the air!!!!!\n\nPLEASE DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS RIDE ANY OF THE AIR ATTRACTIONS HERE WITHOUT BEING ADVISED THAT AN AIR ROPES COURSE RIDER WHO APPEARED TO BE STILL STRAPPED IN THE HARNESS FELL SEVERAL FEET JUST LAST FRIDAY 3/29/19, AND THE COMMUNITY IS NOT AWARE OF THIS.  Don't let it be your kid please!  PEOPLE SITTING DOWN ON THE GROUND BELOW WERE ALSO HARMED!!!!\n\nThis is important!! I'll repeat it.  If you plan to go and play it safe by not riding in the air, then this review is still for you and all of your family  because PEOPLE SITTING DOWN ON THE GROUND BELOW WERE ALSO HARMED!!!!\n\nPlease read on or call to try to find out for yourself before you go.  I don't want it to happen again to anyone!!  I've tried many times for a week now, but I can't reach any local or corporate officials with Urban Air to explain or calm our fears.  Who checks on these things?  Who answers to every parent that takes their kids to Urban Air?\nIt's Friday again and I'm trying not to scream at the thought that Urban Air Trampoline and Adventure Park in Trussville is still open (as far as I know) and still not answering any real questions about last Friday's horrific experience.   This wasn't your average bounce on the trampoline and break an ankle thing. This was a HORRIBLE NIGHTMARE that really happened to innocent people.   Urban Air, what's preventing it from happening again?\n\nHow do you drop a person from the sky?  Why did you drop her on top of a mom who was simply sitting on a bench below? It Was Horrible!!! There is so much more to say, but graphic details are not appropriate or important here.\n\nI don't know if the other visitors there on Friday are just still too shaken up to talk about it.  Or just so relieved like us that their kid didn't fall.  Or maybe like me they hate to write online reviews (especially bad ones).  Well I would give Urban Air Trampoline Adventure Park in Trussville, Alabama negative 5 stars if I could, but I can't, so 1 horrible star.  Our little one has had a difficult time since he saw that horrible event on his last outing for Spring Break.  Thank goodness, he made it out ok.  Still, I'm so very sorry we chose  the Trussville Urban Air, but we knew other kids who enjoyed it there in the past.  I'm sorry to say we even teased a teenager who was too scared to ride, but he was wiser than us I guess.  We researched. We read the google reviews first. Obviously, not enough people write reviews.  We thought it was safe (trampoline park safe anyway).  We were wrong!   It's not even safe to sit on the benches and watch your babies.  And the lack of customer followup and consideration just adds to the mess.\n\nBecause of the layout of this Urban Air in Trussville, people on the ground are always under one of the air rides!  There should be a safety net or some type of separate area to keep kids above and kids and families below safe!!!!!!  We've visited Homewood Urban Air without a big problem. (Of course they don't have the air rope course and racer).\n\nPLEASE DON'T LET ANYONE YOU LOVE (OR HATE) SIT OR WALK AROUND ANYWHERE IN THIS URBAN AIR LOCATION WHEN SOMEONE IS RIDING ANY AIR ATTRACTION (even with a harness)!!!\n\nI hope this helps someone.  If you saw this, please speak up too and let people know.  It's time.  I can't believe the news didn't cover this.  I wish someone else said it sooner than me.  Every customer who was there Friday deserves answers, although not nearly as much as the injured victims.  We hope and pray they are alive and OK.  Every potential customer deserves answers so that it doesn't happen again.\n\nUrban Air in Trussville, I don't see how you are still open and promoting Birthday packages. But since you are, PLEASE PROTECT YOUR PATRONS( that includes kids riding and also includes moms and babies sitting and watching below)!!   I hope you are at least answering and helping the people you seriously hurt last Friday.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1554563277949, "text": "Hi Kim,\r\rThis is Carolyn from the Corporate office.
