My wife had gotten him to roll it out to the car before she purchased it to make sure that it would fit in our vehicle. When I told him that's where the scuff came from he said oh no I took it straight out of the box so that's not possible. The stroller was a display model so there was no box at all.

The owner told my wife the set does not take long to come in, usually a couple of weeks and she will expedite the shipment. Since we purchased the set the customer service has been HORRENDOUS.!! When my wife purchased the set, they advised her a estimated delivery date would be provided on the following week since it was a weekend transaction and the Vendor was closed. Since that date the owner have failed to contact us on the delivery date. We made several attempts to establish a concrete date in which we were told by the owners, \u2018that is not the way they do business\u2019. On last Monday,  November 13, the owner reached out to me and said the crib and dresser would arrive on Thursday (Jax Birthday). After my wife was settled in her hospital room after having Jax, I called Posh Mommy to verify what time the truck was coming in order to pick up. The owner, Lisa told me \u2018the truck had not arrived and she will call back later that day.\u2019 I did not receive a phone call, in which I called the following day to pick up the set. Lisa\u2019s husband (co owner) claims he did not tell me it will arrive on Thursday but he claimed he hoped it would arrive on Thursday. On Friday, November 17th, he stated the shipment will be in on today. As of today, November 21st, we have not received our furniture. The owner now claims it will be in on tomorrow. Please help me share this experience, I have filed a complaint with the BBB and other parents need to know how POSH MOMMY does business. My wife was 9 months pregnant when she purchased the set believing the owner at her word. I guess that means nothing these days.#cribforJAX", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1573752892023, "text": "Mr Jackson, as we discussed on the multiple occasions, as signed in the contract with the store, it can take multiple weeks, worst case up to 16 weeks for furniture to arrive at our store.

My husband and I were having a hard time finding a nursery that we could both agree on for our second child. I suggested Posh Mommy and we went in there last thinking we probably couldn't afford it. When I walked in the owner immediately greeted us and asked what we were looking for. When I told her baby furniture, she wanted to show me her collection that was on sale. It was the Dolce Babi Grazi Crib and the pieces with it. It came in vanilla bean which is a vintage white and I loved it! It was a great deal and very well made. She pretty much had it over 1,000 dollars cheaper than the original prices. She let us look with no pressure. She told us she had already ordered it so if we were interested to let her know because she would hold it for us. We decided a few days later that that is what we wanted and when we called and told her, she also gave us 20% off the conversion kit because it was being ordered all at once. So we waited about a week and a half and our crib was there! (bc it was already ordered it didn't take as long as most orders) My husband and a friend went to pick it up and she was having a Veterans Day sale that weekend and our crib price dropped $100. So she felt sorry for us that we missed the sale and GAVE US A FREE CRIB MATTRESS AND TODDLER RAIL!!! I was blown away by her generosity. I had no idea that the crib price dropped so when she offered us all of that it really meant so much! The items she gave us retail way more than that $100 dollars. I am very impressed and plan on giving them more business in the future. THANKS POSH MOMMY ;)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886268e8fdc4fd2f:0x746533eb9aa4d4df"}

Back in March, I ordered a crib converter to convert my child's crib to a toddler bed. I was told it would take a little over a month for it to come in and they would call me as soon as it did.  The money came out of my account the day I placed the order. About 2 and half months later I still had not heard from them, so I called asking about my order.  They had absolutely no record of my order, however, I told them I had proof because I can show my bank statement where the money came out of my account.  They basically said they would call the company and work on getting it to me ASAP and they were supposed to call me back.  I never heard back from them.  This was just the beginning of many false promises and unreturned phone calls.  After I decided I couldn't deal with them anymore I went on the web and found the exact crib converter kit that I needed for less than half the price they sold it to me for.  At this point, I called and said I wanted my money back.  They agreed to return my money, but said they would have to mail it to me.  It has now been almost 5 months since I placed this order and I have yet to receive a crib converter or my money back.  And they are continuing to blow me off and not return my phone calls.

I told him what I was there for and he immediately said they do not give refunds. He said he couldn't take back a used product and he could not be out that money. He was extremely rude and basically called me a liar. He said the stroller was obviously used because one of the wheels had a scuff on it. My wife had gotten him to roll it out to the car before she purchased it to make sure that it would fit in our vehicle. When I told him that's where the scuff came from he said oh no I took it straight out of the box so that's not possible. The stroller was a display model so there was no box at all. When I told him that I knew he was lying to me, he said well our return policy is posted on the counter there so if your wife is literate she could've read it. I wont go on about everything else that was said but I just want to let people know how they do business. He was EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional and I can see by all the other comments that I am not the only one who has experienced this.

The owner told my wife the set does not take long to come in, usually a couple of weeks and she will expedite the shipment. Since we purchased the set the customer service has been HORRENDOUS.!! When my wife purchased the set, they advised her a estimated delivery date would be provided on the following week since it was a weekend transaction and the Vendor was closed. Since that date the owner have failed to contact us on the delivery date. We made several attempts to establish a concrete date in which we were told by the owners, \u2018that is not the way they do business\u2019. On last Monday,  November 13, the owner reached out to me and said the crib and dresser would arrive on Thursday (Jax Birthday). After my wife was settled in her hospital room after having Jax, I called Posh Mommy to verify what time the truck was coming in order to pick up. The owner, Lisa told me \u2018the truck had not arrived and she will call back later that day.\u2019 I did not receive a phone call, in which I called the following day to pick up the set. Lisa\u2019s husband (co owner) claims he did not tell me it will arrive on Thursday but he claimed he hoped it would arrive on Thursday. On Friday, November 17th, he stated the shipment will be in on today. As of today, November 21st, we have not received our furniture. The owner now claims it will be in on tomorrow. Please help me share this experience, I have filed a complaint with the BBB and other parents need to know how POSH MOMMY does business.

My husband and I were having a hard time finding a nursery that we could both agree on for our second child. I suggested Posh Mommy and we went in there last thinking we probably couldn't afford it. When I walked in the owner immediately greeted us and asked what we were looking for. When I told her baby furniture, she wanted to show me her collection that was on sale. It was the Dolce Babi Grazi Crib and the pieces with it. It came in vanilla bean which is a vintage white and I loved it! It was a great deal and very well made. She pretty much had it over 1,000 dollars cheaper than the original prices. She let us look with no pressure. She told us she had already ordered it so if we were interested to let her know because she would hold it for us. We decided a few days later that that is what we wanted and when we called and told her, she also gave us 20% off the conversion kit because it was being ordered all at once. So we waited about a week and a half and our crib was there! (bc it was already ordered it didn't take as long as most orders) My husband and a friend went to pick it up and she was having a Veterans Day sale that weekend and our crib price dropped $100. So she felt sorry for us that we missed the sale and GAVE US A FREE CRIB MATTRESS AND TODDLER RAIL!!! I was blown away by her generosity. I had no idea that the crib price dropped so when she offered us all of that it really meant so much! The items she gave us retail way more than that $100 dollars. I am very impressed and plan on giving them more business in the future. THANKS POSH MOMMY ;)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886268e8fdc4fd2f:0x746533eb9aa4d4df"}

They had absolutely no record of my order, however, I told them I had proof because I can show my bank statement where the money came out of my account.  They basically said they would call the company and work on getting it to me ASAP and they were supposed to call me back.  I never heard back from them.  This was just the beginning of many false promises and unreturned phone calls.  After I decided I couldn't deal with them anymore I went on the web and found the exact crib converter kit that I needed for less than half the price they sold it to me for.  At this point, I called and said I wanted my money back.  They agreed to return my money, but said they would have to mail it to me.  It has now been almost 5 months since I placed this order and I have yet to receive a crib converter or my money back.  And they are continuing to blow me off and not return my phone calls.

My wife had gotten him to roll it out to the car before she purchased it to make sure that it would fit in our vehicle. When I told him that's where the scuff came from he said oh no I took it straight out of the box so that's not possible. The stroller was a display model so there was no box at all.

My husband and I were having a hard time finding a nursery that we could both agree on for our second child. I suggested Posh Mommy and we went in there last thinking we probably couldn't afford it. When I walked in the owner immediately greeted us and asked what we were looking for. When I told her baby furniture, she wanted to show me her collection that was on sale. It was the Dolce Babi Grazi Crib and the pieces with it. It came in vanilla bean which is a vintage white and I loved it! It was a great deal and very well made. She pretty much had it over 1,000 dollars cheaper than the original prices. She let us look with no pressure. She told us she had already ordered it so if we were interested to let her know because she would hold it for us. We decided a few days later that that is what we wanted and when we called and told her, she also gave us 20% off the conversion kit because it was being ordered all at once. So we waited about a week and a half and our crib was there! (bc it was already ordered it didn't take as long as most orders) My husband and a friend went to pick it up and she was having a Veterans Day sale that weekend and our crib price dropped $100. So she felt sorry for us that we missed the sale and GAVE US A FREE CRIB MATTRESS AND TODDLER RAIL!!! I was blown away by her generosity. I had no idea that the crib price dropped so when she offered us all of that it really meant so much! The items she gave us retail way more than that $100 dollars. I am very impressed and plan on giving them more business in the future. THANKS POSH MOMMY ;)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886268e8fdc4fd2f:0x746533eb9aa4d4df"}

My wife bought an umbrella stroller from there about a week ago. We had some unexpected expenses arise and I went there with the receipt to return it. We had it just over a week and had never even taken it out of the car. It still had all the plastic on it and had never even been unfolded. When I walked in, they were not busy at all. There may have been three or four people in the entire store. I walked up to the counter and waited and waited and waited some more until finally going and asking someone to help me. I told him what I was there for and he immediately said they do not give refunds. He said he couldn't take back a used product and he could not be out that money. He was extremely rude and basically called me a liar. He said the stroller was obviously used because one of the wheels had a scuff on it. My wife had gotten him to roll it out to the car before she purchased it to make sure that it would fit in our vehicle. When I told him that's where the scuff came from he said oh no I took it straight out of the box so that's not possible. The stroller was a display model so there was no box at all. When I told him that I knew he was lying to me, he said well our return policy is posted on the counter there so if your wife is literate she could've read it.

The owner told my wife the set does not take long to come in, usually a couple of weeks and she will expedite the shipment. Since we purchased the set the customer service has been HORRENDOUS.!! When my wife purchased the set, they advised her a estimated delivery date would be provided on the following week since it was a weekend transaction and the Vendor was closed. Since that date the owner have failed to contact us on the delivery date. We made several attempts to establish a concrete date in which we were told by the owners, \u2018that is not the way they do business\u2019. On last Monday,  November 13, the owner reached out to me and said the crib and dresser would arrive on Thursday (Jax Birthday). After my wife was settled in her hospital room after having Jax, I called Posh Mommy to verify what time the truck was coming in order to pick up. The owner, Lisa told me \u2018the truck had not arrived and she will call back later that day.\u2019 I did not receive a phone call, in which I called the following day to pick up the set. Lisa\u2019s husband (co owner) claims he did not tell me it will arrive on Thursday but he claimed he hoped it would arrive on Thursday. On Friday, November 17th, he stated the shipment will be in on today. As of today, November 21st, we have not received our furniture. The owner now claims it will be in on tomorrow. Please help me share this experience, I have filed a complaint with the BBB and other parents need to know how POSH MOMMY does business.

My husband and I were having a hard time finding a nursery that we could both agree on for our second child. I suggested Posh Mommy and we went in there last thinking we probably couldn't afford it. When I walked in the owner immediately greeted us and asked what we were looking for. When I told her baby furniture, she wanted to show me her collection that was on sale. It was the Dolce Babi Grazi Crib and the pieces with it. It came in vanilla bean which is a vintage white and I loved it! It was a great deal and very well made. She pretty much had it over 1,000 dollars cheaper than the original prices. She let us look with no pressure. She told us she had already ordered it so if we were interested to let her know because she would hold it for us. We decided a few days later that that is what we wanted and when we called and told her, she also gave us 20% off the conversion kit because it was being ordered all at once. So we waited about a week and a half and our crib was there! (bc it was already ordered it didn't take as long as most orders) My husband and a friend went to pick it up and she was having a Veterans Day sale that weekend and our crib price dropped $100. So she felt sorry for us that we missed the sale and GAVE US A FREE CRIB MATTRESS AND TODDLER RAIL!!! I was blown away by her generosity. I had no idea that the crib price dropped so when she offered us all of that it really meant so much! The items she gave us retail way more than that $100 dollars. I am very impressed and plan on giving them more business in the future. THANKS POSH MOMMY ;)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886268e8fdc4fd2f:0x746533eb9aa4d4df"}

So I drove down and went inside and started looking. Not being able to find it, I asked an employee about it and he told me that another guy came by the other day looking for the same thing, but they didn't have any. I'm not sure if that he meant there weren't any left or that Target doesn't even carry the item in store.\nI advised him that the internet said that there is several of this item in store right now according to the website. He said yea but we don't have it.\nThe item I was looking for is a $300 Oculus Quest VR headset.

Yesterday, 2/8/14, I showed up at the pharmacy a few minutes after 5pm.  They were closing down for the day, which I was unaware of, but the manager, Marie and the pharmacist agreed to fill my Rx.  They could have easily sent me away, but they  were generous with their time and stayed to help a mom who desperately needed some medicine for a sick child.  Unfortunately, several problems arose due to my child being a new patient, with new insurance.  But they never gave up.  And my child received a much need night of rest.  I wish I had thought to get the young mans name that worked so hard to get this filled, because I would surely like to recognize him personally.  I know working in the service industry can be an often thankless job, so I just want to say thank you to both of them for going above and beyond the normal protocol.\nSincerely,\nJulie Pitts", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a417fd10fd647:0x2b449aa842f4c8d6"}
