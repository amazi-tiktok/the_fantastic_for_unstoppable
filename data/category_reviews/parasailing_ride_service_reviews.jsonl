My boys (6 & 8) had never been, but they wanted to try it.\nThe booking experience was simple and easy. On the day of our flight/sailing, we were able to park at Ike\u2019s (great, as parking at the beach can be tough), then walked over and were treated and taken to check-in. It was friendly and efficient!\nIn no time, we were life jackets, and being escorted out for a (fun! My boys loved it!) banana boat ride to the pick-up area to boat the Chute Yeah.\nAs we got on the boat, I couldn\u2019t help but think it was the Outer Banks guys or the Rob Spicoli was our captain... but immediately I saw the way they handled the boat & gear and KNEW that these guys were true pros. Not only were Jason (Capt) and Josh (first mate, shark fighter/rescue diver/photographer) extremely Proficent, but they made it a complete BLAST!\nGreat tunes, fun atmosphere, PERFECT (safe, from take off to the dip, and landing) experience!\nBook at Ike\u2019s...ask for Jason & Josh... you won\u2019t be sorry.\n\nOh, and the ride itself... well, my 6 y/o told me it was \u201cthe best week of his life\u201d because of it, and my 8 y/o simply said \u201cDad it was epic\u201d...\n\nAnd you know what...they both were right.

They were running an hour behind schedule and we were left to stand in the surf in our life vests in the blazing sun for a half hour with no explanation. There was absolutely NO descriptive for safety instructions.  Our trip out to the parasailing boat was terrifying. We had 4 in our party plus two others ... the banana boat was so imbalanced that it folded in half and dumped two of us in the ocean.  They didn't give us the option of not being dunked .... which would have been nice since the jelly fish were a problem at that time.  The captain and his mate just played loud music and didn't socialize with anybody during the sail.  Two of us injured our feet (bent our big toenails back) getting on the banana boat to return to shore. Some of the pictures were great,  but there were far less than the 200 promised  .... maybe 5 unique pictures. We chose this company because their rating was higher than other providers ..... maybe we can keep that from happening to others.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a079f96d95689:0x560e5838f4fe773a"}
