Then we checked out. So we knew our total charges should be 302 plus 30. which is 332 which has already been paid. so a credit for about 11 dollars would post sometime this week I assumed. On 7-6-21 my bank account was not credited anything and was charged $365.40, This make my checking account negative so now I will have service charges also. I called and spoke with Kendrick Delaney the manager on duty. He said he only saw the one charge and needed to see my bank statement before he could do anything. I sent him an email and he said he would check that and call me back as soon as possible. I waited for a call back because I told him we had no money and no access to the bank account because of the overdraft of double charging me and because this overdrafted my account and he assured me I would hear back from him. He never called me back. The next morning I called and spoke with a woman that said it was too early in the morning for anyone there to help me. I later saw a short email from Kendrick Delaney that said my email did not show the bank statement so he couldn't help. He did not call me back so I could resend it. This needed to be handled asap. and it still has not been handled. I need a call back. I have re-emailed him my bank statement where we have been charged a total of $around $747.00 for one night and a breakfast. and should have been a total of 332. This is completely ridiculous.
