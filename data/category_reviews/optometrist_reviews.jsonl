Due to his deadbeat dad not paying child support, the child is on Medicaid, and Schaeffer is supposedly one of only two places in Huntsville that offers eye glasses under Medicaid. The little boy was actually excited about getting glasses - about being able to see the board in his 2nd grade classroom. He was excited by all the cool frames he saw on display. When it was his turn to be seen, he and his mother were ushered to a small table, tucked away from the waiting area, with 3 red boxes sitting on top. In those boxes were dirty frames, with only a few sized for boys and not even a mirror to see one's reflection while trying on. The mother humbly asked a clerk if there were any other options for her son and was told \"what you see is what you get\" then dismissed as if her presence were a nuisance. The little boy was forced to pick out a pair of glasses that, although he needs, we're relatively certain he won't wear past the 2nd day he owns them due to the harassment he'll receive from bullies in school. So he won't be able to see the board, and his education and self esteem will suffer. His mother was understandably upset, but what can she do? She already works at least 3 jobs to pay for food and bills. Life can be hard. You do the best you can with what you have.\n\nBut did this mother and child have to be treated like dirt? No. Absolutely not. The behavior of Schaeffer's employee was abhorrent, at best.\n\nI, personally, have a great job with good insurance and can afford not only new glasses every two years, but new prescription sunglasses as well. Where do I go for my glasses? The WalMart vision center on University Drive. The doctor and staff there treat everyone equally well, no matter how they're dressed, how much they make, or what their insurance status is. I know other high-income families that prefer to go there as well.\n\nI will personally spread this story as far and wide as I can.

Ashley compared the two current promotions to find me the very best price.  Then, several days later, I received a call that my glasses had arrived, but Eyecare Associates had rejected them after inspection and had ordered a new fabrication.  Wow!  Just a few days after that, I went to pick up my new remakes.  I was not satisfied with the field of vision they offered, and Ashley showed me the three types of lenses available.   I selected a set with a broader field of vision and, in spite of the $80 increase each of the three sets would entail, placed my order.  The next day, Ashley called to tell me she had discussed my case with the manager, and they had decided to wave all further fees, so these three new pairs would be free!   Double-wow!   I was impressed and, frankly, touched by the empathy, attention, personal concern, and expert service I received from Eyecare Associates.    EA went out of their way and beyond all my expectations to insure a fair and positive experience for me, and I simply cannot recommend them enough!

I normally see either Dr. Harris or Dr. Jackson. On this visit I was seen by Doctor Fredrick Jackson and it was a truly amazing experience. Everyone was extremely courteous and friendly. I was really impressed with Dr. Jackson on this occasion. He took his time explaining everything he was doing and why he was doing it. His explanations and genuine concern went a long way in putting my fears to rest. He not only took an interest in my eye health, but he was also very forthcoming with sharing some possible solutions to other areas of my overall health that could potentially affect my eye health. He offered some possible solutions to help with bouts of vertigo I have been experiencing for a couple of years now. He suggested some things that I could try to help to minimize the severity of the migraine headaches that I have been suffering for more than thirty years. No one else had ever made the suggestions to me that he did. I can't wait to put them into practice to see if they will help even the tiniest little bit. Thanks, Dr. Jackson, for one of the most enjoyable appointments I have ever had. And trust me, I will make sure that you are highly recommended to everyone that I know who needs a good optometrist. Keep up the good work.\n\nHad my yearly exam on February 4, 2015 and must say that it was a very interesting experience. Even though the wait time was a few minutes past my appointment time, I clearly understand why. The doctors spend as much time as needed with each patient and I realize that I will get the same type of treatment when it is my turn. Also, Dr. Harris' staff are extremely kind, considerate, and compassionate. I just love Dr. Harris to death (no offense Dr. Jackson, I love you, too). Even though he informed me that I have cataracts, he took the time to explain all of my options and shared his experiences with his father's surgery. I left the office feeling very good and felt that Dr. Harris had provided me with all the information that I needed to make a decision. Once I made the decision, he even scheduled an appointment for me--talk about the personal touch approach. I would highly recommend Primary Eyecare Associates to anyone. As a matter of fact, my entire family uses Primary Eyecare Associates. So, if you are looking for a good eye care center and optometrist, give them a call, THEY ARE THE BEST I have ever used.

I have never been treated so rudely by a person/business as I was today. I ordered new lens on my last exam and specifically told the man that works in the eye glass department that I did not want the reflective coating because they were just a spare set of glasses to watch TV with. He padded the bill and added the coating anyway. I didn't figure out what happened until they sent a bill, I called and they had no problem removing the charge for the reflective coating. That should have been the end of it regarding that coating.\nI went in yesterday to pick up my glasses but had to wait so long that I got into a hurry running late for another appointment and I didn't fully inspect the glasses, my mistake. I put them in the case and went on with my day, last night when I took them out to clean them there was two bad gouges on the lens. I originally thought it was just lint in the office because he did not clean them before he gave them to me. Today I took them back to show them the gouges and was practically called a liar by the man in the eye glass department. He treated me very rudely and got abusive towards me when I told him they were gouged when I picked them up. He basically told me that they were not gouged by them, I DID order the reflective coating and he did clean the glasses for me, which none of was true. The coating shouldn't have even been an issue that was brought into the conversation. I turned around and walked out before things got even uglier.\nI really can't understand how Dr. Cantley can allow an employee to treat a long time patient in this manner. If I had scratched/gouged those lens then I would own it and just say my fault and go on with life. At this point it isn't even so much about the glasses as it is being treated so rudely and abusive. That employee just cost Dr. Cantley two long term patients and negative reviews because I will never return there again. He should not be working in any capacity with the public. He had a chip on his shoulder before I even walked into his department. Sadly I really liked Dr. Cantley and had been pleased with her as my eye doctor but I will not be treated as I was today by her staff.

They are providing me with a new set of frames and lenses with everything in the lenses I wanted except for the polarization without cost; and still will fulfill my original order once the new vendor is acquired. Unfortunately, that could take as much as 3 months...hopefully not. Now that's what I call stepping up to the plate!\nSpecial shout out to the staff there...Melissa, Vicky, Mike and even the trainee (sorry, didn't get her name) were fantastic!

The view from our  previous lenses could focus on an entire page. We discovered that  the old prescription used Varilux lenses and Advanced Eyecare orders Kodak lenses. My spouse and I both considered the Kodak progressive lens to be unacceptable. Advanced Eyecare then special ordered Varilux lens to satisfy us. Thanks for that, our vision is back to normal, but the default Kodak lenses are lower quality lens in our opinion.\n2)\tThe decorative diamond on one frame fell out after a few weeks. Advanced Eyecare would replace the entire frame, but we would have no future warranty on the glasses. I was called a \u201cdifficult customer\u201d when I objected to the loss of warranty due to a workmanship issue with the frame. I left without fixing the frame and they asked which Optometrist they should send our records to.\n3)\tThe lenses in another plastic frame are loose.

The guy that processed my transaction was very cool and he actually helped me choose the frame that looked the best on me. Rewind to the day I pick my new glasses up. Well let's just say I was not happy. First time trying the new frames on they were so big they did not fit at all. The first lady adjusted them but they were still falling off my face. Then she ask another lady to help while she is adjusting them for the second time I asked why are they so big and not fitting like the previous frame (demo) I tried on. She tells me that my actual frames are bigger because the thickness of my lenses and that demo frames will fit differently. I have never heard of that or had that issue anywhere else. Everytime I tried on frames I liked and was fitted they have always fit fine with little to no adjustments. After about 5-6 times adjusting my glasses they somewhat fitted ok. The piece behind my ear is adjusted so far inward on both sides that the top of my ear sticks out and the frame does not fit properly on my face or behind my ears. She then tells me that I will have to come back and get them adjusted again because overtime taking them off and on they will adjust back to there normal size. I was not told this when I was making my transaction nor have I ever experienced this elsewhere. I will not be coming back. Worst experience ever.

At my first visit I was told retina scans only needed to be done every 5 years. When I went in for my second visit I was told they needed to be taken again \u201cso something could be looked at.\u201d Red flag #1 because nothing was mentioned about the \u201csomething\u201d during the first visit. During my contact fitting I mentioned and even showed my insurance and what it stated, questioning what I paid the previous year because it said my contacts would be covered IN FULL if they were Davis vision contacts, THREE people discussed it and determined that the contacts I was getting were in fact Davis vision contacts but I was only allotted a $150 credit? Red flag #2! I should have demanded them to re-read my insurance because I knew something wasn\u2019t right but I thought \u201cI\u2019m at the eye doctor, if anyone knows about eye insurance it should be them, right?\u201d On my way home I called my insurance and explained everything, they said that my contacts should have been ordered through them and would have been covered 100% and that I also shouldn\u2019t have paid the charge to have my \u201cchart updated.\u201d They even called Bailey Cove and explained everything for me. Insurance said I\u2019d be getting a call about my refund for the chart update fee the following day, which I did, but I missed the call. When I called back the person who called was busy with a patient but I was told I could give my CC number to them and they would give it directly to her to refund my money. Red flag #3!!! A few days later I had multiple charges on my credit card, one being Netflix! I called to ask who had access to my credit card number and expressed my concern, considering that I hadn\u2019t used the card in 3+ months prior to the eye doctor, I was left to feel like it was my fault that my number had been stolen and that it wasn\u2019t anyone at their office because the shredded it. I left it at that and just said I was done with that office. Or so I thought, I received a text the other day stating my contacts needed to be picked up. I called to say that I had already received the contacts I ordered and wondered what was going on, they said my account had a $150 balance and I had contacts up front (which were NOT ordered by me). It was at the end of the day and I was told I would be called back with more information so I figured it would be the next day before I heard back. 2 days later and still nothing.

We do stand behind our products and services. We will have our Optical Manager contact you regarding your experience and see how we can satisfy any unmet needs you may have.\nWe would like to address a few things here, which you mention above:\n-Although we did have a relatively new employee working with you, we did have a more experienced optician assisting with the process, who looked over her work during your fitting and looked over everything after as well. It was our understanding that you did request transition lenses, which creates a slight tint to the lenses even when they are not triggered by UV radiation into the sunglass-like appearance. We would be more than happy to remake those lenses at no charge to you to remove the transitions.\n-Regarding the retinal photos- On the new patient paperwork, which you signed, we do notify you of our intention to take retinal photographs:\n\"We take routine retinal photographs of all new patients to help with disease detection and management, as well as to help establish baseline retinal and optic nerve health and appearance.  These pictures are not covered by many insurance plans but we feel that they help significantly in the care of our patients.\"\nWe do try and also provide verbal notice to our patients as well: this was the cause of your $35 refund. Please be aware that you have the right to decline this service, although it is recommended.\n-Regarding the sunglasses: We do follow VSP's 20% coverage for any second pairs of glasses or sunglasses you wish to purchase. We even go a step further by having an additional 20% (total of 40% discount) removed from you total if the purchase is done within 30 days of the first pair. However, you were looking at our Maui Jim and Costa sunglasses, specifically. These two lines do not allow us to utilize any insurance discounts for their merchandise, per our contract with them, and they set the pricing 100%: frames, lenses, and all.\nWe hope the combination of the above explanations and the additional contact of our optical manager will help you. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us via a phone call or drop by our office if you would like further assistance."}, "gmap_id": "0x88621287821106f1:0x26311bf1e65162ea"}

Staff and Dr. Harris are always nice and professional.  I don't have vision insurance, but price on visit is always reasonable.  Wait time is a little long but I never make an appointment either.  I'm always a \"walk-in\".  The eyeware part is a bit higher on retail prices for contacts so I choose to buy my contacts online.  They are always nice and helpful in providing my written Rx to purchase my contacts elsewhere.  Overall, I would recommend Dr. Harris @ Marx Optical to anyone looking for a good optometrist.......\n\nUpdate : I have officially quit seeing them after  10+ years.  After sitting waiting for almost 3hours with an eye injury,  I felt as though greater concern should have been given to at least administer a triage type exam to assess the situation,  but none was given.  In much pain,  I decided to leave after nearly 3 hours of waiting, since no concern was given.  I don't know if  my doctor knew that an eye injury was waiting,  but if not, his office staff have been poorly trained to deal with medical necessity Vs.  Standard eye exams.  I have seeked out an ophthalmologist and will begin seeing Dr Cain from now on instead of any optometrist office.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862847643db3f51:0x1eb815f284b146b5"}

I am very disappointed in my \"very short\" visit with Dr. Rosenstiel and staff. (Well I didn't even meet Dr. Rosenstiel???!) Being that I live in Montgomery, I have to request a day off for ALL my eye appointment visits.  I am not new to UAB Callahan Eye Hospital as I've had multiple surgeries within the last three years there. As a matter of fact I just had an appointment there two weeks ago with the incredible Dr. Priscilla Fowler and staff.   I've been diagnosed with Kerataconus and Dr. Priscilla Fowler is my primary eye doctor.  Dr. Fowler and staff are some of the nicest people I've met in the eye care industry. Earlier this year and this past month I received the Cross-Linking  procedure.  I spent over $6000 within the last three years at Callahan eye.  Dr. Fowler and staff treat me with respect on EVERY visit,  yet on December 10 with Dr. Rosenstiel and staff I felt the lesser of.  This visit was scheduled to replace my old sclera lenses with new.  You would think before my arrival they would've did their research on my condition.  Upon my arrival in the room, Dr. Rosenstiel's nurse asked if I ever had sclera lenses?? (I'VE HAD SCLERA CONTACTS FOR THE LAST 6 YEARS??) From there, he goes straight into and I quote, \"before we even see you, you have to pay X amount of dollars!?. Furthermore, he adds, \"The Lenses will be an additional $XXXX.XX amount of dollars to get them?   Now at this point I was feeling as though they did not want to help me as Dr. Fowler and staff did you for the last couple of years.?  Now do mind you I've already spent thousands of dollars to get my eyes corrected.  The money is not an option, but I felt inferior to his demands.  I also wondered have they even looked in my charts from previous visits.? \"Have they even checked my insurance\" I thought to myself?  At that point I asked him a series of questions in terms of verifying my insurances and deductibles. To no avail he says nothing will be covered. Now as I mentioned money would not be a concern as I've spent a lot of money to fix my Eye disease. ( As well as the removal of an tumor in my eyelid two years prior ).  More questions came to mind in this parlay with Dr. Rosenstiel's nurse.  At this point I felt that the nurse is trying to rush me so he leaves then comes back with a business card and prices on it. He then states, \" if you have any questions please call Melissa\" on the business card. I agreed and proceeded to leave. Upon leaving, I felt very embarrassed to even be there. I rushed out and got in my car. I kept thinking to myself \"have they even check my insurance\". So I called my wife, and she confirmed we do have Eye insurance.  I decided I needed to call them back to confirm and verify with them that I have insurance, the same insurance I've used last three years. Two calls later and one left message, I still have not heard from Melissa, Dr. Rosenstiel , or the male nurse that was talking to me. I never even got to meet Dr. Rosenstiel??? I will still come up to visit Dr. Fowler but I will do my business elsewhere in finding new Sclera lenses!\nVery disappointing!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bea1d7b458b:0x2741eb9855e3054"}

I went to my eye doctor. After a check-up, he said my retina was partially detached. And, had I waited a week or so longer, I would've have gone permanently blind in that eye. I got an appointment at the Callahan Eye Foundation.\nThe doctors, nurses and receptionist were very nice. The surgeon did a fantastic job reattaching my retina. The only thing that was a bit frustrating was that gas bubble. But, it kept pressure on my retina. Now, my vision in the right eye was like it was before the accident.\nIf you have a problem with your eyes that a regular eye doctor can't treat, then I highly recommend the Callahan Eye Foundation.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bea1d7b458b:0x2741eb9855e3054"}

I asked what all it test for and the doctor was very informative. I accepted. So then I thought in my head..$93 plus $39 equals $132. We went thru with exam and discussed my contact brand, they gave me a trial size to try before they ordered. Perfect! But when I went to pay it was $250!  I asked why it was that amount, she said it was the contact fitting. So I paid anyway. I kept thinking about how the Dr. said the trial contacts was included in the exam so I called and asked for the manager. She apologized that I was mis informed, the exam is $115 then the  CONTACT exam is anywhere between $95 and $165, or something like that. So the contact exam is not all the same! You're charged for 2 exams! I would've stayed with my Walmart appt. So you're gonna pay at least $210 for an exam and Contact exam.

I couldn\u2019t imagine having 4 teeth pulled because this place sent me home with NO ANTIBIOTICS. Only pain pills! I noticed that the pain was beginning to be a bit unbearable so I called and ask if it was normal and if I could come in. The RECEPTIONIST proceeds to tell me that everything was normal. She\u2019s not a dentist so I called back to schedule an appointment to come in. My appointment was at 4:00. I didn\u2019t even make it to the back until 4:40 after asking if I was forgot about! A heavier set girl in at the front desk said very dry \u201cwell they had to squeeze you in\u201d as if I was a burden or something!   She left for the rest of the day. The other RECEPTIONIST I asked ignored me when I told her I\u2019d been there for 40 min and never even got up to see what was going on Smh! The entire time I\u2019m sitting in the waiting area the vision department was clapping and dancing to music (imagine how that feels to hear loud clapping after having your teeth pulled) VERY unprofessional! I finally was in the back at this point. The assistant that helped me was very nice and patient! I hate the fact that I didn\u2019t get her name but I loved her attitude and how she was willingly trying to help me! I was sent home with antibiotics! The same antibiotics they said they didn\u2019t give after a extraction smh and steroids for my swelling. He also gave me more tabs for pain as if I\u2019m a junky or something or if that was going to make me happy. I\u2019m not going back at all. Thanks but no thanks. On another note!

He started a filling and my son raised his hand and made noises to let him know he could feel it, but the dr kept going and told the nurses \"He's fine.\" Then when my son finally jumped & grabbed his hand, he got aggravated and said to refer us to a pediatric dentist to be sedated. Very rudely made a point to say he wasn't even touching his teeth when he jumped. He didn't even offer to give him another shot or try to comfort him/talk to him about what he was feeling. My son is 11, knows what he can feel & has never had this problem with other dentists. :( I am very disappointed that an office so heavily geared towards children & close to home, has such an impatient & unkind dentist.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889badbf94081c6b:0x4f3c6da5ce8f1c70"}

Dr. Hankinson replaced that crown because he said that he felt that it should have last longer than that. I did not go in to received a free crown, I thought he could cement the old crown in considering that it was still pretty, but he insist on doing another one free of charge.

The ladies at the front desk were lovely, but the man who did my prescreening was awful. He was rude right off the bat. I'm generally a nervous person when it comes to doctors and I like to know what's going on, however when I was asking questions about what he was trying to do to me, he got annoyed and kept trying to rush me into doing things. This automatically put me off, and made me feel unsafe. The puffer  test, for Glaucoma always has made me really nervous, but usually I try my best to get through it. However, I felt so unsafe and uncomfortable in the small room with this man that I was not about to do anything I wasn't comfortable doing to begin with. When it came to doing the eye mapping, he kept getting frustrated because he wasn't getting a good picture and ended up pushing my head pretty hard into the equipment. I wish I would've left at this point, but I figured it was probably just all in my head. He asked if he could hold open my eye, but made no attempt to even put on a glove, and at this point I had 0 trust in the guy. When I went into the exam room, the doctor was condescending. I try to tell doctors that I get anxious around them, and it typically helps the appointment go smoother, but she as well rushed me through everything which made me feel really uncomfortable. She then went to put drops in my eye, because I denied the puffer test and became really mad and threw down her paper towels she was holding when I refused. I know it is an important test, but they didn't try to establish any trust, and made me feel really freaked out and uncomfortable. I figured I don't have to go here again, and will take the test with a doctor who I actually trust, and who treats their patients with kindness.\n\nTo sum it up I will never be going to this location again, nor will I suggest it to anyone. They made me feel uncomfortable and unsafe.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da239f8e191:0xca264ffb151bf5e2"}

Still I didn't learn from them overcharging me from last year, that was partly due to my not so great insurance coverage.  I've been wearing corrective lenses for decades.  This would be my second visit to this office, I was in need of new glasses and my old prescription expired, so I dropped in on my lunch break.  This was one of few places my insurance covered.  The office assistants were nice.  They tried to upsell my dilation but I told the girl that I wanted to keep everything under my insurance coverage.  Everything went fine until I had to wait 45 minutes for Dr. Davis finish her causal conversation with the patient next door. When she finally appeared, she touched base on the astigmatism in my left eye.  I've had an astigmatism in that eye for years and there has yet to be any issues about it.  She said she wanted to try a specific contact lens for that eye, she would order me free trial and that I'm to come back for a follow-up.  She also suggested that I change my disposable contact lens from daily to weekly.  She asked if I slept in them, I said no because I rub my eyes in my sleep and I have symptomatic reactions with allergies which causes severe protein buildup.  She said she will write a prescription for some allergy drops.  I didn't think I needed them because I haven't had an allergic reaction like that in a while. So I thought I would just not get the prescription.  Finally I am about to check-out and the lady at the desk, Sarah, tells me that my final total is over $100.  I only assumed that my copay would be $40. Sarah said that my eye exam \"became a medical visit because the written prescription for the eye drops and the specialized fit for the new contact lens we are ordering.\"  I was blown away.  I had no room in my budget for that.  I know I signed the form understanding there would be extra costs but they should at least TELL me as they are working what costs are to be incurred.  Sarah saw I was distraught and made and additional comment, \"You know, I'm working on getting a coupon for these drops.  I don't know what your co-pay is, but these drops are expensive.  The coupon will make sure you don't pay more than $25. Oh and the follow-up visit is free.\"  Thanks but no thanks, you obviously know what you were doing and got caught.  I don't plan to fill out the unnecessary prescription.  I don't plan to use this office again.  I'll go back to get the rest of my contact prescription and that's it.  No more.  I've been seeing an ophthalmologists for, years under basic insurance and my copay was not over $20, let alone any surprise charges for a non-invasive visit.  My suggestion is to go elsewhere.  A medical office is supposed to take care of their patients, not rob them blind.\n\nUpdate 7/18/2014:  I came back for my follow up for my contact fitting.  This time I was seen by Dr. Bradley.  He asked about the contacts that were given to me, I told them that the left lens was difficult to adjust to because it was thicker than the right lens and that with my new job, I'm looking at a computer more so they dry out faster.  He examined my eyes and found out that it wasn't the computer use that was drying out my eyes.  He said the contact lens material was not working with my body chemistry and that my tears were being repelled from the lens and not being absorbed for normal wear.  He then looked closer at my prescription and said that I didn't have a need for these special lens.  I was doing fine before and this was not a solution to my problem.  He referred me to use a different lens, free of charge, and crossed out Dr. Davis' previous notes in red marker.  I'm so glad there was a second opinion in the same office that could help me out.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da239f8e191:0xca264ffb151bf5e2"}

Instead of giving a teenager time to think about whether he was comfortable with contacts or wearing them, they insisted on forcing you to pay for a lesson and a contact exam on top of his glasses exam before making a decision. After leaving the first time with a horrible experience, we got a call that his lenses were in after 2 weeks. Then, after calling to make sure they\u2019d have time to complete the service before driving the distance again, we get there to be told they had ordered the wrong lenses for his frame. The frame in which he specifically had with him at his first visit & had taken a picture of with him in them. The employees were unfriendly, unconcerned, and sat there arguing with me about them having more than one frame listed in the system for him as an excuse. Regardless of the fact that his current frames were there with him on his exam visit & they were responsible for making sure they ordered the lenses for that exact frame! They completely disregarded checking the frame model he had with him before ordering the new lenses I paid $362 for, and we were not only out of another long drive for nothing, but ended up being  left without him having his glasses.

All b/c I had their eye care plan.  I shouldn't have done that.  Their eye care plan or whatever it's called is not worth it.  So, if you're a person that reads reviews and takes them to heart.... My advice to you is find an eye doctor that is there every time you go into their office, so you actually SEE the same eye doctor each time.  A doctor that will explain to you what's going on and makes the time to answer your questions.  A doctor that CARES about your eye health or lack there of, depending on the situation.  A doctor and his staff that know what customer service is all about.  A doctor and his staff that will work with you on the health of your eyes.  I'm dealing w/ these people today, b/c I have to.  But I won't do it again.  I don't care if I have to pay twice as much to see another eye physician.  America's Best does not care about it's patients.  Not in the least.

It had been about 5 years since my last eye exam. I used to suffer from horrible migraines (which I seem to have remedied) and I still do suffer from pretty frequent headaches and some other minor issues (floaters, some blurring in my vision, straining with low-light situations).\n\nFacy was the front office associate that greeted me and verified my insurance. She was VERY sweet and helpful.\n\nLinda did my preliminary eye exam and field testing. She was very kind, very patient and overall pleasant to interact with.\n\nDr. Mills is AMAZING. She is such a kind human being, she listened thoroughly while I talked about my history and concerns. She did not lose patience or make me feel rushed during my eye exam (especially when I had difficulty deciding between which two lenses looked more clear). We chatted while she checked out my eyes after dilation and she was just a joy. I love love love the experience I had with her and the fact that she is a WOC sealed the deal for me.\n\nCecily was a peach and walked us through what insurance would cover, our many options for lenses and frames and was able to play with some numbers so that we were able to get the most bang for our buck based on our needs.\n\nI'll come here to update about receiving our glasses, the fitting and how things turned out but the experience overall was wonderful!\n\n***Our glasses were ready for pickup 5 days after our appointments!

I was using Medicaid to cover the cost of the exam. They checked his eyes and told me that he needs glasses full-time. He was very upset with the news, but we picked out some frames anyway. The selection of Medicaid covered glasses was terrible and cheap looking, so I paid out of pocket for the frames we picked in the amount of $211.00.\nI received a call that his glasses were ready for pickup on 8/5/2016. I took him in to get them fitted to his face and out of curiosity and clarity I asked Dr. Michael Redus, that performed the eye exam, again if they were for full-time wear. He responded yes.\nA day or two went by, my child wore glasses to the first day of school and I started to question if he could see better with the glasses. He said that he could tell no difference. I put the glasses to my eyes and could tell no difference from the way I normally see. I decided to go for a second opinion.\nI took him to Walmart Vision Center on US Hwy 280 and paid for another $70 eye exam out of pocket. That doctor told me that my child did not only have no use for the glasses, but he had 20/20 vision. I have documentation of both visits. One from The Optical shop stating he was prescribed glasses and that it was .075 in each eye. The Walmart one states 20/20 vision with no prescription needed.\nI went back to Optical Shop after my visit with the Dr. at Walmart and brought it to his attention. I was told that they were only for reading when before the Dr. said full-time wear. I told them how awful of them it was to prescribe glasses to a 7 year old child that they don\u2019t even need. They refunded my money, but its sad to see a business lie just to make a buck.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cce7cc45bf3bf:0x76db5e75438885c"}

But, my opinion of Dr. Mark Shirey, who is also trying to run for public office - has changed.\n\nDr. Shirey was a savior to me when he helped me with a nearly debilitating ailment. I have photophobia - no I'm not scared of light. It's a diagnosis for high sensitivity to light. Bright light, and all Sun light, are very painful for me. Dr. Shirey gave me the prescription that helped me deal with this while driving, of which I can't describe how grateful I was for this. It was literally life changing.\n\nBut - during my last visit, Dr. Shirey told me that he \"doesn't do that anymore\". He doesn't recognize a diagnosis that's over 100 years old and recognized by all major medical institutions. His excuse was \"ALDOT doesn't recognize it.\", which is not true. Neither ALDOT or ALEA list any diagnosis that they do or don't recognize. The law in the state of Alabama is very clear in this regard.\n\nWhen I got home, I did the research on this. I compiled the information and sent it to Dr. & Mrs. Shirey for review and follow-up. I haven't received anything back from them.\n\nI've dealt with tremendous pain in my life, and live with severe musculoskeletal pain every day. Every day I deal with challenges doing things that most wouldn't have a second thought about. But the pain from bright light is something that stops me from being able to safely operate a vehicle. I have to close one eye and squint the other - all while they're watering. depending on how long I'm exposed, my vision just starts deteriorating - colors start blending/fading.. etc. It's not a pleasant experience when I'm without shaded lenses.\n\nI've been very fortunate to have doctors and specialists that have helped me with a number of things in my life. Doctors that listen to their patients and seek to understand them.\n\nThis is the first time I've felt discriminated for a medical diagnosis. By a Doctor.\n\nI'm sure Dr. Shirey didn't think of it like that, or do it out of spite. But it's still a blow to the quality of life for me. Dr. Shirey, like the rest of us, is human. But, in a position where you're responsible for providing care for and improving the quality of life for your patients, you should never assume, discount or interpret your patients plea as unimportant or conjecture.\n\nI'm the one with the condition, not you. You're responsible for having the knowledge and authority to help me cope with the condition.\n\nI do not take any pleasure in giving a review like this. Especially for a local owned business and a member of our community. But, I also take professional responsibility very seriously - and this was an irresponsible action that negatively affected my quality of life, where I was a patron seeking professional help to improve my quality of life. It was a request well within the realm of service that one would expect from this establishment.\n\nThis is very important as a leader in the community as well. If you want to run for office, don't start by discriminating against your own patients by directly denying them the help you're tasked with and responsible for providing.\n\nI guess it's good practice for becoming a politician...\n\n5 years ago: 5 Stars\nI've visited this office twice and will be back. Both times I was promptly taken care of by the staff. Everyone there was polite and showed great hospitality. They have excellent equipment and are truly capable of providing great vision care.\n\nThanks! =)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb20b61f7d133:0xe258a2eb70da471c"}

When you schedule an appointment they tell you if it turns into a medical visit your insurance will not cover it. They preform the same eye exam Walmart on I65 does for $88 with no insurance.  At no point during the visit do they inform the patient they are changing the visit to a medical visit. Only when you are done do you find out that your visit was changed to medical and your insurance doesn't cover that. As I said, SCAM ARTIST. I'm surprised Lenscrafters allows such a company to do business inside thier doors and under thier banner. Myself, I contacted my insurance immediately and informed them of the scam so they can appeal the charges. Hopefully others will read the reviews of this place before becoming the next victim.\n....\nActually my statements were all true. I was never told my appointment was turning into a medical exam. Yes I signed a piece of paper that said \"IF\" but was never made aware of that it had. No other eye doctor has ever tried pulling this SCAM on me.\n\nYou're right. You do not deserve one star. If it was possible to give zero I would have.\n\nAetna did payed them what they billed, which I did appeal and the did APPROVE the appeal. I have a copy of the appeal and my monthly Aetna statement. Aetna paid them for a standard eye exam for which I went in for.\n\nI paid ZERO because I have a zero copay on standard eye exams.\n\nSomeone who think they need to argue with and lie about their customers speaks volumes about your business.\n\nI HOPE OTHERS READ THIS POST BEFORE BEING TOOK ADVANTAGE OF BY THESE SCAM ARTIST AND IF YOU ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF BY THEM, CONTACT YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY.

During the exam, Dr. Davis asked me what kind of contacts I had been wearing because I wrote down something other than she had prescribed. She said, \"Whoever you got your contacts had better have given you Alcon, or I'll have their license. It's illegal for someone to prescribe anything other than I have prescribed to you.\"\n\nDuring checkout, my PayFlex card was declined and I didn't have any other method of payment. So I asked the girl at the front desk if there was anything else we could do. She said, \"Oh, we'll call you on Monday and make sure we get our payment, or we'll send you a bill.\" I understood that I was unable to get a prescription, but they refused to give me a trial pair of contacts or anything because my bill was not satisfied.\n\nEventually, I had to call my wife's cousin, who let me pay for it over the phone with her credit card. After paying, I asked again for a trial pair of contacts and they told me that I had been finalized and could not give me a trial pair, as they had a limited supply and those were for \"patients who had to come back.\" She acquiesced and said she would ask the doctor if she could give me a pair.\n\nAfter FORTY-FIVE minutes, she apologized for the wait and told me that she was able to give me a pair of trial contacts, but the right eye was not the correct prescription. I put the contacts in and, needless to say I will NOT be back.\n\nUPDATE: Changed review to 5 stars. Not because of anything that they did, but because Dr. Bradley got his feelings hurt. I'm not sure how he wants to run his business, but EVERYONE, please check your medical records. He let me know, after 4 years, that I still had a balance with his company. He called me a fraud because he said I presented an invalid and expired insurance card. Supposedly he will contact an insurance company that I haven't had insurance with in 4 years to try to recoup $99 for his business.

I was recently due for a contact eye exam. Because I had a good experience previously, I chose to return to the office for this procedure. The entire office is clean, bright and friendly. I was brought to the back almost immediately for my exam. The office had both standardized and progressive eye exam tools of technology. The office staff member who had worked with me explained all price upgrades for the exams on each of the machines that was not included. Dr. Moore was professional, informative and thorough. He was patient throughout the exam and took time to explain my current eye health and prescription. He also went above and beyond to explain the contact brand options that would work well with my eyes. After the exam, I was told that Dr. Moore preferred me using trials of the new prescription prior to ordering. I appreciated this long-term because it ensured that I felt comfortable in my new lenses. Since getting to know this office, I will not go anywhere else in Tuscaloosa.

This is in addition to the normal aging exams for the use of reading glasses, changes in prescriptions, etc.\n\nI cannot say enough good things about Dr Bedsole as an optometrist and as a caring individual.  She follows up on her patients to make sure they are improving.  She has even accepted an off hours message from me when we had an eye related emergency and responded immediately.

The doctor fit me for new contacts despite me insisting that I had just been given an updated prescription by my eye doctor at home a few months prior. I also emphasized that I had 3 months' supply of contacts at home and was NOT looking to buy new ones. The doctor told me that was fine and that she would just write me a new prescription in case I wanted to update my lenses. This was after her asking me what my old prescription was and me telling her what I THOUGHT it was, emphasizing that I was pretty sure the prescription I had at home was much stronger than the numbers I could remember. Please keep in mind that I am young and inexperienced in the medical field and basically just moved through my appointment (which was supposed to only be a check-up on the blood vessels in my eyes) basically nodding along to whatever the doctor and the staff said because I know NOTHING about this stuff. When I get up to the front counter to pay they informed me that I owed $100 for the contact fitting that I DID NOT ASK FOR and that even the doctor explained to me wasn't entirely necessary because she told me I could one day use the updated prescription she wrote me if I wanted to. Ended up going home, letting my dad call them (because they would not listen to me at check out) and ultimately making my way back to the office for a refund of the $100. The entire time I'm there for the refund, an older lady who was not in any sort of medical attire (she looked like a patient) harassed me telling me I was not fit to drive with my old prescription, she could get me in trouble, etc. She stood over me badgering me while I removed the contacts that the doctor sent me home with and returned the prescription the doctor wrote me to her.

Mr.Dr.McCurdy was very respectful and a very good doctor. My experience with Mrs.Dr.McCurdy, on the other hand was a nightmare. I came in with an eye ulcer and Mr.Dr.McCirdy helped me a lot and asked for a second follow up visit to see how my eye was feeling. When I returned I did not seem him. I saw his wife who works along side him. I was ok with this until she figured out I was a victim of a rare disease. When this became apparent to her, she began pestering me with questions. It ended with her asking \"If you would mind me taking a couple pictures of your eyes?\" I was reluctant but agreed. Instead of using the provided equipment to take professional pictures, she instead took the machine with a light and mirrors and instead of putting her eye to it, she took two pictures with her iPhone 7. I remember it being an iPhone 7 because it stated that it was on the bill right next to the 75$ price tag of each picture she took. After this I did not want to return for my yearly eye exam but I agreed to with the condition I would Mr.Dr.McCurdy instead of Mrs. So when we made the appointment we made it VERY clear we wanted him, not her. Well wouldn't you know it, who do I see when I walk in the door of the doctor's office. She was happily smiling with one of her nurses there. I sat in the chair waiting for the exam to begin. Instead of doing that, she asks the nurse to sit there and stare at my deformed eyes. After a couple minutes, I spoke up and asked if we could start the exam. She agreed and proceeded to put dilating drops in my eyes. When she got down to look she asked if I still had my contacts in. I said yes. She immediately pulls each of them out of my eye and throws them in the trash before I can react. I tell her those were my last contacts and she pulls them out of the trash and puts them in solution. Well we go on with exam even though I should've left right there. We finish and without asking me anything, she reaches to get the contacts and starts to try to put them in my eye. I ask her what she's doing and I explain to her I don't want contacts from the trash. She tries setting me up with a pair of sample contacts, which weren't even fit to my prescription, the equivalent of me putting on reading glasses when I'm legally blind without proper aid. She tells me we'd laugh this off and I left as quickly as possible. It's been three years or so, Mrs.McCurdy. When do I start laughing?", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a0335d9dc6d17:0xd729b4754302373e"}

I have had occasions when an eye injury occurred, something diagnosed as a \"detached viscous\" which happened first in one eye then, a year later, in the other.  Dr. Nichols explained the first time that it occurred, how important it was to make sure that the condition was watched carefully for the first several weeks or so, until the detachment was complete as it could result in a detachment of the retina during the process.  He told me to call 24 x 7 if I had any issues and that he or one of the other doctors in the office would see me immediately.  This is the kind of service that is unexpected today but shows the care and concern that Dr. Nichols and his office provides.

Instead of giving me the promised $50 discount for buying contacts and glasses at the same time, they added an additional $50 instead.They did have new computers when I was there so I understood that they were having difficulties with the system. Also charged me another $58.60 charge that could not be explained.  I went back to their office and explained what happened, showed them their own paperwork showing this, and they promised to correct it but did nothing. I had to contact my credit card to have these charges put on hold. The credit card company took off the $50 overcharge and the additional $58.60 charge that was never explained; however I never received the $50 discount that I was promised. After a second office visit and several phone calls they still did nothing. Not a good way to do business. Dr. Bedsole is good but his office staff is not. If you use him check your bill very carefully before you pay!!!  UPDATE: They sent a copy of the bill (same invoice number but for a different amount) to my credit card company that doesn't match the bill that I was given at their office!

My vision is so good in them I am shocked. Every interaction with staff from making the appt to the eye exam and testing the health of my eyes was SUPERIOR. The only challange was that Dr Kidd is yet another example of an extremely beautiful and highly intelligent SOUTHERN woman. She looks about 20 until she opens her mouth.

As was the case with last year\u2019s visit to Target Optical, the exam part is the only reason I could give the three stars. My experience LAST YEAR in getting my glasses was a total disaster from start to finish. From being given the wrong glasses which I took home and had to return, to then getting glasses that were marked completely wrong and had the reader part of my bifocals as 75% of my lenses, and beyond.....It was completely subpar in every way. This year I came in knowing that I would not be getting new frames, but may need to get new lenses. I had pre-priced everything on our EyeMed insurance site, and knew within $10-$15 what I would (SHOULD) be paying. Upon talking to the person who tried to help me, I was given an estimate which was over $100 what my insurance told me I am supposed to pay. We went round and round, and ultimately I left without even ordering my lenses. I was also told that even though I wasn\u2019t getting frames, they now have a $25 frame fee to just get lenses.(WHA???) When I got home, my husband and I put in all the information on the eyemed website and again came out with a cost which was over $100 less than what she had quoted me in the store. This experience reminded me that last year, I also had this problem, with upgrades and extras to my prescription being the \u201cdefault\u201d, and me having to beg for things to be taken off in order for me to get to the simple figure that my insurance would pay. WHY would they not start with the most simple lenses and frames and then give me the price to upgrade and add on extras? Why would they immediately start out with the most expensive features my insurance won\u2019t pay for, and force me to navigate removing the features to get what I want? Particularly since from the get-go I said I wanted the basic package for my glasses (plastic, not poly, etc) and was very clear about the cost that I was expecting? I guess I\u2019m old-fashioned, but I still consider an eye exam to be \u201chealthcare\u201d. I\u2019m not looking for a used car salesman in a person who helps me with my healthcare. That is exactly how I would describe the experience with target optical, and how I would describe the experience I had last year as well. The ladies who helped me were very nice, but I could say the same about all the folks who have ever tried to sell me a car. Want to win my 5 stars, Target? Talk with me about what my budget is. Talk with me about my insurance. Start from the ground up in building my package with my eyeglasses. Be honest with me about what is necessary, and what I can live without. I have always had plastic lenses, and because I am an adult who takes care of my glasses, I never have had so much as a scratch. Don\u2019t try to sell me polycarbonate when I tell you that it\u2019s not something I need! I hope you are getting my message here. I don\u2019t leave feedback lightly, and because you are a partner with our insurance we would like to continue to use your store. I\u2019ve given you two chances, and I\u2019m going to go back one more time to try to get lenses for my eyeglasses AT THE COST I EXPECT even though you are charging me an outrageous $25 fee for frames that I am not actually purchasing. You have two strikes. Hopefully you won\u2019t let me down when I go back.\n-Laurie Hill", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886212f944f99d41:0x50c1acb0e1adf057"}

Also, since my employer is so strict on the glasses, they provide me with a free pair every year, but my prescription has to be up to date. The ladies behind the desk refused to give me my exam results because it was against their policy. Basically they didn't want me to take my prescription to a competitor and purchase glasses or contacts. I explained my situation and that I had just spent almost 500 on glasses and contacts (and thats additional to insurance paying 150 toward my frames) with them. Didn't matter. I walked to the back and grabbed the optometrist. He gave me my prescription so I could take it to work.

This is an unbearable condition to the point you can\u2019t sleep at night. I have been treated for this before here and swapped back to acuvue 2 as soon as we figured out what was going on. Last week I used a pair of leftover oasys contacts by mistake and yesterday afternoon my right eye reacted. Last night and this morning were miserable and to make it worse I couldn\u2019t find the drops I was prescribed for the reaction.\n\nThis morning I called the eye center and asked if they could call in the drops so my wife could pick them up and bring them to me at work. I got short smartass answers and was told that they couldn\u2019t call in the eye drops I would have to see the doctor that was filling in today. She said if I got there by 2 they would work me in. Fine.\n\nI took off work early and arrived a little before 2. Staff attitude was terrible. My eye was blood red and I was obviously not feeling well. A little after 2 I was told there are 3 people ahead of me and it might be a while and asked if I wanted to wait. I don\u2019t know, how long will it be? She didn\u2019t know. Asked me again if i wanted to wait. Again I said how long? I don\u2019t know she said. Ok, how long does each patient take to be examined? 30-45 minutes she replied. At this point it was after 2, she had already told me the doctor was leaving at 330, and was obviously hinting for me to leave. I told her to remove me from the list i was leaving. She was happy to do so.\n\nSo it\u2019s Friday evening, I have a very obvious problem with my right eye, and she is happy to just send me away with no advice on what to do and not even offering to have a quick word with the doctor. Again, this is an easily diagnosed problem, especially with a history of it in my file, and the only thing I need are some non narcotic eye drops from the pharmacy.\n\nI googled eye doctor in the parking lot and saw Cargus eyecare a mile away. When I walked in I asked if they were taking new patients and could fit me in today. The lady at the counter took one look at my eye and said I can\u2019t turn you away with your eye looking like that we will definitely work you in. Within an hour I had seen the doctor and was gone.\n\nI will never be back to mccalla eyecare. The reviews on here regarding poor service are legit. This isn\u2019t the 1st time I have experienced it but it was the last. If anyone from there reads this do not bother calling, no need to apologize, I\u2019m done.\n\nOh btw. Several months ago I was shopping for some Costa sunglasses. When I figured out mccalla eyecare sells them I stopped by to see if patients get any kind of a discount. I was told no they are required to sell them at retail with no discount. Fine. I was still interested so I took a look at them anyway. I was looking for a specific pair and had looked at them online and at several stores. Long story short mccalla eyecare doesn\u2019t sell costas at suggested retail. They are marked up 10 or 20 percent, I can\u2019t remember which. Doesn\u2019t matter though the point is she lied to me and I just happened to know better.

He had picked out the black on black plastic Ray Ban frames.  The staff stated that it would take 2 weeks for his frames to come in so he had to go without glasses which contributed to him having major headaches.  They stated they would call me once they came in to come and pick them up.  I had to call them 3 separate times and physically go into the office and ask if they had come in yet for me to finally get my son's glasses, only to realize that they were the wrong frames.   He has been wearing the wrong frames for the last 3 weeks b/c he couldn't go a day longer without glasses due to his headaches. The staff there stated they would order the correct frames which should only take a week..... I have called the Mobile office 6 separate times (last call was Friday November 1, 2019)  with the response of, \"I don't know what you\u2019re talking about, can you repeat what is going on again?\" and with \"I don't see any frames for the name of ****** here for pick up\"..... with no resolution.  I have drove up there 3 separate times, the last time being yesterday, November 4, 2019, and a member of the staff sat there and pulled my son's frames out of her desk drawer and stated, \"well, they're right here\"... with attitude and with a disgusted look on her face that clearly showed that she was bothered with having to even deal with the situation.  I then asked how long they have had the correct frames there because I NEVER received a phone call to advise me that they were there for pick up.  Their response was, \" I don't know\"...... They stated they needed the glasses off my son's face before they would give me the correct glasses for him to wear and attempted to take them off his face right there.  I told them they were not taking the glasses off of my son's face and we are leaving with his new glasses that we had paid for. They then stated i would have to call management to try to resolve the issue and they just sat there without giving me the name and number of the person I needed to talk to.  I had to ask them for that information directly.   Needless to say, I left the office yesterday, yet again, empty handed because they never gave me the glasses that we originally ordered and paid for.

The staff was unbelievably rude and poorly trained. I went up to talk to the receptionist, she shooshed me, asked me if I didn't see her talking on the phone, and then closed the glass. I had an appointment at 9:30, but didn't get in until 11:00. When I did make it back to the office, they told me we would have to wait an hour and a half for my son's eyes to dilate. If this was the case, then why didn't they do that while we were already waiting. All in all, they expected me to be there for over 3 hours for an exam that might take 10 minutes.\n\nThe Daphne branch and Providence branches are just as bad. In Daphne, the doctors told me my eyes are getting better and I needed a weaker prescription. I asked them how was that possible since I have had glasses for 30 years and they stay pretty much the same or get maybe slightly worse. I thought that was just common sense, but I thought I could trust them. When I got my glasses back, they made my eyes cross. The staff told me that was because I needed a few days to adjust to the new prescription. After a few days, nothing. I took them back, got a new pair and the same thing happened again. It took them 3 tries before they could correct the problem.\n\nLike I said, I have been wearing glasses for over 30 years, lived all around the US, and have never had a problem.

Which he sent me to Dr. Mitchell @ Maynor and Mitchell Eye Center.  Dr. Mitchell removed my cataracts in both eyes.  He is very professional with great ethics, my surgery was done and in appx 2 hours, and he sends you to lunch, then returned back at his office at 12:00(**that was my time, it may be different for other patients **) .  He likes to Ck and see the eye to make sure surgery went good and no complications.  I have been in glasses since I was 10 years old, with the cataracts removed from both eyes I am now seeing 20/10 and 20/15 in my eyes! I was so much the colors of things were so different, so vibrant and pretty.I no longer did not have halos, I realized they were only one thing I  was looking at, which was a good thing. I did not know what to think it took a minute for my brain to comprehend that I no longer needed glasses to see distance.\nI will always have to wear glasses to read, but I am amazed at the quality of work and how How easy it was to have the surgery to see just how things look, how clear I could see things, without having to wear contacts or glasses not to mention developing and having cataracts.. I was told by my regular doctor;  Dr.  Vandiver in Athens, Having cataract surgery is almost 100% correction; where optional Lasix surgery to correct far vision is only temporary and Then you have to wear glasses or contacts or are to have Lasix to be re-done , usually in 10-20 years.  I was never able to afford having the Lasix surgery (because it is considered a cosmetic surgery) so I wore contacts and glasses all my life!  When I developed cataracts I did not understand why I could not see In my correction glasses/ contacts that I was used to wearing.  When Dr. Mitchell done my surgery, let me REMIND you it was in and out, within four hours I was seeing (almost ) perfect, I had very minimal swelling and the next day at my check up (Dr. Vandiver) My swelling was almost completely down, which even amazed my regular eye doctor. Dr. Vandiver , even helped me out with some really expensive eye drops by giving me a couple of samples( with my RX INSURANCE COST ME $70.00 out of pocket.) I found Dr. Mitchell to be very professional, caring, and very informative.  He is not one of the doctors that just does the work and then rushes you out of his office. He took his time, he done the job, and he made sure my eyes were healthy before he discharged me.  Dr.  Mitchell did NOT PROMISE ME THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO GET TO A PERFECT EYE SIGHT\u2026\u2026however, even though he did not promise he did tell me that he would do his best for me to see clearly, Now I can perfect better than perfect (in MY OPINION) I could not be any help happier!  I Highly, highly recommend\nDr. Mitchell\u2019s service. He will take care of you no matter what your circumstances are!!\nTHANKS TO DR. MITCHELL NO MORE EXPENSIVE PROGRESSIVE LENSES OR EXPENSIVE CONTACTS, even if he did not promise that, he done a great job with the surgery, and my eyes are brighter, and healthier!\u2026. I would do it all again 100 times over. Thank you Dr. Mitchell and  to your team!.\n\nMrs. Pruitt", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cccfd39e9b9:0x9bbcddc496fcb23"}

I have written a previous review concerning the immense amount of professionalism and care that the doctors and personnel provide; but once again, they have exceeded my expectations of their care. From the minute you walk into the door, you notice the constant upgrades that the facility is experiencing due to them becoming a part of Family Eye Care. This demonstrates that they wish to be on the leading edge of optical care with new equipment and a welcoming patient waiting area. I was welcomed by Cindy and Paige at the reception desk with a pleasant smile and greeting (unlike some medical practices that basically show that you are bothering them by requesting assistance); you will not see this here!\nThe wait time was incredibly short and I was escorted back to the back with questions of my day and further concerns of my wellbeing. Once I was in the examination room, I was greeted by Melissa and Dr. Mary-Kate Moring. They both intently listened to my eye concerns and took attentive time ensuring that my eyes were examined and explained any problems or developments with by contacts and vision. I didn\u2019t feel a bit like I was rushed out of the office by \u201cwriting off\u201d any questions or concerns; this gave me confidence once again that they really do care.\nAfter my exam, Melissa took as much time AS I NEEDED to ensure that I fully understood how to place and remove my contacts, as well as care of them. They also supplied any contact lens products that would assist me while I was getting used to the care and wear of them. While talking to Melissa, I told her that I recommended them to a family that needed eye care, but they probably could not afford eye care. She informed me that they work with the needs of many families when it comes to eye care, and they fully understand the hesitation of families to seek eye care due to finical needs. She continued to tell many that they have many eye care packages to assist those families in need of eye care; when comes to vision, cost should not be a factor. Again, this demonstrates a deep concern for an individual\u2019s eye care needs.\nOnce again, this visit amazed me! They really do care when it comes to my vision and eye care. It is ironic in the fact that they are becoming a part of Family Eye Care; each visit leads me to believe that not only do they care for me and my families\u2019 eye care, but now I can say that they are now a part of my Family.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1493320622796, "text": "We so appreciate you taking time to review us once again!

Just to be certain he also scheduled a follow-up so he, too, could monitor any changes. Dr. Appel has been there for our whole family for many years and I highly recommend him.
