Within the first few months the floor visibly began to cup and buckle and remains that way today. \tThe owner said he would, \u201cmake it right!\u201d \tWe have had to contact Old Gin Carpets over and over trying to get them to address this problem. However, well over a year after installation the problem with our floors remains. Our business with Old Gin Carpets has resulted in a loss of over $10,000 to repair the problem.\n\nAs part of a remodeling effort in our home, we had Old Gin Carpets install wood flooring in our main living area. After a few months we noticed a problem that I will refer to as \u2018cupping\u2019 on the new flooring. This effect was evident in all areas of the floor and worsened also resulting in \u2018bowing\u2019 in places where the floor raised high enough that it became a tripping hazard. I provided photos to Old Gin which was eventually followed by a visit from the owners, They told me that they had never seen anything like this and that they would do whatever needed to be done to, \u201cmake it right!\u201d I had hoped that such a strong statement by the owner would surely lead to a resolution.\n\nUnfortunately, months followed and it\u2019s been well over a year now since the flooring was installed. During that time we have lived with the constant embarrassment and humiliation of having to explain to guests why our floors are messed-up and why in all this time it hasn\u2019t been fixed. Old Gin has had multiple flooring inspectors look at the issue, but no exact cause has been mentioned. I have consulted with 2 licensed general contractors who have independently concluded that the lack of installation of a proper vapor barrier beneath the flooring is the most likely cause. It was also determined that there were no existing water leaks. I have also examined the National Wood Flooring Association and the flooring supplier\u2019s own Installation Guidelines, Methods and Instructions that validates what I was told by these general contractors that more preparation should have been done prior to installation.\n\nOld Gin was paid in full at the time of the installation. Our expectation of a North Alabama BBB A+ rated company would be one that would stand behind their products and service. It seems like it has been impossible to get resolution and it will end up costing us twice as much to repair as we will now have to remove the damaged floor and install a new one. This problem has taken far too much time and effort to address and many excuses have been given for the great delay in fixing the floor.\nWe feel that Old Gin has not been truthful in providing their products and services and that they have not met our expectations. Relative to the ideals listed by Old Gin Carpets on their website, we certainly have not been the focus of their business, we have not been happy with the product and we have received zero value for our money. In fact, we feel that they have flat-out taken us for our money!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886212bb9c084277:0xcfa30894660c0db6"}

It's always a pleasure to shop in Ethan Allen.

Thanks\n\nPlease Be Aware Of This Business\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 SHARE\n\nI purchased a brand new $800 lift chair recliner from this place. I bought it on a Saturday evening and contacted them on Monday to let them know something was wrong with the chair. They would not let me return it. It was under warranty so I had them send some one out to look at it. The guy came week 2. Agreed the whole time that something was wrong with my chair but he wasn\u2019t sure how to fix it. He sent the report to Sabrina\u2019s Furniture Store week 3 and she said nothing was wrong with it. I hung up and called the manufacturer in Mississippi they said the brake for the footrest was not working. Therefore my footrest slowly goes down while sitting in it. They sent me a new motor for it. I contacted Sabrina back and she was gonna send someone out to put it on. So I\u2019ve waited all week and nobody has showed up or called. I contacted Sabrina to find out why nobody has showed up to fix it and she said the system is kicking out the maintenance order. I told her I was tired of waiting because my feet were staying swollen from not staying elevated. I also told her I would bring the chair back tomorrow and swap it out for a new one. She said they were all out of stock. So I said I would bring it back and get my money back. She agreed to it but then wanted to charge me a $200 restocking fee. Mind you this is a brand new $800 chair that has been tore up since I purchased it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862ccc4d6074139:0x7da1f1f052cd206a"}

My shipment is a pallet of 33 boxes of porcelain tile., plus 7 additional boxes they put on the same pallet. The right side of the pallet was coming apart due to the immense weight of the tile . The driver could not move the pallet down the truck. He was not going to be able to pull it up the small slope on my driveway. What on earth were they even thinking?They needed a fork lift. I called Home Depot and they got the Transport company on the line while I was on hold. I ended up being told the transport company needed to take care of this and they would contact me in 24 to 48 hours. Which they never did. I had to call them. On 3/5 Friday I called central transport and they told me the shipment would be delivered on Monday between 11 and 12. They never showed. I checked the shipment tracking and found that they changed it to Tuesday 3/9! I got no call, text, or phone call.So Tuesday 3/9 I message them to find out eta. They said the drivers hadn't left yet and to keep checking they will update me. That never happened. So I wait and wait and I get a call from Home Depot letting me know the tile has arrived at THE STORE.

I'm good. WRONG!!! The outlet had to be above the microwave.... Something that would have been nice to know, but they could not communicate that properly.\nThen, the delivery/installation people had no idea what they were doing. They were more of a delivery company, not an installation professional. They could not install my gas range. They damaged my microwave. So, really, they weren't even a good delivery company. Home Depot just subs out delivery to the cheapest company....and you can see the quality when your damaged items arrive!\nAnd I pray for you if you have ANY problems with your delivery or installation!!!\nCount on a couple of things: 1) You will spend hours on the phone getting to talk to the right person. Once you think that you have the right person, they will tell you they have to check on something and they will have to call you back. OR, the right person is \"on lunch\" and they will call you back. After giving them ample time for \"lunch\" (3 hours) when you call them back, you will be told that they were \"off today\" but they will return your call in the morning.\nBasically, it's a game of ping-pong and it takes days to get simple questions answered because, obviously, no one who works there wants to actually do anything.\nI can't believe I dropped over $7K in there and they can't even answer a simple question!!!!\nBuyer beware!!!

When they were forced to call me back, I felt like my problems had been resolved, and my appliance would be delivered. The next day, I received an email that my fridge was ready to be picked up. After calling the store AGAIN, it was finally sorted out. I think I got lucky and spoke to someone who cared that it had been nearly two months of waiting.

He had no info - not even on the process and we explained we had a bad experience before.

We went in to return a work desk that he had purchased yesterday, only to come home and find out that pieces are broken and missing. When we arrived at the return desk we were greeted angrily by a lady named Shelia (her tag said CSA Front Desk). She was in the process of helping another gentleman with a wheelbarrow at the time we arrived so I shrugged her attitude off as frustration to begin with. By the time she got to us she took the receipt from my husband, asked angrily what was wrong to which he informed her that the desk portion (the main part of the item) was broken down the middle and pieces were missing. She rolled her eyes, mumbled a few things, then started to walk away and as she was walking into another room yelled back at us \"you know it's a clearance item right?!\"  She then came back out of that room, struggled to get the lid off the box and then continued to tell us in a displeasing tone that our kobalt work desk was on clearance. I then stated \"so does clearance mean that pieces are broken? If so, lowes should not be selling clearance items\". She then argued with me that clearance items are usually returns with missing pieces and I restated that the main portion of the item is completely broken in half. I don't care if it's clearance or not, it was not marked down nearly enough to compensate for a complete useless, damaged piece. She then slammed a refund receipt down and asked my husband to sign. She never asked if we wanted to swap it with a usable piece. She never asked anything, actually. During this entire transaction she was rude and everything anyone in customer service should not be. She was also complaining and cussing under her breath about no one answering the phone around there during our entire few minutes with her. When we were leaving there were 2 more men waiting patiently behind us and just staring in disbelief at what they witnessed and would unfortunately encounter. I told one man good luck as we walked off and he said it looked like he needed it.
