Originally me and my now husband were going to have our wedding somewhere else but due to covid 19 they cancelled on us 3 weeks before our wedding. We called and left a voice mail to get prices for Burns Bluff and Mrs. Tillery called us back and set up a tour for that weekend.\n\nWe toured and instantly fell in love with the place. It is gorgeous. They fit us in so that we could get married june 20th, when the original daye was the 6th. That just shows how quickly and efficently they got us on the books and ready to go.\nYou don't realize how much of a blessing it is to have sleeping accomation for not only yourself, but the wedding party (depending on the size) until after everything is over. We went with the big package and were able to sleep 28. I didnt have to worry about people being late because most of the party was there the night before.\n\nWe also got the decorations closet, which was also a blessing. I didn't have to go find decorations or agonize over how to decorate. They asked me my opinion and set everything up. It was gorgeous.\n\nCathy Mayer was our coordinator and thanks to her and Mrs. Tillery, I did not have to worry about anything the day of my wedding. They took care of everything that came up and if anything went wrong, I don't know about it.\n\nA small piece of advice though, close off the main living space before everyone gets there. Designate someone to do it. We forgot to, and there was so many people walking around the living room and kitchen, going into peoples rooms, that it was suffocating. That's the only thing I would change, and that was totally on me to do.\n\nI will post some pictures when I get them.

We set up a tee time the day before for Saturday. We traveled about 40 mins to the course. It was right off the highway into a gated golf community. Right from the start we were greeted by the staff. Upon entering the clubhouse, I was amazed at the initial set up of the course. My co-worker had to rent some clubs, at which they were very accommodating by giving him a brand new set of Nike Vapors. I had the Coverts 2.0 from the previous year and was impressed at the rentals they provided. We went to the driving range and then the putting green and we were off. Long story short, the course was AWESOME and the view was even better. We found ourselves stopping to take pictures and taking in the view (Which I rarely do on course). What I thought was to be a 6 hr round (because of our relax play at each hole) was a little over 4 hrs. This course is in my TOP 5 best courses I've played in my life, (I've played in the range of 50-60 different courses). I would recommend this course to anyone who enjoys a challenge, but also a forgiving course layout. The scenic views are something out of a movie which as to the relaxation of the game of golf. If you are ever in the area, you have to check out this course.\n\nA big Thank You to the staff there at Cherokee Ridge who were some of the top notch personnel a course can have.

Only one wedding this year failed to communicate these requirements to their guests and, as a result, their guests and wedding party failed to follow our social distancing requirements and also broke our venue rules in regards to smoking and safe alcohol consumption. When our team has communicated these rules at all of our weddings and events this year, only one wedding party reacted poorly and refused to be reasonable and berated our staff.\n\nAll of our weddings receptions promptly end at 10:00 pm and all guests are asked to leave the property at this time. It is unfortunate when intoxicated guests react poorly to these rules but we are grateful that all but one of our wedding couples this year has communicated the contract and wedding end times successfully to their invited guests.

It may be a bit long of a read but if you want a current and an honest review on our experience here then please read this.\n\nThe property is absolutely beautiful and has a lot of historic charm. The house is spacious and can probably accommodate any event. It's an older house so the layout is different but still functioned what the event needed. Thats pretty much the only positive thing I can say about our recent experience here. My friends recently, as in yesterday, got married at this property and the staff, one in particular, were rude, inappropriate at times, unprofessional, condescending and over bearing all while smothering the bride, groom and wedding party along with all the guest that were staying and attended the wedding. The staff never left at any point and hovered over the guest making it feel uncomfortable and uninviting as possible which is not the proper tone for a wedding. They gave conflicting rules on the fly such as no smoking on the property and to go to a spot about a 100 yards away which was actually public property and could lead to you getting arrested for public intox if you want to be technical not to mention extremely inconvenient. Another example: one of the guest that was staying in the house was told to leave the inside of the house as its only for those who are staying here. She was reminded more than once that said person is indeed staying and has his own room in the house. Later that night another guest who was also staying was standing in the kitchen and was told it was more of a prep kitchen and not a hang out and get drunk kitchen and to remove himself from the kitchen area. The staff constantly complained about every little thing we did and without being biased at all and being completely honest, we were extremely respectful of the property as we were there to have a wedding and were there to celebrate two of our close friends getting married and wanted it to go as perfectly as possible. The staff made that a challenge but luckily we're a resilient optimistic group and continued to have a good time even though the staff never left and are even in the majority of the pictures that were taken through out the evening. So if you want to be bombarded with random rules and a cramping and hovering staff that will provide you with zero privacy and add stress to your visit then this place is absolutely perfect for just that.\n\nUPDATE: All they keep saying is the same exact response in each review which is very poor management and not EVER reaching out to the customer! If this was my business and had MULTIPLE people saying the same thing then I would at least find out what is wrong and fix it. NOT GIVE THE EXACT SAME RESPONSE! And just an FYI.......there were more than 1 group that has complained about this and wish I would\u2019ve taken a screen shot of the reviews BEFORE they took it down!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1603285437994, "text": "We are so thankful that out of more than 50 events in 2020, all but one wedding event was successful and the couples were wonderful to work with.

My daughters engagement pictures and  wedding pictures are full of cats in the ceremony, one cat literally walked down the isle in front of our daughter creating a laughing frenzy that took her aww moment from her as no one paid attention to her . One was cleaning it\u2019s  bottom at the alter, some lying in food servers and eating off the quest tables and several dogs running thru the reception. We had  people holding cats under each arm to keep the cats out of pictures. The video of the wedding can not be heard over the barking of the rescue dogs and the owners personal dogs on the premises. The bridesmaids were constantly having to clean cat poop off their shoes. \ud83e\udd22  The road to the venue is not paved and has become very rough as there is a large amount of logging going on around the venue at this time  (6-1-19). As I am an animal lover a formal venue is not the place to have a rescue and vice versa. There is only one bathroom for guest to use and it was not clean upon us arriving. I had to ask for it to be cleaned as it at hair around the urinal.  The inside of their carriage house which holds the kitchen had dirty floors and filth in the corners where it had not been cleaned well. I would not recommend this venue for any event which is formal or food being served. I also find it very interesting that any bad review on here can be challenged by a \u201cgoogle user\u201d which is probably the owner trying to get their rating back up because if any of my family didn\u2019t agree with me I can promise you they wouldn\u2019t be coward enough to go on the Internet and post anonymously so there\u2019s your proof they are pretty dishonest folks.

I'm assuming that you expect my employees and other vendors who work tirelessly to ensure that your daughter's wedding day went perfect should never take a break to eat or drink. As an employer I try my best to ensure a great work experience along with providing all our guest service that is top notch.  We have a very close knit relationship with Southern Skillet and she always makes sure we are fed out of her own cost.\n\nNo one took any of \"your\" food as you are claiming. There are more than 10 employees/vendors at each event. Some of whom have worked 10 plus hours in the point that they actually get to sit and take a break during the reception. No one on staff eats until all guests are through the line and there has been plenty of time for any guest to get extra if desired. It is an absolute shame that anyone would think its unacceptable for another human being to eat or drink. As a matter of fact I got up and left what small plate I did have to clean up vomit that I am sure you knew nothing about.\n\nAll of the accusations you have brought forth have been addressed with your daughter. We cannot allow food to be taken when it has been out of temperature per health department regulations. We along with Southern Skillet ensure that all food is handled safely to standards that are set extremely high.\n\nWe did not meet or even speak to you until the day of the event, nor was your name on any invoice or the contract. So if you would have been a part of any of the meetings or wedding planning we could have explained everything.  We explained everything to your daughter and she was great to work with. I would even say a dream bride!

I was able to bring all my stuff in and tell Heather and her staff what I wanted and they decorated and set everything up in exactly what I asked for.

Her staff was friendly and willing to drive me anywhere I needed so I wouldn\u2019t mess up my dress. One sweet lady even drove from the woods to the reception hall just to get me a water! When we weren\u2019t taking photos, I was able to relax in bridal cottage\u2014 which is perfect with comfy chairs, a badass ring light for your makeup/hair person to use, an antique vanity for pictures, and private bathroom. The venue itself is so breathtaking. Every spot\u2014 the woods, chapel, reception hall\u2014 is designed from a photographer\u2019s perspective, and on top of designing it that way, Heather even worked with my photographer (telling her the best time of day to shoot where) to ensure all the pictures of my special day were perfect. Our ceremony was held in the open air chapel, and once my toddler made it to the end of the aisle, she decided to take off into the woods\ud83d\ude02 but one of the wonderful staff members drove her around on the golf cart to keep her entertained so my whole family could stay in the ceremony and so momma/bride wouldn\u2019t stress out over a crying toddler.

Fresh, juicy tomatoes burst with sweetness along with pungent garlic. The sweetness and acidity of the balsamic add another layer of flavor and fresh basil turns it up with herbaceous flair. Rating: 4.5/5\n\nBrie and Marmalade Bites starts with a phyllo cup filled with orange marmalade, brie, and herbs. It is a light bite and would be great as a passed hors d\u2019oeuvre for a wedding or corporate event. The creamy brie combined with the sweetness and citrus flavor of the marmalade pair perfectly together. Rating: 5/5\n\nCaesar Salad is made with fresh romaine lettuce tossed with house-made Caesar dressing with anchovy. I love Caesar salad but it is very hard to find a place that makes it correctly. If you do not like anchovies, do not order a Caesar salad. It is just not a Caesar salad without it. Chef David makes a great Caesar salad dressing, not too thin and not too thick. The perfect viscosity to cling to the lettuce. I love that Chef David makes a crostini seasoned with butter, salt, and pepper instead of chunky, clunky croutons. It\u2019s easier to eat and elevates the salad as well. Chef David, you need to bottle and sell that dressing! Rating: 5/5\n\nChicken Marsala is made with mushrooms, shallots, garlic, and parsley served over angel hair pasta. The chicken gently bathes in the sauce and really infuses the flavors into the chicken. It is tender and unlike any chicken marsala I\u2019ve ever had. But that sauce is like liquid gold. It clings to the angel hair pasta like silk sheets. You can\u2019t help but lick the plate afterwards. I could see this on a fine dining establishment\u2019s menu. It is so refined and delicious! Rating: 5/5\n\nChocolate Fondant (Americans refer to this as a chocolate lava cake or molten chocolate cake) is basically a bi-product of a flourless chocolate cake and a souffl\u00e9. Chef David served his with macerated strawberries and strawberry coulis. If you go to my Instagram, I have a video of the chocolate \u201clava\u201d flowing from the cake. I have tried many of these in my lifetime, but I think this was the best. I don\u2019t know if it was because I had right out of the oven but it was just amazing! The perfect ending to a perfect meal!

I didn't recognize your name right off, so I looked in all the reservations to see when you stayed and didn't see your name anywhere.  I can only assume you came as part of a group.  I was looking because I was wanting to respond to the comment but don't have chronology.  I wanted you (and the public reading this) to know that we have added two sparkling new full bathrooms on the main level and they are gorgeous.  The only other thing I could think of was the upstairs hall bath leaking to the lower floor.  We have discovered it only happens once in a while and in those cases the guests didn't put the shower curtain inside the shower.  So mystery solved AND we ordered glass sliding doors for that shower/tub combo to make it virtually leak-roof.  Hoping that clears anything up about \"bathroom amenities needing work\".  To the public reading reviews: this property is well maintained and we have no current issues with bathrooms.  They are all stocked with body wash, shampoo and conditioner.  We even have bar soap and the towels are fluffy and smell amazing.  Thanks Patrick for bringing the possibility of needing improvement as we strive to continuously achieve that.

They forgot to bring out our champagne for all 150 of our guests for the toast. They didn't have any of the cake ready for the guests, we had to awkwardly stand there with no cake for the guests. After both of those occurrences, one of the rude staff members pulled my husband aside and yelled at him for having a terribly scheduled wedding, even though we gave the staff the schedule for weeks early, which we followed. The bartender was very kind, but there were several times where the bar was left unattended and I was having to wait there with a ton of guests to get a drink.  There even came a point where the drinks were left for guests to grab themselves, and some of our guests were taking whole wine bottles... which didnt seem compliant with ABC rules.

When Elena and Owen would happen to stop by the restaurant I worked at, they would always make a point to come say hello to me.

The owner was contacted and he defended her saying she sometimes comes off as rude, he did however go speak to the men and offered them a Gatorade as compensation... Yes will deff not be back! But they did say the course was nice.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1618467343724, "text": "The real story of this review is that Tangy Bodie whatever her name may be, wasn't even at the golf course.   This is more of a story of how she can attempt to extract extreme compensation for the threat of a bad review.  From the moment speaking with Alexis on the phone the conversation quickly became \"what kind of compensation will you give me??\"  Meaning she wanted me to refund over $ 160.00 in greens fees because of her threats of a poor review.   I went out to the course and spoke to the gentlemen about the incident.  They were delayed only 5 minutes from their tee time.  My worker could have had a cooler head dealing with customers, but an apology was made and the men appeared to be happy that I looked into the situation. I offered to buy them a round of beers as a friendly gesture.   I am more than willing to accept a one star review than cower to a person trying to extort money in lieu of a bad review.   Cumberland Lake GC is one of the finest golf courses in Birmingham at its price point.  And, we also have some very fine individuals working behind the counter.

That wasn't a problem for me- I only had one bridesmaid, and we did everything except getting dressed, elsewhere. Also, the reception area doesn't hold everyone, so we had to set up tables outside.

Do not sign a contract with Adam\u2019s Acres, and do not trust them. Adam\u2019s Acres has been operating for less than a year. I was the first bride to book Adam\u2019s Acres. I booked them when all that Brittany Adam\u2019s had to show was studs and pictures of what it would look like when completed. I took a huge risk and trusted Brittany. Now, I regret that decision.\n\nDue to the COVID shutdowns in March, I was forced to postpone my April wedding. All of the dates I had to choose from included holiday dates or August dates. We picked August 15th thinking that COVID would be over by then. However, COVID-19 cases are worse now than they were in April. After a lot of praying and talking to relatives, a month from our wedding, we made the decision to postpone our wedding again! This is not at all what we wanted to do, but for the safty of our family and friends we felt it was necessary. Brittany, being the heartless person she is, refused to give us another Friday-Saturday date in 2021. She offered a Sunday date with our rehearsal dinner being on a Thursday. That would not work for religious purposes and the fact that we have so many out of town guests.  She said \u201cwe would cut into her 2021 revenue if she gave us a Friday-Saturday date\u201d. The only way we would be able to have a Friday-Saturday date is to pay the new 2021 rate of $3500.00 when we have already paid in full of $2500.00. Not only will she not let us postpone to a Friday- Saturday date in 2021, she refuses to give us a refund.\n\nShe has stolen our money and has taken advantage of the COVID-19 situation!!

COVID-19 has been a nightmare for everyone and we understand your frustration.\nWhen the State of Alabama shut down all businesses we rescheduled affected couples. It was heartbreaking for our couples and incredibly difficult for our small business that had been operating less than 6 months. We were so happy to have Fall dates still available, but we will be very honest...it has been difficult trying to recover from all the bookings we lost because of reschedules, especially when we didn't qualify for any assistance. We are thankful that unlike a lot of businesses we were able to survive and didn't have to close our doors.\nWhen we rescheduled you to August 14th/15th, we held that date for you and turned away other couples and parties that contacted us for that date. Unfortunately when you cancel 3 weeks prior, it is impossible to re-book.\nWe have been open and safely hosting events again since May 30th. Every single couple has been dealing with the uncertainty of COVID and taking precautions to keep everyone safe. We offered to discuss these options with you as well. The mother of the bride tonight told us, \"I know it wasn't as big as they planned, but they are finally married and we felt SAFE.\" Yesterday\u2019s couple rented additional tables to put outside to further socially distance. All weddings have provided masks and had hand-sanitizer readily available. Tonight's bride also live-streamed her event so that her grandmother (who could not attend because of her assisted-living's COVID policies) could watch her get married. Vendors are wearing masks, caterers are hiring extra staff to safely serve everyone, our venue has extra staff at events for sanitizing... Everyone is making compromises and working hard to keep everyone safe.\nWe are in no way downplaying the seriousness of this virus. We also have no idea when it will end. We understood the reason for your cancellation and although it goes against our cancellation policy, we were empathetic and offered you a Sunday date in 2021 with no additional payments required. When you told us that interfered with your religion, we again offered for a Monday-Thursday. We are so sorry that none of those options worked for you.\nWeddings are such an emotional time for everyone and we understand your disappointment. We know that all couples and wedding vendors alike have been thrown into incredibly difficult situations. When what you want to do for your couples conflicts with how you have to run your business--it feels impossible. If we let one person reschedule, we would have to do it for everyone to be fair. We are so sorry, but we simply cannot do that and keep our doors open. We have to follow our cancellation policy in this situation."}, "gmap_id": "0x889297ef32ece5ff:0xf3bd8bb0f4a416a"}

The decor was modern while still having a traditional southern feel. All areas outside were well lit, and had great coverage from the sound system. Plenty of clean bathrooms as well. Of course we couldn't use it but the infinity pool and hot tub looked very relaxing! There also was a fire pit built into the ground with seating around it.

I understand that everyone has gone through hard times during COVID-19, as it\u2019s something no one could have planned for. But I do feel like a wedding venue should be willing to compromise with a bride when she is unable to use dates they give her. I fell in love with this venue and the owners and recommended them to everyone, but with the outcome we have had, I will not be recommending them to anyone else, in fear that someone else will lose thousands of dollars when the venue says a pandemic falls under \u201cacts of God\u201d.\nRefused to refund us even a portion of our money after our family could not use one of their dates available due to a PANDEMIC and the fact that my FIL is a football coach with a very tight schedule. I would also like to point out that when we booked the venue, I booked through the owners. An employee was hired a few months after to handle the wedding side. I loved the personality of the owners and how kind and relatable they seemed. I do not feel like I dealt with a person with the same qualities when we were met with the tough decisions of rescheduling twice and then eventually not being able to have a wedding at our dream venue at all.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1603891157453, "text": "Caley, we have all been affected by the pandemic and we appreciate your frustration.

You chose not to use that date and gave us no notice.  We relied on your acceptance of the date and were not able to offer that date to other brides or new weddings.

The day before our wedding, at the rehearsal, they changed the time that we could arrive and made it an hour later. This was a problem especially because our photographer was scheduled to come at the earlier time. He came when they allowed but we were not able to get as many pictures. Their wedding planner called the day before the wedding to discuss details for the first time. That is something that should have been discussed way beforehand. We had our own wedding planner but were required to use theirs as well. I had hoped for one type of flower but since it was unavailable I chose roses. 2 weeks before the wedding the florist called to tell me the other flowers were available but when I called her back my first AND second choice were no longer available. I ended up choosing something random since it was so last minute.  The cake was beautiful and perfect so there is that redeeming quality. I would not recommend this place due to the attitude of the staff members. Though we had all of these minor things going on, my wedding day was more than I ever dreamed. That didn't have anything to do with the venue but had to do with what marriage represents. Thankfully our vows were much more important than everything being perfect.

We had approximately 125 guests in attendance, and we fit well in both the ceremony and reception areas. While the weather was sunny and hot, they cranked up the AC in the barn. Also, my granddaughter had fans printed up and passed out, so people were fanning themselves throughout the service in true Southern style. After the ceremony, we walked across the gravel road to the reception area, and dined under the wide open blue skies. Fireflies danced among the rose bushes as evening softly surrounded us, and the stars and twinkle lights added to our celebration. Of course, my granddaughter\u2019s father-daughter dance music selection was the opening theme song of the movie, \u201cPride and Prejudice.\u201d Then, the DJ put on the latest dance music, and the crowd of twenty-somethings danced the night away. The food and bar offerings were greedily devoured. I found the J and D staff kept our needs met unobtrusively but also with a sweet spirit.

It was very hot, though I obviously don't knock the location for that. My main complaint would be that they had to move the chairs from the ceremony area to the reception area. This took about 20 minutes, and left all the guests standing confused in heat. No one came to tell us when they were finished setting up, and we eventually meandered up to the barn where the reception was held. There were also quite a few chiggers (red bugs), at the barn as well. Perhaps this all wasn't to their fault and was resultant of poor planning, though it seemed as though it was.\n\nThe parking was also odd, it was about a quarter of a mile from the venue. They had transportation between places in the form of what was basically a golf cart. Though they took forever to come back and forth, resulting in my girlfriend walking up the hill in heels.\n\nOverall the place was quite beautiful, I hate to give this sort of review to such a lovely place, but this was my experience.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1572798023395, "text": "Hi John,\nThanks so much for your review and the kind words about the overall beauty of our venue. In regards to the seating in the orchard... we actually have multiple seating options available that do not require seating to be moved from ceremony to the reception. We have over 300 chairs, vintage church pews as well as custom made wood benches. In this case it was requested that the same chairs be utilized at both, ceremony and reception, so we did in fact have to move them... which is a job that  requires about 20 minutes and 6 staff members. We do strongly discourage this option, but ultimately it\u2019s the decision of the bride. :-) As far as instructing guest to make their way to the barn, this would fall under the job of a wedding planner or coordinator, not the venue itself. In regards to chiggars, we do keep all gathering areas around the barn and reception area mowed and well maintained, however we do have 40 acres of Bermuda surrounding the barn, so if you got in any of these areas, a chigger or two is very likely :-). Finally, our parking lot is located on site but 600 feet from the barn. We do this as an effort to keep the ceremony & reception area safe, as well as clear of vehicles for photography purposes. A 6 seater electric (2017 Polaris Gem) shuttle is available for all weddings. The round trip for this takes only 90 seconds, of course that time does vary..  Especially when exiting, as we make every effort to drop guest directly at their car.  Again thank you for the very kind words. We hope you get the opportunity to attend another wedding soon!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888a30d338f76721:0xf2771ad745e07a53"}

She was very rude on the wedding day.

We wanted to avoid the \"wedding nightmares\" you hear about with vendors falling through or ripping you off or all of the above and we chose wisely. We visited the venue and after meeting Yolanda, we immediately said \u201cthis is the one\u201d. We looked no further and this is the only venue we visited. It is as beautiful in person as you see in the many photos on their website and in other bride's pictures. I cannot wait to get our pictures/videos back. It is a family owned business and quite reasonable in the grand scheme of average wedding costs. We had unlimited contact and visits with all staff. We moved to the south a year before getting engaged and decided to have everyone come down to us for a good ol\u2019 southern wedding. The logistics were overwhelming and Yolanda, Candace and Terri were wonderful in making sure everyone was picked up, transported and generally accommodated. They take care of all the major details so for a detail-oriented person like me, it was great because I had time to craft my own little personal touches. We rented out the mansion for the immediate families and wedding party to spend the night with their guests and when we pulled up, we got nothing less than Ooos and Ahhs about how beautiful and serene it all is. Every vendor Yolanda has in her arsenal is remarkable and a joy to work with - she wouldn't have it any other way and that is how you know you're looking at the right venue/planner. The day-of coordinator (Terri) is a MUST-DO for Brides. We actually ate at our wedding! We had our first meal as husband and wife and no one even knew and just assumed the wedding norm ( that you don\u2019t get to eat the delicious food you hand-selected!) It was absolutely incredible. Everyone was so surprised that she answered all of their questions, let them do whatever they wanted within reason and even partied and had a blast with us. You will not find a more flexible venue/planner anywhere. There were bridesmaid's guests that were not a part of the wedding party and while we were off taking pictures or getting ready, she let them hang out, swim in the pool and generally do whatever as if they were at their own homes. In terms of the wedding, she was willing to go above and beyond to make the day special for us. She found us the perfect officiant who let us do a cultural element as part of our ceremony \u2013 something they were equally as excited to see executed. We wanted to light off lanterns at the end of the night and she said absolutely. Nothing was out of the realm of possibilities or \"against the rules\" and that is how your wedding day should be - exactly as you want. Everywhere else we looked there was a \u201cNo-no\u201d list of things you cannot do \u2013 be out by 11, no open flames, no loud music, etc etc. That list does not exist at Oak Island and they will try to accommodate all of your requests within reason.\n\nIf you are looking for a one of a kind wedding experience with seasoned professionals, listen to their advice (they've done way more weddings than you!) and go with Oak Island Weddings. We could not have been happier with our choice.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888948c6f31e0777:0x7dbfd474cbd2c867"}

The Barn at Twin Valley made our wedding day SO special and one we will always treasure. The entire process from visiting the venue to the day off was overwhelmingly enjoyable. Lyn, Patty and Lucy were such a pleasure to work with. They are true examples of classy hospitality. As the bride, I did not stress one bit on the day of my wedding because I trusted in them completely. They are professionals and know exactly what to do -- down to the smallest details. The venue itself is BEAUTIFUL! You have several options of where you want your ceremony to take place and they tailor the rest of the venue to what makes you happy. They have a room full of every decoration you can think of too! This was one of the best things because it took away a lot of stress from me and my family. You have the option to pay an additional charge and they take care of EVERYTHING when it comes to decorating. I highly recommend you do this because it ends up saving you a lot of money and time. The venue also accommodates for your entire bridal party. We got ready at the venue and it was so much fun! There is a ton of space and all of our vendors were pleased with the venue for their own needs. Also, the venue can hold a ton of people too! Our wedding was probably over 250 people and it was no problem for them to handle. Again, having our wedding at the Barn and Twin Valley was one of the BEST decisions my husband and I made for our wedding. Since they took away a lot of stress, we were able to focus more on marriage counseling and all of the fun things that come along with wedding planning! I will continue recommending it to everyone because I am confident that you will be satisfied! Remember, a wedding is a day and a marriage is a lifetime -- so let the professionals at the Barn at Twin Valley take away all of your stresses you may have -- you will be guaranteed to have your dream day! Then you can look back and be joyful over how smoothly everything went and look forward to the rest of your life as husband and wife!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-m1QHlIGe98cYkL9eQNMdwMzgaYLEv9OmmHCg=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNX9NNihgU_tY9W6qv4D2sqHjCJmBZxLsmzandy=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOygGJXhqzbbzI0DYPjYhBFqFMgx_HYQRslN2WN=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEEBgZ0A4jbk5DLhQsN-9QZSzJFZosjbtVyx8q=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXY6RuKRf3Lfd8ppEYyW214H0NHScgDze6IAhT=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfQeQZvPvrjlMDIOIGSAFa2i3xsHhWoXKUa1Yy=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e8c92ada2667f:0x899f45a3df1c9457"}

I understand there are farm animals surrounding the \"what used to be a functional barn\" but no one wants to smell poop on their wedding day. I quickly told them that I changed my mind and they verbally agreed to return my $500. If someone else book October 14th. Well we booked the venue over a year in advance so it was a waiting game. The form you fill out clearly said no refunds however given the advanced booking she verbalized there wouldn't be an issue with giving me a return once it's booked. Well after emailing maybe 4-5 times to see if it was booked, she seemed to get irritated and acted like the conversation never occurred. Well I have not received my refund and she refuses to talk to me about it. I don't have parents to pay for my wedding so I am paying for my own, and this was a hit to my budget. I am a nurse so it's going to take quite some time saving. If she didn't plan on giving me a refund then it would have been nice for her just to say this instead of ignoring me.
