Not only did he personally call me to ensure everything went smoothly with renting, he continued to be personally involved in my stay, routinely checking to make sure I had everything I needed and was comfortable.  The few times I had any issues, like a small incident with the city dumping tree trimmings where I would park, he was super responsive and helpful in resolving the issue almost immediately.\n\nThe house itself was great and the location was super convenient.  It was a less than 10 minute drive to downtown, grocery stores, and the mall by exit ten, but also a quiet enough neighborhood that I could feel at home at the end of my day.  It was also a two block walk to Lakebottom Park, which really can't be beat.\n\nProbably the best part of my experience with renting from Dave though, was that he is 100% serious about looking out for people who have rented from him.  While moving to a new duty station, I contacted him asking if he wouldn't mind being a reference on a lease application.  He had the reference forms filled out and sent back to me just a couple hours later.  He is seriously awesome.\n\nIf I'm every back in the Columbus area again, he is the first person I would contact to rent from, without hesitation.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1622232960228, "text": "It was my pleasure to host you Simon, good luck to you with everything. -Dave"}, "gmap_id": "0x888ccb76728417bb:0xd3c749a16486b273"}
