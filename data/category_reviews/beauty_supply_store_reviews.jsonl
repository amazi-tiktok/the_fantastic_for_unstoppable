The drive through was closed today so I entered the store (not wanted to go inside trying to keep my husband as well as I can) the cashier, when I asked,  told me the pharmacy  was closed I asked to speak with the manager. The shift manager  can out and I asked him why the pharmacy  was closed he said someone  in the pharmacy tested positive  for COVID-19.  I told him I must have my husband's  prescription because  he could end up in the hospital  without it. His answer  was that he didn't  know when the pharmacy  would open back up and they were having the store cleaned  tonight by a professional cleaning  co. So what is a person to do if they depend  on a medication that they have a prescription for and can't  get it from the co. they have trusted to fill that prescription? The shift manager at 4:10 PM Tuesday  answer  was to call the doctor and get a new prescription sent to another store. I guess he doesn't  realize how difficult  it is to get intouch  with a doctor and a doctor at that time of day. Wouldn't  you think that the owner of this pathetic excuse  for a pharmacy would have had an emergency  plan in plan? We have been dealing with this Virus  for many months and a company this large should have a disaster plan in plan for just this type  of scenario. Pathetic. Everyone of my friends  has had a horrible  experience  with this store. We are going to flood the social media sources and expose  this company for who they are. They care nothing about the people  that keep them in business it's  all about money to this owner. Would you not think that they would close the whole store if someone  tested positive for COVID-19 I mean do they think that the virus decides to stay in one area of the store. Do they think that people  don't  go in there and touch products  before they go to the pharmacy. Just an example the bottom  line is money not care. Even Sonic  hamburger restaurant in Leeds Al. closed completely when one of it's employees tested positive and they sell burgers. The Walgreens in Leeds Al. Is absolutely  the worst pharmacy  in Leeds. You would think if they cared they would have had a disaster plan in place and they could have contacted all patrons that have life sustaining medications of the situation and where they could pick up their medication. There are many other drug stores  in Leeds and the surrounding area. I encourage  everyone who has had a dangerous experience with this co.to stop using  them and contact the head office.

I have been a loyal Walgreens customer for at least 20 years, and have used Walgreens on the east coast, the west coast, and in between.  I\u2019ve never had any issues with any other Walgreens as I have at this store.\n\nTo begin with, I\u2019ve experienced phone wait times for up to an hour.  I just gave up on calling\u2026I go directly to the pharmacy and wait to speak to the pharmacist.  I take a lot of meds, and there are times I have to personally request the pharmacy to fill certain prescriptions, as Walgreens online won\u2019t allow me to electronically file certain scripts. Luckily I\u2019m not far from the pharmacy, and driving over is no big deal for me. If you need to talk to someone in the pharmacy, just save yourself the frustration of calling.\n\nI used to be a Job Coach, so I didn\u2019t just want to hate this pharmacy\u2026I wanted to understand what the problem was (is).  The problem is, they are always extremely busy, and maybe understaffed.  There have been times I have visited the store when there were at least 15 cars in line for the pharmacy; the line being wrapped around the building.  In addition there were also times where there were up to 10 people in line at the pharmacy.   I\u2019ve sat and watched the employees working, and they are all working like crazy.  Nobody is on their phones, no one is standing around talking\u2026they all seem to be working just as hard as they can.  In addition, I\u2019ve always been treated with the level of kindness and professionalism that made me a loyal Walgreens customer many years ago. When I\u2019ve been there I\u2019ve heard the phone ringing constantly.  But In the pharmacy employees\u2019 defense\u2026they are so overwhelmed with customers in the store, no one has time to answer the phones.\n\nWalgreens, if this pharmacy is understaffed, help them find some more employees!  There are a ton of people who depend upon this pharmacy for their medications.  Help this pharmacy to be better!\n\nSincerely, an extremely loyal Walgreens customer.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccea8b57332c1:0xcebb8fff287cdf42"}

She would not provide services while being videoed.

When it came time for me to receive my shot she looked at me like I was crazy for jumping away from the needle and crying.\nI DONT LIKE NEEDLES WHY DO YOU THINK I WAS RECORDING.\nMy arm was sore for days after the shot, which was probably my own doing for tensing up but she did nothing to even console her \"patient\". Not knowing much about HIPAA I went and asked some of my nursing friends and a phlebotomist I went to school with if there was a passage in HIPAA about a provider refusing service because of privacy on camera and both said no I even followed up on it by looking up HIPAA.

I want to save someone else from spending money they don\u2019t have.\nDisclaimer: This isn\u2019t to \u201cbash\u201d but to literally to bring awareness to customers about the fraud of this shop.\n\nOn 1/30/21 I went to the Weave Zone in Huntsville,AL to purchase hair for graduation pictures. Graduation is something that I looked forward to because I\u2019ve worked so hard and endured a lot along this journey so I decided to celebrate by taking pictures with a certain look. The look I was going for requires deepwave hair.\nI purchased 4 bundles and spent a total of over $300.00. A day later I ran my fingers through one bundle and it was completely nappy and tangled. (Pictures will be attached)...\n\nThey gave me the run around and of course rude customer service but I\u2019m from New York so that little attitude they gave didn\u2019t phase me at all. I\u2019m used to that.\nThey eventually exchanged it and I went about my way.\nNow it\u2019s time to wash the hair ....\nI do hair and have been using bundle hair for years. The pattern completely dropped and ended up looking like straight hair.\nI called the Weave zone and not to my surprise, they refused to compensate me or exchange my hair just because they exchanged a bad bundle. Keep in mind, all these issues were THEIR FAULT! Lol anyway...\nAs I said, no need to be disrespectful towards them in this review because I\u2019ll let the pictures speak for themselves.\nIn closing, ladies , I\u2019m sure you\u2019re reading this review because you are contemplating spending your hard earned money in order to do something nice for yourself. Please go elsewhere, I highly advise it.\nAm I disappointed? Highly. No one has 300 dollars sitting around but I strongly believe that when you\u2019re dishonest, you won\u2019t prosper. The weave zone isn\u2019t exempt from that principle. Have a blessed day ladies!\n\nEDIT/(2/7/21)\n\nOk let me blast you really quick... first of all, there was no harsh chemical. It\u2019s a rinse where you put the NON-TOXIC RINSE, NOT A DYE, on the hair and simply wash it out. (I\u2019ll attach pictures). Everyone knows what a rinse is. Secondly, as I showed your associate, the left bundle with the red rubber band WAS NOT RINSED!! So how do you explain that??? The crunchy bundle I exchanged was also not touched hence why it was exchanged.\nMy point is, the hair you gave me was NOT DEEP WAVE!!! Does that look like deep wave to you? Cut the foolishness. Your hair is trash and I stand by what I said. All proof is provided. How do you over process a non chemical rinse? Go back and look at the picture with the bundle in the red rubber band that wasn\u2019t touched. You\u2019re still going to tell me that\u2019s a deepwave pattern? You\u2019re missing the point of my review. My point is, that is NOT deepwave hair!!!!

The hair was BEAUTIFUL, until shampooed on 3/17/19 with Tresemme products, and immediately lost all curl pattern. I was the only one in the wedding party with straight hair, and the bride was so disappointed because that was not the look agreed upon. Nevertheless, after speaking with the owner, Tony, who agreed that should not have happened to the hair, and texting him the requested pictures and receipt, I didn't hear back from him. Perplexed, I called the next day, and Tony placed me on hold for 23 minutes! Giving the business the ultimate benefit of the doubt, I waited and called again the next day. Tony was unavailable, but Keyshonna (sp?) told me she had seen the texts from me, and to bring in the hair, along with the receipt, for replacement hair. She told me to call before coming into the store. I could not make it HSV soon, so I called to inform them.  Tony and Keyshonna were unavailable when I called, but I spoke to Lawrence, who kept telling me to call back because they were moving. In anticipation of miscommunication, I texted after each call, just to make sure! Days later, I get to speak to Lawrence, and he finally speaks to Keyshonna about the issue, who remembered me from bringing up the wedding. They discussed it, and informed me that Tony doesn't remember me, and they won't replace or refund the purchase, since it was worn - which all parties knew based on 1) the pictures sent and 2) each text and 3) each conversation!\n\nAs a consumer, I legit waited weeks and several calls and texts to attempt to fix the issue. It hurts me to even have to write this review, and to announce the customer service practices of this business. However, they made it extremely hard to ignore.

I have always been treated professionally and got very timely service at that store.  One day last week they were out of one of my meds so they called this Walgreens at Gardendale as I happened to be in that area; they had it so I went by to pick it up.  The whole staff in the pharmacy treated me horrible.  Beginning with totally ignoring me when I stood at the counter for several minutes with 5-6 people working in there and no one but me at the counter!  When some one finally did wait on me, my med was not ready; before all the ugliness was over they had kept me in there for over an hour while they waited on around 10-12 other customers not counting the drive thru!  Much more was said and went on towards me that was not professional nor was I treated fairly, however, I have already written a book and can not say it all here so I will write headquarters.  I did nothing nor said anything to them at first to deserve this treatment; but the more they pushed my buttons the more I got upset.  I still held myself back to what a lot of folks would have done.  This happened on the day crew July 5, 2017.

One of the technicians here stole half of my prescriptions. Now, I'm from out of town and this was my first and last time using this Walgreens. I went on a Thursday evening, and dropped off my prescriptions, then I went out to dinner. Afterwards I came back to Walgreens, there was a brunette at the register who was rude. I thought, she must be tired because she didn't look too good. I paid for my medication and walked out of the pharmacy. I went back to my place and noticed half the prescription was missing! I thought that's strange half my medication is missing and I just left the pharmacy that's never happened before, so I assumed it was probably a mistake.  When I finally got in contact with the pharmacy, I explained what happened and a woman responded saying she needed to check their records. After a few seconds she comes back on the line to tell me their counts for the prescriptions were accurate and she couldn't do anything about it. I said, I will come up there with the prescription bottles to discuss this! Then she proceeds to tell me she's the Pharmacy's Manager. At this point, I was getting upset! I told her this pharmacy charged me FULL price for a months supply of prescriptions then only gave me half of it. I told her, I had to pay out of pocket for this and I want to be reimbursed.  She continued to say there's nothing she could do.  Well, that's just too bad, because for a \"Manager\" not to even attempt to investigate  problems when a customer is genuinely upset and telling the truth about a bad experience just baffles me. Why isn't this manager more concerned that a technician took someone elses medicine from the pharmacy's safe and then falsifed records to get away with it?! She's kept saying there's nothing she could do. Really?! Why don't you fire the employee, so this doesn't happen again.

I take one prescription a month which is a schedule three or four narcotic I believe. I go to my doctor and he writes my new prescription every 28 days. I take two a day which equals 56. I drive almost two hours to this doctor and live in a rural area that never has this medicine so I always stop at this Walgreens and every time they tell me they can\u2019t fill it until the next day or I have to wait two days even tho my doctor schedules my next appointment on the exact day my medicine runs out. For example I got my prescription filled there last month on 2/5/20. Went yesterday after my appointment to fill my script for this month which ran out yesterday. Waited in traffic and in line for over 20 minutes only for the cashier to tell me she can\u2019t fill it until tommorow. I didn\u2019t even waste my time explaining to her that I couldn\u2019t turn around and drive two more hours again the next day or that my medicine ran out yesterday so technically I could have gotten it filled two days early as per the narcotic laws. I\u2019m not sure if she dosent pay attention to the quantity and counts thirty days or she just dosent care to actually read the directions on the prescription. This is also a medicine that if I don\u2019t take it causes extreme withdrawals so I ended up having to drive 30 plus miles out of my way and wait two to three days for another pharmacy to fill it. Got home and called and asked them via the phone if I was eligible to get it filled yesterday and the lady said yes. Needless to say these people don\u2019t understand that some of these medicines are people\u2019s lifeline and they don\u2019t understand the danger and inconvenience of having to drive all around the country and risk your health all because they can\u2019t take twenty seconds to read a prescription look up last day it was filled and count 28 days. Drove 30 miles to another pharmacy keep in mind another WALGREENS pharmacy and they told me I could have gotten it filled Sunday. Done with Taylor road. They also charge me(no insurance same medicine and same amount every month never changes) anywhere from 180$-300$ went to another Walgreens paid 112$ explain that.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2b7c001e262d:0xf87a74a409f34f7c"}

I tutored/ taught organic chemistry when I was an undergrad and have had many arguments with them over medication. I have had them get my dosages wrong many times (telling me to take to much). On top of this many times they treated me like I was a criminal for trying to get medicines with no street value. Other times those medicines that did have street value, were handed over to me like candy. Some of the employees also were not aware of basic pharmacy policy, upon which I had to remind them of. Needless to say many of them can be rude when you question there blatant incompetence.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: go during peak hours. Know what and how much to take. Then double check when you get home.

The turnover is high which is bad enough but they will cancel your appointment at the last minute and then when I came in for my new rescheduled appointment I wasn\u2019t even acknowledged by the receptionists. Yes plural because there was 2.  The usual receptionist knows me by face so I guess I didn\u2019t think nothing of it when those two said nothing to me since they seemed preoccupied...one with another customer and the other took a call on her cell and stepped away. I waited 30 mins to find out that my rescheduled appointment needed to be cancelled because the tech had a family emergency and she left. Walked right pass me!  I finally got to my breaking point and acknowledged the 2 ladies and they had no excuses that made any sense. One of them said she thought I was someone else so I guess we all look alike to her but ok and the other one said with all honesty she simply said you are right we said nothing to you. She was the one who took the call on her cell. Ok so the only wax tech that was still there had I guess turned her wax up and said she could wax me but I needed to give her wax time to cool or I could reschedule again. I opted to wait another 15 mins to let it cool. I must say she was good and this my first time with her but she was actually super nice and I apologized for getting rowdy to her that is just how good she was. As I was leaving the 2 ladies in the front wanted to offer me something for my inconvenience but I got prepaid wax passes so there no credit that could be given so they opted to give me samples which I took cause no one has ever given me samples at this place. It\u2019s sample though so I dunno if that is something spectacular. I asked for a number for management and they said that the manager would have to call me. That\u2019s been a month ago and no call but my $121 pre paid wax pass payment just hit my card again today.  I see that isn\u2019t being rescheduled!  So I said all this to say I might be calling the number and asking for a manager again and getting funds reversed because I can not keep coming to a sinking ship.

Awkward ...overpriced and unsure of the experience of the technician (this place charges twice the going rate in our area and the service is not half as good as the other places!)\n\nWhen I arrived the check in process was a little intrusive. The girl at the front desk wanted to see my driver\u2019s license? I\u2019ve been to several spas and had many waxes and never have been asked for a copy of my drivers license. That seems a little extreme for a spa service? But okay. I go to the restroom before my appt starts and when I\u2019m walking back to the waiting area someone calls out my name from a room ..It was my technician (first visit at this place and don\u2019t remember her name)? I felt like that was forward (but not so much so that it ruined the appt). However, then I step into my room and the technician tells me to undress from the waist down that she will do my brows first then my Brazillian ?!? So I don\u2019t have a choice in this and have to lay there EXPOSED while my brows are being done?!? Not only that she didn\u2019t go anywhere! She did not leave the room for me to undress and just stayed in there!?! That\u2019s not typical. Every place I\u2019ve ever been (and I\u2019ve been to many saloons and spas) has always left me in the room to undress then they would come in. More so  than that I\u2019m usually given something to cover up with until the service is needed in that area (unless it\u2019s just a Brazillian that we go straight to). I did not like that!! It was strange and the technician didn\u2019t say a word while she was working which makes things even more awkward!! Oh except for the \u201cshave shaming\u201d as if that\u2019s the reason for the horrible pain that I feel when my hair is being ripped out of my skin around my pubic bone! Lol ?!? So the technician had a dry personality (looking back she seemed weird) ..I had to lay on the table exposed while my brows were getting done first (I didn\u2019t have a choice in that or wasn\u2019t told I did). Also, she stays in the room while I change!!! And when it\u2019s over she stays in the room waiting for me to get dressed!! There was absolutely no concern for privacy or customary respect and boundaries. I much prefer the other place that I go (Marci\u2019s Hoover). The prices are better. The experience isn\u2019t creepy weird or demeaning and my technician is friendly and speaks!\n\nOh and heads up anyone who gets a brow wax, the technician removed all of my make up then waxed my brows! I told her that I prefer that she just get the strays outside of my make up. My brows are thinning and I have a particular shape that I prefer! That was not respected at all!! There is NO need to remove the make up first of all. (That\u2019s just some personal preference of the technician). That should be the clients choice! We should be able to change without someone watching us when we arrive and before we leave!! There\u2019s no way this place will stay around much longer if things don\u2019t change! Why would anyone continue to pay twice the price for a worse experience!? It\u2019s a strip mall wax place just like Marci\u2019s ..only they advertise like it\u2019s some type of luxury saloon. It\u2019s not..thank goodness they didn\u2019t try to sell me products or some membership. I hate it when I\u2019m paying for a service and still being subjected to high pressure sales. So that is a bonus. To add to the bad experience my wax took close to 30 minutes! It\u2019s never taken that long anywhere else. I don\u2019t think the technician was very experienced. I also felt it was a little creepy that she didn\u2019t say much at all but that she just stays in the room while I\u2019m changing out and back into my clothes. When I was leaving I felt rushed, she was standing with her hand in the door watching me put my shoes on!! I felt rushed cuz her next appt was there! I mean give a a girl some space!\n\nTo the management: you need to take note of the things I\u2019ve said.

The staff at the pharmacy informed me to call my insurance and make sure something was not incorrect and were very patient while I did so. This was all happening at the end of their shift. The new co-pay was the correct amount and luckily my family was able to help cover the cost. Fast forward to a few days later and I received a phone call from Walgreens patient care. The pharmacy staff had contacted them on my behalf to enroll me in to a co-pay assistance program through the medication manufacture. The new total monthly cost would be $20! They also applied the discount to the original refill and I was able to give my family back the money I had borrowed to cover the medication. I am truly thankful to the staff at the Fort Payne, AL location for all the help and kindness they showed an out-of-towner.

After spending years going to different salons getting mediocre results I tried this one out and I haven\u2019t been disappointed yet with my results. I have had some not so great experiences with the ladies at the front counter but I think that stems from my very first visit with them not setting clear expectations. In the beginning I was told that walk ins are welcomed but appointments are recommended. The 2 times I have had to do a walk in I\u2019ve been turned down. Today I had a 11 o\u2019clock appointment and came in at 9 hoping to get in early because I had to go out of town. I was willing to wait and it was a quick wax (less than 10 mins)  so I was disappointed to hear that it wasn\u2019t possible when I come every 2 weeks at minimal. So I canceled my appointment I had for 11. After thinking it over Jessica is the reason I decided to come back. I would really like to get the wax passes which saves alot of money but I\u2019m afraid how the customer service will be after purchasing.

I moved from PA a year ago and was sad when I found out it wasn\u2019t here initially.\nI\u2019m a stickler on customer service and let me tell you that these ladies did not disappoint!!!!\nMiya is a doll! She was so pleasant and professional and I could hear her smile in her voice. She explained the wax passes thoroughly and made sure I got the best deal. She greeted me as soon as I walked thru the door which is also a big plus for me. She checked me in quickly and before I could even sit down, Hailey was calling my name to come back (talk about being on time!!!!) This was the quickest and most thorough wax I\u2019ve had since moving here a year ago! In that short amount of time, we talked about everything under the sun, and I felt like I had been knowing her for years. She is officially my new waxer! I\u2019m already booked for my next appointment and I will be sure to send other customers your way! Thank you ladies!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1620675522633, "text": "Hi Audrey.

I did tie it down everyday. Didn\u2019t exercise. The ponytail broke in half after 3 days and the swoop moved everyday. The stylist Kierra put glue all over the bundle so, I can\u2019t reuse it.

This Fenty foundation was the first thing I have purchased from this location in years so I knew for a fact that I didn\u2019t buy it and just forgot. It also showed that I \u201cbought\u201d this right around the time when I actually got the Fenty foundation. The cashier rang up the wrong item when she checked it out now I am unable to make any returns or exchanges with this item and was basically told there\u2019s nothing they could do because it\u2019s not the product that\u2019s on the receipt. Now I\u2019m stuck with a 40 dollar foundation that I cannot wear because the cashier made a mistake.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a430e3c99ce71:0x85d8dc99394fe886"}

I finally asked if there was a comparable brand, she did bring some from 1 other collection but it was not the same coverage. My daughter finally suggested swatching my old one (which I had with me, although broken) on my wrist and then the new KatVonDee's to see which was the closest. That worked and I made the exchange.

I have had just a few minor negative experiences during this time. Most of the time I was comfortable with the service. Today was a different story. I called about an hour before they closed to finalize 2 scrip. orders. I called at this time because I had tried several times in the past week and today to get thru to someone on the phone, but had too long of a hold time each time. I thought it might be less busy at 7pm. The woman who answered, who I believe was the pharmacist on duty, had a disrespectful tone a couple of times during the call. I mentally excused her then drove to pick up my orders almost immediately. When I arrived the assistant, who was one of the distasteful encounters I've witnessed in the past, was working the drive thru. I told her I needed the pills cut in the required dose which I'd gotten done many times before without problems. It usually doesn't take very long to do as well. I went to wait across the lot when I saw a multitude of cars arriving at the drive thru right before closing time. 15 or so minutes had elapsed and it was closing time by that time so I decided to drive back over to the window to pick up my meds. When I arrived the tech ignored me for about a minute or 2 and then she mouthed something to me without the microphone and immediately walked away out of my sight. I could not make out what she said, of course. I continued to wait patiently. Within that time the pharmacist walked over and in a scolding tone told me to tell her ahead of time I needed them cut. I informed her I did not because I was informed in the past not to do that because I must pay for them before they are cut. She then continued her scolding by telling me \"Well it's just so late.\" Omg...are you not still open for business when I arrived 15 to 20 minutes prior? And it doesn't take that long to cut them. And I would of done it sooner if I could of gotten someone on the telephone without a long hold time every time I called! That response was rude, unprofessional and unfair and I did nothing wrong. How dare her and that tech or whatever she is treat a good customer this way. I have always been fair and courteous to the staff. I have already found another pharmacy and will pull my business out of there tomorrow.

I went back 3 days later and they didn't have them and they hadn't been ordered.  People at the counter where trying to be helpful, but the Pharmacist clearly didn't care.  No, \"I'm sorry\", no engagement at all.  They finally told me they would order and to come back in two days.  I went back in 3 days later.  The pills are now in stock, but nobody had filled the remainder of my prescription and the system was still showing that it was completed.  The person working the counter was helpful and apologetic, but when the Pharmacist came back, she said \"we don't manufacture the pills, so it's not out fault\".  She obviously missed the training for customer service.  This was the fourth time I was told the prescription would be filled and it still wasn't done.

It's a pharmacy, first and foremost in the business to take care of a patient's needs by filling doctor prescribed medication for sick people. That alone should mean the employees will be kind, considerate, and have the patient's best interest at heart, which requires a certain level of customer service skills. I can honestly say, this is by far the WORST customer service experience I've ever had, in ANY industry! From the pharmacist herself to the tech working the counter, they are the rudest people I've encountered! My particular issue began with a refill which I called in back in August. Once I received a text that it was ready for pickup, I drove over to collect it, only to be told once I got there that the RX was not ready and the drug was not in stock. The tech argued with me about being notified that it was ready until I showed her the text message and then she had nothing to say. I was then told they would call me when the drug was back in stock and my RX had been filled. Three weeks went by and no word so I drove back over to check on it. This time, I spoke with the pharmacist who literally could not be bothered with my questions about when I might be able to get my prescription. She said it was ordered from the 'warehouse' and that they would call me when it came in but if I didn't want to wait, I could go somewhere else and get them to transfer the RX. I opted to wait. Huge mistake! Yesterday, while picking up 2 other prescriptions, I inquired about my refill on backorder. I explained everything that had taken place thus far to the tech and gave her my previous RX bottle for informational purposes. She checked on the computer and said 'this RX has already been filled.' And so I say to her, no, as I so painstakingly explained, it was never filled because you were out of the drug and could not fill it and I've been waiting for you guys to call me when it came in. Immediately she became combative! Then she tells me that, yes, they have the drug in now, BUT, I can't have it because 'oh look, this refill expired a few weeks ago.' Umm. No, it didn't 'expire,' it's been in your system awaiting the restock of the drug! She very rudely tells me that I'll have to go see my dr (and pay the $30 copay,) and obtain a new prescription. What? I'm in disbelief at this point. And when I asked if she heard any of what I had said to her previously, she began talking over me saying it's not their fault because they're all new and training and learning the rules and I'm out of luck! And that she would be happy if I took my prescriptions elsewhere! DONE! Not to worry! WALGREEN'S will never get my business again for anything!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886213531c24638b:0xa635a2eff497a769"}
