Having our current home inspected before we put it on the market was the best thing we could have done. We were able to completely have the house ready for its inspection and it passed with flying colors.  Then, of course, we used Ron and his team on the house we are purchasing. He was able to point out a few things and explain to us what they were, why they were important, and what was needed to resolve the problems. He was very informative and explained everything to us during our walkthrough. He let us know what were safety issues and what were just routine maintenance items. Thanks to his attention to detail and his keen eye, we were able to get the seller to resolve several minor issues and a couple of safety issues before we move in. My wife and I feel much better now knowing Ron has looked at our new house and given us a report that is both very thorough and detailed, but also very easy to decipher.

On the day of the home inspection Mr. Blair arrived a few minutes before the time he said he'd be there, he came equipped with every tool of the trade to include the drone and even the under the house remote controlled car with camera since it was a tight crawlspace. Mr. Blair spent several hours on site in the brutal August heat and never complained one time, he was very diligent in his work and very knowledgeable. I've had numerous home inspections done over my lifetime and Mr. Blair is the best I've ever hired.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c0bbb5568eaa5:0x7632e4fe494b3d56"}

Of course it was found to be extremely poorly built and rotted. The estimate to repair/replace is $9,300.00.\n\nI haven't found a single GFCI that functions properly in the home. None were noted in the inspection report.\n\nSo far I've found 3 leaking faucets that required new Pex fittings in order to repair.\n\nThere are some buried extension cords around the exterior of the house clearly being used as permanent electrical supply sources.

Second spraying comes around and same thing- earwigs inside every day. This time when we contacted them (2 weeks ago), they ignored us. They also didn't call when they came to spray the second time so if hadn't been home, he wouldn't have been able to get inside or in the backyard.

I live out of state, but used them for my second home in AL.  I specifically asked them from the beginning to put my primary out-of-state home address as the billing contact.  For years, they would conduct the service and send the bill to my primary address out of state.  I always immediately paid for their services via credit card over the phone.  For my annual ant and terminate inspections this year, I just happen to call them to schedule things, and they said, \"we closed your account because of failure to make a payment.\"  ???  I told them I never received a bill nor knew there was an outstanding balance.  I asked what the billing address was...never got a straight answer.  Eventually, the phone representative admitted to the possibility that Bama may have sent it to the AL home where the service was being performed.  Also not true, because my mom lives there and sends me all bills that come to the house.  The phone rep even had the nerve to say \"we were sending the account to collections.\"  I never even knew there was a bill due!  And they obviously make no attempts on their end to keep in touch with the customer.  That was issue No. 1.  Nonetheless, I immediately paid the outstanding balance and that issue was resolved, despite Bama's sloppiness and failure to communicate.\n\nIssue No 2., they have an absolutely unconscionable provision in their agreement that says something to the effect of, \"Customer must give 30 days written notice before getting out the the Agreement.\"  The very next sentence in the Agreement says, \"Bama may cancel the contact without notice at any time for any reason.\"  What?!\n\nBesides the fact that such a provision would never hold up in court if there ever were a dispute, it is a completely onerous clause.  They're not selling gold, they spraying chemicals on the ground, for goodness sake.  No need for such an unfair clause.  I asked the representative for a reason for such an unfair clause.  She responded something to the effect of, \"we need that in there for customers who don't pay.\"  What????  Well, in my opinion, such language is waaaay over broad for such a limited scenario as nonpayment.  Anyway, I refused to agree to it, Bama Exterminating refused to change or delete it, and we parted ways.  I signed up the same day with their competitor, who actually ended up being cheaper...and more organized as well.  I have been happy so far.\n\nThere is a fine line between a mom and pop operation and a sloppy operation.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888603267877fefd:0x2a05ac8851bf106c"}

In my case, they made several mistakes and refused to admit to or even rectify their own mistakes.  I purchased my home four years ago and it came with a termite bond with Bama Exterminating.  This year (2014) they mailed me a contract to sign regarding that termite bond with dates listed from 2012 to 2014.  In essence, because they made a mistake and did not have me sign a contract when I purchased the home, they were trying to get me to agree to terms for the previous years to cover themselves legally while disregarding the legal issues for the customer.\nI called their office manager, Kim Ousley, to inquire about this contract and she was unable to explain why I was receiving this contract four years after the home purchase and why the contract had a start date listed as 2012.  After getting frustrated with my questioning and being unable to answer the questions posed to her, she hung up the phone.\nThen, I spoke with another employee, Mr. Bridges, who did manage to explain at least why I was receiving this contract at the time I did.  However, he did not see any issue with me agreeing to terms, in writing, that were two years in the past.  He also did not see any issue with Ms. Ousley's behavior even though she was unable to explain their contract and hung up on a customer after getting flustered.\nSo, there are a serious of problems here that are all the mistake of Bama Exterminating and the company refused to rectify their mistake.  First, they should obtain a new contract when homes are sold for the new owner.  They failed to do that in my case.  When they realized their mistake (in 2012), they continued to let the contract go unsigned.  In 2014, they mailed a letter and a contract dated for 2012.  In the letter they stated they could not renew my termite bond UNLESS I signed the back-dated contract.  This seems reasonable except the mistake was on their end and I shouldn't be required to sign things I am uncomfortable signing and they refused to fix it.  I offered to sign a current contract but they would not do that unless I signed the back-dated one.  Finally, the way the office manager, Ms. Ousley, handled the call was unfortunate.  If she did not have the proper information or could not communicate effectively with the customer, she should have found someone else to help rather than hang up the phone on a long-term customer.\nIn sum, there were multiple errors made this company and even after I offered to sign a current contract, they refused to fix their mistake or even take responsibility.  I would not recommend doing business with this company until they refine their business practices.  There are many more companies that offer the same type of services and will offer better customer service.\n\n***Update - I hired their competitor for half the cost yearly and I would suggest doing that.  From what I have learned about pest control, Bama Exterminating is using older bait stations which is why they need to come service them four times a year.  Companies that use more modern equipment are lower cost because the stations need to be serviced less often.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888603267877fefd:0x2a05ac8851bf106c"}

Basically, the foundation of the house was in such a state, he didn't want to us to spend money on him looking at all the little nooks and crannies when the house had so many big expensive issues that he could inspect with the lower level inspection. I met them at the house and they were so helpful and kind, walking me through all the different areas and explaining/describing potential problem areas. I learned so much and was so grateful for them! I also asked for tips as we continue house-hunting so we would not proceed on any houses with obvious structural issues.

Unfortunately only my wife could make part of the inspection as I could not due to work demands after the hurricane. Mr. Wesley made me feel like I was there and explained the concerns to me as if they were his own. Our transaction broker suggested that we not be \"nit picky\" so the deal would go through. With Mr. Wesley's help, we were able to find the issues that we would not, and could not budge on. I strongly recommend him to anyone based on our experience. He even took time out of his Saturday during the half time show to go over the report in more detail with me.

I had wondered about whether a particular wall had wallpaper or paint on it and as the very kind person Wesley is he took the time away from what he was doing to take covers off outlets and determined the walls were in fact painted and then discussed with me the best way to cover the existing paint job.  This was above and beyond what he came there to do.  This is just one example, there were a couple more times during the inspection where he stopped and offered his expert opinion on things.  The inspection he did was very thorough.  I could not be more pleased.  He was extremely honest with his findings and I 100% trust his judgement and advice.

Although the \"New Home\" warranty was no longer valid, Steve walked us through the process of contacting the builder and made himself available when the builder's representative arrived to conduct their inspection to determine culpability.

My only concern with the home was the wiring since it was built in 1967. I specifically asked him to check the branch wiring to insure that it was copper, which he did and he assured me that all branch wiring was copper and recently updated. Fast forward 2 1/2 months and we have an electrician out for some faulty plugs who informs us that our ENTIRE house is wired with ALUMINUM.\n\nThis was caught within their \"iron-clad 120 day assurance guarantee\" so we contacted Darrell immediately. He and my husband had a good, long phone conversation and he admitted that he goofed this one up and had already contacted his insurance adjuster to come out to our house for an estimate as he was going to cover the rewiring of our home.\n\nThree weeks go by and we hadn't heard from any insurance adjuster or updates from Darrell so we contact Darrell again to follow up. His response was that the insurance adjusters and underwriters were probably very busy because of the hurricanes. (this was after Harvey and Irma)\n\nThree months go by without a word from Darrell after several attempts to reach him. We were advised by our realtor to contact the corporate office after her failed attempts to reach him as well. We were contacted pretty quickly by someone in corporate to hear us out. After she got into contact with Darrell he said he did not recollect a conversation with me about wiring at the initial inspection and he did not recollect a conversation with my husband about rectifying his mistake.\n\nDarrell Clark is a liar and a sub par home inspector. We probably would have walked away from the purchase of our home had he not mistaken ALUMINUM wiring for copper.

The home was inspected in May by Jones-Warren Home Inspection Services. I just recently entered the attic to address some minor HVAC issues and immediately observed large amounts of unusual debris on the white insulation. This debris turned out to be nut shells, seed husks, and animal droppings. Further examination revealed a rat trap, an adhesive trap, extensive amounts of animal droppings. I then found the carcass of squirrel. When I reached out the CEO, Meredith Warren, she replied dismissing any responsibility and giving reasons why. I replied stating to her I could show her how glaringly obvious the infestation was and prove the infestation existed when the home was inspected. I invited her to come and take a look for herself. She never replied. I did a lot of research in this matter because I know a home inspection can\u2019t reveal everything. But one thing that became clear to me is that a trained inspector should be particularly on the lookout for safety and health related issues so a potential buyer can make an informed decision. How he missed the signs of a squirrel infestation four feet away from his vantage point is beyond me.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1564250641979, "text": "Hi Fred, we understand that you believe that a squirrel infestation was existing at the time of the inspection even though it was wasn\u2019t discovered until 2.5 months after the inspection had been performed. We take any claims of missed items extremely seriously and  did not dismiss your claims out of hand. After we reviewed your inspection report,  we sent you the photos of the attic from the report with about 6-8 different comprehensive overviews of the attic from the inspection that look nothing like what you sent us in your email. You emailed back stating that you wouldn\u2019t send us the obvious proof you have. Why would you refuse to send it? This is a reasonable and logical request most people and businesses being accused of missing something would make. At this time, we do not feel it would be prudent to come to your home when you\u2019re  already extremely confrontational and angry when you could simply send us the proof you say you have to clear this to up right now."}, "gmap_id": "0x888919d583b7defb:0xfffd54b2017f89e4"}

I showed him the cracks since he didnt pick them up on his own and he said nothing to worry about. Well he was wrong as I found out a month after we moved in. The worst part is once they found out thru my realtor I was not happy. They had some you guy call me who wanted to argue about what they are really supposed to do and not do. He actually told me they did not represent the buyers that they were neutral. When I told him I paid the fee and they worked for me the buyer and I was done arguing. The little man hung up on me.

A genuine apology would have been the professional thing to do and I would have been happy to update my review at that point.\n\nI had forgotten to post this until they sent me an email this weekend. I got a home inspection with them in July 2016 and ran into quite a few problems.\n-After reviewing the inspection received on July 13, I noticed that no true roof inspection was actually done. The report stated that all the inspector did was look at the roof from the ground with binoculars. This is in contradiction to what Jones-Warren assures will be completed in one of their inspections. They even say on this Facebook page that they \"get on every roof no matter how steep\". I made Allen aware of this via email.\n-Due to concern over the inspection, my Uncle drove 9 hours up from Florida for us to do a second inspection. We found multiple items that the inspector didn't find (half the windows in the home not working properly, attic fan not functioning) and even that some of the items he found were more severe than he had stated (back door didn't need repair-had to be replaced).\n-A few days after this, the seller's agent contacted mine to accuse me of sending my Uncle back to their home without a proper request (he had been back in FL for days). Someone had gone to their home and knocked on their door asking to get on their roof. I later found out this was Allen Warren when he called me to discuss my dissatisfaction. He stated his intention was to test to see if the inspector's ladder had been tall enough for him to get on the roof. While I appreciated the research, it was very unprofessional for him to go there unannounced and caused a ton of animosity between all parties involved.\n-As stated above, Allen did call me to discuss the issues and originally seemed very genuine that they fully intended to rectify the situation. He said that the other owner would be giving me a call later that day to get more details and work out a resolution. I never received any further contact from either of them, even after I emailed Allen a few weeks later (Aug 11) to say I was still waiting on a call.\n-I am very disappointed that I never reviewed a resolution to this after paying the full amount for a thorough home inspection. I'm not sure if they intentionally never got back to me or it simply fell through the cracks, but I definitely would not recommend based on my experience.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888919d583b7defb:0xfffd54b2017f89e4"}

The second type is the \"Blind Inspector\" type who doesn't find anything wrong with any home ever.\nJones-Warren Home Inspections has created a 3rd type of inspection service which is a perfect blend of the middle of the road between \"The Sky Is Falling\" home inspectors and the \"Blind Inspectors\".  Jones-Warren's inspectors do a great job of noting what is wrong with a home and explaining to the buyer what, if any, implications that deficiency in that home may have on their safety, well-being, and enjoyment of that property.\nIn addition to their excellent initial homebuying inspection services, they also will re-inspect the home after the seller has repaired any items that the buyer has requested for the seller of that property to repair.

My complaint is with the scheduling staff and the managers/owners.\n\nI was under the impression I scheduled an inspection for a friday morning. Friday morning rolls around and no inspector. I even had a hardwood specialist with me to inspect at the same time. (We werent allowed in home without inspector per AL law?)  So not only did I not have the inspection done on time, I had to reschedule the hardwood specialist.  When i called friday morning asking where the inspector was, the office staff had no evidence of my request for an appointment. Even though my realtor and the selling realtor both got a confirmation.\n\nOne lady in the office was very helpful and set me up with another appointment. However,  although my inspector was great, it was not who I requested.\n\nAfter having some additional difficulty getting my realtor access to the report, I called the office to file the complaint. I was told by a secrety that the owner told her to tell me that they couldnt do any type of refund because the system wouldn't allow it. The owner never returned my phone calls (yes, more than one call) nor answer emails.\n\nAgain, the inspector was great, but if you want reliable appointment timing and ease of reports etc, don't use this company. A simple call back from the owner/manager with a genuine apology would've been appreciated.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1502306975316, "text": "Hi Mallory, I'm sorry that you felt frustrated with your experience.  When you called us the first time stating that we had missed your appointment, my office staff did notify me and I checked our phone logs (which are from Google Voice and I am the only person who is able to access them) and I also checked our scheduling software as a way to figure out if we had indeed somehow missed your appointment.\n\nOur Google Voice phone records show no calls from your phone number until the day you called us about missing the appointment and there was no information about you in our scheduling system (all appointments that are started, even if they aren't fully scheduled, are saved automatically and can not be permanently erased by anyone other than me).  I do this so that I can monitor what is being done.\n\nI'm sure that you did schedule an appointment with a home inspection company, I just don't believe it was ours.  We do appreciate that you chose to work with us, however, we don't believe this situation called for discounting our services though you requested one several times after you scheduled your appointment.\n\nWe wish you the best of luck with your new home."}, "gmap_id": "0x888919d583b7defb:0xfffd54b2017f89e4"}
