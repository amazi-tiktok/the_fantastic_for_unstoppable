Was so thankful they were open because literally anything else worth eating was closed. We didn\u2019t know this place existed until we happened upon it. So naturally we were thrilled to eat something local, rather than fast food!\nThey got slammed right as we arrived so they struggled a bit to stay on top, but I believe they handled it pretty well and wait time still wasn\u2019t bad! I had the philly chicken and it was delicious! Really greasy but still sooo good. One of my friends had a \u201cseasoned\u201d chicken salad. It was gross. I know having healthier options can be costly but my recommendation is to stick with the sandwiches, or for the owners to do a salad overhaul. A couple got the cheese curds.

I personally have only had to deal with slow service, but that could happen at any time during a rush. The worst stories come from others; I have been around while the building was hosting an added-security event, which required the presence of LEOs; the baristas refused to provide him with a glass of water without charging him. At other foodservice locations in the same building and operated by the same company, not even students are charged for water glasses. That one event does a good job summarizing the apathy and disregard the employees have for their customers. Another critical issue is that this location doesn't accept Starbucks's own rewards program, which is extremely annoying after having signed up for the program just for the convenience of the location being in the same building that I work for.

I was told it could be fixed.\n\nWhile waiting on my sandwich, I noticed the staff watching me and speaking quietly, but I ignored it. 5 minutes later I was called back and when I went to check my sandwich again, I noticed the residue from mayo. It looked as if someone had wiped the mayo off and changed the bread. Again, calmly, I went back up (once again noticing the staff snickering) and asked to speak to the manager for a refund. Said-manager whose name I couldn't get, claimed she was there the whole time they \"remade\" my sandwich and it was fresh. I told her that couldn't be the case because it was now cold, it took her less time to make it than originally and I showed her a piece of lettuce that had mayo in it.\n\nShe then rudely asked me if I still had my receipt, which I did. I was given a refund, but I don't appreciate the way I was treated. If I'm paying for a meal, I expect it to made the way I requested it. I didn't ask them to make me a sandwich befitting God.

When she handed me the drink I thought the color was off but there were a million people there and I was trying to get my family home so I left before tasting the drink (big mistake) when I finally did taste the drink, it was disgusting. It had no sweet flavor. It taste like old coffee with a ton of milk and a hint of caramel syrup, probably just the drizzle she hastily applied after almost putting the whip on top. To sum it up, this was my LAST experience from this previous weekend and I will not be going back to this location again nor the other Eastchase location. Both should be shut down. I do recommend the drive to either the location on Atlanta Highway or Eastern Blvd. I have never had any issue with either of them and the Atlanta highway Starbucks makes the absolute BEST drinks ROUTINELY.

I never have said iced and have always gotten it the way I like it. Then she makes another one and I tell her how it's supposed to be BUT NOPE! Still wrong.

I visited Dreamcakes Cafe with my mother and sister for afternoon tea. It was such a special day for us because we planned afternoon tea right before they accompanied me to shop for my wedding dress! The staff knew this and were so excited, kind, and encouraging.\n\nWe made our tea selections a few days before our event via email. Kallie was wonderful about responding on email. We had to sign a contract prior to the tea and she made it very easy to do so. When we arrived to the cafe, our tea table was set up with everything we needed: teacups, utensils, saucers, even fresh flowers! The set up was stunning and the food was delicious! I highly recommend the pimento cheese sandwich with peach jam and the macarons!!\n\nDuring the tea, the wait staff made us feel so special. Someone was always by to ensure we had everything we needed, refill cups, etc and all of them were SO polite, friendly, and knowledgable about tea selections. My sister had a gluten and dairy allergy and they made sure she knew what she could and couldn't eat and even brought out a special cup of chicken salad for her.\n\nThank you Dreamcakes staff! You made this such a special day for us. The thought and time you put into the details of our tea was noticed and SO appreciated. It was perfect from start to finish. Hope to see yall again soon... we will be back!!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONY-oJn9BWzuTdb2Fi3h6atL79YWPl-U63vkJQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPHHd3s1HgC_MYEB8GlhgLV96Lk0wjV05Aiz7P=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1626716965329, "text": "Thank you so much Erin!

In addition to having just about anything you might find yourself needing while out on a stroll around downtown, or serving jury duty, etc., the staff is incredibly friendly and will (in my experience) go out of their way to ensure your good day.\nHowever, you will be paying convenience store prices for most of their selections: a cup of coffee will only leave you a little better off than a visit to Starbucks (without the carefully constructed flavor--ACoE's coffee has been particularly bitter in my experience, even with sugar and cream), and the food can get a little pricey as well. Packaged foods, on the other hand, seem to be a bit cheaper than, say, the store inside the courthouse but it's not really enough to keep me from driving the little extra distance to the Publix at Twickenham Square.\nThe cozy atmosphere and neat meeting space upstairs, though, may be enough to counter-balance the slightly higher prices and not-so-awesome coffee--and a warm Spring day sat outside with a cold cup of iced tea and a fresh-made sandwich can't quite be beat.\nSo all-in-all, if you don't mind spending a bit more and not getting Starbucks-quality coffee, you will get a cozy, unique atmosphere great for a refreshing time on your own or with friends.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b56a1fd3df7:0xd805f6cc220b76af"}

My boyfriend and I went here for brunch the Saturday of Halloween. Our waitress kept trying to rush us when it came to putting in our order, and she had no sense of warmth or personality. She put our bill on the table before asking us if we would like anythig else and before we had even finished our drinks, then returned literally 20 seconds later and asked if we had put our debit card in the folder yet. When told \"no\", she asked \"oh...well WHY NOT?!!\" In a pushy and rude tone as if we were holding her up. The bar was full, but the restaursnt was dead with no other diners in our section. Another server kept the mimosas flowing and was nice to us. My boyfriend and I have both been servers, so we know the hustle...but none of her attitude was called for. We still tipped well because we are solid human beings, but I feel like she showed us less attention because we are in our mid 20s and that an older couple would've been treated with some respect. Overall, a bizarre experience. I had high hopes, but even the food wasn't anything remarkable. I guess all I can say is that you're taking a risk going here.

My group of 4 sat at the bar, had great service and the food was excellent - specifically the macaroni/cheese special which changed every Saturday.  That was months ago.  So when we went yesterday (Saturday) I was really excited for another great experience.  Not the case.  We sat at a table this time and were again provided slow service and mediocre food.  There is no more Mac/cheese special due to management changes - a huge disappointment for me.  One of my group asked for cheese on her eggs an was informed that they didn't have any cheese.  That they would have to know about it ahead of time because it would have to be grated.  What??  I gave them 2 stars for the bloody mary bar, which I do enjoy.

The kids didn\u2019t get setup and playing until around 1:40 (leaving only an hour to play).  At 2:40 the kids we sent into the party room to eat pizza and open presents.  At 2:50 the guy came in to inform us that we had to be out of there within 10 minutes.  Keep in mind that we paid for 2 hours of playing for the kids and it took 45+ minutes before they all could start playing. The guy that was working informed us that it normally isn\u2019t this troublesome and he wasn\u2019t sure what was wrong  ( we even had a PC crash in the middle of a game within 5 minutes after we finally got it up and running). I will say the only positive to the experience was how nice the staff was but for $275 I expected to at least get an hour and 40 minutes of playing time before eating and we only received maybe an hours worth.

The employee who waited on you didn't want you to be disappointed by turning you (or either of the other two tables that showed up right before closing) away, so she sat you without letting you know the policy. Having experienced the stressful situation that followed, she now understands why we don't seat after 5:45p on Sundays. Your review helps to reinforce why the seating policy is in place, and I really appreciate you bringing your experience to my attention.\n\nAs for the cheese plate, I'm sorry it wasn't explained more fully. I do always present it with an explanation of what is being served, but the barista who waited on you had never presented a charcuterie before and was unsure of what to do.

We have only been open for two weeks, so our staff is still learning the recipes. If you ever get a drink you don't like, you can most definitely have it remade! We are still using the same recipes as the previous cafe, so your drink shouldn't taste different than usual. As for cost, our menu prices are set to be similar to other sit-down cafes and restaurants in the area. The previous cafe that was in our location (Boba Time) went out of business due to their too-low prices that were unable to sustain the costs of operating in Mobile. Like other restaurants in the area, we have set prices that will allow us to keep our doors open. I'd be happy to remake your drink for you whenever you next come in, and I'd appreciate any details you could send me about the staff you interacted with. The vibe should definitely be warm and welcoming! I bought Boba Time because I loved it and did not want to see it disappear, and I truly aim to make Wonderland an amazing cafe!

Took an hour for my friend to receive her banana split dessert.  Despite us asking about it we kept being told \"they're working on it.\"  It's a banana split dessert.  What exactly is there to \"work on\"?\n- Quesadillas underfilled; not much besides cheese (supposed to have steak, peppers, etc)\n- Waitress seemed extremely uncomfortable in her role; she kept making comments about our party as if we were inconveniencing her at her job.  She had a hard time separating our checks despite our party offering to walk up to the register to help her.\n- Our table was served food slower compared to tables that arrived 15-20 mins after us.\n\nHonestly I wish the food and service (both very subpar aside from desserts) matched the emphasis on decor.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb393b79e14f9:0x4b36df30e0221a91"}

I'm sorry to hear that you had a less than ideal experience. I hope you'll reach out to me and let me know what confused you about our restaurant and which meal left you hungry. We do try to keep our portion sizes to a reasonable caloric range that is both filling and healthy, but sometimes we miss the mark. My e-mail is Alice@TheWonderlandCafe.com if you'd like to reach out!\n\nTo address your other comments, yes!, you are correct that our restaurant is geared towards millennials. MIllenials are the generation born between 1980 and 1996, so those between the ages of 21 and 38. That is the generation that my husband and I belong to. There are many restaurants in town aimed at other generations, but as our generation heads towards our 40's you're likely to see many more Millennial-owned establishments springing up. As is the norm in our generation, we do aim to bring a fun, hip, and distinct vibe that you can't find elsewhere in town. If this isn't your thing, we totally understand! Not everyone is going to be feeling the vibe. ;)\n\nAs for the coffee, I will happily concede that if it's a standard cup of hot coffee that you're after, you're definitely better off going to an actual coffee shop, which we are not. I've been going to Carpe Diem and Satori for well over 15 years now, and agree that they're great! Wonderland is a brand new eclectic eatery and Bubble Cafe. We've only been open about a month and a half now! Bubble drinks are definitely a 'millennial thing' and very new to the Mobile Bay Area, but I fell in love with them when I travelled out of state for college in the early 2000's, and I'm thrilled to be able to offer this delicious treat to my home town.\n\nIf the Bubble Cafe part is what was confusing, I can understand that! We've done our best to break down the menu as clearly as possible, but being introduced to an entirely new-to-the-area food concept can put one a bit out of sorts, hence the idea of slipping into Wonderland. Some people find this fun, but I can understand that not everyone is about trying new things on a leap of faith. I hope that if you return, you'll ask your server for some samples and pointers. Bubble samples are always free to newcomers and are helpful if you want to learn about this unique beverage! If you're feeling less adventurous, all of our specialty drinks are pretty much calibrated for complete epicness, so they're an easy place to start- but they're likely not what you're looking for if you're just after a basic cup of joe."}, "gmap_id": "0x889bb393b79e14f9:0x4b36df30e0221a91"}

There is absolutely no mold in the walls. A few days before we took over the lease of the unit, we saw that there was bubbling in the paint on the walls. My husband peeled back the paint and we found a significant amount of mildew through the wall and down into the baseboard, caused by a leak at the neighboring business. We notified the landlord immediately that we could not take over the lease if the issue was not addressed. We took many pictures to document the situation, and sent them to the landlord. The following Monday, the contractor came in, fully sealed of the effected area in tapping with a fan to dry the wall, then removed the entire bottom half of the front west wall from the floor to six feet up. This removed the mildewed area, as well as the two feet above it. The inside of the wall was removed, and affected boards and insulation replaced, with mold block being sprayed in throughout the repair. New drywall was installed, primed, and repainted. I realize that the pictures I took for the landlord to show the original damage are circulating on Facebook, but please take two minutes to think about why they exist. Do you honestly believe that my husband and I ripped a wall partially down, documented the damage, and then paid to have a secretly damaged wall rebuilt? Doesn't it make way, way more sense that we took the pictures to document an issue that needed to be fixed in order to have the matter addressed and remedied by the landlord? Seriously, why else would we have taken so many pictures documenting the damage?\n\nAs far as you saying that I'm showing up at people's houses cursing and screaming, this is also completely falseYes, we have a past employee who was let go of last October and who continues to slandering the business the internet over. Her mother, who she lives with, lives down the street from me. Since this young woman cannot be reasoned with, and has continued to slander me, my family, my employees, and my cafe, I did in fact go over to speak with her mother, who is my neighbor, calmly and matter of factly explaining (mother to mother, neighbor to neighbor) that if her daughter does not stop posting untrue information attempting to ruin my business, I will be filing a lawsuit. I wanted to give her a chance to speak with her daughter about honestly and most definitely how not to react to being let go of by an employer.\n\nThe fact that you have written this  review, believing the absolutely bizarre things this young woman had said about me and my cafe, only further proves her guilt in what is fast approaching a lawsuit, should this harassment continue. Speaking the truth about a business is legal, spreading lies that damage a business's reputation and cause damage to the business is absolutely not.

There are vegetarian options for breakfast such as Avacado Toast and waffles, pancakes and French Toast.  The lunch menu had a veggie sandwich and several salads.\nThe food was homemade with most things locally sourced, which I appreciate.\nI had the Challah French Toast and Hashbrown Casserole.  The casserole was rich and tasty, but the serving was small.  The French Toast was not hot by the time I got it, so I didn't enjoy it as much.\nThere were several hot tea options and I had the peach tea. It is served by the pot,  in very beautiful china. I enjoyed it, but there again it wasn't very hot.\nThe owner was present and very sociable and accommodating.  I feel he will work out some of the kinks with time, as his heart has definitely been put in this place.\nThis is also a small inn.

I've been here twice. First I must say that the people are very friendly and polite. However, the food is honestly just not very good. Nothing anybody had in the two times I've been was that great. The best tasting thing both times was probably the hashbrown casserole side. As another reviewer said, the food is very bland, especially the eggs. The bigger issues though are the portion sizes and the wait times to get your food. Both times, we have been the first people there. Both times, it has taken forever to get the food. We ordered pretty basic breakfast items each time. Very off-putting. On my second visit, I could see other customers who came in after us getting frustrated with the wait time as well. The portion sizes are really small. Like embarrassingly so. It was actually quite annoying/maddening. The fruit was just a couple of very tiny blueberries, strawberries and a sliver of orange in a tiny tea cup. Other sides were crazy small too. The biggest joke was probably the country ham side. It was basically two quarter sized pieces of country ham. I wish I was joking. I was shocked by that. Also, the avocado egg toast entree is ONE piece of toast, I couldn't believe that that was the whole meal. That was incredibly bland too. I left hungry, it really should have been a joke. Nowhere on the menu does it say it is a single piece of toast. In fact, none of the small portions are mentioned anywhere. I will say the taste of the country ham was good, same with the bacon and sausage, but they are so small what does it even matter? It's really a shame, I wanted to like this place a lot. In fact, I was very hesitant to write this review and was planning on going back and trying the pancakes, waffles and lunch, but the more that I think about it, I have no plans to return. It's just not worth it. I honestly have never felt so ripped off by a restaurant. I understand you have to make a profit as my family runs a restaurant too (not even in the same state or same type of food, so not a competitor), but this was just ridiculous.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1618029327989, "text": "Hello Tanner\nThank you for taking the time to write your review.

I gave the lunch special a shot with the Country Fried Steak, Mac n Cheese, Deviled Eggs and Fried Green Tomatoes. They give generous portions for $8.99. Additional sides are only $2.50 and they have slices of pie for $5.\n\nThe steak was a good size and well breaded, mac n cheese was thick and creamy, and the tomatoes were perfectly fried. The deviled eggs contained relish and possibly celery, which provided a nice crunch that paired well with the firmness of the egg white. All the items I tried were well seasoned but they were just a tad too heavy with the salt. The staff is super friendly and the back of house cranks the food out quickly.\n\nAll in all, this is a great spot for a quick bite. My only suggestion would be for them to update this Google listing with a current menu and maybe work on developing a larger online presence.

I ordered the shrimp platter grilled with broccoli for the side. I admit I didn't have very high hopes on the broccoli, I was expecting the typical butter and salt on it you find at most restaurants. However the broccoli was very well seasoned with what maybe have been a cajun type season along with the shrimp which was grilled perfectly. It came with a couple hushpuppies that were also larger then normal and tasted delicious with the shrimp. My dad ordered the fried catfish with fries and coleslaw. He enjoyed the breading and seasoning of it as well. For two meals and one coke it was only about $25 so I find it was decently priced for a home cook style meal.

Especially if it\u2019s glass and surrounded by windows like yours. The handprints make interest disappear immediately. Wash those windows and door glass, I can help you with a professional it you need it. #2. Your floors. Your floors were filthy. Every customer eats seated on your floor. I\u2019m not gonna go into more detail on that, deep clean your floors. #3. The food. For the most part the food is very good! The potato salad has way too much mayonnaise, save yourself money and flavor on that. Also, the fries should be blanched and seasoned if you\u2019re using straight potatoes for a much crispier fry. I can show you how to do that if you need it. The chicken was good I would tell your cook to be more delicate with the Fryer, you want he fry to stay on the chicken! It all fell off. #4 and this is the biggest one because it will DESTROY your business, fights on the floors. I heard loud bickering, fighting, screaming and just a barrage of immaturity from your staff. In between a screaming child who took a fall, girls were literally fighting on the floor. That kills environment and will destroy your investment. This is your investment and one of the few options for the community to have a place to eat clean food. Come on! There is a lot of room for growth here and I hope your restaurant takes advantages of store meetings to discuss how to grow and how everyone can ultimately make more money and serve better food.

The food and coffee is top notch, but what really makes this place special is their mission. All workers are volunteers, so they can give back every cent they make to Auburn\u2019s community. This is a meal you can feel good about, knowing your money is going to something for the greater good. 3. The space. Inside, there are lots of seats and cozy meeting spaces.

He's also constantly working to improve his business and make sure everyone that walks in the door has a great time. He also runs a pretty dope YouTube channel called Nerd Torch TV.\n\nThe store is organized and managed extremely well. There are several rooms dedicated to different types of gaming. There is a room for tabletop games, another for rhythm games like Guitar Hero or DDR, and other rooms dedicated to console games. There's even a PC built for gaming. Multiplayer games are very popular and this is a great place to find people that love to play Smash. I don't think I've ever been to the cafe when there wasn't someone playing Smash or Mario Cart. There's a great community built up around the cafe as well. All of the cafe members are invited to a GroupMe chat where you can get updates on events or just chat and hang out.

Cara's Cafe was previously Frankie's Deli and we had been there a few times and really enjoyed it. We got a glimpse of Cara's menu via Facebook and found quite a few entries we were anxious to try. We finally made it to Cara's yesterday (3 Jul 2020) for lunch.  We were greeted immediately upon entering and grabbed a paper menu to make our selections.  Making just 2 selections was tough, as everything sounded delicious.  For lunch, we opted on a Pesto Chicken Salad Sandwich on Croissant and the Mufalletta Sandwich on a French roll. Several counter pastries caught our eye as we were going over the menu so we added a piece of German Chocolate Cake, 2 Cannoli's, a frozen Peach Cobbler (for later consumption), and 2 Blueberry-Lemon cupcakes.  Cara's also offers frozen casseroles to take home and heat up, so we opted to grab a Jumbalaya with Conecuh Casserole for a 4th of July lunch.  After we received our sandwiches and our remaining order was bagged, we ventured over to the Alleyway in downtown Wetumpka for an outdoor table. Both sandwiches were EXCELLENT and the Italian Pasta Salad was DELICIOUS! We followed our sandwiches with the Cannoli's and cupcakes and they were just as DELICIOUS as everything else! While at the Wetumpka fireworks show last night, we gobbled up the German Chocolate Cake which was also DELICIOUS! We cannot wait to try the Jumbalaya Casserole today and Peach Cobbler.  We also had a great conversation with Bert and Katie while we were there.  They were so helpful and courteous!
