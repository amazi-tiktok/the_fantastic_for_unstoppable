I had a scheduled meeting with the admissions office to get information about their vet program since they were unable to send information through the mail. When I first arrived, I had to fill out a life questionnaire and turn it in. Once I got in my meeting, 95% of the meeting was asking rather personal questions about my personal life rather than going over what the school had to offer me. I was told I would need 2 vehicles to attend. Within 10 minutes of my scheduled meeting, the advisor asked me to hold on so she can go consult another \"potential student\" who had a meeting. After waiting in my scheduled meeting for several minutes while she talks to another potential student (which made me feel like I wasn't important) she returns to finally start reviewing about the program. About 5 minutes in, she left the meeting again to talk to a different \"potential\" student. I was told they do not hire teachers, they hire professionals that only require 3 years of training. I asked several times about financial aid options and was given no information. I then inquired about how I could use this program as a bridge to become a future vet and the lady told me that being a vet was hard work and lots of money and it probably wont happen for me. She mentioned that once I graduate, they could not guarantee me a job. Then when she realized that I was only there for information and not immediately ready to start, she shut the whole meeting down and told me that there are people waiting in the lobby who want to start classes now and require her attention more than I and to return when I am ready. She quickly handed me a brochure and I left. I would not recommended this school to anyone. Very unprofessional!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626957c65de5f1:0x352012e0212f404d"}

Not even a fridge or microwave to bring our lunch. i would bring my lunch if i had a way to keep it cold or heat it up. If your thirsty and need something to drink we have to walk next door.

I had a scheduled meeting with the admissions office to get information about their vet program since they were unable to send information through the mail. When I first arrived, I had to fill out a life questionnaire and turn it in. Once I got in my meeting, 95% of the meeting was asking rather personal questions about my personal life rather than going over what the school had to offer me. I was told I would need 2 vehicles to attend. Within 10 minutes of my scheduled meeting, the advisor asked me to hold on so she can go consult another \"potential student\" who had a meeting. After waiting in my scheduled meeting for several minutes while she talks to another potential student (which made me feel like I wasn't important) she returns to finally start reviewing about the program. About 5 minutes in, she left the meeting again to talk to a different \"potential\" student. I was told they do not hire teachers, they hire professionals that only require 3 years of training. I asked several times about financial aid options and was given no information. I then inquired about how I could use this program as a bridge to become a future vet and the lady told me that being a vet was hard work and lots of money and it probably wont happen for me. She mentioned that once I graduate, they could not guarantee me a job. Then when she realized that I was only there for information and not immediately ready to start, she shut the whole meeting down and told me that there are people waiting in the lobby who want to start classes now and require her attention more than I and to return when I am ready. She quickly handed me a brochure and I left. I would not recommended this school to anyone. Very unprofessional!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626957c65de5f1:0x352012e0212f404d"}

Then on top of that the higher up people want to say it is important to eat but we have no machines for food , or drinks for our breaks. Not even a fridge or microwave to bring our lunch. i would bring my lunch if i had a way to keep it cold or heat it up. If your thirsty and need something to drink we have to walk next door.

Then on top of that the higher up people want to say it is important to eat but we have no machines for food , or drinks for our breaks. Not even a fridge or microwave to bring our lunch. i would bring my lunch if i had a way to keep it cold or heat it up. If your thirsty and need something to drink we have to walk next door. If we had a fridge or a microwave it would probably cut down on money for everyone and stop students being out of the classroom longer than the scheduled ten minutes.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626957c65de5f1:0x352012e0212f404d"}

After waiting in my scheduled meeting for several minutes while she talks to another potential student (which made me feel like I wasn't important) she returns to finally start reviewing about the program. About 5 minutes in, she left the meeting again to talk to a different \"potential\" student. I was told they do not hire teachers, they hire professionals that only require 3 years of training. I asked several times about financial aid options and was given no information. I then inquired about how I could use this program as a bridge to become a future vet and the lady told me that being a vet was hard work and lots of money and it probably wont happen for me. She mentioned that once I graduate, they could not guarantee me a job. Then when she realized that I was only there for information and not immediately ready to start, she shut the whole meeting down and told me that there are people waiting in the lobby who want to start classes now and require her attention more than I and to return when I am ready.

They have caused me so much suffering the last few years. I got a loan to go here, and it was a huge mistake. I'm just now getting it paid off, even though I dropped out 6 months in. Im probably going to have to get a lawyer to get the rest on my money back. Half of my so called \"professors\" were extreamly rude, refused to help me with anything. Eventhough I was paying 500 dollars for the class I felt very unwelcome. The final straw is when I had a sprained ankle, and I pulled up next to the door, to literally go 30 feet to drop a paper off on a desk, in the 30 seconds of doing it, a fat rent a cop is flying across the parking lot, to cut me off, and illegally detain me and give me a ticket. Literally parked there for less then one minute. I could not deal with this usurpitation, it took everything I had not to break that punks neck.\n\nIf you are a young man or women, and you are unsure about what you should do in your life. Don't let people pressure you into going to college. Take a year or two off, and work if you need too. College cost a ridiculously large amount of money, because the government basically guarantees it to anyone who wants to go. Make sure you are on a path to a successful and fulfilling career.

My Snoopy has been ill for over a year and after so many test, ultrasounds, x-rays and false diagnosis I was given a referral to have Snoppy be seen by Dr. Martin and her staff in April of this year. After our second drive from Atlanta Snoopy was finally diagnosed by her and her team. (After trying to get the same results for 11 months from his hospital in Atlanta he's been a patient of for 10 plus years. ) Dr. Mendoza was our first Doctor that helped take care of my baby when he had to stay a few nights to Catlin who on Ranks Supreme. Everyone that knows me knows how much I Love My Baby Snoopy and how I hate to leaving him in the hospital, but Catlin calms my soul. She called everyday for a week sometimes twice a day to give me an update on Snoopy. She  always made me feel at ease after every conversation. Snoopy was discharged over a week ago and she still called after his discharge almost everyday checking on my baby and offering me solutions. Unfortunately Snoopy is back but with the help form Catlin and Dr. Martin I think this time around the procedure they have suggested for Snoopy will get him on the road to Recovery. I've yet to meet Catlin but I hear that today September 13th is her birthday. Have a great one and I hope you will stop in to check on Snoopy. I hope the new person Morgan stepping in to fill your shoes will carry the same torch you did!\n\nPS Morgan will as soon I submitted this post.

My Miniature Pinscher was misdiagnosed by Dr. Vigg which caused her a major relapse and a 1 week stay at Auburn University Small Animal Hospital.\n\nMy Min Pin has a neurological condition and was under the care of the Neuro Team from UGA. 3 weeks before she was seen by Dr. Vigg, she was on the lowest dose of Predinisolone and being weaned off. I had travel to work a project in Maryland and my Aunt was watching her. My fur baby was not eating and drinking and showed signs of neck pain. She was taken to TU Vet school and Dr. Vigg was made aware of her MUE condition.\n\n1 week later, Mahogany could no longer walk and had to be rushed to the ER. The Neuro at Auburn University called me and inquired about her visit with Dr. Vigg and after talking with my Aunt about her med management, it was discovered he made my Aunt take her off the meds and this was why she had the severe relapse . He advised my Aunt to take her off the prescribed Prednisolone by her Neurologist, stating it was making her sick and to keep her crated for 90 days.\n\nMahogany's meds tripled and her re-checks which were every 3 months changed to monthly.\n\nI could not get TU to call me back and had to almost harrass them before I was able to speak with Dr. Bellamy who refused to address any wrong doing and stated, \"what do you want me to do about it! She's a dog!\" Dr. Bellamy was unprofessional and I questioned why she wanted to be a Vet. If these animals are only \"animals\" to her and not a life worth protecting, why is she in the field to care for them?\n\nDr. Bellamy nor Dr. David McKenize have replied to emails, although they promised they would.\n\nPlease make sure you think throughly before taking your pet to this Hospital. I know mistakes happen, however; as a Medical entity, there is a duty to make sure you are licensed to practice in a specialty and Dr. Vigg was not. Dr. Bellamy told me he did not have to be but that is not true and the Neurologists at Auburn and UGA confirmed this. They said you NEVER pull a canine off a steroid suddenly as their system will go into shock and if he were a Neuro, he would know this.\n\nA lot of progress was made to get Mahogany back on track and Dr. Vigg's negligence caused the Neuros to go back to the drawing board which upset them. They told me he never should have treated her for a Neuro condition as he is not a licensed Neurologist.\n\nPlease think twice before coming to Tuskegee University Vet Hospital. Auburn is far more rounded and the professionalism/bed-side manner exercised along with certified Medical Professionals who treat your pet with care is reasonating. It gives you peace of mind to know your pet will be given the utmost care. TU, on the other hand, views them as 4-legged property with no regard to the level of care amd treatment they are given.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c510e303e62e9:0xf598f4353e4e7ffe"}

The dean was WONDERFUL and became a good friend while I was there. My advisor was amazing and I had some absolutely tops professors. The campus is small and self contained but gorgeous nonetheless. Campus police are all really good guys and there are just really good people here from the friendly caf ladies to admin.\n\nTHAT SAID, there are a LOT of negatives and I do mean a LOT. The whole campus manages to be uphill in some form or fashion which is really difficult if you end up injured or disabled. There are a lot of professors with really strict attendance policies so you better have your mental and physical health in order or you're going to have a hard time. A lot of people here act like they're Ivy League so the workload is absolutely insane. God rest your soul if you're a music major.\n\nThe most difficult part of my experience here was the extremely limited accessibility as a disabled individual, most notably the soulless provost. When I had to take part of a semester off due to a medical emergency, my credits weren't applied properly forcing me to take an extra semester to make up for it. We as students were never notified when elevators were out or being maintenanced and I ended up missing classes because I couldn't use the stairs. The professors with the strictest attendance policies only cared that I wasn't in class, not why.\n\nWhile I was there, the college couldn't keep a president longer than two years at a time so it wasn't like we the student body saw any point in getting to know the president. When Krulak was in charge, he knew us all by name and our personal issues. He made sure I never had any accessibility issues. But as soon as he was gone, it was like a totally different school. The semester I was in a wheelchair was a soul crushing hell in and of itself.\n\nThis also isn't a place you want to go if you're queer. I fought one professor for a whole semester to call me by my name instead of what was on the roster. This led to a LOT of students using the wrong name which led to unspeakable dysphoria. It was a war just to get people to use that name so I just stopped trying when it came to pronouns. The best departments for fellow trans students are anything arts related like English, Studio Art, and theater. I changed my major because the science department was so transphobic. While the theater department is the best for this, it has its own issues.\n\nThen, there's the neighborhood. There's a drinking game we like to play called \"gunshots or fireworks\" if that gives you any idea. It's really close to Eastlake where even cops won't go. My husband was working on a roof in the area and found sniper bullets. The ER five minutes away sees a lot of stabbings and gun wounds but you should be fine if you're white. Just everyone will tell you not to turn right off campus. It's silly because the people there know who's a college kid and they aren't going to mess with any because they don't want that kind of trouble. You're safe on campus but don't park by the sorority houses unless you're cool with your car being broken into. It's a recurring problem.\n\nThis is probably not a place I'm going to send my kids for a lot of reasons. I did enjoy the classes themselves and frat row knows how to party. The professors were stellar and the campus was gorgeous but none of that totally cancels out all the negative. So as long as you're straight, cisgender, white, mentally healthy, and able bodied you'll be fine!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891c45e0215555:0xcc723ea8efbfa1fa"}

Dr. Levey, Dr. Barton, Dr. Mullins, Dr. Coyle, Dr. Rector, Dr. Law, Dr. McInturff (don't hold me to that spelling) and Dr. Ott are really awesome people who everyone should take classes from. They were truly awesome role models for me as I came up through the college ranks.\n\nThere are, however, negatives too: I often found students less dedicated to their studies than warranted, the campus police unwilling to enforce simple rules against underage drinking and illegal drug use, and some strong evidence that some members of the faculty adjusted grades on the grounds other than merit. I certainly hope that since my time at BSC this situation has changed.\n\nOverall, I am still torn on whether I should have attended Birmingham-Southern. It is a difficult question, one that I cannot answer even in hindsight four years after graduation. Definitely make sure it is the right fit for you. Keep in mind that although the school is Methodist affiliated, not everyone who attends or teaches there is Christian or Methodist. In fact, you may even find some activities on campus of which Methodists and Christians alike might disapprove. Thus, although it appears to be a school similar to Samford University, it simply is not. The school does treat its alumni very well, and I oddly have to say that I enjoy being an alumni more than I enjoyed being a student.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891c45e0215555:0xcc723ea8efbfa1fa"}

The co-ed visitation is for Wynn/ Hay Hall residents only and is limited to strict terms and conditions. The dorms are old and falling apart, especially King Hall. The college's website is often down, which at times is very inconvenient. The cafeteria basically rotates the same 7 meals. Thursday and Friday during are the best days to go, which are \"chicken day\" and \"fish day\" respectively. The cafeteria is the only eating spot on campus and it closes at 6:30. Everything else (stadium, hay center, wynn center, etc.) usually closes around 9 or 10. I will not even get started on all the problems with dealing with financial aid.

This has been the worst college (if that\u2019s what you want to call it) that I\u2019ve ever attended. There are a million things that I can review about but I\u2019ll limit that to my top issues I\u2019ve had personally.\n\n1. ADMINISTRATION. The administration here are a joke and are the most unprofessional people I have ever dealt with. I mean some have the nastiest attitudes on and off the phone, are nonchalant about student issues, don\u2019t return calls or emails\u2026just don\u2019t care. The business office just puts anyone in there to handle student business (ie. Lowerclassmen who have the slightest clue on how to conduct business). The admissions office is a joke. I\u2019ve tried to have a conversation with a lady at the front desk, she didn\u2019t even have the decency to stop smacking and have a conversation about important paperwork with me. Don\u2019t try to call the business or admissions office after classes have ended to talk about transcript requests etc \u2026they wont answer. As well as, you need to \u2018follow up\u2019 with them when they say they will do something for you regarding transcript requests to be sent off because they won\u2019t send them unless you hassle them.\n\n2. COLLEGE GROUNDS. The college is old, I get that but the buildings are literally falling apart. The classrooms have holes in the ceilings, rainwater that comes through, desks that barely hold themselves together, out of date lab equipment (60% of that which doesn\u2019t work), mold, mildew & let\u2019s not forget what ever critters decide to come visit you that day. The dorms need serious improvement too. But I guess the faculty and staff here are more worried about driving Mercedes, BMW\u2019s and Camero\u2019s rather than providing a quality education to their students.\n\n3. MONEY! I hope you are able to pay your student bill in the exact amount that your statement says, because if you are looking for a refund check\u2026you might not get it! I can\u2019t count how many stories I\u2019ve heard about them stealing money, saying it went to \u2018other fees\u2019 than giving it back. Also, if you decide to go part time, be prepared for 3-5 people quoting you different prices for how much a credit hour costs because obviously nobody knows much about prices.\n\n4. FOOD. One cafeteria, if you don\u2019t like the choices\u2026oh well! The food reminds you of when you were in elementary school lunch lines..bland and nasty most of the time. Also, they close at 6:30 so I hope you have food in your rooms!\n\n5. EDUCATION. This is the saddest part. They dumb down the education so bad, using out of date resources. Most days there was no point of even going to classes because of how bad the teaching is there. Most of the professors don\u2019t care if you learn or not as long as they get paid. Most lectures come straight from the books and their whole process of education is about 20 years behind.\n\nIf you want quality education at a great price in Tuscaloosa choose Shelton or Alabama! Shelton is amazing if you don\u2019t want to spend the high prices at Alabama and you are valued there as well! It\u2019s just a matter of time before this \u2018college\u2019 closes for good.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8886030439a1640f:0xcc438ccf73fc02ba"}
