Sadly it was not what I had hoped.\n\nWe ordered the seasonal salad which was under dressed with wilted lettuce. Said we wanted to share the salad but then had to ask for plates to share and were given awkward wax paper lined baskets that bits of the salad could fall out of.\n\nWe also got the Southside supreme pizza. The crust was flat, chewy, and without any crunch. One side of the pizza had all the sauce while the other side was dry, and there were whole cross sectional slices of onion on 3 of the slices with no onion on any of the others. Similarly with the olives, 2-3 slices held almost all of the olives while the other slices were bare. The pepperoni was okay but the sausage tasted like breakfast sausage, no spice or Italian sausage flavor (where\u2019s the fennel?) at all.\n\nWhile we were there for lunch, they were moving things like ladders past our table and into the back and making loud noises. Our pizza also took forever to come out, and we were the only people there.\n\nMaybe it was just a fluke, but I\u2019ll have a hard time wanting to try iron city pizza again anytime soon.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1568927413550, "text": "We are very sorry you had anything less than a perfect experience with us.

That has its ups and downs.  Ups sit where you like, not where you are lead.  Down:  The server for that section may not know you are there.  After looking over the menu twice and discussing the options provided, roughly 10 mins; we got approached by the waitstaff for drinks.  The place was not very busy, but there were other folks there.  Got our order in. Eggplant Parm, the Italian, and order of cheese breadsticks.  It took a while for the chow to hit the table.  The Eggplant Parm was a big portion  looked really tasty.  The Italian  was wee for a 8-9 dollar sandwich, i would say less than 6 inches of it total.  The meat cuts were great though.  Cheese bread.... can't tell you just yet, as it has not arrived.  My side salad was fair.  The Greek dressing was really good.  However the onions were old as they had become translucent and the red had seeped into the meat of the veggie. My friend had to get up to get his tea refilled.  The waitress did not even acknowledge that she had not returned with his drink.  I scarfed up my sandwich after removing the onions.  Good, but not valued correctly in my opinion at the cost point.  When i had cleaned up my area, just a thing i do having been a server, my cheese breads arrived.  They came with an apology about a mix up in the kitchen. Things happen.  They were the best thing out of all that was ordered.\n\nWhat this place needs to do to stay alive in a market flooded with food options :\n*know that this place is new and are working on finding their rhythm\n\n1.  Bring on better wait staff, and add another the floor\n2.  Re-evaluate their price points on certain items.  There Special was a great deal!\n3.  Polish the time from order to table.\n\nI will be going back in a month or two to see how things have changed.  It has some great things going for it.

She didn't mind at all that we wanted to switch tables closer to the TV. She even helped me with my drinks. The reason why we moved was because she changed the channel to an animated movie. Well reading the caption from where we were sitting was a little eye straining. Once we moved closer she even turned the sound on for us.\nWe sat there and ate a very delicious and very cheesy pepperoni pizza while we watched some of that movie.\nOne con to this place though.....the women's bathroom door. It's absolutely disgusting and y'all should be ashamed of yourselves for not cleaning that nastiness up! Honestly made me second guess on whether or not I should eat the food i had just ordered because I know y'all use that bathroom. You see it when you use the door. There is NO WAY ON EARTH THAT YOU CAN'T SEE IT! Better yet, just replace the door.\nHaving said that, I would still eat there because the food was excellent! Just please do something with the door, please.\nThe hours are weird...so call first.\nThis really is 5 star food and I will change my rating once the door is nice and clean.\nUPDATE:\nOrdered another pizza this time Togo and was just as delicious as the last one!!!!! Yummy. They have the best tasting pizza!!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889b70ed9f44735:0x15428828803b0209"}

Surely an Italian restaurant can't mess up Italian dishes. Hence my sarcasm.\n\nI wanted something quick, to-go. The venue was quite busy so I knew it'd be a little while before my order was ready. No problem. But after about 40 minutes I started getting a little antsy. I walked over to the VERY friendly young woman whom I had placed my order with. She advised it'd just be a few more minutes.\n\nShe was right, my food (I ordered the Pasta Linguine w/shrimp and scallops, and a Chicken Ceaser salad), was ready in those few minutes she mentioned. My order was totally screwed--the blame could be placed on me for not checking my food before I left, but that's not my job to know their job.\n\nMy chicken Ceaser salad didn't have any chicken. They had placed the chicken that was supposed to be on the salad on the linguine. And they also placed some vegetable soup with my order. I don't even like vegetable soup. The pasta was totally dry as well, it was supposed to have a tomato, creamy sauce but maybe mine disappeared, because it certainly wasn't anywhere to be found.\n\nI ended up at least trying to eat some of the pasta but it prematurely & intentionally went into the trash. The salad was fresh though.\n\nWith so many restaurant offerings it often hard to give a spot another shot, nothing different in this case.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a4d65451269:0x9fba3973b50c979f"}

I ordered the Camile club with no mayo. When I received my sandwich, it had mayo. So, I calmly went back up and explained that I didn't want mayo. I was told it could be fixed.\n\nWhile waiting on my sandwich, I noticed the staff watching me and speaking quietly, but I ignored it. 5 minutes later I was called back and when I went to check my sandwich again, I noticed the residue from mayo. It looked as if someone had wiped the mayo off and changed the bread. Again, calmly, I went back up (once again noticing the staff snickering) and asked to speak to the manager for a refund. Said-manager whose name I couldn't get, claimed she was there the whole time they \"remade\" my sandwich and it was fresh. I told her that couldn't be the case because it was now cold, it took her less time to make it than originally and I showed her a piece of lettuce that had mayo in it.\n\nShe then rudely asked me if I still had my receipt, which I did. I was given a refund, but I don't appreciate the way I was treated. If I'm paying for a meal, I expect it to made the way I requested it. I didn't ask them to make me a sandwich befitting God.

Socialized with friends for a while and saw two missed calls a few minutes later at 6:53. No voicemails but I figured it had to be Domino\u2019s so I called back. Waited for 10 minutes and no one picked up. App said pizza was being delivered. Called back at 7:26 to see where food was. Finally got someone on the phone. The gentleman said he tried calling twice to tell me there were no delivery drivers available. But he could\u2019ve left a voicemail for that! Why did I have to try and call him back for that information? At this point we\u2019re all hungry and now the guests are upset.\n\nSo a few things here:\n1. The app shouldn\u2019t show my food is being delivered when it hasn\u2019t even been made.\n2. I shouldn\u2019t have been able to order delivery if the location doesn\u2019t offer it.\n3. The employee should have left a voicemail with the information and not wasted my time trying to call back for it.\n\nSo be careful using this location. The communication is very poor. Call ahead of time to see if they can deliver. Don\u2019t use the app.\n\nEDIT: Bumping up a star since the manager called me to explain the situation and obviously wants to make things right. I may give this location another try since it seems I caught them in a perfect storm of \"things going wrong\", and being a former restaurant worker myself, I can sympathize.\n\nMy order was flagged for review since it was associated to an address that has been linked to multiple phone numbers. This is a national Domino's corporate policy to keep tabs on potential sketchy orders.\n\nDomino's corporate always expects their franchisees to have delivery drivers, and never anticipates a scenario where a given store has no delivery drivers show up for work. So don't expect the app design to improve, and I can't fault this location for that.\n\nDomino's typically doesn't leave voicemails as they prefer to talk about potential order problems in person, and in my case, try to present an offer for me to pick up the pizza myself. Even so, we'll agree to disagree as the voicemail could have said \"We have no delivery drivers for tonight. Please call us back by X time if you still want the order and can arrange to have it picked up.\"", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1627330944209, "text": "Our team appreciates your review and feedback.

Another time I waited over 2 hours for my order when they said it would be 30-45 minutes. This last experience was the final straw. Placed an order on the 4th of July and never received it, but I was charged. When I called to inquire about the charge a couple days later the store manager was EXTREMELY RUDE, and then told me he couldn\u2019t do anything and I should probably just call my bank and say it was a fraudulent charge.

I ordered a pizza last night and it was canceled due to no delivery driver. They called from a personal cell phone to tell me this instead of the Dominos\u2019 number, which resulted in me not answering since it was an Iowa number. That much was understandable since I know people are having a hard time finding workers. After I called to check on my pizza, she said I needed to place my order again online since she couldn\u2019t apply my coupon over the phone. She told me they now had a driver, and it would be delivered. I order my pizza again and the tracker says it has been delivered. 30 minutes later- still no pizza. I was left on hold for 20 minutes or so and called back several times with no answer. I love dominos, but I hate to say I won\u2019t be ordering from this store anymore.

We were seated at a super small table and we ordered bruschetta as an appetizer, my wife ordered the house meatballs, and I ordered their chicken alfredo spaghetti. When the \"Bruschetta\" arrived, our table was now \"full\" with the plate containing the \"toast\" with tomatoes masquerading as\"bruschetta\", and our two dining plates.  Normally, bruschetta is served on some type of grilled French, or \"specialty\" bread. Nope, ours was served on 3 pieces of \"toast\", cut diagonally, and fresh out of the bread wrapper.  Only the first piece was edible because the reason you don't use fresh bread is because it becomes soggy very quickly which is exactly what happened with the following 5 pieces of \"toast\". Oh, they tried to help it out by charing the bread pretty good, but it didn't keep the center of each slice from literally folding over and dumping the bruschetta all over the plate, table AND my clothes as I tried to eat it. The overly toasted crusts were best used to dip my wife's meatball sauce while she wasn't looking.\n\nSoon, my chicken alfredo spaghetti arrived, and it looked nice, creamy, no place to put it however on our uselessly small table so I had to give up my dining plate and just eat my remaining bruschetta straight off of the serving platter...  AND...  WAIT A MINUTE... that's not spaghetti, it's penne pasta. We summoned our waiter, and he apologized but said that he was pretty sure that the chicken alfredo was always served over penne pasta. After requesting the menu again, I pointed out the word \"spaghetti\" in the description of their \"Chicken Alfredo Spaghetti\" and he quickly disappeared. Soon, a woman, whom did not introduce herself, appears at our table and says \"So, you're not a penne kind of guy huh?\". I replied, \"No, I'm not.\"  She then tells me that they are \"out of spaghetti\" and that she'll \"get them to make me anything else on the menu\". What she's really telling me is WoW, you do know the difference between spaghetti and penne pasta, AND noticed that we just substituted what you ordered with whatever we had...\n\nMy wife was about half through with her house meatballs by this time so I told that I was fine and didn't wish to order anything else. And she hopped right up and disappeared as quickly as my appetite had, never to be seen again.  I left slightly ahead of my wife and when our server told me \"Hope to see you again soon...\", I just replied, \"You won't\" as I made my way to the street.\n\nI really don't understand how anyone can find this sort of treatment \"acceptable\". I don't, and they've lost me, my recommendation to my friends and family, coworkers, business customers and clients as a place to get a good meal and have a nice time.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPknd14kfbI_V-pGEeKBWEiBeRUH6MvosxcKf9C=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3i1JY8rXB3PBUrxT7XTT7rsJS_D-aFIyanub9=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMw5HMPJzRLH7SHNL6gSfvklrHFWSIUUMGwMd4z=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bb5a07760dd:0x9e5262ceb80f18a3"}

I went to visit Little Caesar pizza place. I ordered one pepperoni pizza and one cheese pizza. There were three females inside of Little Caesar two African American female and one Caucasian female. One of the African American females with a cashier then one day in the African American female in the back and a Caucasian female with making the pizzas. When I place my order Little Caesar around 8:51 p.m. which is the X stamped on my receipt. All of the workers in Little Caesars were on their cell phones or had the above's in the ear. I placed my order with the cashier, then I just watch to see what happened. I washed your Caucasian female put her phone down and take her ear plugs out, then she received it to wash your hands. Then I saw the African American female come from the back aisle set up phone down, but never saw her wash her hands. Then she proceeded to take down crust and lay them flat in trays and place butter on them along with the cheese. Not remember as I stated before, I never saw her wash your hands. Okay so I'll call the Caucasian female to the front and I said excuse me but she did not wash her hands referring to the African American female. Then the Caucasian female he's going to tell me that she washed her hands. The African American female and stated I don't know what you watching me for because I wash my hands. Then she proceeded to use negative language and added to that a very negative attitude. Simply because I requested that they follow safety procedures by washing their hands before touching food. Then the African American female continue to be negative and use and negative body language. I asked for the name of the manager and the district office number. I was told there was no district office for Little Caesar. I was told the manager on duty was the African American woman with the negative attitude and the one that use negative language. I asked who was the owner of this particular Little Caesar on Moffett Road in Mobile Alabama. I was told I think his name is Michael. So you telling me that you're working at a business and you don't even know who you're working for? I tried to reach someone in the office a little Caesar to put this situation. I will continue to reach out to Little Caesar until I get some type of reply. I'm just afraid that the person may not have enough self-control to walk away from someone else being ignorant. So my experience with this little Caesar on Moffett Road and Mobile Alabama was totally negative and I would advise anyone not to go.

For now it's not delivery it's D'Gornios. Update 11/13/2019: never got a response to my complaint online and I guess their way of responding was to stop delivering to this area.

When I got there I noticed a pizza on a tray and as they were calling out names I thought they said it was mine but a diner in front of me said iy was hers. They delivered the pizza to her table and then the cashier started to wait on me. I gave her my name and she looked confused. One of the guys working behind the counter said that the pizza that they gave away was mine. They went out to the table and brought pizza back and start to put it in a to go box like they were giving it to me! The guy was like \"no way\" I am making you a new order. So I have a seat and I hear a commotion.  The guy is arguing with a \"manager\" and he tells the guy to clock out. When he leaves he tells me that he's sorry. So I wait for another 20 minutes thinking that I am getting a new pizza. Eventually I asked the girl at the counter where my order was and she says oh I'll bring it right out to you. I get the order and walk back to my car and something told me to check it. I opened up the box and its the same cold pizza that they originally wanted to give me! I mean the bottom of the box is soggy and the pizza is freezing cold! I marched back in there very upset and ask for my money back immediately.

First I called and I called on a landline phone so there would be no issue, well the person taking my order had to have been deaf bc I repeated each word of my sentence at least 3 times and then hung up in my face. So I call another location in Tuscaloosa and the guy that answered the phone there was so nice and told me that we were too far away but he was gonna check the other stores to see which delivery range we were in and he came back and said we were in range for delivery from this location. So I call back and was told again I was not in range, very confused at this point bc I\u2019m sure they use the same system but anyways didn\u2019t wanna argue so I just order and do pickup and when I get there I had to wait at the counter for over 5 mins just for someone to speak to me. Then in the middle of her ringing me up she proceeds to leave the counter to give another customer their order for free I might add. So I\u2019m furious at this point and I ask if the pizza comes with ranch and she says no and doesn\u2019t ask if I need any or anything so I ask her to get me 2 cups of ranch and she acted like it was a problem I needed ranch.

The issue had already been addressed to management by the driver prior to my arrival as the driver sat in my parking lot several minutes before leaving and actually pulled up to the store right after I did. When entering I was greeted and I told the manager I needed to speak with her. Now in a managament position it is required that you set the bar of excellence for your employees. That did not happen here. Her demeanour was appalling. Because I have never had an issue with Manager Beth Brooke I would have gotten it remade had she shown a level of excellent and professional customer service. Instead she displayed no empathy, no apologize, no consideration.  She did not even look at me while talking to me until I said \"Is your name on my receipt.\" Then manager Beth looked at me and said you know all you had to do was call me instead of coming up here.  No what should have happened was the pizza that came out to me should have NEVER pasted as company standards.

We are visiting here and attending a 10 day church event. We ordered two pizzas, wings and a two liter drink. The delivery drivers calls us to meet her in the lobby.

At the same time the driver calls back and says no one is at the desk waiting. When I asked the driver where was she at , first she said that she was waiting at the desk and didn't see anyone there with what I told her my daughter was wearing. I asked if she was sure she was at the desk because my daughter was on the other line waiting at the desk. That's when she told me no , she was outside because she had to go get her phone. First untruth. My daughter calls back and ask if we ordered a drink because the driver didn't give her one. I quickly call called the driver back so she didn't get to far and have to turn around. Once I got in touch with her to inform her that she had forgot to give us our drink , she states that she was looking at our ticket and we didn't order a drink. Once again I asked if she was sure? She replies that she was. Second untruth. I guess she forgot how a copy of the order is on each box, and how it clearly reads a 2 liter mountain dew. That's not the funny part. When my wife called the store back guess who answers the phone . That's right the same person who took our order, who happens to be the manager. The manager said confirmed that we did order the drink and sent the driver back.

The pizza had no olives at all on it. I called her back and informed her that I did not order extra toppings, only substituted two of the toppings and that there were no olives on the pizza.

This really isn't much of an issue because I just ask them when I get there.\n\nHowever, the consistency of quality of the food hasn't been good since around June. We order bread bites a lot from there and sometimes they are drenched in oil to the point that they ooze out a lot with every bite (not good) and others it is bone dry with not even sauce to dip them in (also not good). Sometimes the bites are REALLY undercooked and sometimes they are just right. I understand it is different employees making the pizza, but sometimes the stuff is good and other times I don't even eat it because it is inedible. Ordering now is a 50/50 gamble on whether I will actually be eating what they give me. The pizza is often the same (undercooked or just right).\n\nAlso one time they gave us a cheesy bread instead of bread bites and then when we called about it they basically called us liars. We just wanted what we ordered and we order from there A LOT.\n\nRecently we have cut back on ordering from there because of the consistency issues.

I like it bc it's inexpensive but you get what you pay for so it's a cheap pizza and good enough but not the best around.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a3c67895de18f:0xbdd31e9186a15c04"}

Got home and it was the WORST food we had ever gotten. A house full of 7 teenage boys and 2 adults and there was still 2 1/2 pizzas left afterwards. The wings were inedible. They looked and tasted like they were made the day before and set out overnight. Horrible...just horrible. Corporate will be getting a major complaint. They were refusing to refund money to those of us that were tired of waiting. The excuse was noone in the store was allowed to refund money and we would have to wait until the next day for the manager to deal with it.

He comes over to find out what the issue is and I explained to him how it's been forever since I ordered a cheese pizza and a bowl of pasta for my kids that are in the hotel Room starving to which he apologized and went to ask the waitress what was going on. She whispered to him that I was being belligerent and rude even though that is entirely untrue the patron at the bar can attest to that. The owner then turned to me and explain to me how the customer is not always right as if I had been causing a problem to which I explained to him the only issue I've created was when I asked where my order was at no time was I ever belligerent and he should talk to people around to find out the truth before just blindly believing his head waitress. In the end he felt he should give me my money back I got my pizza the fed achenia turned out to be linguine the chicken was so overcooked it was in edible. The pizza was great the service was total  Krapp. The airconditioner in the front of the store is leaking water so much that they had to empty a picture and it was all over the floor entire time.

Didn't ask for our name or number to call when it was ready.\n\nWe stood around for another 10 minutes waiting for her to come back so we could tell her to get our number to call us when it was ready. She told us it would be about 30 minutes and they would call.\n\nAlmost an hour later, we received no phone call and I had to call them to ask if it was ready, which they said it was.\n\nI walked back over from our hotel, paid for our pizza, only to find out when I opened the box (because they clearly didn't check it) that she had put the wrong order in for our pizza.\n\nAt that point we told them we just wanted a refund.\n\nWE RECEIVED NO APOLOGIES FROM YOUR INCOMPETENT AND UNTRAINED STAFF, JUST AN ATTITUDE.\n\nI don't care how good the pizza is, your service was awful.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fd7562089b5:0x177315578d833c37"}

It sure beats having to go to the midtown location or going the Old Shell Location. Takes me less than 6 minutes to get to the new one. The decor and flow of the building is outstanding and I also understand that it just opened up so it IS gonna be packed and service will be slow as they try to  weed things out. Only been open maybe a week. We did wait for awhile for food but it was worth it. I'm sure the wait times will improve with the upcoming weeks. But yes parking was an issue having to park in the grassy dirt location next to the parking lot. Hopefully they can maybe purchase that lot and extend the parking lot. The food however was outstanding when we got it. Hot and tasty. Our server was attentive and everything was delivered properly\u200b and food came out perfectly.

We arrived around noon and there was a single slice of pizza on the buffet. We loaded up on salad and waited for pizza... And waited... And waited. People started to complain and we decided to order a pizza instead of waiting any longer.\n\nIn the ~1 hour we were there two pizzas were put on the buffet and quickly claimed by the dozen or so people waiting. Definitely not worth the extra drive for something that doesn't deserve to be called a buffet. More like a salad bar. No soups, no breads, and- for most of our visit- no pizza.\n\nOur waitress was nice enough and the pizza we ordered after we got tired of waiting was great. Next time we'll skip the longer drive and hit up the one nearer to us for our pizza. And if we decide we want a buffet we'll go to Cici's.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1526266797923, "text": "We are so sorry to hear about your experience with us Robert! The buffet is a new thing for us that we are tweaking to get just right. It's hard to determine just how many people might attend. Currently, with it being fairly new, attendance hasn't been high, so we hate to make a bunch of pizzas just to get thrown away. In your situation though, this is something that seems to be an issue that could have been prepared for and we are sorry for that! We apologize sincerely and appreciate your feedback.

I ordered the veggie calzone and added pepperoni. This is one of my favorite dishes there. When it came, the outside was cooked perfectly, but the pepperoni was raw and cold. Not room temperature, refrigerator cold. I told my server and she asked if I wanted it remade. I did. The second one came to the table in the same condition. At this point, I was done. I told her to just take it back and I would go. She brought the manager over,  who said yes it was cold, thier oven must not be working properly and took it off the bill and then presented me with a check for my soda.\nI have been in the service industry all my life and I have never seen a customer charged for a fountain drink when thier order was botched. I rarely complain in restaurants because I understand how demanding the job is and I tip well because I appreciate good service.  Charging me 2.69 for a soda I drank a quarter of after failing to cook my order twice seems cheap and passive agressive.

The remainder of the 45 minutes spent waiting for whatever we requested from our waitress who was slow and forgetful. She also brought my 3 yr old sons drink in a bar glass then proceeded to say she wasn't sure if it could be transferred to a to go cup but was willing to bring me a cup to pour it in. After 30 minutes of waiting and asking multiple times I gave up and asked a different waitress for a cup. She didn't take our menus till the end of the meal. She took our orders and we waited 15minutes  for them after already being their and seated for a minimum of 10minutes she brought out the appetizers and still had not brought any of us the water we asked for when we first sat down. This is not acceptable service in my book. I will be eating their again bc the food was so good however I will be requesting a different server if sat in her section.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1493270679443, "text": "Hey Kameron!

My 3 orders all had 14 minute windows and with all three of my orders I ended up waiting and additional 15 minutes for customers foods. My last order towards 10pm ended up being 20 minutes late and while standing at the bar waiting for the other half of the order groups of employees were at the bar with two bartenders gossiping about the workers in the kitchen and another group was behind me folding silverware gossiping. Not once did any of the fill me in or ask me about what I was still waiting on. This experience has deterred any future plans I had of visiting this location. The one on Old Shell had nicer workers and spoke to me throughout my whole pick up process. Again, this review is based solely on my experience picking up orders not my experience dining in and eating there.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1539568864761, "text": "Krystal we are so sorry to hear about your experience with us!

Then we placed an order for a medium House Special pizza. About 45 minutes in, we already finished out wings and my wife also finished her pint of beer; we were waiting on our pizza still. We asked our server if our pizza was ready and she went to check. She brought out a large pizza and placed it on the table. I looked at it and said, that's not our pizza. She took it back. My wife at this point was pretty frustrated because we were both pretty hungry. Almost 5 mins later she brings out our pizza. She explained that they put our pizza into a to-go box and got it mixed up with someone else's order. I can tell the pizza was probably sitting in the to-go box awhile because our pizza didn't taste fresh. At this point, we were not going to wait longer to get another fresh pizza.

Another selling point of this chain is the ability to customize your pizza.  Lots of ingredients you don't see else where- like artichoke hearts.

People who had walked in the last ten minutes are seated. I listened to them sign in (no, they did not have reservations)They are seated within 10 minutes, 4 if them, 4 of us. I questioned it. She said our name was not on the list. I told her I watched her write it on there because it said \u201cand a booster seat\u201d.m and noticed she was left handed. Told her 2 names now on bottom of list and 7 families waiting. She said the list must have been accidentally erased by another employee. We have been sitting there the whole time. She was the only employee at the hostess desk. She came and went back and forth, cleaning tables, and hanging out with waitresses talking and laughing. She didn\u2019t go around to see who all needed to be added back so lots of complaints. One guy ask her would it be much longer, if so, he needed to leave and go somewhere else. She said, \u201cbye\u201d. They did not have on name tags. She had short, one length, dark curly hair, blue eyes. The waitresses were standing around talking. People would leave and the table would be empty over 30 minutes before they\u2019d clean it and seat someone. Poor management and hostess with bad attitude. Also goofing off waitresses. Man with grey hair and beard making pizzas had mask wrapped around his neck, not covering nose or mouth, right over the pizza\u2019s. Bleach blonde guy flicking his hair everywhere and digging ear wax out his ear with gloves and looking at it did not change gloves and leaned up on pizza counter where pizzas were. Bathroom beyond filthy. Took over an hour to get pizza. New waitress in training was the only one not goofing. They had a lot of employees and only half capacity. I\u2019d hate to seen it if it were full capacity. They will close soon. Grey haired, grey beard man came to table at the end and asked how was it?  He had no solution to the waiting list getting erased and act out out because I complained. I have a solution. Do away with the dry erase board and wet rag and try a paper and pen and hire a hostess that doesn\u2019t have an attitude problem, wear you mask correctly, and provide service.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e856ea43b91d5:0x8137de843540196c"}

I was infuriated at how little care was given when the floor supervisor (who was literally 15 feet from our table) could clearly see that we weren\u2019t receiving any service at all and ignored it. Not sure if I\u2019ll ever return to this place again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e856ea43b91d5:0x8137de843540196c"}

I\u2019ve had the misfortune of frequenting this establishment 7 times since it opened up. And every single time was extremely negative. The first problem is every single time I\u2019ve went was during a week day around 2-3 in the afternoon and the place was nearly empty and we were seated and promptly forgotten about every single time I\u2019ve ever been there. I could possibly understand that if there was ever any more than 3-4 other couples in the establishment besides us but no the place has been absolutely almost empty every single time (of the 7) I\u2019ve been there. The last time was around a couple of years ago. I went with my cousins wife and we ordered some of that humus bread she ordered a small pizza I ordered a sandwich. Well the humus came a couple minutes later her pizza came but my sandwich never did so I wound up eating the humus. When we were ready to go (waiter was nowhere to be found as usual there in a empty restaurant) I stood up and said hey we decided we do not want the sandwich can we just get the check for the rest we need to go. Well they tried to rapidly make the sandwich and give it to me with me telling them I did not want it. I didn\u2019t want it because we were going several places and I didn\u2019t want the food rotting and stinking up my car. Then they shoved the unwanted sandwich at me basically forcing me to take it and the waiter proceeded to start saying don\u2019t blame him cause he isn\u2019t the cook. Now he said to this to me and I worked in the restaurant business for 15 years and I knew they were having the chit chat hour and possibly doing side work. I told him well you should have asked the cook why your entire order wasn\u2019t up. In a nutshell he actually started cussing me etc. Me and my my cousins wife left the childish pathetic situation threw the sandwich in the nearest garbage can and I\u2019ve never went back to that establishment again and never will. From the 7 incidents I\u2019ve had there frankly I\u2019m amazed they have any clientele at all. I should have written this a long time ago but I had a lot of things going on in life and just now got the opportunity when the subject was brought back up in a conversation last night. This is NOT a fake review before the owner wants to chime in and claim so I\u2019ll happily provide my receipts. If I could give this establishment negative stars I would. I do not recommend this establishment to anyone of any age group for any reason. Unfortunately this is the second negative review I\u2019ve felt obligated to give and I\u2019m upset with myself for not addressing the last incident back when it happened", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e856ea43b91d5:0x8137de843540196c"}

This is a review specifically for the female manager on shift 9 March 2019 at 6:30 pm.  She was very rude and I figured I should share.\n\nI ordered pizza for take out and went to pick it up.  I got to the restaurant about 6:30 and went to the bar area to pick it up.  The lady behind the bar asked my name and immediately told me my pizza wasn't ready yet.  I said that's fine and sat where I could see the take out orders sitting on top of the oven.  I noticed a take out order matching my size boxes sitting there, but figured they weren't mine, as that's what the lady said.  None the less, I happened to notice they weren't going anywhere and began to figure they were mine.  After 20 mins of waiting, the lady went and picked up those very same boxes from on top of the oven and brought them to me.  I mentioned that they had been sitting there since before she told me that my order wasn't ready and that I wasnt pleased with that.\n\nShe began to tell me I was a liar and that it was impossible.

Then another 15 minutes for me to get a salad. Now the waitress did not bring me my salad the hostess did. Who also was very nice to bring me silverware. Ok then my son got his little cheese pizza and apples. That meal was perfect. My salad wasnt even great. I had the wrong lettuce. Ok 30 minutes later my daughter gets her pretzel dippers and they were almost as big as her and hard as all get out. You could have broken a glass with it. Ok about another 30-35 minutes past and my husband still has not gotten his calzone. It finally arrives and its cold. The waitress has not even checked on us since we got our drinks. The hostess again was nice enough to bring him silverware after we tried to get the attention of our server for about 10 minutes.

There will be no \"next time\" BOTTOM DOLLAR ON THAT. Horrible experiences at this locations but tonight's interaction burns bridges. Granted, there was inclement weather tonight so some delay and difficulties were expected. However, from what I experienced tonight, Domino's Pizza off of Mobile Hwy would have been better closed. No matter, I ordered from the app and request delivery. I finalized the order on the app but I later received a call from the store, saying they didn't have delivery drivers (again, expected difficulties) and I need to pick up my food. What they didn't tell me is that they voided my app order, placing a hold on my debit card (upcoming 'last straw'), and I would need to bring my debit card to re-order. So, when I arrived at the store, lo and behold. They told me that I needed my card. Thus, I had to drive back through Tropical Storm Sally in a partially wrecked car, just to get my debit card. (Now, given my past dealings with this store, I should have know better but I am a naive person person at times.) I get back to the store, just to find out that because of the order I made on the app, Domino's Pizza tried to charge me twice for the same order. One for delivery and the other for carryout. I snapped. So what? I need to have at least 40 dollars in my bank account to order pizza. I am sorry; your tax dollars don't pay teachers enough for that. I find it really funny that Domino's Pizza can jump into your bank account so fast when you order but, refunding and correcting orders, they feint as bumbling idiots. I do not just hold the store at fault but the entire corporation. They have no regard for customer service; Domino's Pizza only cares about profits and their shareholders. I wouldn't drop or invest a dime into Domino's Pizza, with all the dried and burnt pizzas I have ordered over the years. Hell, Pizza Hut has a hotline for situations like this, but you invest your time in 'Pizza Insurance' and 'HotSpots'. How about fairly selling pizza when trying to double dip into people's bank accounts? How about optimizing your systems so errors like this can fixed quicker? Just go under, already. But, before you do, give me my money back because YOU STILL HAVE NOT DONE THAT YET FOR A ORDER I CAN NOT EAT BECAUSE I NEVER RECEIVED IT!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1586546559560, "text": "Hello Chris, I apologize for your experience and would like to assure you that this is not an automated response and your review is individually read and responded to because we want to make sure your concerns are addressed.

Although the pizza tracker showed it at quality check phase (the last phase before delivery), I get a dead air call no one said anything. So I called back and get an answer from a rude Adrian screaming and cutting me off because I questioned him about waiting 30minutes to call me to tell me they don't deliver in my area after dark. In which I just received a delivery from them about a week or 2 at this hour ago so I guess it's a new policy, So why was I able to place an order and why was I charged and again 30MINUTES before you call knowing you have an online tracker indicating the steps of my delivery??????? Don't waste your time dealing with these people. It's a hit or miss on the quality of your service or if you'll get your food at all.

I waited another hour and forty minutes, no pizza I proceeded to call over and over again they would not answer the phone.

My wife & I dined in, i ordered my usual, Big Dave\u2019s 16\u201d pizza, $22.50, & told the server to please make sure has plenty of sauce, because sometimes dry, I\u2019ve always ordered it this way. My wife got a Calzone, which the crust was a little burned in places & i told my wife not to eat if tasted burned, but being the nice lady she is, said no its fine.\nWhen i got my bill, i saw i was charged an extra $1.85 for sauce & asked the server when they started charging for sauce. She said she wasn\u2019t sure, but thats the way it was billed.  I told her she didn\u2019t say anything about & extra charge &  i had never been charged before. The manager came out & I explained to her that i just asked to make sure pizza had plenty of sauce on it like I always have. She just bluntly told me they consider extra sauce as another topping & thats why i was charged. I told her I didn\u2019t order extra sauce just wanted it not to be dry, like normal & thats why i always asked to make sure had plenty of sauce on it & I wasn\u2019t told there would be an extra charge by server. I can afford the $1.85, but for a $22.50 pizza, it needs sauce, & there wasn\u2019t extra sauce on it, just what i would consider normal.  This manager was very rude, didn\u2019t even offer to remove the extra charge, even though ive been coming their for years, & i know if Lillian were still a live would be disappointed in her attitude.\nAlso, was shocked that non of the servers were wearing masks & their social distancing was very lacking.   As customers came in, they just filed right by our table.\nHate this manager has run off a loyal customer over $1.85 over charge, been coming there for 20 years.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8890af40ac23e55f:0x6264e78f73c16c21"}

We didn't feel comfortable with the latter, and our bank has a charge for external ATMs, so we decided to wait. It was talking longer than we'd expected, and our plans started to be affected, so the \"manager\" came out to talk to us. She identified herself as such, but I doubt she was, because she had no managerial qualities. She didn't offer to discount even $5 for having to go through the wait or eventually having to pay ATM fees at the gas station ATM. In fact, she got defiant and said, \"This is not our fault, it's AT&Ts\". We were aware that this was something out of their control, but we had a family who was waiting to go to the beach, and because they have AT&T for their phone and CC services, they should've ensured their customers left happy and then resolved that with AT&T. As a manager, she should've apologized and offered something, whether it was a % off (even if small), or a gift card to return.

As if Covid -19 isn't bad enough, my trip to Lillian Pizza today was the worse. I drove about an hour from Foley to enjoy some pizza today. Have not been out for a meal since this pandemic and social distancing started. Arrived about 1:40pm. Nobody at the restaurant at all. Great no worries about social distancing. (important to us due the fact we a disabled and medically challenged seniors). Took a minute for the server to come and seat us. Ordered right away, just a 14\" large half and half pizza, nothing fancy. The server was OK, not very polite.\n\nAbout 25 mins later she comes out and tells us our pizza got burnt and needs to be remade. No checking on us the whole prior 25 mins. Again , we are the only people in the restraint. 3 people in the kitchen and 2 servers on the floor. Didn't offer us anything to eat while waiting for the remake on our pizza or even a I'm sorry. She walked away with an attitude.\n\n10 mins later she comes back by and asked if we want a salad. We said no, but that you need to take some money off our bill for having to wait for another pizza to be made. She said no. (take the salad or get nothing attitude) Another 5-10 mins, she comes back by and said, OK talked to the manager, we will take something off of your bill. And your pizza will be out in 5 mins. About 7 mins later, she brings the pizza, sets it on the table, no saying sorry again, and walks away.\n\nHere the kicker.... The second pizza was raw, yes raw. I go find the manager, or who I think is the manager, and show her. She said we can put it back in the oven. This is against  safety or health codes, or so I thought. She said we can order another pizza, with a 25 minute wait. Or we can get some other type of food. We have been there now for about 45+ mins, no food. Told her my husband is on dialysis and need to eat that we can't wait any longer. And told her we will just leave.\n\nYou'd think after all that , the manager would understand and offer a meal on the house if we would ever like to come back and try again. Got nothing and not even a true apology.\n\nThis is how you treat people now? who come out and try and give your business  our money during the pandemic. On top of being disabled seniors. I will not be back to Lillian Pizza again unless they make some important changes. I would post zero stars if I could.\n\nI really enjoyed the pizza here. Lillian has a pretty wide variety on their menu. I ordered the meat and a plain cheese pizza.\nThe wait is a bit long even when there was only a handful of other customers. Worth the wait.\nLillian Pizza has black board walls though out to keep little ones busy, or the young at heart entertained.\nYou can call in your order and pick it up or have it delivered.\nThey even have pickup stops to meet the driver if your home is out of the area. Kinda neat.\nOverall enjoyed my meal.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8890af40ac23e55f:0x6264e78f73c16c21"}

Upon first impression, I figured this might be some two-bit shack run by a mom and pop just trying to keep their heads above the water. A place that wasn't exceedingly great, but wasn't bad either.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThe large painted image of a cartoon fish chowing down on an equally cartoonish piece of pizza gave off the impression that this was some sort of seaside chuck-e-cheese knock-off complete with a goofy lazy-eyed fish or crab mascot dancing about the place. Fortunately, I was greeted by no such character. UNFORTUNATELY, what I was greeted with instead was an entire staff of 'Day One's ... or so it seemed. The teenage hostess was nice enough and I had no issue with her whatsoever. However, once we were seated it where this take of frustration begins...\n\nSitting down, our hostess informed us that our waiter would be right with us. I'm not entirely sure what 'right with you' must mean to these pizza-baking pepperoni-people, but the phrase (to me at least) means 'as soon as possible'. Four waiters in the course of some ten or so minutes walked by us and even made contact with us but not one stopped to ask if anyone had taken our drink orders. Then finally there came a young gentleman who I shall keep nameless... Lets call him 'Jim'.\n\nJim was very pleasant and friendly upon first encounter. He smiled and gave off a very professional vibe as he took our drink orders. After Jim went to fetch our drinks, I rose to see just what this 'buffett' was all about...\n\nIt was about a singlular olive and wilted spinach sprinkled GENEROUSLY over what I assumed was a razor-thin pizza. I've heard of thin crust, but had I breathed just a little too hard in the vicinity of the pizza, I might have blown it off the tray. Four pizzas of the same quality. This was their fabulous spread and, mind you, these were not whole pizzas. There were only a few slices left after previous customers had also had their fill of disappointment.\n\nI should note, however, they also provided two pasta dishes which could only be described as \"not terrible\" and \"it will make a turd\". Also, there was an attempt at salad. It was a good try.\n\nAfter my party and I picked at what we could stomach, it was finally time to head out. All we needed now was the check. That tiny piece of paper which would promptly be met with a few bills and a wave goodbye. However, I do often forget just how difficult of a task this truly can be as, apparently, not everyone is able to press a button and slap a few keys to make the big pretty machine go 'cha-ching!'...\n\nOh Jim... My sweet Jim. You were the chosen one. I trusted you.\n\nThe first ticket was brought out. Wrong. He went back to fix it. The second ticket was brought out. Wrong again. Once more, Dear Jim, went back... but this time, our server disappeared. Somewhere between the cash register and the kitchen, Jim vanished. I assume he got lost in the sauce because we sat for an additional twenty minutes. In the meantime, one of my party attempted to flag down another server to ask if he could just pay and go. The answer given was \"Yeah! We... Uh...Weh! Weh! S-sommmmeone will be right with you!\". He too dashed off only to be claimed by the sauce as well. Finally, Jim resurfaced and brought with him the new tickets. We slapped down our payment, gave a subtle farewell and left. I would say that there was no tip left behind, but alas, SOMEONE in our party left behind four dollars for Jim's trouble after traversing the sauce.\n\nLet it be known, however, the spaghetti was good.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8890af40ac23e55f:0x6264e78f73c16c21"}

The cook needs to go back for more training but I'm sure they are for from being classically trained at a place like this. Not one person looked Italian anyway.\n\nService was another story our table wasn't very clean but the waitress cleaned it better and apologized for it not being cleaner. They were busy at the time. My guess is there is no other \"real Italian \" place here. I do wish we went to carabbas where we went a few days prior.

I am tracking the order and it finally shows out for delivery and 15 minutes until delivery.  I watch the driver then go the opposite direction from our house and delivery somewhere else which took 15 minutes.  Our delivery then delayed to 20 minutes.  An hour after I placed my order we got our food.  I called after seeing the driver go in a different direction and talked to the store manager.  First she checked on my order and said it is only 15 minutes behind and they are on their way.  I explained that the driver went opposite of our house and that the delivery estimated time had increased double the expected time.  She explained they were understaffed only two drivers but that the order was on the way to our house so they took two orders at once.  With the tracker app, I was able to see the driver delivery the other order in the opposite direction before turning around and driving with two blocks of Papa John's to deliver to our house which was the opposite direction.  When I told the store manager that she argued with me and raised her voice.  It wasn't until I asked her not to yell at me that she toned down some but went back to complaining she had too many orders not enough driver's and I would have to deal with it.  I explained to her that by the time order would arrive it be an hour and almost double what I was promised and since the delivery person dropped off some where else first my pizza would not be hot which is was.  I expressed that the driver could have swung back in two blocks away on the way to my house and picked up my order and the pizza would have been hot and delivery time would be accurate.  She didn't want to hear it and told me she didn't have time to talk to me because she had orders, pizza, and stuff to do all while raising her voice again at me.  Poor customer service and I plan on calling the general manager Kirsten Fowler tomorrow.

Tyler, worlds worst pie store manager, with his nasty attitude and unprofessional work appearance was managing when we placed our order that was taken incorrectly. We ordered a 2liter Pepsi and they sent a Dr. Pepper.  We called and asked for an exchange. Tyler said he would send the driver. 1.5 hours later, no soda. I called again and Tyler said I was lying and no soda would be delivered. I asked his name, he wouldn\u2019t give it. I got in my car with the food that was delivered cold that we didn\u2019t even mention and the Dr Pepper. Took it to Tyler\u2019s location and asked for the corporate or franchisee information. He refused to give either. I asked for a refund which he promptly processed and walked away. Rude, disgusting attitudes and behaviors like his are what prompted this review. Best part...he did not give a rats ashtray...he knew I was recording and still acted like a McDonalds employee on their last day. I also called the Vestavia store before getting in the car to get the managers name. When I told the manager what I wanted, he put me on hold never to return. I called back 5-6 times and each time they immediately placed me on hold. Papa Johns is a once good product that has since become inferior in quality, customer service and value.

I made contact with a female at the Foley store that completely blew my issue off and she told me it wpuld be a 2 hour wait even after it's already been o er an hour by this time.  I asked her if i could speak to a manager about the internet complaint and she told me she was the manager and she couldn't help me. I asked for a corporate number and she told me she didn't know it but i could look it up online. She was DEFINITELY NOT CUSTOMER SERVICE MATERIAL! To say the least we ordered from another Pizza place and waited for our money to be refunded by Dominoes to our debit card.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0e13fd30db99:0xe30e83a629ebe7aa"}

No thats crazy and its not their fault. Last time yall said i could drive and come get some. Im not doing that either, i can go get a whole bottle for the price of 2 little suffl\u00e8 cups from yall. But i dont mind paying it for the convience except i almost never get what i pay for. I never take it out on the drivers and dont even complain cause its not their fault and i understand its just ranch. Its just getting old. I pay 21 something for one pizza and 2 ranches just for me, i give the driver 30 bucks and let them keep the change cause im in the server industry. How hard is it to ask for a little bit of ranch (that i PAY for) i mean come on. I hate leaving reviews like this but i swear ive proly paid 50 bucks just in ranch that i havent gotton.
