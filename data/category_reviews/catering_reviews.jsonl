Justin from Marta's bakery  was willing to do her first kosher cake, she came to our kitchen and learnt everything about it. She was beyond of her job, she brought the ingredients a day before and she helped us to decorate the cake and find special ingredients we requested in order to keep it kosher. Everybody loved it. She also figured out to find the birds I could not have the time to find it and did everything for a good price, punctuality and quality. Thanks Justin.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNq7xElu9zV7H44Zwc8QRhFPDhmvacx7MvWwOeC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889176806a3d1e3:0x4568031f7f24c6c9"}
