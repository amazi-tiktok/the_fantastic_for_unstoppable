The owner actually came out and played against us and soundly beat us. This is the real deal. Real lasers and not RF (radio frequency). The \"battleground\" is well laid out and has a ton of room to maneuver. There are some \"tricky\" twists in the form of \"bases,\" but you need to go play to find out about that. I highly recommend this as a great group, individual, or family outing. There were kids and adults playing with us. The game is monitored by security cameras, so that is an added safety feature. We have needed a place like this in Prattville for a long time. I would give this place more stars if that was an option. Thanks to the owner for giving us such a wonderful time.
