On Saturday October 26, 2019 my 23 year old daughter, my 9 year old daughter, and my 1 year old granddaughter went into this store. After browsing and finding a costume but not all of the needed accessories they left without making a purchase.They returned after visiting another Halloween store to purchase the costume. The manager then accused her of shoplifting and admitted to following them around the store. After my daughter willingly allowed her to look in her purse, finding nothing, the manager still called the police. My daughter stayed and waited on the police asking to see any video showing her shoplifting. The police officer then examined her purse and found nothing.The police officer asked them to leave and said that the manager did not want them to return to the store. I'm a little confused because I did not know that you could be banned from a store for trying to spend money, because my silly daughter was still wanting to purchase the costume.The manager never apologized or admitted to being mistaken, but she did say \"that she know what \"you people\" do and that she was going to jail and told my 9 year old that she and her niece were going to DHR.\" I'm glad that the people that had these great  experiences were not the \"you people\"  that steal.

My style of choice was a sleek ponytail. I paid $88 for a beautiful bundle of Barbie curl and $50 for the style. I told her before leaving that I felt insecure and asked her if she could spray more holding spray on the style. She sprayed a tiny bit more. However, the style didn\u2019t last a week. I did tie it down everyday. Didn\u2019t exercise. The ponytail broke in half after 3 days and the swoop moved everyday. The stylist Kierra put glue all over the bundle so, I can\u2019t reuse it. Basically money gone down the drain. Chanelle is very kind and professional. From what I saw she makes sure her clients are satisfied before leaving.
