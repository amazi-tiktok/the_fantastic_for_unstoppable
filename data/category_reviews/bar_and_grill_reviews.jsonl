There's two sets of bathrooms and the entire place is extremely clean and neat. The owner clearly put a lot of heart and thought into the design, layout, and decor. He's got style.\n\nThere's an ATM just inside the door and multiple points of sale at the bar for quick service. Behind the bar you'll find fully stocked beer coolers with great variety of crafts and classics; there's something for every palate. Soda guns, wines, liquors, and of course, an impressive selection of bourbons and whiskey. The grill menu offers selections of various made-to-order flatbread pizzas, fries, sandwiches, and some thiccc & delicious burgers. \ud83d\ude09 Check out the list of signature cocktails and try something fun, refreshing, and new!\n\nBring your boyfriend(s), girlfriend(s), wives, husband(s), mister(s) and mistress(es) to Blue's Bourbon & Brews for a great date night, or pull up a barstool and make yourself one of the \"regulars\".

Baked potato came with no side of butter and sour cream and I was PISSED when I got home to find out that the only reason I ordered the pork chop was for the apple chunk sauce only to find out there was no apple chunk sauce under my pork chop like in the picture and I swear they gave me the smallest pork chop they had in stock.

By the time the server finally arrived, we were ready to place both our drink and food orders. Another ten minutes pass before my water arrives; ten more minutes pass before my friend gets his drink. Another thirty minutes later, my friend's food arrives and my bowl of soup. I reminded the waitress that I ordered wings. She said she forgot to put the order in. She went to put the order in. When she came back, she said she gave them to another table and had to put the order in again. Then, on the third attempt, she brought boneless wings. I ordered traditional bone-in wings. By this time, we had been at Applebee's for over two hours... way beyond my allotted one hour for lunch break. I asked how long it would take to bring the correct wings. She said 5 minutes. She took the boneless wings back and  I waited even longer for the correct wings. All this time, I'm watching my friend eat, I'm in a hurry, and my soup was too hot to eat. I had taken a bite and it scalded the roof of my mouth. The waitress then overcharged me for the wings which were that day's \"Special\". She charged me double. She went to correct my ticket, taking up even more time.

Well once we received our food (one at a time) we were ready to go. And guess what.....they didn't even have to go boxes. The server who was really nice had to take our food to the back to wrap in plastic wrap! No manager came out to apologize and when I called this morning he seemed to not even care.

She also took more than 20 minutes away from use with our credit cards. This however wasn't the biggest problem. When I called to tell the restaurant that my husband never received his ID back and that I'd like them to get it back a women answered the phone saying she (my waiter) was never suppose to leave the table with the ID, only look. (But that's not what happened) she sent a male to check on it and came back with 30 seconds saying there was no ID, but that's okay. I thought that if I called back the next day maybe I could get the server and ask her if she accidentally placed it in her pocket or even a worker who was actually willing to look. The hostess who answered told me that she (my former waiter) wasn't there at the moment I said okay that's fine, are you allowed to tell me when she'll be in or no? She says \"ummm hold on\" (if the answer is no, a simple no is fine) she then puts a very upset male on the phone he begins to talk and says \"yea this is Mark!!\" (Whom I didn't ask for) I said hi sir, I was calling trying to see if [name] was in today. He says\" well  [name] who??!!!!\" I said I'm sorry I don't know her lastname she was my server. And he said interrupting \"well we don't have a [name] that's works here bye!\" The hostess had already confirmed she works there by saying she wasn't in at the time and so did her name tag, so the uneccessary lie was weird to me.

The menu and especially the burgers are inventive and intriguing, the location is great for us mid-towners, and the building has a special charm to it.  As stated elsewhere, the service is not professional.  At brunch recently, we waited 20 minutes before we saw a waiter.  We waited another 10 minutes after we were finished eating before we were able to get our check.  The staff are all friendly enough, just don't seem to know how to properly wait on tables.\n\nThe Food....    Best thing on the menu I've tried is the burgers... but there are cheaper better burgers elsewhere in midtown.  I suppose it is the only place you can get a burger sandwiched between two donuts, but then again, why would you want a burger sandwiched between two donuts?  The Red Beans and Rice (even though it was recommended) was the worst red beans and rice I've ever had. It completely lacked in flavor.  Recently, at brunch, their complementary beignets, were gooey and and not cooked well.  I tried their fries with shredded chicken wings and cheese... it was ok but am not a fan of their wing sauce.  Then I had their special of the day, a breakfast bowl.  I should have known from the description, it wasn't going to be good. It completely lacked in flavor. My partner in crime ordered the meatloaf cupcakes and was served a grayish brown pile of mushy meatloaf and spuds with gravy.  Kind of disgusting and no flavor.  Also disappointing was the quality of coffee and their bloody marys which didn't have a good flavor or bite.\n\nThey have a decent beer selection but their craft beers are $6 and up a pint. Kind of rich for my taste.\n\nAll in all, I really hope they are able to get things fixed. I think in trying to find their niche, they've focussed more on an inventive menu than quality food. I'll stick to the restaurants with quality and flavor than wacky combinations.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4de05df85c3f:0x40b9eb3676f98774"}

After finally going for lunch today, I can say with certainty that this place is vastly overrated. Based on the menu selections, it's supposed to be a quasi-Cajun/Creole place. Dishes such as crawfish pasta and alligator are represented on the menu, however there are two big problems. First, the food is incredibly bland. Having eaten in New Orleans more times than I can remember, I would say the chef has toned down the food to cater to a broader (i.e., non-New Orleans) audience. The result is less than stellar. Second, the prices are way over the top. $15 for a simple pasta dish with only a couple of crawfish in the sauce is beyond the pale. The place is attractive enough and the service pleasant, but not enough to justify the emptying of my wallet on mediocre food.

We had a couple hiccups throughout the night nothing major but he was on top of it and made sure we had the best experience ever, we appreciate that man. Third an last shout out is to the man that set this all up for me over the phone Mr. John Cole. Without you and all your guidance and emails we would have never had this experience. Thanks again. If your looking for a good time and are over the age of 21 and wanna do a group event totally look into the King Pin Package here. I promise you that you won't regret the decision.

We make it a point to get in the boat and get to Pirates Cove. It has a run down feel, where people are laid back and dress how they please. There are patrons that bring dogs and just a few random dogs running around the grounds but make no fuss over you unless you call them. It is always busy. You can drive there, pull up to the marina in your boat or just beach it. Kids can play in the water or sand beach area. In my opinion they make the best bushwackers PERIOD.

We have to get a table because my  86 years old adopted  Mother has dementia and down \ud83d\udd3b n a wheelchair.  After waiting 20 minutes still no table available. My adopted 81 year old Dad asked to speak to a manager. The host then got us a table after waiting 30 minutes. We looked in all corners and they were available tables everywhere. When the manager did come to our table I told her about our experience and  asked her why this happened and she explained she was short handed with staff and she was swamped with doing to go orders. If someone is in a wheelchair and I can't stand very long and there's no sense in them not offering at least a place that's available to sit until our table was available. I have a bad torn hamstring. If management don't get better we will take our business somewhere else. I will be contacting cooperate office. I have the manager's name's. This is very bad customer service when we are regular customers and my adopted parents drive a long distance. Besides this Logan's the one in Moody is even much worse. We've gave Moody chance after chance. It's poor management at that store. It's ashame I just moved here a year ago and when I first started going and our good experience only lasted maybe 3-4 months now we can't even eat here anymore. It's lousy. Don't do any good to talk to the manager. Moody  Al don't know how too cook a medium rare steak. It's always too tough. I should have sent it back but I didn't. I had to feed it to my patients dog so it didn't go entirely to waste but was still very expensive steak to not get to enjoy. t's time to go to cooperate office with this!

There were three factors. Baby Back Ribs were not properly cooked......an ongoing problem at all the locations in the Birmingham area.  I have learned to have a picture on my phone showing the proper preparation when I run into this problem.  As I was politely attempting to explain this issue with manager John Prince, Mr. Prince's attitude was hostile, uncooperative and confrontational. When I asked if he knew how they were supposed to be cooked, he replied, why don't you tell me how they are supposed to be cooked.    At this point I knew I needed to document the conversation and started my phone recorder.  Mr. Prince said I am not going to talk with that recorder on.  I asked Mr. Prince's name and he just stared at me.  I then prepared to leave and Mr. Prince said his name and walked off.  My waitress did a splendid job.  The issue with the ribs is they were pre-cooked as usual, but then they were not finished on the grill.  They were warmed up and BBQ sauce smeared on them. It appears that race may have even been an issue.......I am white and Mr. Prince is black. Mr. Prince never acknowledged the ribs were not properly cooked nor did he offer any apologies or consolation for my dining experience. At approximately 5:15 pm, Logan's District Mgr Charlie Eben called me in response to my complaint.  Mr. Eben assured me that employees would be retrained to insure that proper food preparation would result and the John Prince would also be counseled.  Sorry Mr. Eben!  I have heard promises like that too many times.  It is a roll of the dice no matter how many free meal cards you want to send me.  Your sincerity is in doubt.  There are too many good and quality companies out there with whom I will do business.  Just for the record, I am including a photo of your signature Baby Back Ribs when prepared properly.....and this photo was taken at the Trussville location several years ago when they were doing it right!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5meTA3g87mqIEgBhLxUFVvMvDBZsYFfZ7Pi9K=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOruS7JqwKqimfLfTToU9zMi6yQsE4lgxgHOyW=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1488303649780, "text": "Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

I asked The hostess how much longer and she said her manager was waiting for a party to finish before she sat us. Another 10 minutes went by and I began to get upset because our placement should not be based on when another family finishes eating. We were about to get up and leave but a server came and got us, told us he was working a big party but he would be more than glad to serve us.

Now granted I am not an unreasonable person nor am I impatient but the lack of professionalism displayed by the management team was unacceptable. We arrived around 6:20 we were not eating to well over 8:00 pm. I didn't want any discount or free food just the common courtesy to say I'm sorry for your wait and we will get you and your family served as soon as possible, but I guess that was too much to ask for.

We sent the wings back and told the server that we would pay for the three wings he ate and ordered something else. The manager came out, not to apologize, but to tell us that we didn't need to pay for the three wings. Oh ok, thanks. Guess that was his solution to the problem but then we receive the replacement meal. The replacement meal that we paid full price for and paid extra to get an upgraded side of macaroni and cheese that came in a container that was less than half full. So what do we do?

That would be my only complaint all in all good spot to eat!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1480170680208, "text": "Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

Over half of the restaurant was empty. Then they seated four 2 tops before me and my wife and 1 child. Even though we were next in line according to the hostess. I can understand seating 2 tops over 3 because they are busy and that's what's available but they had half of the restaurant empty. There was no reason to adhere to section integrity when tables are open. Then they were out of the steak I ordered and when the steak I chose  was served it was cold.\n\nIn the end the food wasn't bad but wasn't worth what I paid or the 2 plus hours we spent there. I have finally learned my lesson and will never ever give them another chance.\n\nWe never heard from a manager to explain what was going on.

Hands down the WORST dining experience I've ever had in my 30 years. The wait wasn't too terribly bad, but after we were seated was terrible.\n\nMy roommate, her son, her girlfriend, and I were sat and promptly greeted by our server. We each ordered drinks, and then our food. The salads were pretty good, but then things took a U-turn.\n\nOur food was first brought out to the table next to us. When we brought this to the attention of the server who brought it, he said \"Let me go check the ticket.\" I know from some knowledge shared with me that when that happens, a fresh order is to be made because it touched the table. So the same man finally brings us our food, with the exception of my roommate, which I happen to know is another mistake, as we should have all been served together. I should also note these plates were the same ones as before, which I happen to know because I had a clear line of sight to the kitchen from where we were sitting. This is a health violation.\n\nSo after bringing our steaks out, I notice mine is undercooked (I ordered medium and got medium rare). My roommate's girlfriend's steak has been cut into, which is ANOTHER huge no-no. When this was brought to the attention of the man who brought them out (the same man I mentioned before), he claimed that was how it was cooked and acted as if he didn't care when we stuck a knife straight through the pre-existing hole in the middle of the steak.\n\nAfter the guy walks off, my roommate's girlfriend goes to our server and asks to speak with a manager. Our server points directly at THE GUY WHO HAD BROUGHT US OUR FOOD. You remember him- the rude one. So she asks if there is another manager around. Keep in mind that my roommate still hasn't seen the first morsel of her food. She informs her that the other manager's name is Jennifer and she will be right over. Jennifer was great and went above and beyond to try and turn our visit around. She quickly explains she will check on my roommate's food and bring fresh steaks out to replace the ones we had.\n\nMy roommate finally gets her food, and there is cinnamon all over her baked sweet potato- which she specifically ordered without cinnamon. But there is also cinnamon all over her steak- why would the steak have cinnamon on it in the first place? So they bring out a fresh potato, which tastes like it's been sitting out for about 2-3 days before it was brought out to the table.\n\nMy roommate's girlfriend and I finally get our fresh steaks, and mine is RARE when I cut into it- worse than before.\n\nWe left not having to pay for any of our food, including what my roommate's son ate because his was fine- but I still won't be back.

Let me say I've been to this Logan's many times since it opened, in fact it use to be one of my favorite restaurants in Trussville, but that has definitely changed. We got there a little after 2 PM and had to wait for a table until almost 3 PM. Now, I understand it was a Saturday, so even though it was annoying I was willing to look past it. Once we sat down, we sat there for 45 MINUTES without anyone even acknowledging that we were there. My uncle had to get up and go find someone to even get them to come take our drink order. After finally placing our drink order, it took another 45 minutes to get our drinks...and most of us ordered WATER. Our waitress had a terrible attitude,  we didn't even get our food until almost 5 PM, and once we did get it, it was not good. 3 1/2 hours for what should have been a simple lunch, when most of it was due to sitting around waiting on someone to even acknowledge that we were there is ridiculous. If it hadn't been for my grandmother refusing to leave, we would have left. And then, when my uncle asked about getting a discount, because there was no way we were paying full price for the terrible service, the manager had the nerve to ask \"Why do you need a discount?\" Even the management didn't seem to care. Needless to say, I will never be back.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1487439208391, "text": "We're sorry to hear we fell short of a great time.

However, after this pass weekend, they left me no choice. My fiance' and I go to Logan's faithfully, so needless to say, we have spent too much money in this place to be treated the way we were. The service and food quality has really gone down hill. Quite frankly, I can see why they're having to close so many locations now because the competition is better. Granted, all of the other Logan's in this city ARE indeed horrible, but this one was still the best in my book. That is no longer that case!\n\nFirst of all, we ordered a basket of fried pickles, and we received a half of half basket of fried pickles. I would rather they just told us they were out rather than bring us what they did. We ate those because we were hungry, it was getting late, and we expected a much better dinner than appetizer. It got no better! We waited over 30 minutes for food, and when we got it, most of it was cold as hell. I guess our waitress forgot about it and left it on the counter. My fiance' had meatloaf that was not thoroughly cooked in certain areas, he never got the fries he ordered, so he practically left everything on his plate, he never touched the mashed potatoes and gravy. Our waitress took up our concerns with the manager about our 30-minute wait and the missing items, and as a courtesy she removed 3 whole dollars from our ticket. That was the cost of a side! Gee thanks! You took off what exactly? Our taxes off one of our sides! Then she goes on to explain that they had a party of 35 people come in that they had no idea was coming. That's great, but what the hell does that have to do with us? That's not our problem!! If your business can't serve large parties while maintaining the quality and integrity of your food to all other visitors then you SHOULDN'T be in business... PERIOD!\n\nBasically, we paid full price for horrible food and horrible service. It's sad because we WERE faithful customers, and Logan's just lost us.

I have eaten here several times and the service has been average, but yesterday was awful. The hostess said it was a 30minute wait to get a table and their were people ahead of me waiting. However she said that if I would sit at the bar that there would be no wait and I would get immediate service. What a misstatement. As I proceeded to the bar, I couldn't help but notice 6 tables empty and wondered why no one had been seated there. Anyway, I sat at the bar and spoke to the gentleman who was seated to the right of me. He said that it had taken 20 minutes for them to take his to go order and that he had been waiting an additional 40 minutes for his prime rib order to come. After about 20 minutes of waiting myself, the bartender/waiter finally brought me a menu. I told him I wasn't expecting to wait an hour for my  food like the gentleman next to me. He said food was coming out in about 30minutes which obviously wasn't happening. Finally the waiter came to take the order of the gentleman on my left side who was with a young boy. He had been waiting over 30 minutes for his order to be taken. He explained to the waiter that he had ordered prime rib on his last visit and was disappointed because there was more fat than meat on his portion.  The waiter told him that the prime rib is usually very fatty and that gives flavor to the meat. I thought to myself that I have eaten prime rib at many places that had little fat and was very meaty, juicy and tender. The bartender/Waiter then suggested that the gentleman order the new York strip. At that moment I changed my mind about ordering the  16 ounce prime rib and decided that I would order the 22 ounce porterhouse,if I could ever get my order taken. By then the poor guy on my right was getting antsy because he had been there over an hour and said that if he had not already paid for his to go order that he would leave. Finally someone else came and asked him what he had ordered since he had been sitting there forever. That  person went to the kitchen and the bartender finally came out about 5 minutes later with the man's order. I thought to myself I hope he has his order right in his bag after that awfully long wait. So now I've been waiting over 35 minutes and still have not had my order taken. So now the bartender waiter guy goes to take someone else's order, bless their soul who was there before me. At that point, I could not take anymore,so I politely got up and told the people around me to have a nice evening and left. I would think that a major franchise as Logan's Roadhouse would provide extra help on busy days like Sunday. I left went to the grocery store and bought a large tbone steak and took it home and cooked it. Oh, also one lady ordered only potato skins to go and said she has been there over 30 minutes.

I have eaten here several times and the service has been average, but yesterday was awful. The hostess said it was a 30minute wait to get a table and their were people ahead of me waiting. However she said that if I would sit at the bar that there would be no wait and I would get immediate service. What a misstatement. As I proceeded to the bar, I couldn't help but notice 6 tables empty and wondered why no one had been seated there. Anyway, I sat at the bar and spoke to the gentleman who was seated to the right of me. He said that it had taken 20 minutes for them to take his to go order and that he had been waiting an additional 40 minutes for his prime rib order to come. After about 20 minutes of waiting myself, the bartender/waiter finally brought me a menu. I told him I wasn't expecting to wait an hour for my  food like the gentleman next to me. He said food was coming out in about 30minutes which obviously wasn't happening. Finally the waiter came to take the order of the gentleman on my left side who was with a young boy. He had been waiting over 30 minutes for his order to be taken. He explained to the waiter that he had ordered prime rib on his last visit and was disappointed because there was more fat than meat on his portion.  The waiter told him that the prime rib is usually very fatty and that gives flavor to the meat. I thought to myself that I have eaten prime rib at many places that had little fat and was very meaty, juicy and tender. The bartender/Waiter then suggested that the gentleman order the new York strip. At that moment I changed my mind about ordering the  16 ounce prime rib and decided that I would order the 22 ounce porterhouse,if I could ever get my order taken. By then the poor guy on my right was getting antsy because he had been there over an hour and said that if he had not already paid for his to go order that he would leave. Finally someone else came and asked him what he had ordered since he had been sitting there forever. That  person went to the kitchen and the bartender finally came out about 5 minutes later with the man's order. I thought to myself I hope he has his order right in his bag after that awfully long wait. So now I've been waiting over 35 minutes and still have not had my order taken. So now the bartender waiter guy goes to take someone else's order, bless their soul who was there before me. At that point, I could not take anymore,so I politely got up and told the people around me to have a nice evening and left. I would think that a major franchise as Logan's Roadhouse would provide extra help on busy days like Sunday. I left went to the grocery store and bought a large tbone steak and took it home and cooked it. Oh, also one lady ordered only potato skins to go and said she has been there over 30 minutes. I give yesterday at Logan's a negative -10.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1545182424141, "text": "Hi, Ira.

We even put in an appetizer of spinach dip. An hr goes by and still no food or appetizer. Finally, and hr and 10 mins later, the appetizer comes out, and it was salted and tasted old. We had them take it back. An hr and 30 mins later, or food comes out.... I ordered shrimp and rice with a sweet potato... yeah no sweet potato and the food visibility looked old, but was cold. Finally the manager comes out and says I'll take it to the back and put it in the microwave... really? We waited 2 hrs for food and now you want to microwave it? Uugghhh no.. I wont be going back.

The last 2 times we have come it has not been a good experience. Either the food is subpar or the service or both. Tonight we waited over 10 minutes to even be greeted. We had to get up and say something to the hostess for someone to come to the table. Well, then we waited another 5-10 minutes for drinks and rolls. I know it took our door an hr to come out.

Yesterday June 11th my family and I went there for my daughter's birthday dinner. We got seated right away. But then it took 10 minutes before the waitress came to take our drink orders. This was shocking since the restaurant was fairly empty. Also The waitress tried to bring my daughter Coca-Cola  twice when she had sweet tea that was empty . But that is not a big deal. Upon receiving our steaks That's when we were told that what my youngest daughter ordered they did not have. They asked her to re-order while the rest of us had our food in front of us.\nI am not the type of parent that will eat in front of my child that has nothing. At that point I asked to speak to the manager. I watched as the waitress went over to the manager and told her I would like to see her. But she did not come right over. It took at least five minutes before she came to see what was going on. I explained what had happened and she did not even apologize. I asked her what we can do at this point. She said she would take our food back and make sure that we all got them served at the same time. It just did not sit right with me that she did not apologize and I had to ask what we can do to fix the situation. At that point I asked her for a check because we were leaving. It was then she just pointed towards the door. Again not apologizing or saying you don't owe anything. Just pointing towards the door. So we walked out and left the food on the table To say I am disappointed is an understatement. I especially felt bad for my daughter who just wanted to eat there on her birthday.

His side salad never came with his order. I waited 20 min for a box to take our nasty food home to give to our dog. When I asked the waitress if she could get my to go side salad as fast as she could (seeing that I already paid for it and I over paid on my bill) there was literally about 3-4 bites of lettuce. My son had practice at 6:00 and it was close to 5:50. Mind you we we got there at 4:45 and ordered right away with our drink order. We were done eating before 5:30. This is a real shame since my son is obsessed with your dinner rolls and we frequently dine there. I will never go back again. I paid for things I didn't get. I don't know if the cook was new but my steak had so much seasoning on it it was barely edible. I scraped as much off as possible. If our waitress would have been more attentive I would have said something. We spent too much of our time seated with no one taking care of us. Even when I said I have to go please give me my receipt to sign, she dropped it off with no pen. Leaving me to have to chase down another waitress to borrow her pen.

But now my friend and I look back (2-3 days later) because we're still distraught over our experience, there were several red flags, which started from the moment we walked in to be seated.\n\n1.  When we walked in to be seated there was a customer complaining about there service and how they never received items that they ordered.\n\n2.  The first thing we noticed once seated (which was promptly considering they weren't busy at all) was the table across from us hadn't been cleaned.\n\n3.We sat for about 15 minutes before a server (black male). finally came to our table.  He stands there with his arms crossed speaking abruptly says, \"have y'all decided what you you want to order\". Without a greeting or introducing himself, we were caught off guard because it felt like he was a drill Sargent commanding us to order our food! We ordered and noticed his arms were still crossed AND noticed he wasn't writing down our order!  It felt as if someone made him come to serve our table.\n\n4.  While we were enjoying our appetizer, which a nice, cheerful young lady brought to us, he returns once to let us know since it was 2:44 p.m., it was too early to put our order into the system because  it's a certain time to order the 2 for $15.99 special, which we understood.\n\nAs a result of not writing down our order initially he came back to ask what our orders were again!  Then shortly after that, the initial young lady comes back to ask my friend what his entree was.\n\n5.  Also, while we initially started eating our appetizer, we noticed there were no napkins.  My friend had to get up (while on crutches and wearing a boot) had to go find us napkins!\n\n6.  The entrees were served and the first thing I noticed was my salmon seemed very dry and I thought it was because the oil topping was missing.  I also noticed I received a mushroom skewer, which I'm allergic to mushrooms.  I was supposed to receive the veggie skewer.\n\n7.  The table across from us still hasn't been cleaned, this has been after sitting there over an hour (2:30 - 3:30 at least) looking at it.\n\n8.  After talking to the sweet manager and explaining to her that this could be a training moment for our server(at this point we hadn't started eating to notice the actual condition of our food), by this time,  we're frustrated and ready to leave.\n\n9.  While the female manager was adjusting our ticket to remove the appetizer, I noticed my food wasn't cooked properly.  The sweet potato wasn't cooked all the way through!\n\nMy friend has to get up once again, now to request carry out containers because we haven't seen our server lately except from across the room while he was just standing there talking to someone.\n\nThe server comes to ask if we need carry out containers.  I explain that my friend just left to go find containers. At this point he realizes hat we can use a refill on our water, which was the best 2nd thing we've had after the appetizer.\n\n10.  The next day (Sunday).my friend takes his dinner to work and realizes his chicken isn't done in the middle!  This is when he and I start to reflect on our overall dining  experience at this location!,\n\nI do not recommend this location, please consider the Fultondale or Crestwood locations, l've only had good service and food from these locations.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1496690231605, "text": "We're sorry to hear about your experience.

We waited 30 min to get our drinks and bread and 45 min for our wing appetizer. When we asked why he told us the kitchen was backed up.

The steak was not seasoned had to use steak sauce. My daughter asked for extra queso which took 15 min to get her food was cold by the time it came out. The manager came out and explained the kitchen was not backed up and explained Dusty was new and he brought me the avocado they were out of.

Whether it be something I can play with or just an interesting educational display, it's always fun walking around and seeing what appeals to me. I especially liked the Illuminated fog, Geysers, Giant mirror, Colored shadows, Slinky trampoline and Scott Weaver's Toothpick sculpture. The giant mirror kept us entertained for quite some time as it was super trippy walking around in front of it. Bobby L showed his skills with the slinky trampoline. When none of us could do it for longer than 5-10 seconds, Bobby made it go on forever. The toothpick sculpture is impressive as well. It took the artist 40 years to make it, but he recently added his face to the sculpture. It was frustrating for some to find, but I found the whole process amusing.

My honey is having rum & cokes & I'm slammin' my usual ice waters with triple lemons :-) It's good music chips, salsa & queso with a breeze of the bay baby!!\n\nI'm ashamed to see that I've failed to write an appropriate review before now but it may be because we were enjoying ourselves so much that I just dropped a quick note and forgot to come back and correct it but whatever the reason let's fix this now.\n\nFirst of all this is a real-life locals place and I found it way before I was a bonafide local and loved it. It's not on the proverbial beaten path and you had to be looking for it to find it to begin with. It's not out of the way, mind you, but it's a straight shot out canal road a couple miles past Doc's at the big intersection and right on the water across the bay from Zeke's, Cobalt's & Perdido Pass. There's a long and spacious parking area right out front that will accommodate enough cars to pack the place to the rafters and there's a couple long transient piers by the docks so access by water is easy and free.\n\nIt's a huge palapa bar that looks like what you'll find on any given Caribbean island with big surround bar with tables all around plus a series of tables around a wrap around deck that all looks out onto the long series of boat docks just past their nice patch of sand (about 25' wide with cornhole games) and of course  the water. The view is excellent from almost everywhere you are except in the sand pit. Oh yes, the sand pit is another bar about 15' lower that has more tables, a big circular lounging palapa, some adult swings and even high chairs for youngsters. I do se thst's where some folks bring their kids but they're okay anywhere. It is more than just a bar, indeed they serve some pretty good food here too. Before the food & drinks you can sit inside under the massive thatch roof that's \"decorated\" with a lot of random stuff from pirate paraphernalia to neon signs & enjoy the open air beach bar vibe with some live music or pick any spot down in the pit, by the docks, in the sand or on the deck to just relax & chill.\nside note: they have 2 gender neutral bathrooms that have the only air conditioners on the property :-)\n\nOn to the food, my personal favorites are the fish tacos and the crab cakes but there's a good selection of other stuff as well. For apps there's nachos, seafood gumbo, homemade pork skins, wings & other bar food finger foods. Tjey've got some salads, and their sandwiches include my fav the pork tenderloin plus burgers, Buffalo chicken & pulled pork & a club. For entrees there's Gulf fresh shrimp & fish baskets, fish tacos & wraps. But wait there's more ... they have some pretty darn good pizza with a big selection that rival a pizzeria. For sweets there's two offerings for dessert, the hot fudge brownie with chocolate sauce & 2 scoops of vani\u013ala ice cream, that's okay but the key lime pie is way better.  All that plus they do have a kids menu.\n\nI haven't tried their bushwackers but I've heard they're good and they serve a variety of frozen & island drinks and importantly the beer is good & cold.\n\nBottom line: It can get pretty full after quttin' time (remember I said locals) but you can probably get a seat at the bar until a table opens up. The food is pretty good, the service is friendly and good and if you're local or not and looking for a great view with a beachy island feel then this is the place you were looking for", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfFy_5vLljfTp9cQP7CwFgQmbUuqpXx3OItZMQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrpDFbM0knxgrpGDKYJBjzQSLRiJhG2yWDAP3T=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYs_rE1tVUzK5fYr0xvsG621K34EsK-d2MYqCb=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a07923b85a75d:0x13b6a173f35cf9fb"}

I asked the bartender where the cash was and she said she took it and put it by register. It was not enough to pay the tab, so why take it and place by the register?  So, she placed the cash back in tab holder And refused to deduct the $38 cash from the tab so we could then pay the balance with our debit card, so we paid with the debit card. We had drank quite a bit and thought we had put the cash back on our possession, but after we got home, we realized they had kept the cash and we paid the entire $72 tab.

Had a hard day at work and wanted sit down and have a nice lunch with a friend. Our first choice was Cracker Barrel but the wait was an hour. So we went O'Charleys which is one of my favorite restaurants so I didn't mind at all.\nIt was chilly outside and it was super cold inside so we asked for hot teas and were informed that they were out of tea and coffee. Really?! Well, I never. So I had to go to my car and get my OWN HOT TEA to drink.\nThen the signature rolls arrived. They we're not even the size of a playing card and just as flat and hard.\nWhen my potato soup arrived it looked so good, I was excited to dig in. I dipped my spoon in and pulled it back up and not one piece of potato came up. I stirred my spoon around frantically and only found one piece in the entire bowl. Mind you, my friend had the same experience.\nOnce the entrees came out, the food did get a little better but by then I was so disappointed and I was so cold it was no way to make it better. I felt bad for the server because he was excellent but he kept apologizing for things that were out of his control. Almost at the end of the meal, the manager comes by and asks us about our meal. We ask her about the tea and bread and soup and she quickly excuses them away. And closes the conversation with free pie coupon.\nWell alrighty then!!\nI didn't need a coupon, one apology from her would have been worth twenty from the server. It needs to be understood that when customers voice concerns, they are not 1. Always complaining and 2. Always trying to get something free.\nIf you take the time to listen you may actually get better CUSTOMER CARE, SERVICE, AND SATISFACTION.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlo_zmzI9uq_Pnu5cFU-D9ZvumL4jzYmwpG3Vx=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOX2fzL-TWXwkyJxJeXvtlpCSGRbANiuG7QR9YQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxlV9Zx6yvxpT4ejGMmZwWHhrwvgJWuA1HSZIc=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccb6376cb87c3:0x50aaada97876e555"}

I have no complaints about the service, our waitress was nice. The food however is a pile of greasy pig slop and should not be consumed by humans.\n\nI hadn't ordered a steak in awhile at a restauraunt so I said let's do it. The steak I ordered was supposed to be  medium rare and it came out half medium half rare, so I guess I got medium rare hahaha. It was like chewing on leather each bite and was absolutely horrible. The appetizer was greasy potato slices with some decent tasting cheese dip. The sides were disgustingly mushy and sour tasting broccoli.

Ordered the Cajun Ribeye dinner anticipating it to be the same exceptional quality it's historically been and it was pathetic. The ribeye was tough and a poor quality cut, it was drowning in the sauce, and the two sides were unusually bland tasting. I had to spoon the watery cajun sauce on the sides to give them a little more zest. Had I not skipped lunch that day in giddy anticipation of eating here, I would've left. I was blown away by the overwhelming sadness of this $34 entree, especially when some generic steakhouses serve better quality cuts for less money. What happened to this place? I used to brag to people about how awesome the food is here and would recommend it in a heartbeat; however, I hesitate to suggest it now... I really hope they get it together and bring the quality of this dish back to its former glory!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b515e53b43f:0xa1748840b10c8590"}

We then asked for the manger, paid our bill and left.\n\nWe understood that they were busy, but when the larger party ( that was seated AFTER us) at the table next to us was getting their steaks and alcoholic beverages at faster rate and simply receiving better service, we realized that were second rate patrons at this establishment.

Unfortunately, like others have said, the service sometimes can be downright neglectful.\nWe have been about six time now and two of the experiences were amazing, both in terms of food and service.  Two were mixed, one with food being great/service being slow, one with great service/overly greasy and over cooked food... the other two? Slow/forgetful/neglectful service with food that was missing the usual seasonings, condiments, or sides.\nSeriously,  I want to LOVE this place.  I did the first time I went, and, despite the wait to be seated and the huge crowd that night, food and service were outstanding.  Slower days seem to be a big miss, for some reason, and things are just off the majority of the times we have gone back since.\nI DO RECOMMEND GIVING IT A TRY, and hopefully you will have an experience like my first.  It has quickly fallen out of our list of \"usual\" spots due to inconsistencies in both food and service.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b515e53b43f:0xa1748840b10c8590"}

We received our food over a hour after ordering.

When trying to explain that our orders were cold, she basically tells us, it\u2019s OUR fault! We didn\u2019t have a reservation! The problem I have with that statement...Why not tell us that at the door when we initially came in? We would have understood that. But to tell me and our guests it was our fault because our food was cold was not what I was expecting! She went on to turn our tour on Huntsville into a nightmare!

We arrived at 8:00pm and there was a wait but most places seemed like there were wait times so we didn\u2019t mind waiting and having a quick drink at the bar. We were sat at 8:30 outside, which we were thankful about because it was so loud inside. After waiting 20 minutes for a server to come by our table, and watching others get sat and greeted immediately, I went and spoke to the hostess and let her know the situation. I went back to my table and watched inside as it seemed no one knew who was supposed to be taking care of our table. At 9:00 someone finally came by and apologized and said he\u2019d tell the manager what happened and see what he could do for the mess up. No manager ever came by and nothing was done. I was very upset as I\u2019ve worked in a restaurant before and these things happen but you take care of the guests when they do happen.

They had wonderful selection of 32 draft taps with craft beers from from Alabama to Germany. They even had 5 house made crafts that would delight any lover of craft beer.  The food albeit  bar food in nature, had an upscale feel. The coffee crusted strip was delicious and the fish and chips was on the money.  You will not regret visiting this hidden gem in Huntsville.

They have an extensive selction of beers on tap, but the menu lacks any description on the flavors or character of each beer. I asked for a stout, and the server recommendd an imperial stout from Denver, which was OK, but arrived as a small 10 oz pour. Then I asked for a pint of Porter, and got the Abita Boubon Street Porter from Louisiana. I'm not sure why they call it a Porter, cause it is not - it's super sweet, like syrup mixed with Bourbon. In short - disgusting. After 2 small sips, I knew I could not drink it, and asked if I could trade it in for a normal brown ale or stout, as this was the only Porter on the menu. \"No\" was the flat answer. So I fessed up \"should have ordered a flight\" I said, \"to sample the options\" - even though the fact they had flights was never mentioned. The answer was still \"No\" to any exchange. So I did something I've never done before, pocketed the tip, and left a full beer on the counter. It would hae been easy to provide courteous service so I'd be writing a good review, but these guys are jerks.

The service is HORRIBLE!\nMy husband and I tried this restaurant for the first time today. My husband got the prime rib, bacon, and potatoes. I got the chocolate gravy and biscuit, hasbrown casserole, and chicken sausage. My husband said his prime rib wasn't good but the other two were good. My food was good but the biscuit definitely could have knocked someone out with how hard it was. The food was good but we wont be back, doesn't seem like they care though because a father and son said that service is horrible every time they go.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b515e53b43f:0xa1748840b10c8590"}
