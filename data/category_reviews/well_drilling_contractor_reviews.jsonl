After a year of begging Alms Pump to come reconnect the electric wires in the older pump house that they disconnected to put a check valve,  I had to hire an electrician ($126) to come restore electricity in the pump house so that the lights could be turned on for freezing weather that was 2 days after the 2 days of freezing weather.  The bulb receptacle that was removed without my permission was bought and remounted as the backup bulb.\nIt makes no sense to mistreat a customer who is a disabled Army Veteran and have been a loyal paying customer.\n\nBuyer beware\n\nAlms pump does not care about their customers.  You cannot trust them to do the job right especially if you leave them and trust that they will do right by you.   I paid $450 for a check valve but the aggravation they caused me for a year to reconnect the electric wires they disabled, removed a light bulb socket without my permission, and had leaking pipes at the new pump, I should charge them $500 or more.\n\nSo, buyer beware.\n*********************************\nNov 10, 2020 update:\nAlm Pump finally came to fix the leaking pipes..  Hurricane Sally busted the leaking pipes open and water was pumped on the grounds for 2 to 3 days and nights. It could have burned up the new pump. I wondered why there were 4 inches of water on the ground 3 days after the hurricane. Wading through the water, I discovered the pump gushing water from the pipe at the pump.  I shut off the power to the pump. Then called Alms Pump.\nTheir reply was that they had people without water and it would be a couple of days. Well, about 6 weeks later Alms Pump showed up and fixed the pipes to the pump and turned the water back on.  The bill for that meter where no water was used was $60.  This was the first bill where payment was only for water used plus taxes.\nAs to the older pump, Alms Pump  never went to the  pump house of the older pump and never reconnect the electric wires they disconnected to bring the pump and pipes out of the ground to put a new check valve on the pipe of the older pump.\nI have begged Alms Pump to reconnect the wires in the pump house so that the electric plugs can be used to run extension cord to where 2 junipers fell in the yard and need cutting.  To this day, Nov 10, 2020, the 2 juniper are still down.\nThere is no electricity to the switch for the light bulb when freezing weather comes.\n\nMy attorney wrote Alms Pump  a letter and it was ignored.  I gave Alms Pump until 31 Oct 2020 to reconnect the electric wires and that was ignored.\n\nThey will not answer as to why they will not reconnect the electric wires they disconnected.  I paid Alms Pump $450 for repairing the older pump (putting in a new check valve).\nIf I have to hire an electrician to reconnect the wires Alms Pump disconnected, would that make Alms Pumps liable for the payment? My attorney says yes, and, they should be taken to Small Claims Court.\n\nThe senior Alms who started Alms Pump never mistreated their customers as I have been grossly mistreated by this younger generation running Allms Pump.\n\nI will never call Alms Pump to put down another well and pump. Fini.\n\nPrevious post in Sep 2020:\nNot responding to fix the leaking T under the valve they installed.  I have done business with Alms Pump for over 30 years and do not understand why they are not responding to come fix their work. A plumber would not touch it.\n\nAlms Pump. Please come fix your work.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0eec74f9bc57:0xa013dc0b035b77e7"}
