Arrived at the showroom about 5 minutes early, walked inside with my daughter for my appointment and waited approximately 15 minutes, when a gentleman walked out and asked if we had been helped yet. After telling him we had not, he took us into the warehouse where the slabs were and also where Betty (the sales person supposed to be taking over my appointment) was chatting with a couple of other employees. We could hear them just on the other side of the door when we were waiting for her to come out and greet me for my appointment. They knew we were in the showroom, yet they continued chatting. Betty finally came over where the young man walked us to, showing us the slabs. After being in the store about 20 minutes at this point, they decide to do a temperature scan on us. It was hot in the warehouse and we had masks on. We both scanned 99 temps. They acted as if we had the plague. Betty behaved one the most rude way I\u2019ve ever witnessed, in any environment but especially a sales environment where a customer is hoping to do business with the company they\u2019re patronizing! Betty treated my daughter and I, first of all as if we had the plague and stayed probably 10 feet from us. Even once, when I turned to speak to her, she stepped back about 3 steps like I was about to attack her. Then she treated us as if she was doing us a favor by walking through he warehouse with us. She was not helpful AT ALL, and allowed two other people to take her away from assisting us! I held out as long as I could. It takes a lot to make me mad and I\u2019m always kind to everyone, but she was so disrespectful and rude! I would NEVER hire her to work in my company and I hope the owner/manager reads this review and thinks twice about maintaining her as an employee! Betty has no idea how much I had planned to spend on my countertops, tile work, sinks and faucets! But she will NEVER know now!! Because I\u2019ll find someone who DOES want my business and who respects myself and my daughter. You see, I own a successful business. But Betty has no idea of that. She treated me as if I were a homeless person who walked in off of the street with no money and no plans to purchase anything. Little did she know, I\u2019ll be doing all of my business with OHM!!

I ordered one piece of granite for a 84\" bathroom vanity. I ordered a remanent off of a slab there. I paid a 50% deposit and they were holding it for me. When it was time to be installed, they brought it for my vanity. Unfortunately they installed a piece that was not mine. I paid the balance of this in November and I wasn't ready for it until April. When I went by the shop to pick up a small piece for the shower, I was advised I still owed the other 50% as they didn't show it paid for.. Thank goodness I had a canceled check to prove I had paid for it. I contacted them and advised they had installed the wrong one.  They said they would call the owner, they have never gotten back to me with any kind of explanation at all.  It is installed with no explanation and no apology. Now it would cost me an extra fortune because I am not living in the house and the plumbers installed all the plumbing which would be another added expense to have it replumbed. An apology would have been nice, or they didn't have enough remanent left, or some kind of an explanation and give me another choice. I had no choice in the matter.  No I would not recommend them for any stone work.  After over 1100.00 for 84 inches, we sent them pictures of what we bought and what we had.  The only contact I have had since was they sent me the warranty with still no explanation whatsoever.   I have never been so disappointed in a company and I will never do business with them again. So my situation is this: live with it for the rest of my life or have a law suit and have the bathroom torn up again which has not even been offered..

Thanks Countertop and Cabinet for your wonderful service.\n\nWe had our kitchen and two bathrooms done. The granite is beautiful and the team was wonderful to work with picking everything out. They were quick to get everything done too. They were ready to install within 2 weeks! *However, there were a few things that could have been better with installation.  After having removed our sink faucets, part of a faucet (the plug) was misplaced or lost and that has been super frustrating because I wasn't planning on replacing it and it is expensive to replace that single part - they don't sell it separately from the faucet. Also, they drilled the holes not completely centered on the 3 sinks (each is slightly to the left) and one of the bathrooms was done very poorly. One of the three faucet holes was drilled too close to the backsplash, then realized it was too close so drilled a better distance, but got scratched in front of the holes and the faucet cannot cover up both mistakes. Josh said someone would come fill it, but it hasn't happened yet. Lastly, our master bathroom has a chunk knicked out of a corner and I didn't realize that until after signing the paper work.  I really like the granite we chose, but I have been dissapointed with what went wrong and that it hasn't been fixed.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1602813289292, "text": "Sorry this never made I back to the office.

My wife and I was both at work while this happened no one had informed us about this from their company but our home builder did as they had a plumber working for them actually help bring it in afterward. When my wife and I got to our home they had already placed it on the island bar area trying to buff and sand the edge off to cover up what they had done. We noticed it right away and when we said something about replacing it they said no they will fix it.. well it took them 3 months to try to and we tried to give them a chance but we noticed the bonding material as they called it a patch that would hold up as if it was stone fell off ( we had found it laying on the floor). We mentioned to the supervisor about just replacing it or we wanted our money back he said no no we cant give you a refund but we promise to have it replace.. well we had to call and text and call and text they made no attempt to be in any hurry so i told the store manager 2 days ago via text ( because he hardly answers phone calls) to please let us know whats going on and after waiting a couple days he text back saying he was out of town but is back and will let me know end of the week.. well he never reached out so i text him today and he replied that he still had no word on when it would be ready. Then he goes on to text that the countertop wont match the other small section we had kept while trying to work with them.. told my wife she and i both feel like we have gave them enough opportunity for too many months to get a countertop that cost us thousands of dollars not to match and to look out of place.. so i asked the store manager to either take everything back and to start from the beginning or refund our money.. im still waiting for his reply and that has been 12 hours ago. I had also mentioned to the store manager that it has been very difficult not having a kitchen fully functional due to this and at this time we have a 5 month old he seemed to not care. We Havent reported this to bbb yet but probably will seeing as though it has taken them over 6 months total to get this problem resolved and their lack of communication or priority towards a good paying customer who paid in full ( still have our receipt) we will take this further if need be and dont mind seeing an attorney or any arbitration necessary we really dont care at this point. You can only take so much. We would not recommend them to anyone and if i could have scored them no stars i would have. They did come back later and put a countertop in but we found out and had already knew it was the same one but does look better than before. We just wished we had not been lied to and if someone is going to do the job, made it right as promised. Our cabinets was not through them, but we still are living with the scratches on them from prior work this countertop place had done. They did say they was going to fix it but would cost us extra for the paint.\nContinued.. cabinet guy who works for this company has put us off for over a month now saying that he needed to get the wood shipment from mississippi. I got some wood at lowes and came out cheaper, done it myself and the outcome looks better than what they provided on their website. Overall, my wife and I am well pleased with what I have done to make our kitchen what we wanted it to be. We never asked those idiots to take a rigshaw to mississippi to get wood for free floating shelves.  2 Thumbs down on this review. I will tell all my friends, they will tell all theirs and i have thousands of customers who are always asking if I know a guy who can help them with kitchen remodeling and even new builds.. I will simply say, i know a company I will NOT recommend if you're looking to get it done professionally.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1568823418773, "text": "Hollingsworth,\n\nObviously there was a little more to this.

First issue is that they will not come measure 'after hours' so we had to take off work to be available.  The job required 4 pieces of granite, one to be joined.  Again we were asked to take off work to come view the work particularly the joint.  They had equipment in front of one of the pieces, so we missed the fact that this piece was too short on the end.  The sealer from counter to cabinet even showed.\nWe complained thru the contractor and Surface One gave them a heard time about  replacing it.  After weeks of waiting they sent two workers out and again the piece was too short.  After that, they finally sent someone out to measure again.  A third piece was sent out after 9 or so weeks and this piece finally fit.  Not only were we put out because of lost of time in the kitchen, but the installer with the third piece was the original installer and he told us he told the Source One owner that he knew we would not be happy with the first piece.  So this is the kind of shoddy work they try to get away with.  Not to mention the lack of cooperation with my contractor to work out the issue.  I would not recommend them.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923e8bb5fe1b1:0x68e7cf64b8fb4df1"}
