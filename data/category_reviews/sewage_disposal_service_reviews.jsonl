I called and setup service to pump out RV the week before Christmas and was told they'd be out the following week. I waited and never received a call or a visit. I called the next week and was told that he forgot to dispatch the information. I reiterated the need for the pumping as we had holiday guests and really who wants to ask their guests to do their business in the woods. I was told they would be out Thursday. On Wednesday my 13 year old and I put gravel going to the RV to make sure the truck wouldn't get stuck with heavy rains. Not exactly a fun chore. On Thursday I called to see when the service truck would arrive only to be told that it wouldn't be this week at all. I explained that this had inconvenienced me, 13 year old, and a 91 year old and I would like to know exactly when they will provide the service. Chad then proceeded to tell me essentially.....we were out of his way. At this point I've decided to go elsewhere. Horrible customer service, lack of concern, and apparently unable to show up.

So now its friday....i called to see if he could give me a estimated time he would be out. He said he would have to call his driver and would return my call. After setting at home all day waiting for his call or someone to show up, guess what...NOTHING! So i had my husband call him and he tells my husband \"oh all of my guys are gone home, it will be monday\". Which he was told from get go that it needed done by friday.

They pumped down the tank immediately so that we could shower, and within a week they had come out and completely cleaned out the root system (chainsaw work INSIDE my tanks).  They did an amazing amount of work for a great price.  Yesterday, the old system started acting up again.  They came out first thing this morning so we could shower for work.
