I brought the car back in on Monday the 4th and told them the service engine light came on and something under the car was rattling. I was told by the owners son that he didnt know anything about standard shift cars and they would not be responsible for anything wrong with it. Almost 3 weeks later the car starts running hot. When my husband got to me to check it out he opened up the radiator to find that it is full of J.B block seal he runs over 80 gallons of water through the radiator trying to clean it out to no avail. We replaced the thermostat that was so coroded with block seal it was rusted up. I called and left a message with Pierce auto sales telling them that the car was running hot and because someone was trying to cover up a cracked block or blown head gasket and there was so much block seal in the radiator and engine that I didn't know if the car was going to make it home and that I really needed someone to call me back because I had no way to get it home. I never recieved a call back.It cost me $60 to rent a car dolly to drag it home. Now the car came with an outside warranty but because \"whoever\" filled the motor up with block seal to hide a major problem until they could find an idiot \"me\" to take the car off of there hands the warranty will not cover the car. So now I have a blown up car sitting in my yard that I drove less then a month and repo men knocking on my door because they want there car back and still after all this time I have yet to recieve a call from anyone at Pierce Auto Sales.  I recieved more help and sympathy from the repo man in 10 minutes then I have from Pierce in 2 months. I paid $1500 down for a car that didn't even last until the first payment was due. I dont bash people or businesses but i have tried every other way to get them to talk to me. I just want my money back so I can get a car that runs and won't leave me on the side of the road less then a month after purchase.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a56497104639d:0x842e60c3c94517bb"}

He said ownership was changing and his dad was going to be leaving and to give him a couple weeks and he would give us an awesome deal on it which was fine because we needed to sell our vehicle to purchase that one. After 2 weeks we had a buyer for ours and was told to call the following week and set up time to do the deal on the vehicle I wanted so bad. Well I called 2 days ago and left message for him and told them it was about the blazer, she said ok he will call you back. Never heard anything. My husband calls up there today and he isn't in so my husband asked if blazer was still there. Guy says no we sold it back last week.\ud83d\ude21 Well good damn thing we told guy that was buying ours that we couldn't do deal until the day we was able to get other one.

I sent my car that was under warranty to Chatom Ford. That was one of my worst mistakes possible. The first week of their service was promising. After that it was all down hill. Shade the \u201cService Manager\u201d was my main point of contact. He would promise me updates and call backs which I would never get a returning call. On October 16th I was PROMISED my car was repaired and ready for pick up. As I had two friends take off work to take me 5.5 hours to Chatom Ford, Shade called me and said \u201cthe car jumped time and is not ready\u201d. The following day I called to get the new date  I could expect my car to be repaired.  Shade then tells me that he had been lying to me and my car was not ready and he does not know why my car is not fixed nor when it could be fixed. During this call he also promised me that the car would be sent to my house in Tennessee. After Shade continued to lie about my car and repairing it, I then moved to speaking with Collin Ward (General Manager)-  I only spoke with him once because he told me \u201c I\u2019m sure what you are saying MAY have happened, but im sure my team has a better way of going about this story\u201d. He also promised I would get a call back from him and I never did. Collin also asked me why I would even send my car here with it being out of state and not send it local (I was on my way back from vacation on the coast when it happened). In my opinion, this should not matter. With no hope, I called asking for the owner, Gene Brown. No one would help me reach him. Then I finally received a call from Kevin O\u2019Brien. He was very promising and reassuring at first as they all were. Kevin worked with my father and I for about two weeks then he stated to not take our calls or call us back as promised. Last, my father began to work with Lara. She was helpful in helping us know what was going on. She is who we worked with for the rest of this mayhem. 99 days later on December 18th Chatom Ford met me in Mississippi to give me my car. This dealership is an ACTUAL JOKE. From day one I asked for nothing but updates and I never once got that. NOT ONE WORKER AT THIS PLACE (I say place because I can not call this a business because this place has no business structure at all.) was truthful in customer service to my father or myself. If anyone at this place has any further questions feel free to contact me as you have my name and number. PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME BY NOT SENDING YOUR CAR HERE. THIS MANAGEMENT IS A JOKE AND ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS IN THEIR PROFESSION.\nThank you for the worst Ford experience I could ever ask for.

I\u2019ll start with the fact that I hate shopping for new vehicles. It takes too much time and so many people try applying way too much pressure.\n\nAnyways, Jim Cook Ford had a vehicle in stock that I wanted to test drive. I called them after work one day to find out if it was still available and arrange a test drive. I spoke with Brock and he told me that I could stop by anytime for a test drive. I warned him I only wanted to test drive and had no plans on walking away with the vehicle that day. He encouraged me to come by when I was ready.\n\nWhen I showed up at the dealership he had the vehicle ready to go and threw me the keys. After the test drive, Brock answered a bunch more questions and was straight forward when I asked him something he didn\u2019t know. Never once did he try to make up answers to anything he didn\u2019t know.\n\nThe price and customer service was great so I had a lot to think about as I walked away that day. Anyways, I took a day off work later in the week and traveled a bit further to a larger city to see what kind of deal I could get. Let me tell you that trip ended poorly. I was so disgusted at getting treated as just another number. The place didn\u2019t care about my name or me. They just wanted to know what I wanted for a monthly payment. Even worse was the fact that the dealership was trying to pass off a beat up vehicle as nearly new.\n\nOnce I was convinced the vehicle Jim Cook Ford had was the one for me, I called Brock. He told me it was still on the lot. I arranged another visit and was literally \u201csold.\u201d Brock did such a fantastic job at never pressuring the sale. He treated me as a person who had options. I could never say enough good things about the dealership. Even after the sale I heard from Brock a couple of times following up on my satisfaction.

We ended up passing on the vehicle the man working Rick was absolutely sweet is why I even handed this review a one star. Rick showed us another vehicle, dead battery but you know we thought, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s just been on the lot a second\u201d. Little jump start, and it fires right up. Problem one radio didn\u2019t work, problem two the air wouldn\u2019t even get cold. The biggest problem of them all is we tried to test drive this vehicle and the brakes sounded like steel on steel it was god awful. We didn\u2019t even have second thoughts, we straight turned that vehicle around before we even got a second to pull it off the lot. Ridiculous because the photos that were used on Facebook didn\u2019t show any detail of all of the paint job involved on this car. A waste of an hour drive to the location. Please know what your getting involved in on this lot.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923b189b005c9:0x6db750ee718606e9"}

Car seems like it\u2019s a great vehicle and for a reasonable price.\n\nThe only problem I had is that we made a deal with them to replace the battery in the car (which was a hybrid) and they gave us a battery that wasn\u2019t for a hybrid. I went back and what should have been a calm discussion about getting the right battery turned into a very heated exchange when the dealer began to call my mother rude and claiming the battery was fine.\n\nThe battery ( the 12 V startup one) is a specialty type of battery for a hybrid that only the dealer provides and costs about 500$:\n\nWe ended up getting a check from them to get the battery from the dealer (they wouldn\u2019t pay the install price, just the wholesale). The thing is, is that this review would have been 5 stars if they had just been polite and understating when we came to them about the problem. We could have gotten to the same point without the very unpleasant arguing and lying. That had us coming away with what seems to be a great car but a really bad taste in our mouth about the dealer.\n\nHope the car runs for a long time, but when buying a car from here ....

Great, genuine people here. Drove an hour and a half to the location, test drove the 2014 Nissan and took it to get checked out at a near by garage. It checked out- As any used car it had minor things that needed to be addressed but that's to be expected with any used car. I don't expect a brand new car, besides a mechanic shop HAS to give you a long list otherwise they feel like they have not done their job correctly. Came back, negotiated price (which was already low and I admit to that since I did my research). The gentleman was polite and told me he could knock of $200. Paid it in cash and made it through the paperwork hassle free in less than 15 minutes. On the way out I ran into  the owner who  explained to me the way that they conducted their business. They seemed to do well and sold many cars at that location. He was a very down to earth person. The reason for my detailed explanation is to make it clear to anyone that looks at online reviews to take them for a grain of salt. Mid-conversation with the owner I watched a man come into this dealership and demand new brakes and tires on a vehicle he bought a few weeks back apparently, and otherwise threatened to leave a bad review!! People like that get on my last nerve. These folks are selling good quality cars for a fraction of the price. If someone wants a brand new car they need to help themselves to a brand new car store. We don't see shops like this anymore, everything is being bought out and turned into a franchise sore where you would pay at a lot more for the exact same car. We need to value these people.

If I could leave 0 stars, I would.\n\nMy mother purchased a car a few weeks ago and today she decided to go on her lunch break and get her tag. Information that should've been provided during her purchase at the dealership was requested from the clerk at the tag/title office. She placed a call and got the owner on the phone and he was attemping to assist her. While he was able to eventually get her the information she needed the process of how she had to get the information from the owner was where she had an issue. She stated that there was a language barrier which she didn't personally mind BUT as she was on her lunch break and had limited time to talk she requested to speak with someone with better English that could accomodate her and articulate the information she needed in a timely manner. The owner became rude with her during her phonecall even prompting the clerk at the window to comment on his rudeness.\n\nI later accompanied her to his dealership as she needed to make a payment on her vehicle as well. Once arriving conveniently the owner was sitting on the front \"porch\" of the lot. When she expressed to him her issue with the process that it took to get information from him earlier and why she requested to speak with someone with better English he became rude with her again, and constantly interrupted her.  I happened to accompany her on this visit and made a comment about his direct rudeness. I guess he didn't take our visit too well because we'd interrupted his flirting with his employee but he then proceeded to invite the both of us into his office and present to us a dusty old box containing his many \"degrees\" which from what I saw were merely laminated certificates as if that gave him the right to conduct business and talk to us the way he did. I made the comment that both myself and my mother carried actual degrees from accredited universities, she even having her Masters which at the end of the day should not matter. Him having the title of \"OWNER\" and his many \"degrees\" should never give him the right to believe that he should be able to be rude to customers or anyone else for that matter. It takes way more than walking around and merely calling yourself a business owner. Its a matter of action as well. As an owner you should be able to take criticism and responsibility for your actions. A simple apology would've been good enough but my mother didn't even get that. I myself began to get upset because of the way he chose to speak to my mother. I simply could not allow it. I began to explain her position yet he attempted ot interrupt me like he did her. I wasn't allowing that either. Our conversation ended up being a mix of words in which he eventually summoned one of his employees into the room for reasons I still don't know. She attempted to explain that the owner was alone by himself at 8 AM until she was able to get into the office and the fact that she hadn't been able to hang up her purse because he asked her to take the phone. This made no difference to me or my mother because 1. She called around 1 PM not 8 AM & 2. As a business \"OWNER\" he should've done a better job with tailoring his business to order to fit the needs of customers. If you had staffing issues then as an \"OWNER\" it was on him to take on that matter himself. Either way it should not fall on the shoulders of the customer to deal with your rudeness and lack of customer service. My mother always raised me to be honest and to speak my mind so here I am speaking my mind and saying that the \"OWNER\" of this establishment is trash and should better spend his days gaining proper accreditation on what it means to be a good business owner and how to deliver good customer service as well taking some time to fix up his dealership because all it takes is for the wrong person to have an accident on that janky \"staircase\" on his lot and his entire business under fire due to lawsuit.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923b189b005c9:0x6db750ee718606e9"}

We just sold that last night...I said, I called you twice today before I came..he said well we got this gray one...both front tires flat on the ground, he said...they just need some air...I said nah let's look at the Hyundai, Rick says, it's right here...points to a really damaged vechicle...says let me get the key..and runs off...another man in a cart come by and hands me the key and I get in and the overhead visor was down in my view so I pushed it up to the roof...it fell right back down...again I tried...again, it fell down...I put the key in the ignition and turned it....nothing...the battery was dead...I looked at the guy and he said \"oh you wanted to crank it\"....I said well yeah, how else can we test drive..he said, well we don't crank these cars a lot and some have been sitting for awhile...just needs a jump real quick....I said no, I'm going to take my money and leave...what a sketchy place.  If you buy something here it had better be your last hope for anything cause you will not be happy...they straight lied to me\n..caused me to drive 45 mins for trash.  I had cash in my pocket ready to buy.  Glad I trusted my gut and left....they wanted 3k for that lemon....I picked up something waaaay nicer at a real car dealership, paid cash and rolled out happy...Do Not Buy From Them!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923b189b005c9:0x6db750ee718606e9"}

Usually dealerships ding you for everyone imperfection, but they gave me a fair trade in value and even helped by a few thousand to try to get this sale done.\n\nI got a call a few days later, and Avery got me back in. It still was not my price point but met a lot of my needs in a vehicle. They also gave me an extremely generous offer on my trade in and got me an excellent deal.

Wish I could give them 5 stars because that would mean I had a great experience. But buyers BEWARE of the management here. If you buy a used car or happen to get a lemon, you may be in for a huge headache. I bought a used vehicle on Friday, 2/19, and on Monday 2/22 I already had it being looked at by my mechanic. This was AFTER I tried to get management to respond. Vehicle's fuel pump wasn't working, and Stivers said DO NOT tow it to our place because we don't work on Rams. My mechanic found out that the fuse box had been heavily rigged to send extra juice to a failing fuel pump, just enough to get it to run. He said that this was easy to spot once they looked at it, meaning that Stivers doesn't check out the vehicles well enough. I have tried, repeatedly, to get them to return my call and talk to me about the issue, hoping they will at least acknowledge it. And additional $2000 later I've got the van back, but NO thanks to Stivers. My mechanic, on the other hand, is going to get the SECOND Google review I've ever written, and it will be 5 stars.\n\nAs of the date of this review, we are just a month past the date I bought the van, and I still have not heard from them. This was after my salesperson and the manager BOTH said he would get back in touch with me. They have three different phone numbers, and not a single message or call has been made. I will keep trying, and I hope that someone in their marketing group will see this and get back with me.

I drove 2 hours to the dealership to look at a used van.  When I arrived I noticed that the van had a rear liftgate which prohibits the installation of the ladder rack I was going to add to it.  I told them it wouldn\u2019t work for me, then inquired about a new van.  We couldn\u2019t find it so my salesperson said let me check on this.  A few minutes later he came back and said it was at a lot a few blocks away.  He asked me to wait amd said he would go get it. I agreed.  Thirty minutes later I was still waiting.  I called my salesperson to see what was going on and got no answer. I finally left to start the 2 hour drive back home.  I texted him and told him I was leaving.  He said he found the van and would send pictures.  Frustrated at this point, I thought I can see pictures online but whatever.  This was on a Monday.  Finally, on Saturday I agreed to the terms of purchase.  They asked when I could come down and sign the papers and I asked them to email them and I would sign them electronically.  The manager didn\u2019t know if they were setup to do that yet but would check and let me know.  (Another reviewer on here said they did their hole deal online!) I didn\u2019t hear back from him so I reached out on Monday and asked for a proposal with the final terms.  I got that email and did not hear back from them again. I reached out to them on Friday and was told they were trying to figure out how to get me the paper work.  I didn\u2019t hear back so Saturday evening I told the manager that I wasn\u2019t going to purchase the van.  So far, I haven\u2019t gotten a reply.  We had a deal, the financing was approved and yet it seems they were not interested in finishing the deal.  I have never experienced such at any other dealership.  I spent three years in automotive sales, when someone said we\u2019ve got a deal we were always quick to get them signed sealed and delivered.  I\u2019m still stunned by this outcome.

I\u2019m very confused as to why cause I was not given a proper reason! So all day today I\u2019ve been trying to get in touch with the general manager to ask why I have been fired, because Daniel was texting me asking me about the test, and how everything was going. Apparently Ford isn\u2019t the right fit for me and I\u2019m not a good candidate according to Lydia. I have 7 years of customer service and the job offers training so I\u2019m not sure how that made sense. In my attempt to contact the General sales manager aka Daniel Flatt he has ignored me and now blocked my number. So I\u2019m hoping this gets the dealerships attention. I was really counting on this job to help me pay my bills that are late (due to covid haven\u2019t been able to find work) not only would it have helped paid my bills.

She was sure to search for a car that had a carfax and found several she liked online. We live over 100 miles from Adamson Ford and probably could have bought a car a lot closer...but because of the online reviews...she chose Adamson. Well this week, she had to have her entire brake system replaced at the local Ford dealership. They told her that the underside of her car was completely rusted out. This happens when cars are from Northern regions where they use salt on the roads to melt ice....or beach towns where there is natural salt in the air. in places like THAT....it is standard practice for a mechanic to check the underside of a car. My daughter's car was a late model 2014. The vehicle was most likely purchased at auction and came from another area in the US outside of Alabama. She was not expecting to have to pay for  new brakes and other rusted out parts on the bottom of her car. She called Adamson Ford about it and they said it was not their problem. Typical! They are nice and polite BEFORE you buy from them....but if you have a problem they change mighty quick. This was my daughter's very first vehicle. She tried to ask all the right questions and STILL got burned. No help from THIS dealership! And worse...no acknowledgement that they did not check the bottom of the car before selling it to an unsuspecting 21 yr. old kid. Yeah...I am one angry parent! Shame on Adamson Ford. We will NEVER use you again. You COULD have helped with the cost a little.

My father managed the parts department there up until 2 years ago (because the new owners were crooks & he couldn\u2019t stand to work with them any longer). Since, my sister bought a car from Adamson & was very happy with her experience. So in December, I decided I\u2019d start getting my oil changes there. I work @ UAB so it was convenient around my work hrs. My 1st experience was great! The guy that took care of me made sure the guy that drives the shuttle got me to work by 7:30. I picked up my car & paid leaving as a happy customer. My 2nd experience wasn\u2019t so great.\nI decided I\u2019d get my tires rotated as well. A different man took my order & I went inside to sign up for the shuttle service. That same man comes in & openly complains about how several people are out with the flu & says \u201cthis is just going to be a great day\u201d in an annoyed, sarcastic tone. As I\u2019m signing up for the shuttle, the guy that drives said, \u201cshuttle rides don\u2019t start until 8\u201d. To that I responded, \u201cThe guy that was here last time made sure I was at UAB in time to clock in & you were the one that drove me\u201d. He said, \u201cthat should be fine as long as a lot of people don\u2019t sign up\u201d, & then after asking if I should walk 15 minutes later, he finally drove me (10 minutes after asking). Mind you, I didn\u2019t have that problem at all the 1st time. As I\u2019m working I get a call from them saying \u201cMa\u2019am when we were rotating your tires we noticed that they are in big need of changing. Can we put on new tires for you?\u201d He didn\u2019t expect me to not be na\u00efve & mindlessly say yes (being a single young female). I asked, \u201cHow much would that be\u201d & he said, \u201cOh uh\u2026$1,600\u201d. I said, \u201dAbsolutely not!\u201d & instead, took my car to a place in my hometown & got 4 top brand, brand new for $950.\nLast week I decided to give them another shot thinking if that guy was there that served me the 1st time, it should be okay. I saw him, but was served by a man I hadn\u2019t seen before. I ordered an oil change & tire rotation. I avoided the hassle of the shuttle & made the 15 min walk to work. I got a call from a female saying \u201cwhen we were rotating your tires we noticed a nail in one of them & if we took it out the hole would be too big to patch, can we replace that tire?\u201d I, of course, said no & to that she said, \u201cokay well we can\u2019t rotate your tires then\u201d. I told her that was fine. But I thought the whole thing was strange because I hadn\u2019t once received a \u201clow tire pressure\u201d warning. When I went to pick up my car I noticed on their write up they documented the nail. So I took my car to my parents so dad & his friend could look. NO NAIL! I tried calling the following day to speak with the manager, & the lady that I spoke with was rude, & on top of that, REFUSED to give me her name. Apparently, they don\u2019t have a general manager, they just have a manager per department. I wanted to be fair thinking maybe the head guy didn\u2019t know about his workers, but if it\u2019s the manager of the parts department, they know, which is why I\u2019m turning here. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to try to screw people over to get more money, my grandfather didn\u2019t run his business that way. & the best thing I can do is caution other people from going.

After getting the vehicle home and detailing the car thoroughly, we noticed that the passenger door sounded hollow (like an empty garbage can).  We immediately took the vehicle to Myer's Auto Collision to have the car inspected --after inspecting it, he found the vehicle to have had over $4000 worth of damage (passenger back door had so much bondo it couldn't be read on his meter, passenger door was a hollow shell (aftermarket part - not factory), the hood had also been replaced with aftermarket part - not factory and wetsanded and painted with trash in paint.  We also ran a Carfax and found out that the vehicle had been wrecked and the airbag was deployed and vehicle was undriveable and had to be towed.  We went to Adamson and talked to the manager, Mike Gargone on 2 different occasions about this and was told he would not cancel the contract and also told us that the vehicle had not been wrecked.  He also said that the vehicle had been bought at Manheim Auction in Georgia and that they do not have to divulge the information of any wreck to a vehicle and that he did not know the vehicle had been wrecked (we have had reliable sources to tell us this is not true -- that if a vehicle is wrecked and airbags are deployed, it has to be divulged to the buyer).  It is hard to believe that a supposedly reputable dealership that is well known in the city of Birmingham would conduct business the way they have.  We feel we have been violated by fraud, lied to, and deceived.  How would they as experts in cars not know this vehicle had been wrecked and how are they not liable for not divulging that information to  us as a consumer?

I have bought 2 vehicles from them. David G. The sales guy, Hes great, but the problem came when I bought an 06 f-150 from them in November of 2015. I purchased an extended warranty through them and less than a week later I cancelled it (after I read the fine print). So I am entitled to a full refund. So the dealership sends off the forms to cancel the warranty while I do the same through email. I have to talk to David A in financing and he is the problem. He told me for a month that he hadn't heard from the warrenty company and I told him that I had and that they told me that they cancelled the warrenty. So he tells me to send the email stating that to him and so I do. Well then he says that I have to sign the form and him send it in and I reminded him I had the form so I sent him the original form I sent to Alpha warrenty. I finally tagged him in an email with Alpha Warrenty to get it all straighted out. Then Alpha calls me and asks who to send the email to, I Tell them David in financing and so they DO!!!! I call Adamsonford again and guess what? David in financing tells me that he got the email and is sending the check. Thats was December 14, 2015. So I call my finance company on Jan. 4, 2016 and they haven't received a payment. I email David in financing again and he says he's waiting on alpha from a fax he sent on December 14, 2015. I call the dealership and now someone else is \"helping\" who I won't disclose at this time. And he is waiting on a response from alpha warrenty. ...... really??? I've BOUGHT 2 VEHICLES FROM THIS PLACE AND WAS GOING TO AGAIN..... all I can say is things better go right or I will discourage everyone on every page and website, social media and whatever else I can. If a customer calls with a problem you don't just email or call the place then leave it, you keep calling or emailing until it's fixed especially when I buy more than once......\nAfter submitting this review I had a lady contact me named Melissa. She looked into the problem and found that they never sent the money for the warrenty. She has been a pleasure to work with and I wish I would have done this sooner. Sadly I won't be buying another vehicle from them as long as David A. In financing or Shaun(syan) works there as their apathy and laziness is appalling. Everthing is sunshine and rainbows until u have a problem.Everyone else at adamsonford is great, but if the finance guy who pushes a warrenty doesn't send the money, what else are they not doing?", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b95166e0335:0xefbc2a3c0352ab5a"}

On March 25, 2016 I was at malfunction junction when my 2007 Mustang just stopped working. I pull over & immediately use my road side assistance then google the nearest Ford dealership because I was fairly new to the area. I called the service department & not sure who I spoke with but he was friendly & I told him I would be having my car towed to them for diagnostic work within the hour. He said ok bring it in. Ok me & my boyfriend  follow the tow truck there & speak with Jay in service. He assured me that would try to figure it out. After sitting there for 30min, he comes to the break room & said it was my battery. I said ok replace it. Did that & it still would not crank up. So him & another gentleman almost tore up the starter by trying to crank it & I literally had to say PLEASE stop doing that. So it was around 3 on a friday so Jay stated that the head tech was out & leave my car for the weekend & Monday he will call me by 10am & let me know whats the problem. I said ok. Well Monday I called in to work so I could be available about my car. I called him at 1030 am because I hadnt heard from him. He said they still working on it & try back at 12. Called at 1230pm & he replied they cant get my car crunk up so they dont know whats wrong. That they will start from the bottom up to find the problem.I said I need to know the problem because thats my way to work. He said as long as it doesnt crank up they cant find out. My dad is a retired mechanic so I ask why is that because most car issues often doesnt allow the car to crank up. He said they know its misfiring but dont know from where. I said the diagnostic machine should tell you. I was informed then they dont have a diagnostic machine to put my car own. I about passed out. I said well how long will this take because I need a car to get to work & I need to know what to do. Jay told me that I may need to call enterprise because they dont give out loaner cars & cant fix it until they figure out whats wrong. I said my dad & brother fix on cars & I have never heard of a Ford dealership not able to tell me what was wrong with a Ford car. Jay reply was why dont you get them to look at it. I was just angry. So I called my dad & brother out of town & they instructed me to get to a local Pep boys to get diagnostic testing. Informed Jay of this on that Monday that a tow truck would be to get my car that Tuesday morning. Jay informed my road side assistance that I owed them no money but I didnt want to use them because I didnt want to pay them. By now I was livid. My boyfriend was too. So the following day the tow truck driver went there 2 times to get my car for them to not be able to get my car because it wasnt accesible. I called them & informed them if they dont have my car accesible a 3rd time I was coming with the police. 3rd time tow truck was able to get my car.  Took it to Pep boys & they had a diagnosis within 2hrs. Well in May I left the same review on their facebook page & whoever is over it apologized & offered me 2 free oil changes. Well I have tried to get these 2 free oil changes for me to get there at 2pm on June 28th for Jay to yell out they done with oil changes for the day. So the gentleman at the desk asked could I come back the next day. I said I work all day. He said can you drop it off at lunch. I said sure. I called the next day at lunch to say can you bring it at 2pm. I said no. Tried to bring it again then no time. Its sad that you offer me something for bad service to get bad service on the free offer as well.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b95166e0335:0xefbc2a3c0352ab5a"}
