I originally filled out all the appropriate fields online and a few days passed and we never heard from anyone. No- problem. So my fianc\u00e9 and I sat down to call and see if we could get the ball rolling. Our initial encounter with her was a little uneasy. She made up every excuse under the sun as to why she had been in contact with us and that she didn\u2019t have enough staff to adequately return calls in a timely manner. We talked back and fourth via email. She didn\u2019t act like she wanted to help us narrow down our search and advise us on where we could go with what we were wanting to spend. She was very adamant about us narrowing down where we wanted to go and to get back with her. I kept telling her we needed her help, that\u2019s why we reached out to a travel agency! I threatened at one point- to use another travel agency if she didn\u2019t want to help me. Oh at that point the emails came flooding in and she put fourth a little bit more effort. So fast forward to yesterday afternoon. I had a few minutes before getting kids off the bus so I ran to the Albertville location. When I got there I was somewhat greeted by a blond headed lady, can\u2019t remember her name. I told her that I was there to go ahead and book a honeymoon and that I have been speaking with a lady named Jamie. Jamie was on the phone with another customer which was totally fine. I let her know first off that I was crunching for time. She sat down at her desk and seemed extremely overwhelmed and had no clue where to start to help me. When I told her to have Jamie contact me when she got off the phone she looked at me and told me to calm down waving her hands at me like I was a complete idiot! She kept saying she was new and it came across that she was not capable of performing her job duties as helping me with what I came in to do. She also popped off with a \u201cwow lady \u201c as I walked out. I received an email from Jamie maybe an hour after all of this happened. I explain to her that I was upset and pretty much what I\u2019ve said here and got absolutely no response. I will be going above her head if somethings not done about it. Management needs to focus on better training for the travel agents at this location.

She told us lies about all these perks we were going to get and when we got to the resort that\u2019s when we realized she was incorrect about literally everything. I also had to pay an extra $278 for me and my brother to travel back with the rest of our group on the same flight because she somehow booked us on a completely different flight at a completely different time. Of course she never  returned our emails about getting that issue or any of the others resolved or even dealt with. Never reusing or recommending Adtrav to anyone. Thanks for nothing Cyndy.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cca30b8138d:0xcf1f334ae8b7f5f3"}
