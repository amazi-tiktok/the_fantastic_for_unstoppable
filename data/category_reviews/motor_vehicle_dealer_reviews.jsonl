But puts recent windows lives in danger\n1. Made several barter deals with my mother and I.\nA. Bought a Z71 for $6500 dollars from my mother and I. Instead of paying cash, he was suppose to fix my fathers 1987 corvette for the sum of $6500 and the remaining  sum, would be reimbursed to my mother . The involvement of the repairs between all parties was a replacement motor, install convertible top that we already had bought, just needed to be installed. The 1987 Corvette was suppose to be first thing fixed but instead took almost a year. There were issues, that not only put my mother a recent windows life in danger but other peoples lives as well.\n\nThe brakes had little to no brake fluid.\n\nThe oil was over a quart low\nThe body damage that was done while in Charlies shop leads me to believe they went off roading with the corvette.\n\nThe next barter deal was that Charlie was going trade a 1969 Chevelle which was recently on his website as a barn find. It was not a barn find. It was in a building that my mother and I own and I had previously got the 1969 Chevelle running about a year before we called Charlie to come look at the Chevelle to see if he would like to buy it.\n\nThe deal was the Chevelle for a 1954 Corvette my mother owned to be restored. Charlie promised that the 1954 Corvette would come back running and safe to drive to town,. When the 1954 Corvette came bac to my mothers, the corvette was unsafe and dangerous to be driving. It would not idle, it took three times the normal distance to stop.\n\nCharlie came over to my mother who recently had lost her husband of 30 years and scammed her. He did not honor any of the agreements that were agreed upon and if you would not like yourself or your family placed in danger do  not use Charlies Classics Car restoration . Message me if you would like more details and I will be glad to tell you the rest .\n\nOh yeah,. Charlie will use he is Christen as well as his family to gain your trust and then screw you over and try to kill you.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bca0fa4e55555:0x3ad69e86867c4a15"}

Purchased a used vehicle from this dealership in May of 2020. I was sold when I was told that my vehicle had an Auto Nation warranty of \"90 days or 4,000 miles.\" Sounds great doesn't it? Well after being hurried along in signing paperwork so the vehicle could be mine I was very happy with my purchase. However, less than a month later, and still well within my \"warranty\" coverage period I got a Christmas tree of lights on my dashboard. I was told to take it to its dealership and from there I could then make the claim. When I called to make the claim, Auto Nation's warranty service said there was no vehicle with my VIN in the system. I then called the manager there who told me, \"I never signed any contract stating I had a warranty and it doesn't matter what I was told because it isn't in writing.\" I realized the manager was right about this however, I was being told one thing then they intentionally rushed me through signing paperwork so that I wouldn't catch that I never signed anything for my \"warranty\". The deceptive methods of these people shows that they are talented at one thing and, one thing only and, that is lying to people. These people are clearly slimy and cannot be trusted, save yourself the hassle and do not purchase a vehicle from here. Learn from my mistake, don't come here.

The service rep who took care of me made the scheduling and check-in nice and easy and arranged for the shuttle service to take me home. I was disappointed that the AutoNation website didn't allow me to schedule an appointment for repairs online (only maintenance services could be done online). I got a diagnosis and repair quote within a day, but word that it would take a week to get the part in. It turned out to be an additional day for the part to arrive, and I was told the car would be done the following day, but  it took two more days for it to get done. We came from the Houston area where we were used to parts being accessible more quickly, so this wait time may be normal for the Mobile area. The pickup experience was a bit frustrating. I picked up on a Saturday and waited 1 hour 15 minutes to get checked out (was told the car was ready but paperwork had to be done). The service rep kept getting pulled away by walk-ins, phone calls, and I'm not sure what else, but it seemed I kept getting bumped to the back of the line. There may have been more legitimate reasons for the long wait time, but those weren't shared with me.
