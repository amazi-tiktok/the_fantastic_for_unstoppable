Well, I have some very disturbing news for you! A very dedicated employee of 16 years was fired from KFC in Fayette, AL while she was in the ER at Fayette Hospital with a stomach virus! There was even a picture posted of this very nice, hard working lady while she was hooked up to IV's. Guess what happened! She was fired!!! Was she on probation or something?>No! Did she have a history of being absent?>No! Sixteen years at a fast food restaurant is a long time. During that faithful 16 yrs., this lady broke her elbow at work. Just a one time thing and what happened?>Her pay was cut! Was the accident her fault?>No! This lady has been unfairly fired, without cause or reason. The owner: Steve Dean didn't stand up and do it himself, no, he took her off schedule and had the Manager do the firing. Trying to save himself for any fault which there is plenty of fault! Surely, there is someone over him (I should have said \"The Suppose to be Owner\"), or someone who can look into this and yes there is, Steve Dean's father, Wiley Dean, the Owner of KFC in Haleyville, AL. Those that do not know this lady are probably thinking, \"oh, she must have done something\", \"she must have been laying out a lot\", \"she must just be trying to get money out of them\", \"she had to be doing something wrong\". Well, if you are thinking any of those things, you are wrong on all of them! The only thing she did, was try to get herself well and not give the virus to anyone at work and any of the customers. Would you like to have someone with a virus handling your food or taking your money and giving your change back? So, what can this lady do? Nothing without the help from you, the public. Word of mouth speaks volumes, especially with facebook! Please, if you think this lady has been wronged, and she has, please, Post It on facebook! You don't have to live in Fayette, AL to post it, for that matter, you don't have to live in AL, all you have to be is concerned and kind enough to acknowledge someone who has been unfairly mistreated. Please, please post your feelings about this. I am not even asking you not to eat there anymore. I just want the entire public to know what kind of person is running the KFC in Fayette, AL and hopefully get this lady some satisfaction by letting the public know and the KFC to see that it is known. She did not ask me to do this. I am doing it because it is not fair, I would miss her friendly face if I were to ever go there again, which I will not and I would hate for this to happen to me or anyone in my family or friends. Thank you.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888635b36e61e68d:0xe01a6707486d342f"}

I sometimes like to sit and grab a bite between classes. The food is bit bland, but I have never had any problems with my order. One day I did and was treated horribly for the complaint. I ordered the Camile club with no mayo. When I received my sandwich, it had mayo. So, I calmly went back up and explained that I didn't want mayo. I was told it could be fixed.\n\nWhile waiting on my sandwich, I noticed the staff watching me and speaking quietly, but I ignored it. 5 minutes later I was called back and when I went to check my sandwich again, I noticed the residue from mayo. It looked as if someone had wiped the mayo off and changed the bread. Again, calmly, I went back up (once again noticing the staff snickering) and asked to speak to the manager for a refund. Said-manager whose name I couldn't get, claimed she was there the whole time they \"remade\" my sandwich and it was fresh. I told her that couldn't be the case because it was now cold, it took her less time to make it than originally and I showed her a piece of lettuce that had mayo in it.\n\nShe then rudely asked me if I still had my receipt, which I did. I was given a refund, but I don't appreciate the way I was treated. If I'm paying for a meal, I expect it to made the way I requested it. I didn't ask them to make me a sandwich befitting God.

They were not busy and we even asked an employee if we could just sit. Someone will be with you. I want to like this place but....... a simple hey we see you would help. I would actually rate it lower but the fried chicken is good and that got them an extra star. 1st visit Ate lunch at Yard Birds Chicken Company. Today was the grand opening so I will forgive them for forgetting the jalape\u00f1o cornbread then giving me biscuits and having to ask for ranch multiple times. The chicken was excellent, They use a crumbly crust almost like you use on fried green tomatoes. And It almost seems like they smoke the chicken first then batter and fry. It was tasty and next time I will have to have the hot. Now for the bad the corn bread was cold, not just room temp but cold. If it was warm then man it would have been great. As a suggestion please please add a honey butter with the warm cornbread or biscuits and it would be perfection.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMB67Ig2rIVCVwn-kXoCR-W6S4oGRSUsPHAD2w=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnwaoXPa_WaTinbaf9Iu6SlzDGRj58gMR2JKk=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgLx6y3GWSljM9S2fLaVicRkHvdX6s5JparYg=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3jxyT29QGAyGNQZhsfe1InLAXtjsZtKV5yTI=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWUxct2iDRAYQV3HAR4zzq74gi_5mt24x62As=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5KOcA99jJum3jSKKjhtk4WOIAHxsNE24r2D4=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5lyoQ98LZMGXQyogs9O8Adjw92YzGTWc7BsM=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMh0St-1-wiRxQUVS14Cg7DaKdJ5xoy6rTX5c=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890dc1bc4cb6cd:0xf143b2afe703a64e"}

Well sir my young children come in there to eat and I am utterly applaud that you stand behind her remarks.

Like when you go to a club and its really hot  and people have wasted alcohol and it's been trampled on. NOW the food was good but the chicken strips and 2 sides was very over price at $13! Three strips fries  and a small  dish  salad. Strips and fries were good tho. I got the Nashville Hot Chicken with two sides.  That was a whole chicken breast and wing for $10 and change. It was very good. Now our waitress was a different story. She was unenthusiastic and very dry. We had completely  ate our food but she had the nerve to ask if we wanted to-go boxes.

Also just a quick TY to the team member that advised the other they should reconsider being so disrespectful to other people, especially their children. That's very important.

Good though with their famous lemonade I always bought in brookwood mall homewood Alabama as an employee of both end chain stores when I was in retail employment. Things are vastly different these days. I took my minimum wages way more seriously than majority and as a result the easiest to be the odd ball Not defying the odds that hard work pays. It leaves you struggling in poverty. But Im sure that's bitterness rubbing off on me. Got a good photo as my other favorite thing to do getting odd shots most get paid big bucks in print media. My phone controls the best of me but I got this from my destination mall and purpose on a gorgeous stressfilled easter weekend. In auburn Alabama where I worked in undergraduate school there at now gone jcpennys and got my earring piercing on top of my ear that took a year to heal because I kept hitting it with the phone receiver back in 1989 rather than continue commuting on weekends back to my hometown birmingham mall as manager of lingerie and top sales in accessories. When stockings used with garter belts came 3 to a box and my thighs slightly smaller but not much. Its control top reinforced toe now for sharp talon nails on eagle soarers. My joke of the city. And the river a few miles before this chick-fil-a restaurant. If you ordered a ice cream cake from now replaced Badkung Robbins in toomers corner I made it as the cake maker/ decorator for a quarter. Loved that job slicing tubs of ice cream and layering with cake then icing with melted cream inside the cooler before piping your favorite slogan on it. Lastly, was now gone a different cooler in environmental management for water samples which storied life experienced escaped discussion in the water sludge cleaning treatment process I endured to get mosquitos in my puddled location.

After my order being messed up and one of my coworkers not getting lunch, I called and let them know the order was not included. This was around 11:30ish. The girl told me her general manager wasn\u2019t there and she would have to get approval from him to fix my order. And she tried telling me I would have to somehow prove that the order wasn\u2019t included, asked me to bring it all back up there when I had already distributed over 5 orders to my coworkers! Not even 20 minutes later Kayleen Turner called them and she says the general manager is there he is just busy, so they lied and she called them out on it and the girl had nothing to say but she offered to bring us the order. She didn\u2019t even want it anymore so she said no just to refund her money. I get a call HOURS later saying I would have to go in the store and get cash because they can\u2019t process it otherwise. Okay, cool. It was very inconvenient but sure. Shortly after they called me, they called Kayleen and she wasn\u2019t able to answer because she was in the middle of selling a car. So after, she called back and said \u201cHey I missed a call from y\u2019all, it was probably about the order for Alyson\u201d and the girl HUNG UP ON HER! So I went in and not once did the manager apologize, not once did she seem to care about the inconvenience, I even brought up the fact that her coworker lied to me on the phone and she said \u201cthe gm didn\u2019t get here until 11.\u201d I told her it was well after 11 that I called and she had nothing to say, did not apologize, just said \u201chave a good night.\u201d and quickly went on to help another customer. Y\u2019all after working in the food industry for so long, it baffles me how some fast food employees AND managers can be so unprofessional, especially when they work at the number one fast food restaurant in the country and are known for treating customers with kindness. I promise I never want to be THAT person, but there\u2019s only so far you can push me. I have never been one to try to lie and haggle to get free food out of any restaurant, and it pisses me off that THEY messed up my order, lied to me, treated me unprofessionally, but I am looked at by them as one of those customers that was there to cuss someone out over them leaving a chicken nugget out of my nugget meal. It is literally not hard at all to treat a customer the right way and I just can\u2019t comprehend how that is so hard for some people to understand. \ud83d\ude11", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1546486752558, "text": "Hi, Alyson.

I asked for some smokehouse chicken and the cashier was kind enough to ask me did I want fresh chicken, would I be willing to wait? I said sure. It was around 8ish so it wasn't busy. While waiting on some fresh chicken, I noticed some interesting facts. The health score was not posted or visible....then one of the employees said the health inspector put it in the men's bathroom....??? and the score was supposed to have been a 94..?? Also, the use of hair nets was not a practice. The fryers had  a bin up under it with with some type of yellow hose going into it...??? The cook did have a hat on and was trying to swap out the racks to place more chicken on it and it fell into the grease. He picked it up and just scraped off the stuck on crumbs with a scraper and sat it back down. I was shocked. All the while the cashier and another employee looking for the health score. They didn't find it  and she called the manager, but no one knew where it was...??? I was happy to get some fresh chicken and the cashier was nice enough to throw in a free biscuit. As I was leaving, one of the employees was taking a smoke break, sitting down  in front of the restaurant talking loud on the phone and using some choice words.The chicken was good.The environment and work stations need cleansing, up to date frying machines need to be installed and a refresher course on conversing in the midst of customers.

If you file a complaint at their website, they say they will 'route' it to the appropriate location managment...  Zaxby's needs to know how bad this place makes them look.  It's unfortunate because this place is near my office and I work late many nights...  if you go to this particular location, you've been warned. BTW, the order was and has always been my favorite, buffalo chicken tenders with celery.  If I manage to get the order completed, it is usually missing pieces or has no celery or has on brown soft stick of what was once celery.

We have to get a table because my  86 years old adopted  Mother has dementia and down \ud83d\udd3b n a wheelchair.  After waiting 20 minutes still no table available. My adopted 81 year old Dad asked to speak to a manager. The host then got us a table after waiting 30 minutes. We looked in all corners and they were available tables everywhere. When the manager did come to our table I told her about our experience and  asked her why this happened and she explained she was short handed with staff and she was swamped with doing to go orders. If someone is in a wheelchair and I can't stand very long and there's no sense in them not offering at least a place that's available to sit until our table was available. I have a bad torn hamstring. If management don't get better we will take our business somewhere else. I will be contacting cooperate office. I have the manager's name's. This is very bad customer service when we are regular customers and my adopted parents drive a long distance. Besides this Logan's the one in Moody is even much worse. We've gave Moody chance after chance. It's poor management at that store. It's ashame I just moved here a year ago and when I first started going and our good experience only lasted maybe 3-4 months now we can't even eat here anymore. It's lousy. Don't do any good to talk to the manager. Moody  Al don't know how too cook a medium rare steak. It's always too tough. I should have sent it back but I didn't.

There were three factors. Baby Back Ribs were not properly cooked......an ongoing problem at all the locations in the Birmingham area.  I have learned to have a picture on my phone showing the proper preparation when I run into this problem.  As I was politely attempting to explain this issue with manager John Prince, Mr. Prince's attitude was hostile, uncooperative and confrontational. When I asked if he knew how they were supposed to be cooked, he replied, why don't you tell me how they are supposed to be cooked.    At this point I knew I needed to document the conversation and started my phone recorder.  Mr. Prince said I am not going to talk with that recorder on.  I asked Mr. Prince's name and he just stared at me.  I then prepared to leave and Mr. Prince said his name and walked off.  My waitress did a splendid job.  The issue with the ribs is they were pre-cooked as usual, but then they were not finished on the grill.  They were warmed up and BBQ sauce smeared on them. It appears that race may have even been an issue.......I am white and Mr. Prince is black. Mr. Prince never acknowledged the ribs were not properly cooked nor did he offer any apologies or consolation for my dining experience. At approximately 5:15 pm, Logan's District Mgr Charlie Eben called me in response to my complaint.  Mr. Eben assured me that employees would be retrained to insure that proper food preparation would result and the John Prince would also be counseled.  Sorry Mr. Eben!  I have heard promises like that too many times.  It is a roll of the dice no matter how many free meal cards you want to send me.  Your sincerity is in doubt.  There are too many good and quality companies out there with whom I will do business.

Another 10 minutes went by and I began to get upset because our placement should not be based on when another family finishes eating. We were about to get up and leave but a server came and got us, told us he was working a big party but he would be more than glad to serve us. Keep in mind the hostess never came by to address us again, nor did any manager. We would probably still be sitting there now if the server who was around the bar area did not offer to wait on us. Now granted I am not an unreasonable person nor am I impatient but the lack of professionalism displayed by the management team was unacceptable. We arrived around 6:20 we were not eating to well over 8:00 pm. I didn't want any discount or free food just the common courtesy to say I'm sorry for your wait and we will get you and your family served as soon as possible, but I guess that was too much to ask for.

We were thinking that one of the first orders of the day when it wasn't busy would surely be one of the BEST orders, not completely true. Although my food was ok, my son's wings were fried really hard. He tried to eat them because he doesn't like to complain but I advised him that you should be satisfied with what you pay for. We sent the wings back and told the server that we would pay for the three wings he ate and ordered something else. The manager came out, not to apologize, but to tell us that we didn't need to pay for the three wings. Oh ok, thanks. Guess that was his solution to the problem but then we receive the replacement meal.

The waitress that served us was very slow and overcharged us by 20 dollars. I ordered a Margarita and did not receive it until my meal was already done. I then found out our waitress made my Margarita instead of a licensed bartender, which is why it was way too heavy on the tequila. The waitress also started talking to us about very inappropriate things such as birth control and giving us advice about kids in the future and how we should have never started using money as currency in america. When we found out the check was wrong we told the waitress and she came back and she started complaining about her boss to us, her customers. We stayed there for 2 and a half hours and received very mediocre food. The manager was nice and knew what she was doing, but the staff was very lazy and slow.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1578339016296, "text": "Brian, thank you so much for bringing your experience to our attention.

Over half of the restaurant was empty. Then they seated four 2 tops before me and my wife and 1 child. Even though we were next in line according to the hostess. I can understand seating 2 tops over 3 because they are busy and that's what's available but they had half of the restaurant empty. There was no reason to adhere to section integrity when tables are open. Then they were out of the steak I ordered and when the steak I chose  was served it was cold.\n\nIn the end the food wasn't bad but wasn't worth what I paid or the 2 plus hours we spent there. I have finally learned my lesson and will never ever give them another chance.\n\nWe never heard from a manager to explain what was going on. Just a young sweet girl and an overwhelmed waitress.\n\nI've said it before but now it's definitely true. I will never ever eat at any Logan's again anywhere in the country. Pathetic at best.

Hands down the WORST dining experience I've ever had in my 30 years. The wait wasn't too terribly bad, but after we were seated was terrible.\n\nMy roommate, her son, her girlfriend, and I were sat and promptly greeted by our server. We each ordered drinks, and then our food. The salads were pretty good, but then things took a U-turn.\n\nOur food was first brought out to the table next to us. When we brought this to the attention of the server who brought it, he said \"Let me go check the ticket.\" I know from some knowledge shared with me that when that happens, a fresh order is to be made because it touched the table. So the same man finally brings us our food, with the exception of my roommate, which I happen to know is another mistake, as we should have all been served together. I should also note these plates were the same ones as before, which I happen to know because I had a clear line of sight to the kitchen from where we were sitting. This is a health violation.\n\nSo after bringing our steaks out, I notice mine is undercooked (I ordered medium and got medium rare). My roommate's girlfriend's steak has been cut into, which is ANOTHER huge no-no. When this was brought to the attention of the man who brought them out (the same man I mentioned before), he claimed that was how it was cooked and acted as if he didn't care when we stuck a knife straight through the pre-existing hole in the middle of the steak.\n\nAfter the guy walks off, my roommate's girlfriend goes to our server and asks to speak with a manager. Our server points directly at THE GUY WHO HAD BROUGHT US OUR FOOD. You remember him- the rude one. So she asks if there is another manager around. Keep in mind that my roommate still hasn't seen the first morsel of her food. She informs her that the other manager's name is Jennifer and she will be right over. Jennifer was great and went above and beyond to try and turn our visit around. She quickly explains she will check on my roommate's food and bring fresh steaks out to replace the ones we had.\n\nMy roommate finally gets her food, and there is cinnamon all over her baked sweet potato- which she specifically ordered without cinnamon. But there is also cinnamon all over her steak- why would the steak have cinnamon on it in the first place? So they bring out a fresh potato, which tastes like it's been sitting out for about 2-3 days before it was brought out to the table.\n\nMy roommate's girlfriend and I finally get our fresh steaks, and mine is RARE when I cut into it- worse than before.\n\nWe left not having to pay for any of our food, including what my roommate's son ate because his was fine- but I still won't be back.

Let me say I've been to this Logan's many times since it opened, in fact it use to be one of my favorite restaurants in Trussville, but that has definitely changed. We got there a little after 2 PM and had to wait for a table until almost 3 PM. Now, I understand it was a Saturday, so even though it was annoying I was willing to look past it. Once we sat down, we sat there for 45 MINUTES without anyone even acknowledging that we were there. My uncle had to get up and go find someone to even get them to come take our drink order. After finally placing our drink order, it took another 45 minutes to get our drinks...and most of us ordered WATER. Our waitress had a terrible attitude,  we didn't even get our food until almost 5 PM, and once we did get it, it was not good. 3 1/2 hours for what should have been a simple lunch, when most of it was due to sitting around waiting on someone to even acknowledge that we were there is ridiculous. If it hadn't been for my grandmother refusing to leave, we would have left. And then, when my uncle asked about getting a discount, because there was no way we were paying full price for the terrible service, the manager had the nerve to ask \"Why do you need a discount?\" Even the management didn't seem to care.

However, after this pass weekend, they left me no choice. My fiance' and I go to Logan's faithfully, so needless to say, we have spent too much money in this place to be treated the way we were. The service and food quality has really gone down hill. Quite frankly, I can see why they're having to close so many locations now because the competition is better. Granted, all of the other Logan's in this city ARE indeed horrible, but this one was still the best in my book. That is no longer that case!\n\nFirst of all, we ordered a basket of fried pickles, and we received a half of half basket of fried pickles. I would rather they just told us they were out rather than bring us what they did. We ate those because we were hungry, it was getting late, and we expected a much better dinner than appetizer. It got no better! We waited over 30 minutes for food, and when we got it, most of it was cold as hell. I guess our waitress forgot about it and left it on the counter. My fiance' had meatloaf that was not thoroughly cooked in certain areas, he never got the fries he ordered, so he practically left everything on his plate, he never touched the mashed potatoes and gravy. Our waitress took up our concerns with the manager about our 30-minute wait and the missing items, and as a courtesy she removed 3 whole dollars from our ticket. That was the cost of a side! Gee thanks! You took off what exactly? Our taxes off one of our sides! Then she goes on to explain that they had a party of 35 people come in that they had no idea was coming.

I have eaten here several times and the service has been average, but yesterday was awful. The hostess said it was a 30minute wait to get a table and their were people ahead of me waiting. However she said that if I would sit at the bar that there would be no wait and I would get immediate service. What a misstatement. As I proceeded to the bar, I couldn't help but notice 6 tables empty and wondered why no one had been seated there. Anyway, I sat at the bar and spoke to the gentleman who was seated to the right of me. He said that it had taken 20 minutes for them to take his to go order and that he had been waiting an additional 40 minutes for his prime rib order to come. After about 20 minutes of waiting myself, the bartender/waiter finally brought me a menu. I told him I wasn't expecting to wait an hour for my  food like the gentleman next to me. He said food was coming out in about 30minutes which obviously wasn't happening. Finally the waiter came to take the order of the gentleman on my left side who was with a young boy. He had been waiting over 30 minutes for his order to be taken. He explained to the waiter that he had ordered prime rib on his last visit and was disappointed because there was more fat than meat on his portion.  The waiter told him that the prime rib is usually very fatty and that gives flavor to the meat. I thought to myself that I have eaten prime rib at many places that had little fat and was very meaty, juicy and tender. The bartender/Waiter then suggested that the gentleman order the new York strip. At that moment I changed my mind about ordering the  16 ounce prime rib and decided that I would order the 22 ounce porterhouse,if I could ever get my order taken. By then the poor guy on my right was getting antsy because he had been there over an hour and said that if he had not already paid for his to go order that he would leave. Finally someone else came and asked him what he had ordered since he had been sitting there forever. That  person went to the kitchen and the bartender finally came out about 5 minutes later with the man's order. I thought to myself I hope he has his order right in his bag after that awfully long wait. So now I've been waiting over 35 minutes and still have not had my order taken. So now the bartender waiter guy goes to take someone else's order, bless their soul who was there before me. At that point, I could not take anymore,so I politely got up and told the people around me to have a nice evening and left. I would think that a major franchise as Logan's Roadhouse would provide extra help on busy days like Sunday. I left went to the grocery store and bought a large tbone steak and took it home and cooked it. Oh, also one lady ordered only potato skins to go and said she has been there over 30 minutes.

I have eaten here several times and the service has been average, but yesterday was awful. The hostess said it was a 30minute wait to get a table and their were people ahead of me waiting. However she said that if I would sit at the bar that there would be no wait and I would get immediate service. What a misstatement. As I proceeded to the bar, I couldn't help but notice 6 tables empty and wondered why no one had been seated there. Anyway, I sat at the bar and spoke to the gentleman who was seated to the right of me. He said that it had taken 20 minutes for them to take his to go order and that he had been waiting an additional 40 minutes for his prime rib order to come. After about 20 minutes of waiting myself, the bartender/waiter finally brought me a menu. I told him I wasn't expecting to wait an hour for my  food like the gentleman next to me. He said food was coming out in about 30minutes which obviously wasn't happening. Finally the waiter came to take the order of the gentleman on my left side who was with a young boy. He had been waiting over 30 minutes for his order to be taken. He explained to the waiter that he had ordered prime rib on his last visit and was disappointed because there was more fat than meat on his portion.  The waiter told him that the prime rib is usually very fatty and that gives flavor to the meat. I thought to myself that I have eaten prime rib at many places that had little fat and was very meaty, juicy and tender. The bartender/Waiter then suggested that the gentleman order the new York strip. At that moment I changed my mind about ordering the  16 ounce prime rib and decided that I would order the 22 ounce porterhouse,if I could ever get my order taken. By then the poor guy on my right was getting antsy because he had been there over an hour and said that if he had not already paid for his to go order that he would leave. Finally someone else came and asked him what he had ordered since he had been sitting there forever. That  person went to the kitchen and the bartender finally came out about 5 minutes later with the man's order. I thought to myself I hope he has his order right in his bag after that awfully long wait. So now I've been waiting over 35 minutes and still have not had my order taken. So now the bartender waiter guy goes to take someone else's order, bless their soul who was there before me. At that point, I could not take anymore,so I politely got up and told the people around me to have a nice evening and left. I would think that a major franchise as Logan's Roadhouse would provide extra help on busy days like Sunday. I left went to the grocery store and bought a large tbone steak and took it home and cooked it. Oh, also one lady ordered only potato skins to go and said she has been there over 30 minutes.

Yesterday June 11th my family and I went there for my daughter's birthday dinner. We got seated right away. But then it took 10 minutes before the waitress came to take our drink orders. This was shocking since the restaurant was fairly empty. Also The waitress tried to bring my daughter Coca-Cola  twice when she had sweet tea that was empty . But that is not a big deal. Upon receiving our steaks That's when we were told that what my youngest daughter ordered they did not have. They asked her to re-order while the rest of us had our food in front of us.\nI am not the type of parent that will eat in front of my child that has nothing. At that point I asked to speak to the manager. I watched as the waitress went over to the manager and told her I would like to see her. But she did not come right over. It took at least five minutes before she came to see what was going on. I explained what had happened and she did not even apologize. I asked her what we can do at this point. She said she would take our food back and make sure that we all got them served at the same time. It just did not sit right with me that she did not apologize and I had to ask what we can do to fix the situation. At that point I asked her for a check because we were leaving. It was then she just pointed towards the door. Again not apologizing or saying you don't owe anything. Just pointing towards the door. So we walked out and left the food on the table To say I am disappointed is an understatement. I especially felt bad for my daughter who just wanted to eat there on her birthday.

It took the Manger 15 additional mins to come to us and told us their in fact were ribs but by then I was turned off.. I decline and left unhappy and very unsatisfied!!! I love Logan's but I'll NEVER again eat at that location!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1468675853340, "text": "We're sorry to hear your experience wasn't the best.

My salad came out with my dinner, my son had to ask 3 times to get water and more bread. My order was wrong and my to go order for my husband came out to me plated. His side salad never came with his order. I waited 20 min for a box to take our nasty food home to give to our dog. When I asked the waitress if she could get my to go side salad as fast as she could (seeing that I already paid for it and I over paid on my bill) there was literally about 3-4 bites of lettuce. My son had practice at 6:00 and it was close to 5:50. Mind you we we got there at 4:45 and ordered right away with our drink order. We were done eating before 5:30. This is a real shame since my son is obsessed with your dinner rolls and we frequently dine there. I will never go back again. I paid for things I didn't get. I don't know if the cook was new but my steak had so much seasoning on it it was barely edible. I scraped as much off as possible. If our waitress would have been more attentive I would have said something. We spent too much of our time seated with no one taking care of us. Even when I said I have to go please give me my receipt to sign, she dropped it off with no pen. Leaving me to have to chase down another waitress to borrow her pen.

But now my friend and I look back (2-3 days later) because we're still distraught over our experience, there were several red flags, which started from the moment we walked in to be seated.\n\n1.  When we walked in to be seated there was a customer complaining about there service and how they never received items that they ordered.\n\n2.  The first thing we noticed once seated (which was promptly considering they weren't busy at all) was the table across from us hadn't been cleaned.\n\n3.We sat for about 15 minutes before a server (black male). finally came to our table.  He stands there with his arms crossed speaking abruptly says, \"have y'all decided what you you want to order\". Without a greeting or introducing himself, we were caught off guard because it felt like he was a drill Sargent commanding us to order our food! We ordered and noticed his arms were still crossed AND noticed he wasn't writing down our order!  It felt as if someone made him come to serve our table.\n\n4.  While we were enjoying our appetizer, which a nice, cheerful young lady brought to us, he returns once to let us know since it was 2:44 p.m., it was too early to put our order into the system because  it's a certain time to order the 2 for $15.99 special, which we understood.\n\nAs a result of not writing down our order initially he came back to ask what our orders were again!  Then shortly after that, the initial young lady comes back to ask my friend what his entree was.\n\n5.  Also, while we initially started eating our appetizer, we noticed there were no napkins.  My friend had to get up (while on crutches and wearing a boot) had to go find us napkins!\n\n6.  The entrees were served and the first thing I noticed was my salmon seemed very dry and I thought it was because the oil topping was missing.  I also noticed I received a mushroom skewer, which I'm allergic to mushrooms.  I was supposed to receive the veggie skewer.\n\n7.  The table across from us still hasn't been cleaned, this has been after sitting there over an hour (2:30 - 3:30 at least) looking at it.\n\n8.  After talking to the sweet manager and explaining to her that this could be a training moment for our server(at this point we hadn't started eating to notice the actual condition of our food), by this time,  we're frustrated and ready to leave.\n\n9.  While the female manager was adjusting our ticket to remove the appetizer, I noticed my food wasn't cooked properly.  The sweet potato wasn't cooked all the way through!\n\nMy friend has to get up once again, now to request carry out containers because we haven't seen our server lately except from across the room while he was just standing there talking to someone.\n\nThe server comes to ask if we need carry out containers.  I explain that my friend just left to go find containers. At this point he realizes hat we can use a refill on our water, which was the best 2nd thing we've had after the appetizer.\n\n10.  The next day (Sunday).my friend takes his dinner to work and realizes his chicken isn't done in the middle!  This is when he and I start to reflect on our overall dining  experience at this location!,\n\nI do not recommend this location, please consider the Fultondale or Crestwood locations, l've only had good service and food from these locations.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1496690231605, "text": "We're sorry to hear about your experience.

The garlic potatoes were prepared the regular way. The salad was good, however they add the dressing to it.

It did smell nice in the waiting area but that is as far as we got.  We gave our names to the host requesting a table of 6 and were told that it would be a 25 minute wait at 12:15.  The app said that we were the next table at the 12:45 minute mark.  At 1:05, we were still sitting at the entrance watching the host sending consecutive snapchats from his phone.  My husband complained to an employee who quickly explained to him that seating wasn\u2019t her job.  I think he might have been talking loud enough that someone alerted another employee who came to talk to us but did not introduce herself.  She informed us that she was unable to seat a table of six due to Covid19 restrictions but could seat 5 of us at one table and 2 of us at another across the restaurant from each other. Considering that it was Fathers Day, we didn\u2019t feel that was a feasible option for our family so we left.  We were offered no other option.  She never apologized or Indicated that she felt bad that we had waited almost an hour and could not sit together.   As we walked out, she sarcastically said, \u201cHave a nice dinner\u201d.

We ordered food and some salads. And waited........ It took a while and the food arrived. Never got our salads. He apologized for that and then brought them as well. The salads were decent. Steaks were ok, but some were so thin that there was no way to cook them correctly to temp. Of which most were medium to medium rare. The waiter did keep our drinks full and was polite. Forgetting the salads was minor. But after two attempts to try this place.... It's just not that good. We won't be back sadly. Too pricey for it to be mediocre.\n\nWell... It was ok. Wasn't bad.

At 7:45 they still hadn\u2019t seated us and was then told they couldn\u2019t find our reservation.\nWe were finally seated and then the service was slow. On top of that the food was cold when it got to the table. Ordered two T-bones, one was think and looked like a good steak, but was over cooked and cold. The other one was really thin but cooked to the right temperature but was cold when it got to the table also. I\u2019m sure both were the same weight, or they were supposed to be, but a thick juicy 17oz steak is much better than a large extra thin 17oz steak any day. The thin one looked like something from Waffle House.\nI know this place isn\u2019t in the same league as Ruth\u2019s Chris steak house, and I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be, but it\u2019s not even up to Texas Roadhouse level.\nThe manager came over and apologized but made no offer to make it right, not even to cook new steaks.\nDefinitely not wasting my time or money coming here again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923e1ccb42077:0x85f66f6e42d882c7"}

So many mistakes, several made more than twice, and everyone had an excuse or wanted to blame it on their other \u201cteam\u201d members.\n\nFirst, my son had to ask for sweet tea twice. Both times he was brought unsweet tea. When we complained that the second glass wasn\u2019t sweet either, she tried to act like it was my personal definition of \u201csweet\u201d that was wrong. They figured out someone neglected to actually put the sweetener in but never apologized. And then tried to charge us $3 for it when it was included in the kid\u2019s meal. They also tried to charge $3.40 for my daughter\u2019s milk that was supposed to be included AFTER being told to remove the charge. Second, my coffee that I ordered when I arrived was cold and I had to wait 10 minutes for a replacement AFTER asking for it AGAIN. Another excuse was given when asked why the coffee wasn\u2019t kept hot in the kitchen.\n\nLast, what is most upsetting is how we were made to feel when making our complaints. I know it\u2019s a fairly new restaurant at that location. I get that there are certain mistakes that happen at any restaurant (like forgetting lemons in the water which also happened tonight). What I don\u2019t get is how 3 or 4 people on their \u201cteam\u201d could make us feel like we were difficult customers when it was their repeated mistakes that led us to complain! And never once did they offer to compensate. In fact, they tried to charge us for their mistakes! I would have rather eaten at Chick-fil-A where my business is appreciated. My family will not be going back.\n\nJust so you know, this is my first time ever to leave a bad review for anyone. I don\u2019t do this as a hobby.

Naturally sirloins are a lean meat and it's difficult to keep this cut tender if not cooked rare/medium-rare. Nonetheless I did enjoy my food and the service was decent.\n\nVisit 2) Ordered the ribeye and garlic mashed potatoes (I know it's completely opposite from the last meal). The mashed potatoes were fantastic. The ribeye though, MAN! That ribeye was an excellent steak and seasoned to perfection. Ribeyes are one of the fattiest cuts and they can be cooked well done while maintaining tenderness. I got mine medium rare. I highly recommend that dish.\n\nOverall this place has a great atmosphere, the service was good, and the food has a good range.

So many mistakes, several made more than twice, and everyone had an excuse or wanted to blame it on their other \u201cteam\u201d members.\n\nFirst, my son had to ask for sweet tea twice. Both times he was brought unsweet tea. When we complained that the second glass wasn\u2019t sweet either, she tried to act like it was my personal definition of \u201csweet\u201d that was wrong. They figured out someone neglected to actually put the sweetener in but never apologized. And then tried to charge us $3 for it when it was included in the kid\u2019s meal. They also tried to charge $3.40 for my daughter\u2019s milk that was supposed to be included AFTER being told to remove the charge. Second, my coffee that I ordered when I arrived was cold and I had to wait 10 minutes for a replacement AFTER asking for it AGAIN. Another excuse was given when asked why the coffee wasn\u2019t kept hot in the kitchen.\n\nLast, what is most upsetting is how we were made to feel when making our complaints. I know it\u2019s a fairly new restaurant at that location. I get that there are certain mistakes that happen at any restaurant (like forgetting lemons in the water which also happened tonight). What I don\u2019t get is how 3 or 4 people on their \u201cteam\u201d could make us feel like we were difficult customers when it was their repeated mistakes that led us to complain! And never once did they offer to compensate. In fact, they tried to charge us for their mistakes! I would have rather eaten at Chick-fil-A where my business is appreciated. My family will not be going back.\n\nJust so you know, this is my first time ever to leave a bad review for anyone. I don\u2019t do this as a hobby. I\u2019ve never felt so disrespected at a restaurant before.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923e1ccb42077:0x85f66f6e42d882c7"}

The first two locations in our area recently opened, so we were anxious to try it out. We had lunch there last Friday. We skipped the appetizers after seeing the meals being served at tables nearby (very large portions). I did have a Grilled Pineapple Margarita, one of the featured drinks, and it was awesome! If it had been a little later, I would have had several more. I selected the 5 oz. bacon wrapped filet ($19.99) with salad & baked potato (there is a $2.49 up charge for the baked potato at lunch). My meal was delicious. My husband had the ribeye ($18.99, I think) with salad and garlic mashed potatoes. His meal was delicious as well, and when we go back, I will have the ribeye myself. It was one of the best ribeyes we've had. For dessert, we shared some kind of brownie/cookie skillet  with ice cream that was incredible and probably actually big enough for 4 to share. The service was excellent as well. All in all, a great experience & we will definitely go there again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923e1ccb42077:0x85f66f6e42d882c7"}

We had issues with an overcooked steak and they offered to put another on the grill.  We denied because the one we had was good but it was not how we ordered, which was our fault we tried something new and it backfired.  Anyway, I loved it.  Patrick was a great waiter.  Atmosphere is great, decor was entertaining, and the place was clean.  I didn't go to the restrooms so I can't comment on that.  There is alot of parking but even with that said, we had to drive around looking for parking on a Sunday afternoon at 2:30pm.  My husband even said that made him want to eat there even more because it meant it was good.  We were not disappointed.  It was delicious.  No sure if there is wifi but either way, it's a restaurant enjoy the company you went with and/or the decor around.  Disconnect if you can, it's worth it.\nSide note:  I would have given 4.5 rating if I could.  Con was not so bad to give a full blank star  but I could't do that.  So it is what it is...\nCon:\nPlace was HOT!!  I am usually cold natured and it was hot even for me.  My husband couldn't take off any more layers.  Our waiter was sweating and so were other people around us.  It was a bit disgusting.  Our waiter was a good sport though.\nFINAL VERDICT:\nWE WILL BE BACK.  REALLY ENJOYED IT!

First, we all know that Covid has happened and I've given this place chance after chance this past year in hopes that maybe, this time things would be different. Today, I'm just done. This place has weird hours 7am-8pm. So you can choose, do you want breakfast or do you want to make yourself late. That's why it's always empty in the morning for rush hour. Then, they rarely operate the app. Oh, they will tell you it's \"down\" but then, you'll have an employee like I got today who quickly replied yes when I asked if that was done purposely. She said they were \"short-handed\" The only way you could order was to go through the drive thru, all of the drive ups had signs that said \"Sorry :-( Drive thru only.\"\nSo, I gave it a chance anyway seeing as my order was being taken by someone outside to make me feel like I was at chick-fil-a ...\nI waited through the line, which was wrapped all the way around the building, it moved fairly quickly. I thought well nothing else is working for them, so maybe this is a good thing. Got to the window, was given the wrong amount to pay but after fumbling the young lady got my order correct and took my card. Then, while waiting for receipt, I was again offered the wrong food this time, but what looked like a perplexed manager of sorts. Almost as if she wanted to argue for a second, how could I be the wrong car, lol... Um, yes, I managed to jump line in my car. Eyes rolling, then I was finally given my order and it was lukewarm, my tea was watered down and my food was not good. Now, I know it sounds like I'm being a total @ss but honestly I'm not, see this happens at this location ... all... the... time! I've waited forever for food at the drive up and then been handed food that a 10 year old could better prepare. I'm not sure if it's an employee retention problem, a management issue, or just simply that no one here cares. One would think, after a nice renovation that management would put in a little effort. I can honestly say, I have lived in Pelham for 13 years. My kids grew up coming to this spot after ballgames, late night snacks, etc and the food was always good. Not sure why they even redone this restaurant because it has been horrible since day one of their new re-opening. Anyone who eats at Sonic normally goes for the drive up. I could care less about the drive thru or the inside. Also, was great because you could go at 10pm at night for a treat. Whoever is running this location needs to do better but I for one, have given it my last go.

The staff was very uninformed on the menu & what options they no longer carried. We went in & I ordered a family size tot for my family & it showed on the ordering screen \"family tot\" with the appropriate price. I paid at the order box & our food came out quickly, but in a smaller bag than we were expecting. I asked the waitress about the family order of tots & she said it wasn't an option & so she gave me a large size order. Instead of asking if I would like a refund or a different size tot, she said she would ask her manager about it. She came back about 30 seconds later & said the manager refunded the difference & she walked off before I could say another word. I feel the waitress & manager were extremely rude for not properly informing us & giving us an option for something different. I never even saw the manager since the interior \"eat in\" area is just like ordering outside in your car. The staff needs better training & the store needs a better manager instead of the one they have!

Some our sauces we lose money on at .29 fwiw and we spend a great deal of time making and pouring them each day which is why we need to charge a little bit for them.

I don\u2019t know who would want to eat and small piece of chicken that is burned. Whoever prepared this meal did not seem to care about the customers at all. The nearest chick fla is in mobile that I know of and I\u2019m really thinking about taking my business. Only good thing about the meal was the sweet tea and the hash browns.

I never leave negative google reviews but at this point I feel obligated to. On my first 2 visits to this cookout they manage to completely mess up both of my orders. On my 3rd visit I sat in the outside lane waiting to order but no one answered me through the speaker. I then pulled up to the window and asked if the outside lane speaker works and the employee told me no it did not. I asked why was there no sign on the speaker indicating this or why was the lane not blocked off. At this point there was already a line of cars waiting behind me attempting to order in the outside Lane. The worker then had the audacity to ask me if I would personally go tell the other cars waiting behind me that they would have to pull into the inside lane if they wanted to order. After all of that they did not let me place an order at the window and then told me I would have to drive around and get back in the one functioning lane. I promptly said no thank you and left. Honestly, if I could give this place negative 5 stars I would.

What I found was a cheaper than expected menu with good prices but the food is also just very average, nothing special, average quality.  The milkshakes are nothing special. Dairy Queen and Sonic have much better milkshakes and I would say Burger King has a better burger.

It had two thru lanes and both were full. It took around  8 minutes from the start  of the line until we got the food but wait was mainly due to people reading there very big menu and not due to waiting on food.\n\nI did love the choices of options. I would recommend you view their menu online and decide what you want before you get there because you could become overwhelmed by choices if you see it for the first time.\n\nWe spent around 7 dollars each.  I got a drink, burger and dog. The other order was a chicken sandwich, slaw, onion rings and drink. The chicken patty was small and flat compared to other fast food. The slaw was in a small sauce cup and she only received three breaded onion rings. She said the taste was good but the potions small. My burger & dog were ballpark field quality in a good way. The taste was great and they were the perfect size. I also loved being able to customize what I wanted on both.\n\nI saw they had a walk up window for orders as well in case you didn't want to wait in the drive thru line. I think if you want a chicken sandwich you may want to go somewhere that focuses on it but if you have people who want different things from Corndogs to BBQ to Shakes then this is the perfect one stop place to make everyone happy.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgNTjcwzwld6lwBRH1JH-Etz9JVSgf4d51_pyS=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-ir1oF5gdeqo7U44RngJ9WhlY-3TuUmtlv1V0=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMh6ksI47bCSqRnuB7oKxYS7y0ra3F8LqWobcOv=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOutdzFhzvI41UOgnyaiqlzNAVrUJyFjHOdVvi=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPi0D74XqItiycfWGUfr6rjfXCD7gP0cpO4o_A=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891f2b21c94d59:0xf5c15aee62a1d993"}

I hope one opens up in Birmingham so I don't have to go on a road trip to get my food. I  have NEVER heard of Cook Out Restaurant,  only the movie Cook Out with Rapper Eve.
