Nick Morris was the first person to approach us and we were more than impressed with his easy, friendly demeanor and willingness to explore our wants in a new boat.  He spent time with us, but also gave us space to look around and gather thoughts.  That casual attitude of salesmanship is quite rare.  He knew tons of details about the Supra. Chad and the other guys were also so friendly & helpful with boat and purchase details. We understood immediately that we were buying a choice in a boat dealer and felt extremely comfortable that Skiers Marine was the number one choice.\n\nThis was a large purchase and we did not take it lightly, but the Supra quality coupled with Skiers Marine quality and reputation made this new boat purchase an easy decision.\n\nThank you for being at the boat show and all of the awesome incentives.

Because we spend a lot of time on the water, we have purchased 6 Malibu boats in an effort not to have too many hours on one boat before trading ( it really had nothing to do with all the new cool stuff that became available). We are super excited about Skiers Marine selling MasterCraft boats! We plan on ordering our new MasterCraft boat at the 2016 Birmingham Boat Show. The staff at Skiers Marine treats us like family, and that is very important to my family. This will be our first MasterCraft and we can't wait.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889419875558687:0x71119d6c950af788"}

We couldn't be happier. He knows his stuff and really went above and beyond what I would think anyone should do.  No pressure to buy and he let our 3 little kids climb all over his super nice boats without shedding one tear- while we deliberated over which boat to get.  After several weeks and my slow decision making process -  He drove to pick up the boat - drove to our lake to deliver it and then rode around with us for over 3 hours making sure we were comfortable. I think we had to kick him out of the boat bc we knew that he had an hour and a half drive back home.\nAbsolutely happy!  And I think their team was just as excited about the boat as we were.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889419875558687:0x71119d6c950af788"}

Kit Barnes was, by far, the best sales person that I have every worked with.  After 20 years of experience with I/Os and a desire to wake surf, we decided to look into purchasing an inboard/tow boat.  Our requirements were unique, in that we wanted a tow boat that was in the 25 foot length, had a large open bow area and yet could also provide a decent wave for surfing.  During my research, it seemed that a Mastercraft X55 was about the only boat that could potentially meet our needs.  I found a few X55\u2019s of interest on Boattrader, sent inquiries out, and Kit was the first to respond (within a day or two).  He later followed up with a phone call to better understand our situation and he even offered advice on different models and brands.  I was very impressed that he expressed interest in helping us find a boat that best matched our needs and really gave me a crash course on the different models of inboards.  The biggest thing is that he really worked with us on the X55, since I knew that we had to stay in a larger model to meet our family\u2019s requirements.  Kit was the only person that was willing to work with us to see if we could configure the X55 to produce a nice wake for surfing.  The test drive went great and with a few adjustments, Kit had the boat configured to make a nice wake for surfing.\n\nWe really appreciate the time that Kit spent with us in answering all of our questions and educating us on the Mastercraft X55.  We proceeded to purchase the boat and are also very happy with the ongoing support and service that Skier\u2019s Marine provides to us. The Athens staff made our buying experience great.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1483503659909, "text": "Thank you for the kind words and for allowing us to serve you!"}, "gmap_id": "0x8889419875558687:0x71119d6c950af788"}

Since we had never owned a boat before, we were very apprehensive and nervous about this process. We met with multiple dealers to get a feel for what we wanted and what we could afford. Skiers Marine provided us first class customer service and was by and far the most knowledgeable and down to earth. The owner, Rhett went above and beyond anything we would ask for in this process. For instance, he brought the boat from Birmingham to our friend's neighborhood on Lake Martin so that we could demo it. He spent a couple of hours with me, my wife, and my three little boys demonstrating the boat. Once we decided that we wanted the boat, the purchase process was straight forward and simple. We live in Northern Atlanta. I expected to take a day off of work to drive to Birmingham and pick up the boat. When the boat was prepared and detailed, Rhett called and let me know the day that HE could deliver it! Rhett drove to Atlanta, delivered the boat, and taught me how to put the boat in and out of the water. Yesterday, I arrived home to a package from Skiiers marine. I opened up the box and found two life jackets! Thank you Rhett and Skiiersmarine for taking care of us through this process. If you are buying a boat for the first time (or 2nd or 3rd time), I would highly recommend Rhett and Skiers marine.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889419875558687:0x71119d6c950af788"}

Living in Minnesota, and not being able to see the boat in person before purchase, Rett was more than accommodating in answering the numerous questions I had before committing to the purchase. He was kind enough to offer to have the boat brought to the Athens store to knock a few hours off of our drive.  The day we picked up the boat, Chad spent a few hours making sure I was familiar with the boat on the water.  2,000 miles and a memorable road trip with my son later, we have the boat back in MN.  Rett and Chad truly care about their customer's experience. I wouldn't  hesitate to drive 2,000 miles again to buy another boat from Skier's Marine in the future.
