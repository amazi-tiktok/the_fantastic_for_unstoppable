I had a scheduled meeting with the admissions office to get information about their vet program since they were unable to send information through the mail. When I first arrived, I had to fill out a life questionnaire and turn it in. Once I got in my meeting, 95% of the meeting was asking rather personal questions about my personal life rather than going over what the school had to offer me. I was told I would need 2 vehicles to attend. Within 10 minutes of my scheduled meeting, the advisor asked me to hold on so she can go consult another \"potential student\" who had a meeting. After waiting in my scheduled meeting for several minutes while she talks to another potential student (which made me feel like I wasn't important) she returns to finally start reviewing about the program. About 5 minutes in, she left the meeting again to talk to a different \"potential\" student. I was told they do not hire teachers, they hire professionals that only require 3 years of training. I asked several times about financial aid options and was given no information. I then inquired about how I could use this program as a bridge to become a future vet and the lady told me that being a vet was hard work and lots of money and it probably wont happen for me. She mentioned that once I graduate, they could not guarantee me a job. Then when she realized that I was only there for information and not immediately ready to start, she shut the whole meeting down and told me that there are people waiting in the lobby who want to start classes now and require her attention more than I and to return when I am ready. She quickly handed me a brochure and I left. I would not recommended this school to anyone. Very unprofessional!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626957c65de5f1:0x352012e0212f404d"}

Not even a fridge or microwave to bring our lunch. i would bring my lunch if i had a way to keep it cold or heat it up. If your thirsty and need something to drink we have to walk next door.

I had a scheduled meeting with the admissions office to get information about their vet program since they were unable to send information through the mail. When I first arrived, I had to fill out a life questionnaire and turn it in. Once I got in my meeting, 95% of the meeting was asking rather personal questions about my personal life rather than going over what the school had to offer me. I was told I would need 2 vehicles to attend. Within 10 minutes of my scheduled meeting, the advisor asked me to hold on so she can go consult another \"potential student\" who had a meeting. After waiting in my scheduled meeting for several minutes while she talks to another potential student (which made me feel like I wasn't important) she returns to finally start reviewing about the program. About 5 minutes in, she left the meeting again to talk to a different \"potential\" student. I was told they do not hire teachers, they hire professionals that only require 3 years of training. I asked several times about financial aid options and was given no information. I then inquired about how I could use this program as a bridge to become a future vet and the lady told me that being a vet was hard work and lots of money and it probably wont happen for me. She mentioned that once I graduate, they could not guarantee me a job. Then when she realized that I was only there for information and not immediately ready to start, she shut the whole meeting down and told me that there are people waiting in the lobby who want to start classes now and require her attention more than I and to return when I am ready. She quickly handed me a brochure and I left. I would not recommended this school to anyone. Very unprofessional!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626957c65de5f1:0x352012e0212f404d"}

Then on top of that the higher up people want to say it is important to eat but we have no machines for food , or drinks for our breaks. Not even a fridge or microwave to bring our lunch. i would bring my lunch if i had a way to keep it cold or heat it up. If your thirsty and need something to drink we have to walk next door.

Then on top of that the higher up people want to say it is important to eat but we have no machines for food , or drinks for our breaks. Not even a fridge or microwave to bring our lunch. i would bring my lunch if i had a way to keep it cold or heat it up. If your thirsty and need something to drink we have to walk next door. If we had a fridge or a microwave it would probably cut down on money for everyone and stop students being out of the classroom longer than the scheduled ten minutes.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626957c65de5f1:0x352012e0212f404d"}

After waiting in my scheduled meeting for several minutes while she talks to another potential student (which made me feel like I wasn't important) she returns to finally start reviewing about the program. About 5 minutes in, she left the meeting again to talk to a different \"potential\" student. I was told they do not hire teachers, they hire professionals that only require 3 years of training. I asked several times about financial aid options and was given no information. I then inquired about how I could use this program as a bridge to become a future vet and the lady told me that being a vet was hard work and lots of money and it probably wont happen for me. She mentioned that once I graduate, they could not guarantee me a job. Then when she realized that I was only there for information and not immediately ready to start, she shut the whole meeting down and told me that there are people waiting in the lobby who want to start classes now and require her attention more than I and to return when I am ready.

It was excruciating, to say the very least. My usual dentist could not see me in an acceptable amount of time, and I was also traveling to Birmingham for school daily-- about an hour and a half drive, one way-- so I begged the internet to help me find a dentist who could pull a tooth of a horribly anxiety ridden terrified patient who might look like an adult but retreated into toddler status when confronted by dental tools, and one who I could afford, as I had no insurance to speak of. They overwhelmingly recommended UAB dental school clinic, so I called up the emergency dental clinic and begged for an appointment asap. They got me in the next day, but were not able to provide me with any kind of ballpark estimate for the procedure, which I already knew would be a complex extraction on a molar and would require nitrous and a calm provider. It was actually kind of rough dealing with their administrative staff, both on the phone and in person. I realize these people see patients from all walks of life and a lot of them are scared, in pain, broke, and in need of a compassionate ally. The office staff was not that ally for me, unfortunately. I arrived for my appointment, filled out paperwork, and proceeded to wait about three hours before I was seen, which I understand is normal. I was already crying by the time they got me into the chair, but my student provider was really, really kind, and she held my hand and talked to me and distracted me with ridiculous jokes until I could calm down a little. She examined my mouth, then the area of complaint. She wrote down what she thought the treatment plan should be to address the problem, and took it to her supervisor dentist and he did a quick exam and approved it. She started with the numbing shots which were actually the least painful numbing shots I've ever had. That shocked me! And y'all, before I even realized she was done with the shots, she had my tooth snatched right out of me!! I did not even have to use nitrous! It was the fastest extraction I've ever had, and I've had A FRIGGIN BUNCH. That part of my experience was phenomenal. They hooked me up with some antibiotics and sent me on my way.\nMy bill ended up being$300+ for one extraction. If I'm being honest, I've paid less than that at private dentists that were a whole lot closer to me. That part wasn't so great, as I'd been led to believe this was a less costly alternative to private dentists.\nOverall, a good experience, I would return for like routine cleanings, and am considering taking my daughter to the orthodontic clinic. I currently need extensive work done, I need bone grafts and implants and all kinds of awful stuff, uggggg, but I hesitate to say I'm comfortable going here only because they were not transparent about pricing, and that matters for me. I would consider a free consultation, but I don't think they offer one, just a heads up.

After 3 hours of sitting waiting and X-ray I was taking up stairs to oral surgery where I waited 45 minutes. Once I was in the back the assistant (she was very nice) came in and took my bp again and told me the doctor will be in soon. When the doctor came in he didn\u2019t speak nor  introduce himself. Talking in an aggressive tone, He said, \u201cI\u2019m going to let the chair back. Now open your mouth.\u201d After checking out the tooth that was causing pain I begun asking him a question about another tooth but he rudely stopped me in the middle of my question aggressively saying \u201cNo I\u2019m not doing that today I\u2019m just going to take that tooth out.\u201d I said, \u201cokay\u201d. The equipment was already in the room so he grabbed the needle and begun to numb me. (This is not my first time getting a tooth pulled) He stuck the needle in swiftly moving it around in my gum fast as he was pushing it further in applying lots of pressure. I know I was in pain and needles never feels good but the way he handle me was rough. As I sat there with tears going down my face and in more pain than what I came with. He didn\u2019t give it at least 1 minute to kick in. Right after he was getting ready to pull my tooth. I told him it wasn\u2019t numb because I was rubbing and pushing my tongue against my gum and tooth, I could feel it. Sounding angry He stated \u201cit should be numb!\u201d By this time the assistant came in asking me \u201care you okay?\u201d I couldn\u2019t respond. The doctor put down the tools to pull and numbed me again he shoved the needle in on the inter side of my gum applying extra pressure/force. I was holding still as possible, but the force of him pushing was pushing my head back. After that torture I stated \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this!\u201d the doctor threw the tools down on the table and started to walk out he stopped at the door because the assistant stated \u201cyou half way there let\u2019s get it out.\u201d I stated \u201c he been rude rough and aggressive since he been in here. I scared of him.He don\u2019t have any compassion nor consideration at all\u201d. In a very nasty tone the doctor then said \u201c it not my fault you need your tooth pulled. It\u2019s not my you don\u2019t take care of your teeth. You the one that needs your tooth pulled not me.\u201d  I asked him \u201c are you okay? Are you stressed or over worked? Because I felt the tension soon as you walked in the room.\u201d The doctor the stated \u201cyou already in pain so it\u2019s going to hurt. You should\u2019ve brushed your teeth\u201d. The assistant then intervened saying \u201clet\u2019s just get you out of pain it will be over soon\u201d. I agreed. The doctor tone of voice got a lot nicer afterwards. Going off the name on my RX bottle his name is Cameron Walsh, Den. It was a nightmare with him.\nThe building was nice and clean.

The \"pocketing\" progressed over the two years that I went there despite my best efforts to keep my mouth clean. I didn't understand this, as I was and still am a young man, and the supposed pocketing was advancing even in previously healthy areas.\n\nI was told after 2 years of seeing them every 3 months and 2 separate full mouth scaling and root planings that my pockets had somehow worsened since my last checkup a mere 3 months ago from 5 mm in a couple spots to as far as 7 mm in several spots in all 4 quadrants and I would need full mouth gum cutting surgery(flap surgery) to the tune of over $2,000. Keep in mind that multiple dental professors were overseeing the students that told me this and confirmed their diagnosis every step of the way.\n\nIt was at this point that I finally understood that something was off about what they were telling me and went to an established periodontist. I did NOT tell this periodontist anything about my experience so far, only that I had received troubling news from another dentist and would like for my pockets to be measured. I had one 5mm spot and everywhere else was a 4 at worst. She recommended laser surgery in just that ONE quadrant with a 5mm pocket. I'm honestly not even sure I needed THAT after my experience at UAB, but I didn't want to take any chances with my teeth.\n\nIt's been over 3 years since I last went to the school of dentistry. To reiterate, they told me that I needed gum surgery and that I would likely lose all of my teeth in no time flat if I didn't do it. That my pockets would worsen and worsen at the same rate they supposedly were(4-5 mm to 7 mm in the time span of 3 months). Since then, my pockets have not gotten any worse, and in some areas have gotten much better. I have a few 4mm now that I have to clean diligently and that's it. I still have all of my teeth. I DO have tooth pain now, and I DO have gum recession now, but it's ONLY in areas that were previously healthy. For example, my two upper front teeth had no pockets or recession whatsoever at any time, even as measured by UAB. They still don't have any pockets, but after being needlessly scaled twice, the gums have receded ever so slightly and I have ugly pinholes in between my teeth. I am convinced that the only reason they ever receded in the first place was my treatment at UAB, as they have not before or since.\n\nGoing to this place was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. I feel as if I paid them for the privilege of being a test subject. If I had continued trusting what they told me, I would have had completely unnecessary and irrevocable full mouth surgery. My smile would have been permanently damaged. I have a VERY hard time understanding how so many different people there could all have had SO many different measuring mistakes of the magnitude they did. Both the periodontist and dentist I go to now tell me I have no worrying pockets and never had any except in that one quadrant.\n\nI did have some other work done here as well, and as far as I know it was fine and they did a good job, but my experience RE the recommended surgery based on wrong...or fudged, not sure if that's better or worse...measurements makes me question everything they did.\n\nI hope my wording isn't too harsh, and I did experience plenty of professional and caring people there, as it's a huge clinic, but I do feel very strongly about almost going through with a life-changing surgery at my own expense only to find out from other professionals that it wasn't necessary. If I hadn't gotten a second and third opinion, I may very well have, and my teeth wouldn't have ever looked right again.\n\nI ultimately would not advise going to this clinic unless you have no other choice.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc203daed6b:0x7aa7178d56f3949f"}

For one of them, they can\u2019t seem to properly communicate with our insurance company in order to get it billed properly. My other son, they supposedly sent me a refund check over a year ago that never arrived. Since October 2017, I have communicated with their offices at least a dozen times, several times in person in their office.  Every single time, they have told me that they will re-issue the check but this has never been done. Numerous times they have blamed it on not having my correct address, but the fact is they have no problem getting bills to my address. Every time I confirm my current address with them,  they supposedly input it into the system. At one point, they input an address that was virtually unrecognizable when compared to my actual address (apparently Plaza De Toros is too difficult for some people, even when spelled out!). The last time I was in there, they told me that the check was in an office across street and has been sitting there for the last year.   It would have been nice to know that I could just go over there and pick it up each and every time I have been at their building. Unfortunately, they tell me that no patients/ customers are allowed to go to that office. That makes sense, as it stands to reason that some people would more aggressive measures than I over a business\u2019 complete lack of sense and ability to properly handle another person\u2019s hard earned money. (I on the other hand, have resorted to an internet review, though I\u2019m close to taking it to a courthouse But I digress). The last time I was there, this secret office was supposedly closed. They promised me that they would have a check overnighted the next day. That was nearly 2 weeks ago.  I simply cannot fathom how so many people in a single department can be as incompetent as these people are. At one point, they sent me a bill for my son\u2019s dentistry work- the same son under which account the refund is owed. I wrote on their bill,  \u201cPerhaps when you send the refund that you have owes of me for over a year, I will pay your bill .\u201d  I placed the annoyed bill and a copy of their letter stating they owe me a refund in the return envelope and mailed it back to them. I never received so much as a phone call inquiring of why their customer service is such a disaster and how they can help.

Other than that, I will never utilize their services again, nor would I ever recommend them to anyone.\nThat being said, Dr. Marcello is fabulous. Too bad she\u2019s a student Dr, which makes her only temporary. She\u2019s a temporary shining star.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc203daed6b:0x7aa7178d56f3949f"}

The parking is horrendous and getting worse every time we go!!! I would not recommend this until they get the parking situation under control! It is bad when you drop off your child and there is absolutely NO where to pay and park!!! You cannot even go to Mcdonalds and buy something and wait for them to call you to pick them up. You really need to provide parking for paying customers!!!!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc203daed6b:0x7aa7178d56f3949f"}

Her initial visit was with Dr. Kentros and Dr. Pignataro at the Dental Hospital.  They are exceptional.  They are caring and explained everything very well as to what needed to be done for her.  Their office staff is very friendly, as well.  Due to bad hygiene (not uncommon with aspergers), all of my daughter's teeth had to be extracted.  The staff at the Oral Surgery office was great, also.  We now have to return every few weeks to prepare for dentures.  I am sure we will be very pleased with the outcome.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc203daed6b:0x7aa7178d56f3949f"}

Everything was fine until I needed Teeth pulled.  I spent over two hours in chair being manhandled by Students.  Where was the supervision.  I had two teeth cut from the bone to have a partial installed later.  The pain has been excruciating with little medication.  A week later after running out of medication and pain was still persisting, I returned to the school and was told everything looked ok even though The pain had extended into my jaw, temple , and side of skull.  I was given 8 tabs of pain medication.  I explained I lived 125 miles away and had ran out of pain meds before, to no avail.  3 days later and I'm out of meds and in excruciating pain still.  I called the emergency line at 10 am est. , explained my situation, and was told someone from the faculty would contact me soon.  Here I sit 8 hours later without a return call.  Luckily I was able to get an emergency appointment with my previous dentist that afternoon and my pain was taken care of temporarily.  I cannot return to this school for the additional dental work I need because of their lack of follow up with patients.  I feel that if there was proper supervision in the oral surgery department, this incicdent may not have happened.  Also during the procedure, a tooth that was supposed to support and end of the partial had been turned, was loose, and would not support the partial now.  I will probably loose this tooth also.  Do yourself a favor if you can afford it, don't go there.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc203daed6b:0x7aa7178d56f3949f"}

Not only was I totally wrong, but I was pleasantly surprised in every way. The waits were no where near as long as I thought it'd be, everyone was SO FREAKING NICE (like, unbelievably nice. which is insane because i have ugly, crooked, and cavity-ridden teeth and have been scolded by every dentist ever until today), it wasn't terribly expensive (I am only in semi-debt to my mother, not The System), and they did everything in their power to make me comfortable. AND I got a real dentist, not a student, because all the dentistry students were off for the day for something(?)!! He was completely overwhelmed with the amount of people who came to have their teeth pulled today, and the dentist STILL took the time to see me because he could tell I was in a massive amount of pain. I also may have promised my nurse and her sister my employee discount because I was so drugged up and happy when she told me they were \"Platos-obsessed\" haha? But oh well! Basically, I have never been so happy with the service I received for anything, ever, and I am eating successfully for the first time since Tuesday (mashed potatoes are my best friend) and I bet I'll sleep tonight, too!!
