While checking out she says \"oh yeah\" or something of the sort. She walks away, comes back with cup while telling me I'd left it. Glad she cleared that up cause home invasion had popped in my mind. It is a Cars cup after all. I apologize to Trussville PD explaining false alarm and hang up. That's a joke, they have me blocked. Anyway, I thank her a bunch, tell her how happy I am to have it, 4yo says \"thank you\" cause he should. I'll allow note taking just this once. We leave, I hear something fall off car.

I went to Home Depot and purchased a new three-way switch but upon pulling the old switch out of the wall I found an unusual wiring that I had never seen. The old switch had three wires vs. the new 4-wire switch and the old switch had the green ground wire connected to a \"Red\" wire. Not wanting to take a chance of burning down my house I took the advise of my friend and called Mr. Electric. They were at my house and had the new switch in within three hours. Although people might feel their price was high, you get dedicated/trained electricians, insured and bonded. I'm willing to pay for that.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1481386074577, "text": "Mr Irvin\nThank you so much for the wonderful comments and for choosing Mr Electric.\nIt's such a privledge to work with customers such as yourself!\nDan Black\nMr Electric of Montgomery."}, "gmap_id": "0x888c2bb791c8ab23:0x5f513be338b68dcb"}

The workmanship of Steven Leavins was simply marvelous and very professional done. I selected Mr. Electric over Dixie Electric, McGehee Electric and R&H Electric for the following reasons:\n\u2022\tThe survey technician, Steven Leavins, was friendly and conducted a fairly thorough survey of the work to be done. This is important because it prevents rework and unnecessary delays in completing the work.\n\u2022\tTheir estimate was very detail, well structured, and nicely presented. Usually, how the presentation (in this case documentation) is delivered reflects the quality of workmanship you can expect.\n\u2022\tQuick response/reply. Mr. Electric responded to my initial query within hours as was your estimate. The other companies took 1-2 days to provide an estimate. This is impressive given the nice job done on the estimate.\n\nI was not disappointed in my choice. Steven Leavins was awesome! His work, attitude, and self-pride are worthy of acknowledgement. I'm not easy to please, but Mr. Electric and the team (namely Steven) delivered as promised and as I expected. Really, if you want some electric work done call Mr. Electric first. Oh, yeah, the company is very reasonable. I promise you will love the workmanship (and the people).", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1506708825540, "text": "Mr F, (Sleep Walker)\n\nYou made our day with this glowing review!
