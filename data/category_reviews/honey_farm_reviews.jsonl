He answered all of our questions and gave us some good tips. I inspected the bees and the frames as I moved them into my hive and they looked GREAT .

I found the queen on the first frame that I pulled (luck of the draw) and saw that the queen is in fact laying based on the size and positioning of the larva in the cells.
