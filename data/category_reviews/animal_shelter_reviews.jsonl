What a relief & what a sweetheart Patricia was, still is, to offer to do that. Twinkle is now my shadow & is actually sleeping right next to me right now. She is such a character. She gets me laughing at her craziness & then she really starts going berzerk. Twinkle has made my life, the unconditional love goes on forever. She is my pal & I love her to the moon & back. Twinkle, my Twilight pup-so glad I found her & she is equally happy that I found her because she is one SPOILED something.

Someone who knew the adopted the dog and was very concerned about the rescue's decision.  This person called me to intervene as I have been involved in rescue for over 25 years.  I called, with the promise of confidentiality, to express deep concern for the dogs care and welfare - short AND long term.  They promised they would investigate.\nThis 'rescue' (as they call themselves) simply called the new owner and read to them ALL the accusations!  Then had the audacity to tell me \"there were satisifed\"!?!  Satisified with what, a lying persons claim that they weren't lying?!?   Not to mention the compromised the confidentiality by relaying all those details!?!\nThen they wrote me an email telling me if I had concerns to contact \"the authorities directly\".  No concern for their poor decision, no accountabliity - just passing the buck onto our local agencies to clean up the mess they created!\nPlaces like this that adopt out simply to find a home for a animal, whether it is a good home or a good fit, is no excuse. There lack of substantial investigation is simply taking an animal that has already been uprooted, at least once, and subject it to a situation where it will likely be uprooted again is a disgrace!   Every new transition likely creates a animal that becomes less and less adoptable!\nDo yourself a favor and DO NOT support this 'so called' rescue and their practices.  Consider for a moment...  that if they don't put effort into properly vetting you - what kind of quality information are they vetting about the animal for you... that you are about to bring into your home?!?\nUPDATE: Sometime after I wrote this review, this 'rescue' called the woman who had the dog, again, and proceed to tell her EVERY detail they could in hopes of unearthing the person who reported them!?!  Absolutely unreal.  This place is a complete and utter shame and give rescues a bad name. I would RUN, not walk, away.

January 14, 2021 I came here and expressed my interest in a puppy VERY clearly. I told the lady ( red head w/ freckles ) Me & my friend were interested in the 2 new puppies ( Dani ( girl )  & Dominick ( boy )  ) they had just got in a couple weeks ago. They told me the dogs wasn\u2019t available for another 2 months & I came up almost every week to create a bond with them. The freckle lady wrote my name & number down & she would give me a call when they were available. NO CALL. During my 3rd visit I was informed that Dani had been adopted by another family. I was concerned as to why she was already given a permanent family & she wasn\u2019t available yet. So I asked questions \u2018 What would I have to do so I can permanently adopt Dominick ? \u2018 ... Young lady told me to fill out an application so she can give it to her manager so she would be informed on what was going on. I filled out an application for him on January 26.  On my last visit, one of the ladies I had never met came to me & informed me that they sold Dominick. She told me the family that adopted both of them had FIRST wanted Dani & had to decide whether or not they would continue to get Dominick. During the time period of them coming to an conclusion, I had already spoke to the freckle lady expressing my interest. WHY continue  to sell him to a family that had to \u2018 decide \u2018 on whether or not to get him & not sell him to someone who had ALREADY displayed interest.

I took home an aplication and returned it a few days after but when I looked at the kitten again she and her siblings had a SEVERE respitory infection. One of her siblings was sneezing so hard there was blood everywhere! The staff was not attentive and distracted by her boyfriend. We had to inform her of the sick kittens. Moments before she had informed me the kittens were ready to go home with a family. They didn\u2019t even know the cats were sick! The windows were unwashed and covered in kitten mucus.I looked into the cat room and one of the adult cats was limping and would not put any weight on her front paw. I\u2019m very disappointed because I have adopted two pets from here when I was a kid,and I once volunteered here regularly when I lived in this state. This place used to be great. I do not by any means mean to be hateful or rude but I would not adopt an animal from here. All the animals are in poor condition and all the cats had respitory infections. I really would like to see improvement in the future because this place used to be great.:(  on the other hand if you are looking for a healthy animal and a shelter with great caring staff and great reviews try Rainbow City Animal Shelter. The staff gave me a tour after asking what I was looking for. I was introduced to every cat. The staff also spent enough time with the cats to now their unique personalities and preferences.
