Drove 45 miles to their store was told it'd be $300.00 just for parts.  Found another place that fixed it for $85.00 in 45 minutes. I hate being lied to to get business.\nEdit for reply:\nMy wife called Tuesday 1/5/21 and told whoever answered the phone, after telling them my issue (power button on my Samsung Galaxy S10 plus fell off). She was told that it wouldn't be a problem and no appointment needed that it'd be $79.00. As I mentioned before I live 45 miles away, I had to leave work early to make sure I had ample time to get there and to get service.\nYes, you are correct,  there was not a record or service ticket made because the guy there looked at my phone said that I'd have to leave it and that the parts would be $300.00 because the board would have to be changed out that the button was all one unit. I value my time and money as much as everyone else and I left without your service. Yes, I do feel like the initial phone call was a bait and switch just to get someone in the store. You know that $19.99 oil change costs $500 because you need tires,wipers, injector cleaning and \"blinker fluid\". It's just strange that my wife was told one thing and I was told another. I called another shop  told them exactly what was wrong, they said same thing. No problem, no appointment needed.  Took phone, they looked at it and the fixed it for the amount quoted.\nFunny thing that one shop said one thing and the other one did it.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1610116073880, "text": "Jason, I cannot find a repair ticket or record of your name, are you sure you have the right place? If so, I would like to reach out to you to find out what happened, as we do not give bogus pricing to obtain business. Mistakes do happen and if this indeed did happen, I'd love the chance to make it right!\n\nWe have a proven track record of being transparent throughout our entire repair process and we pride ourselves on having some of the best pricing in the industry. I especially appreciate this review because it gives me a chance to explain our repair process.\n\nBefore I start, i'd like to point out one thing, there is a giant discrepancy between $80.00 and $300.00. The only phone parts that cost this much are some of the Genuine Samsung Display Assemblies. If another shop was able to resolve this for $85.00, it was a small part repair, like a charging port or proxy sensor, for example. (If parts were needed.) My point is, our prices would have been comparable.\n\nWhen a customer calls in to obtain a price on a particular repair we do our best to go over the details of the problem or issue they are experiencing. If we are confident we know the solution to the issue at hand, we then will give you a price or at least a ballpark figure, so they know what to expect. If we are unsure what the solution is to the issue, we will ask you to bring the device in to be diagnosed, before giving you a price on the repair.\n\nThe Process.\n\n1. Once you come into our office, we go over the details of the issue you are experiencing with your device. We will then go over repair solutions or inform you that it will need further diagnostics to obtain the solution to the issue.\n\n2. We then obtain all your contact information and create you a ticket. We may at this time give you a price on the repair. Below are a couple normal situations.\n\n*Lets go over a couple examples, an iPhone 8, the screen is damaged, everything else on the device is working as intended (we verify this,) we give you a price on the display assembly replacement and an ETA for expected completion.\n\n*Now, lets say its a Gaming Computer, it is randomly turning off or blue screening. We will not know what the issue is without diagnosing all the hardware. In this situation, we will inform you that we will need to perform additional diagnostics to know what it will take to repair this device.\n\n3. Once we have obtained the device, we then will start the diagnostics or repair in the order that it came in. We have other repairs in front of new repairs. Your device will go into the queue and will be worked on when its ticket is next. There are two exceptions to this. Most phone screen repairs, if we have the parts on hand (which we do for all iPhones and some Samsungs,) are completed in an hour or less. (Time will vary depending on the particular repair.) The other exception is, we offer a rush service, this service is paid at the time of when you drop off the device. This is paid to have the device worked on immediately, otherwise tickets are worked on in the order they are received.\n\n4. Once the repair or diagnosis is completed, we then will email, text, and/or call you, to go over any final or further details.\n\n5. Pick up your device and pay for the repairs. Once a repair is completed you can come by and pick up your device at your convenience. We also offer payment options, you can pay in person with cash or card, or you can pay your invoice through our online portal.\n\n**One quick notes, due to COVID-19, we are not allowing our customers to wait on repairs in the lobby. They must either drop them off, wait in the their car, or outside of the building.\n\nJason, thank you for allowing us to go over this process with you and potential customers that may be reading this. Feel free to reach out to me, Clint Silver, owner at ProTek. I would love to know what happened and would love the opportunity to make it right. Thank you and as always, thanks for choosing ProTek!"}, "gmap_id": "0x886268c27f02ac7b:0xf37cf7fc81bd790a"}

I debated leaving this review because I know how harmful bad reviews can be to a small business. Unfortunately, my experience with ProTek was so disappointing I felt obligated to share.\nWhen replacing my screen ProTek compromised the integrity of my water resistant IPhone XS causing it to be hyper sensitive to moisture. This resulted in my phone being corroded by light water exposure only 3days after the iPhone repair. ProTek then refused to refund me the 200$ for the faulty screen replacement which essentially destroyed my 1000$ phone. Let me be clear that my IPhone had been exposed to water on previous occasions to the screen replacement with no issues. ProTek even assured me that there was no water damage prior to the screen replacement. I had expected to have a better experience with ProTek because I had confidence in their customer reviews. Sadly, I have to say I was dissatisfied with their services. At the very least I hope others will take my experience with ProTek into consideration and proceed with caution in regards to ProTek\u2019s remarkable ineptitude with apple products.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1589823914117, "text": "I am very disappointed by this review, i'll explain why. Unfortunately for phones, we are in the warmer months and people like to be on the water and when you're on the water, these type of things will happen. I want to start off by saying that we repair and/or recover data from thousands of water damage devices. When you first brought the iPhone in for a screen replacement it was because you left the iPhone in the rain and it ruined the screen. (We informed the customer that the screen was the only thing damaged by the rain.) We replaced the screen and put a new screen seal on it, (as we do with all repairs.) The phone then came back with standing water inside the device, this amount of water is concurrent with other phones we see that have been submerged into water. The customer asked for a warranty on the screen, unfortunately we cannot warranty water or physical damage. (Simply putting a new screen on this iPhone would not resolve the issue, given the current condition.) In a case like this, with standing water inside the device, we would need to let the water dry (we have tools to speed this process up.) After the water has dried, it will leave corrosion behind, which will need to be cleaned. We would then remove the logic board from the iPhone housing, clean it with our Sonic Cleaner, and then test the device for further component damage. We then would replace the components needed to repair the device. More than likely we could have saved this customers phone, had the customer let us complete the water damage assessment on this device.\n\nPlease remember that iPhone's are not water proof, they are water resistant, and each iPhone has its own water resistance rating. We have seen water damage happen in pretty much every way, from being in your pocket and sweating, to being on the bathroom counter while taking a shower, and to drops in the ocean. Each iPhone handles each exposure differently, because in each exposure, the conditions are different. If you are going to be around water, buy a water proof bag, put your phone into the bag and use it from the outside the bag, only to remove it if you need to make a phone call. This will drastically minimize the chance of water damage. I hope this reply has answered any questions as to how we handle water damaged phones here at ProTek. If you have any questions, concerns, or just want some friendly advice, feel free to contact us at your convenience!"}, "gmap_id": "0x886268c27f02ac7b:0xf37cf7fc81bd790a"}
