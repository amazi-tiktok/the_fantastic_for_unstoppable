I didn't really want to go and deal with Lowe's or Walmart because frankly Walmart scares me right now. The kiosk was in the front of the store. I never had to directly interact with anyone which was a plus. It was simple put the key in like you're putting it in the door and pick out which key you want and I was going to get two keys and it said that I could get a key for free so I ended up getting three keys for everything included around $20. It didn't take that long. They all worked in my door and I made sure that I did the fingerprint in case I ever get locked out of my apartment. All I have to do is go to the kiosk and do the fingerprint and get another key. That's worth its weight in gold. Above all I was very pleased except for I could have got it cheaper somewhere else but sometimes you get what you pay for.

However we purchased a keyless entry/ exit door feature.  This was an option that was very important to us and so we chose a security company that offered it.  When the installation tech arrived I was told that it could not be installed because I didn't have a dead bolt lock on the door.  That I could hire someone else to drill a hole in my door at additional cost.  Already paid $2500 for this security system and now I have to hire someone else to install the door lock.  I  called the salesperson and was told that she could get her husband to drill it. But then he couldn't because he was out of town.  So  3 days later got the hole drilled but when tech came back to install it the lock would jam.  Tech said they never drill door locks.  ADS doesn't pay for that tool because it is so expensive. Very frustrating!  Be careful with the salesperson!  Finally works after spending hours adjusting the door and lock.  Use another security company.

Telephone Representative very helpful in setting up appt. She told me that there would be no charge for the service call as our monthly charge includes the warranty. Service appt. was for the next day - very quick in getting an appt. Service tech - Jonathon Givens - had to replace two door sensors. He then proceeded to tell my wife that our system was outdated and needed to be updated. He offered to update it for a $100 fee. My wife told him she would have to speak with me first before we agreed to anything resulting in a charge. Jonathon then asked my wife how long had we had our system. She told him three years in our current home and approximately seven years in our previous house (total of approximately ten years with ADT.)  He then said he'd go ahead and update our system for no charge, which he did. What was that about??  Offer to update the system for $100?  Would that be considered fleecing a client? And if he was going to update the system for $100, does he pocket the amount, since he updated the system anyway. Kind of \"sketch\" as the kids say these days.  I have not been impressed with ADT monitoring services in the past, and only continued service with them after the 2 year contract (at which time they were going to increase my monitoring price $10/month.) They agreed to keep it at the same rate as long as I agreed to another 2 years.

Unfortunately my mom passed away the day before ADT was set to install. Even under all that pressure I remembered to call and cancel the install while I was out of town. I've been out of pocket for weeks trying to handle mom's business, grieve, and still live so I haven't had a chance to reschedule. ADT proceeded to still charge me two months of service at my old location even though they knew I had cancelled the service at my old house. When I caught it, the call center manager told me that they still bill you 30 days after you cancel. I asked about the other month and she said \"oh we prorated that and took it out of your installation fee.\" So I prepaid $100 for an install that I didn't get. And they took money out of my installation fee for two more months before I caught it. All this while they say sorry for your loss but...at least we gave you back the second month. So instead of $100 back I got about $50. Even during our time with them we were paying several months during one of their glitches and they weren't even monitoring my home.\n\nNo more ADT for me.

From the start, I was uneasy about the experience, but I went ahead with it. Huge mistake. I drove by today and a woman who said she was the owner's friend and acting manager waited on me. I asked her to inspect my car to put tint on the driver and passenger windows only. She inspected them and we agreed on a tint grade and a price. Then I walked down the street to the library to wait. About an hour later I decided to head back, and got a call from the manager on my way. She was agitated, and demanded to know if the car had ever had tint on it before. I replied that it may have, I bought it used. She said that they had already started applying tint to one window when they discovered that there was residue from old tint below the window sill. When I got back to the shop, the manager was in a frenzy. She pointed out the residue, and kept going on about how they had \"wasted $50 worth of tint\". I remained calm and asked them to finish the job. She said they would have to charge me $10 per window extra as a cleanup fee. I refused, saying it was their mistake and they should have inspected the windows more closely before starting (they are the experts, after all). She became very upset and began to shout, again blaming it on me for not telling her about the residue (which, again, was below the windowsill line and not visible). I stood my ground and insisted that it's not my job to know everything, that's why I brought it to a professional. She blew up, began to curse, shout, and refused to look at me in the eye. She shouted at the tint specialist to reassemble my car and send me away. I knew it would cost me even more at another tint shop to have them clean up the messed up tint that was already on my window from Tint Spectrum, so I reluctantly asked the tint specialist what it would take to get the job done right and get be out. He said it would take another $20, so I agreed to pay it. This time, I sat down in the shop and watched them the entire time. I'm not a tint expert by any means, but in my humble opinion, neither are these guys. One of them (who I later found out was the owner) was eating pizza over the hood of my car and asking me whether it was pink or red (it's obviously red). The tint specialist who was working on my car had to rip the tint from the passenger's window, replace it, install tint on the driver's side, rip it off and replace it, and then replace the tint on the passenger's side AGAIN. I'm not sure what he kept messing up, but if each one of those sheets was $50 worth of tint, he easily wasted over $200 worth. The manager continued to stomp around the shop shouting and cursing. The owner didn't seem to care. The tint specialist left lart \"3M\" logos on my window's right in the middle. The manager asked me if I wanted those removed (who in the world would WANT 3M logos in the middle of their window?).\n\nWhen it was all said and done, my final bill was $140 before tax, which was $20 higher than agreed upon earlier that morning due to absolutely no fault of my own. The manager remained rude and loud the entire time, and I must have waited in the shop for well over an hour after I got back from the library. The manager offered no apology other than something about \"didn't mean to snap earlier\". I don't think there is anything in the world that could make me go back to this place or recommend it. The manager is rude, loud, inappropriate and unfair. The staff are very slow, appear to be outrageously incompetent, and are all dirty on top of that (the tint specialist kept spitting tobacco juice on the ground right behind my car). The owner didn't seem to care about anything. I think the quality of the tint is good, since it's 3M. But the service and the installation quality were absolutely not even worth the one star I am forced to grant them. Do not take your car to this place. You will regret it, especially if you have to deal with the manager.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889293004402c64d:0x5a3bd58c8045da98"}
