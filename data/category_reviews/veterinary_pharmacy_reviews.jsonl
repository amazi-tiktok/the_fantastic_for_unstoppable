Above and beyond, even on her weekend off. Dr Myers will always be straight with you about your pet. Yes, some people don't like this but i would much rather have a doctor, people or animal,  tell me the truth no matter how hard it is to hear. I respect this about her.

Dr Myers was most unprofessional during my visit and I am appalled at her behavior.

Needless to say, this will be the last time I use Dr Myer's services for my pets.  I have been using her since 2011 and spent plenty of money in her office.  However, there are too many other qualified, competent and caring vets available in the local area to put up with this.  I chose her because she is in my community and close to my home.  I wish I had done a better job at researching her; if I had, I would have found other reviews similar to mine which would have led me in another direction.  I am a responsible pet owner and care for my pets like they are my children.  I would never knowingly do anything to cause discomfort or harm to my pets.  There was absolutely no need for her conduct today.  Now I understand why there are flyers in her office requesting her clients to leave reviews on specific sites (this is one of them) to counter the bad reviews she has received in the past.

They prescribed medicine that I had to pay for, but he developed Kennel cough at their facility.  He\u2019s 8 years old and never had this happen before.  (2) Took my dog in for grooming at 7 am.  Told it would take 3 hours, after not receiving a phone call I followed up at 1pm, only to be told my dog was groomed, except nails.  He would be ready after groomer retuned from lunch.  Why not finish him, nails take 5 mins???  Well then I go pick him up a hour later and he still not ready.  So the person working the front counter goes back and cuts his nails and now he is bleeding from that experience as I take him home.  (3). While I\u2019m waiting at front counter for my dog another gentleman brings his dog in who is barking quite a bit.  I happen to look back at the Counter Rep and catch her look of disgust of having to deal with this dog. (4) I call on Weekend because my dog has ear infection, Doc calls me back after second message and says it will have to wait till Monday.  Gives me remedies I had already looked up, but no option to get medicine after hours.  I brought my dog in Germany and he has lived in and been cared for Vets on Turkey, Tucson Arizona, Chicago, and Alaska.  Never have we had any of these experiences, and I have all these in 3 short months..  Time to move on and I tried to give benefit of doubt.

We started our dog's care here right after we adopted her from the humane society. We loved how she was treated and how we were treated.

They treated our cat's chronic and severe UTI and he hasn't had one in 2 years; where as at the other vet we felt like he was not being fully treated and was having unnecessary testing for his diagnosis. In Sept. 2013 we noticed that our dog was not acting like herself and it was after hours, so we took her to the ER vet and they misdiagnosed her with gastritis. We took her to Dr. Price the next day because she had gotten severely worse. Within minutes he diagnosed her with an IMHA, which is a very serious, usually fatal, diagnosis. He sat down with me and explained the disease and treatment course. He stayed with her through the night while she received a blood transfusion, to ensure that she didn't have a reaction to it. He even called me late that night to give me an update. Now nine months later she is her perky self. I would never trust my pets to anybody but Oak View!

A year old border collie mix of some sort, who knows? I did my research looking for a vet and asked my friends who they recommended. Oak View came up multiple times so eventually i decided Oak View would be Max and mine's vet. I could not have been happier with the choice. They helped me take my firsts steps as friend and pet owner and made both of us feel like we were part of the family.\n\nMax didn't have his first seizure until 3 months after i adopted him. Oak View walked me through the different reasons a dog can have a seizure and laid out a plan to help moderate or even eliminate Max's seizures. Had Max's condition been epilepsy or even one of the many normal conditions that can cause seizures i can honestly say Oak View would have been able to help him. Through the empirical method we tried everything to help Max. Unfortunately Max's grand mal seizures persisted and i lost a piece of my friend after each one. Dr. Price and Dr. Robinson admitted that this may be beyond their scope and I respect them all the more for it. I took Max to Neurologists, pathologists, and almost every specialist at Auburn and in between. No one could put a finger on it.\n\nWithin a year my friend was no longer himself. Oak View helped with his final moments and the level of caring and comfort they provided i will never forget. Thank you Oak View. I can never thank you enough for the love and support you gave Max and me.\n\nIf you are debating what Vet to use i highly recommend Oak View.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1455550971601, "text": "Our sympathies on your loss - you worked hard to help him with his seizures and issues.

However, you may have gotten a compounded medication from us. May I ask if this prescription was a compound? If this was a compounded medication, we should have let you know that compounds will take at least 2 working days to make. This 2 day delay is because of the time it takes to hand make a compounded medication. Also, we are not open on the weekends, so these 2 working days may be stretched to be 4 actual days before you can pick up your compounded medication. Compounding is a very labor intensive and precise task that cannot be rushed if we are going to produce a quality medication to the exact specifications of your prescribing physician. I apologize if we failed to mention this delay when you came to fill with us. I would like to make things right by offering a $50 store credit to apply to any future purchase with us. Please call the pharmacy and ask for me. I would love to speak with you about resolving this issue. ~ Jeffrey (Owner, Pure Life Pharmacy)"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a0de686e7fa35:0xbfcd9a8677a0e406"}

The office manager helped me with getting out 3 dogs records from our previous vet and arranged our pets visits. During the vet visit the Doctor was on the phone with me the entire time (during COVID) - explained everything including the cost for each test and medication. She answered all of my questions honestly and was great to explain everything. My dog suffers from allergies and previously we were not taken very seriously and told to give large doses of Benadryl even though I explained that does not work for her anymore- it never really did. The most vital part was that she helped me with a treatment plan for my dog. At the end of the visit #1 I was not surprised by the bill- she discussed all that with me as we spoke and #2 I knew the all of the next steps. That was a big deal because where we were before I never had a treatment plan and basically we started over every time we came in. The next day Lucy\u2019s skin was not red, hot, and irritated, she wasn\u2019t chewing on her paws and shaking her head, she wasn\u2019t panting and stressing her and everyone around her out. she was relaxed and calm, and sleeping so peacefully- that hasn\u2019t happened in 8 years for her. The doctor even called me back to go over all of her blood work results. I have never been more impressed with a veterinarian clinic. I am actually a little embarrassed that I continued taking my dogs to the previous vet all these years- had I known the level of service that we were missing and the expertise these doctors offer in comparison to what we had grown accustomed to, I would have moved them many years ago.

Will run an exhaustive list of tests and generate a 2000.00 balance when those tests are not justified by the prognosis or diagnosis. Other vets claim they can't follow the thought pattern and charts were poorly documented suggesting tests were run to make use of expensive equipment for a return on investment. The crates are kept behind closed doors because the conditions are terrible. They over-medicated my dog by giving her a 3 year shot twice just so they could charge for it. You'll notice Debra pushing those heavily. Same as companion... Same vets...same staff... Stay away. Be warned or you are sure to experience one of these terrible experiences.

Dr. Farmer is a wonderful vet and I have used him for years. However recently we saw Dr. Bearden. I cannot recommend her under any circumstances.

Each week we went back and the treatment plan/diagnosis/story changed. The staff would tell me something different than she did each time. She never sent the X-rays to a surgeon. 6 weeks this went on. (Shame on me for letting it go on so long) On the last visit the dog was dropped off 7am, at her request, for observation without the splint. She didn\u2019t look at the dog or remove the splint until I called at 1:30 for an update. At 3:30 she claimed the dog only had \u201cliganitis\u201d but was still not putting weight on the leg. When I asked about the \u201cdent\u201d she claimed I had never told her about it. Not true, and it was easy to see on the dog\u2019s leg. She wanted to give the dog back without a splint. I had the staff splint the leg and took the dog to another vet. She had to have a metal plate surgically implanted to fix the damage.
