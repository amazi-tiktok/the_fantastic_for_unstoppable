I have no disapproval towards the individual employees there.\n\nWith that said, that is unfortunately the extent of my positives about the business. I've brought two of my vehicles there a total of three times, over the course of two years, and each time, I have been disappointed. My first vehicle had a minor oil leak, and I took it to CBA to check it out. Long story short, they charged me over $1000 and a week of time, and in the end, the issue wasn't resolved. Brought my vehicle to another shop on Atl Highway, $250 later, and it was fixed. All in all, this wasn't a huge deal, but I was disappointed in CBA.\n\nFast forward 2 years, and i take another one of my vehicles that I had just purchased to CBA for a post-purchase full diagnosis (This alone cost $120) which they assured me would cover just about everything i needed to get done to the vehicle to get it to top shape. They quoted me over $5,000 worth of service. This alone wasn't completely insane. It was an older vehicle, and yes, a good few things needed fixing. However, I jotted down the items they told me I needed to replace and decided to do the items myself (brake change, coolant flush, oil change, filters, etc). Took off the brakes. The Pads, Rotors were literally brand new. They said my front caliper mount and caliper itself were in terrible condition. Completely false--it was in perfect condition upon further inspection. Performed the coolant change after they claimed it was dirty and needed changing (btw they quoted me $140 for the coolant change, which if you know, is one of the easiest things you can do yourself for $20 worth of coolant and 30 min of your time max). This also turned out to be unecessary. The coolant I drained was the exact same color as the new coolant I purchased myself. I did this for every item on the list of things they told me I needed to change, and the ONLY thing that actually needed to be changed was the front driver struts and the radiator fan.\n\nA week after I get the $5000 list of things that need to be serviced, I drive to Atlanta. Halfway there on the interstate, my timing/fan belt shred apart, engine overheats, and my car is disabled. Tow it to a garage nearby and they inform me that my water pump was well on its way out, A/C compressor had imploded, and timing/fan belts should have been changed a long time ago. NONE OF THESE WERE MENTIONED BY CBA. Fortunately I did not get into an accident, but I trusted CBA to diagnose what I needed to fix on my vehicle, and they failed to mention, at all, three incredibly easy to inspect components that were failing, and caused my vehicle to stop driving in the middle of the highway. Absolutely unacceptable.\n\nIf you're reading this, CBA, come on, step your game up. If you're going to charge one of the highest rates in the entire state of Alabama, maybe provide service that backs up that rate.

CBA was the only other shop I called, as soon as Danny answered my call he said he knew he had to help me, not to worry, they would do everything they could to get me through this. He did. He helped me get it towed from Prattville to their shop in Montgomery. Kept me updated every step of the way and constantly reassured me that they were there to help. My car, unfortunately, had some very major issues and even at CBA prices still was out of my price range. But, I didn't leave without transportation. Danny went above and beyond to help me find a suitable vehicle that I could afford and I left yesterday the owner of a reliable, running vehicle. The people of CBA are some of the kindest people I have had the blessing of meeting. They are truly doing works that reflect the epitome of Christians.

They are just using \"Christian Brothers\" for marketing purposes, not to show a genuine Christian nature. I went in for an alternator swap. I knew it was the alternator and told them as much; didn't stop them from charging me $48 to \"diagnose\" the problem. That was for an half hour of labor which if you want to count the time it took for them to tell me the price, was not a half hour after I brought it in. So yes, their hourly labor rate is $96 which strikes me as a little high, and yes, they don\u2019t mind rounding up to the detriment of the customer. The rest of the bill was just as offensive and out of tune with normal auto repair prices. A re-manufactured alternator for my car was $117 at the time, they charged $244.20 and kept the core fee for themselves. No, they didn't put a new one in, just a re-man. They then charged me $39.78 for a serpentine belt, which I don't mind that they replaced, but a new one at any auto parts store runs around $20. So paying twice for parts is pretty painful, but then they add on a fee for \"shop supplies\"; I'm not sure what for, wear and tear on the tools? A paper towel or two? Whatever they were, they cost me $37.10. You'd think that \"shop supplies\" would be included when you pay premium for the parts and labor. On top of all of that, they padded the hours they were replacing the alternator. They charged me for 1.5 hours ($144.09) but the guy was only working on it for 45 minutes tops. The rest of the time that it was in their garage it just sat there. That's right, a car in Christian Brothers Automotive's garage is accruing labor costs even if it just sits there, hate to see what the overnight tab would be. Just think of the \u201cshop supplies\u201d that leaked into a car that sat there overnight.\n\nThey have three salesman upfront and only two technicians when I was there. This shows their focus: extract every possible penny from a potential customer, especially if he is from out of town. Why pay extra techs when you are still billing for the time that the car sits in their garage right? Another indication of their less-than-honest nature is that they put all these odd-ball prices on the parts and shop fees. Like what is with the 10 cents on shop supplies, they couldn't round that off? Well they could, but they don't want you to realize that they are just padding the bill. Ten cents looks more authentic. They also have a sign in the back that says: \"Ask every customer: Is there anything else we can check for you today?\" I'd hate to see the proposal for work you get back when you give these guys a greenlight to check out your entire car.\n\nThe technicians were good, the alternator seems to be working out fine. But the salesmen are only good at small talk. They brought my car back out of the garage and it started to smoke. They thought the engine was about to explode or something they turn it off and frantically check the oil. When I get out there they say that the oil pan is empty. Nope, check again. When they checked again they saw that it was half full like I knew it was. The smoke was from the debris that got knocked down onto the serpentine belt. Some debris that my $37.10 in shop supplies should have cleaned up. Guess not.\n\nAll-in-all, I paid $545 for a pretty simple fix, and they quoted me on the phone $250 as I was driving trying to get somewhere before my car died. I guess they knew they had me, but I hope this review saves somebody else the expense and frustration of dealing with these guys. These guys bend you over with a smile on their face. If you want this type of service and pay these type of prices, just go to the dealer, at least they are more knowledgeable about your car.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2db31cb0a5bf:0x2c43880b4b10967d"}
