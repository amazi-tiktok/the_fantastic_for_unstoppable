If you don't have lots of money, no worries. They will work with you and allow you to make payments. Jamie, the lady who handles the financial part of the business is a sweetheart.

The dental hygienist, Renae, worked through her lunch break to perform a periodontal treatment on me because I told her it was VERY important that I had it done before the next week. The dentist, listen, you will read reviews saying that she's rude, etc. My goodness, here in the south we tend to be big babies. She isn't rude, at all. She's just very professional and straight to the point. I am sure that she never intended to come across as rude to anyone that's just how she may seem but NOT rude, by any means. I, also, read a lot of reviews where people complained that they tried to force them to buy a toothbrush or only cared to make money. I have a feeling that all of these people, unfortunately, misunderstood a lot. They, too, told me about a certain type of toothbrush and gave me a pamphlet on it. There is nothing wrong with feeling strongly about a toothbrush. Electric toothbrushes clean your teeth and gums far more thoroughly than one that is not. I am sure that the dental hygenist, who recommended the toothbrush to me, doesn't pocket a dime for the people who purchase the toothbrushes. Please don't be misinformed or mislead by other reviews. Give them a try. I am recommending them to you, just like they were recommended to me by a coworker.

I visited this location about a year and a half ago and everything was fine.  Had initial appointment where they did Xrays and evaluation and then had four teeth pulled the next day.  Was way overcharged compared to other dentists in the area, but because they were able to extend a credit line I paid the over priced services for relief from tooth pain with little money out of pocket.  Fast forward to today.  I have severe tooth pain that has had me away all night. I called at 7:30 this morning and the lady that took my call offered me appointments starting at 7:45 (which was the earliest appointment and I took it), and then just about every 15 mins increments after that for the rest of the day.  When we got to my name and information, she stated I was already in their system and would need to call back when the office opened to schedule my appointment.  I just called to schedule the appointment and they can not see me until late afternoon. I asked the lady could they not see me this morning, that I was in a lot of pain and had been up all night and she said no, that 2:30 was the earliest they could see me.  So I questioned why \"new\" patients could be seen as early as 7:45 am and every 15 mins forward, and walk in patients as their website says, can be seen this morning, but existing patients who have already spent a LOT of money with them are not able to be seen until later in the day.  She had no answer other then that is the earliest I could be seen.  Not to mention, even though it has only been a year and a half, I have to do all the exam and Xrays all over again just like a new patient, would not be treated that day for what was hurting and  would have to schedule another appointment to have any work done after the initial appointment.  So this place wants to charge me to complete new patient services, however does not want to give me new patient scheduling times.  I was willing to pay their ridiculous costs because I still have $3000 in credit with their finance company, but I refuse to sit her in pain all day while they schedule new patients in front of me............   Terrible, awful and ungrateful staff and services.

I looked at the papers they have me and they charged me 3 and 4 times for the same thing, then told me that the teeth cleaning is charged for each quadrant of my teeth. This was never explained to me and I have never been to a dentist that charged that way, they did the same thing that other dentist do, and charged me for each quadrant of my teeth, said I had a gum disease, my gums are pushed up over my enamel on my teeth caused from me over brushing them, and brushing them the wrong way,, I did this when I was a child and brushed my teeth 8 to 10 times a day, because my Mom's teeth were so bad and I have seen her in so much pain from bad teeth, so I was over brushing my teeth. I was told that everything would be charged through Genesis Credit, I got a card from the credit company and never activated it... But they don't tell you that the charges are for your first visit only.. Then get the bill and for the few things they did my bill was $1013 and some change.. I went to only get a filling done on a tooth and the dentist was drilling out my tooth that needed filled and kept bouncing off my tooth he was drilling on and kept bouncing off my tooth and hitting a tooth behind the one he was working on, so now I have the tooth he kept hitting with the drill that has to be filled.. I was suppose to go back to get my 2nd cleaning and I was told I would have to pay them in cash for it, then found out that it had already been charged on the credit company, so there they thought they were going to get paid twice,, so Aspen Dental was going to make you pay 2 times for the same thing, as they did on my bill... I was told that the special mouth rinse and special toothpaste was included with the Oral B toothbrush kit, and looked on my papers and was charged 3 and 4 times each for the mouth rinse and toothpaste.. This is the worse dental place I have ever been to... And I have called the Customers Care line and am told they would have someone call me by tomorrow, I have been told this for several times, and the ones that call me tell me to call back if they haven't called me within 2 days, to call them back.. I have been calling them since right after I had my dental appointment and got the paperwork on all the charges and I almost fell over,, I was lied to by the employees, the dentist, and customer care... This is ridiculous... Aspen Dental is a ripoff.. Everyone I have talked to that has been there has nothing good to say about Aspen Dental in Gadsden Alabama.. I have tried to get this straighten out about being overcharged on what was done, and am always told if you don't hear back from me in 2 days, to call back, I have been doing this for months, and they have done nothing to resolve this problem... So my advice to everyone that is bringing about going to Aaron Dental in Gadsden Alabama DON'T USE THEM, THEY ARE CROOKS!!!!!!!...This is the sorriest place I have ever been to... I'm trying to get this straighten out or I'm going to turn them in to the Better Business Bureau, and see if they can do something about them!!!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a3ecf41307ffb:0x4b5df95bcb483c3f"}

And Aspen quoted doing an entire deep clean on my mouth with 21 day round of permanent antibiotics in my gum, NOT, and the other dentist said it looked like only one quadrant may need to be deep cleaned but that because of a bad tooth in that quadrant, you could get a false reading, so we needed to pull that one and then access the deep cleaning at my next cleaning.  Was told by the local dentist that my teeth were in good condition just needed some cavities filled and 2 teeth pulled.

This facility is very new and clearly they need to meet there quota to pay it off. Staff is very nice but when it comes to experience and knowing what they are doing, the lack all of the above. Went to have a simple cleaning and they tell me I have a gum disease. Ok, fair enough I use to smoke so it happens. So I proceed to allow them to do the procedure but wait first I had to pay $180 before I could have any treatment which to my understanding was suppose to cover everything and my insurance cover the rest. Then we go on. They say one of my back teeth js decaying and needs to be uprooted. I allow it to happen because I had bothered me for years. In the most of pulling the tooth the dentist breaks the bone off that holds the tooth in process of pulling it. I told him multiple times before pulling it that I would soon be getting braces and I didn't want that to affect it. Well now that has caused issue with getting braces. So on, I have cavities. A total different dentist is doing this procedure days later. He and the women helping carried on the whole time and was more focused on there conversation than fixing my Cavaties. That being said he didn't fill the tooth the complete way so now I have sensitivity for sweet hot and cold things. The other day I get a bill from them. $172 it was. Going back to the gym disease. I had to \"pay everything up front\" before I could have the procedure done right. At least that's what the lady said. I just got off the phone with them. They begin to tell me the bill is only $126.??? So why did I get billed $50 more than that. Or better question why am I even being billed period when I supposedly had to pay everything that my insurance didn't cover up front.??? Absolute worst experience and place to go.

It is important to me to let people know how wonderful this experience was, and how much I appreciate the \"care\" involved with each step of the way.  Dr. Hirsowitz(Tuscaloosa) is amazing!!  His examination was thorough and he was quick to put together a care plan that was in my best interest and financially affordable.  In addition, I was also seen by Dr. Rotwein (Trussville) whom won my overall admiration for doing one thing no doctor has ever done. Dr. Rotwein personally called me to make sure that I was doing okay after surgery.  In my world, this was just unheard of and I was just floored.  This told me he truly cared for all of his patients and that is a breath of fresh air.   Everyone at both locations office, financial, and medical staff were just amazing!

I had basically neglected getting my annual dental care at the dentist over the past few years. As a single parent of two girls, I took a lot of leave from my job, when I was working, to make sure my children received good dental heath care. I really couldn't afford to take the same kind of leave to care for my own teeth, since I was taking the majority of my sick leave to attend to my health, and other needs for my children. Also, dealing with health problems like multiple auto immune diseases, unknowingly didn't help my teeth, or my situation. My illness took a toll on my teeth. Within the last couple of years, my teeth began to deteriorate at an alarming rate. I knew l needed to take immediate action once I retired,  because I would be eating, and my tooth would actually crumble in my mouth, as I was chewing my food. Moreover, they began to cause me excruciating pain, especially late at night, when I couldn't seek immediate attention, so I began my journey to having a healthy smile. First, I asked friends and family about their dental experiences. I was given several dentist names, and referrals. I narrowed it down to three of the best ones, that I heard the most positive experiences about. Then, I began searching the internet for reviews about the three dental offices. Affordable dentures in Mccalla, was one of the three, that I had heard consistent positive experiences about from family and friends. Surprisingly, they had some of the best reviews, that I had seen. The reviews matched the responses, that I had heard. The wow factor for me was that, the responses were  consistent by a majority of the reviewers. Most of the reviewers stated that, Dr. Latimer was professional, caring, thorough,  knowledgeable, he lessened my fears of anxiety,  he made me feel comfortable, he answered all of my questions and concerns,  it was the best dental experience ever, and I'll definitely be back. Well! I'm not reading a review, I was a patient, and these are my exact sentiments. I made the decision and picked Affordable dentures in Mccalla. Sooooo glad I did!!! I arrived for my full upper extractions, and some lower extractions on June 5, 2020. I was apprehensive, had a lot of anxiety, and nervous to say the least! In my previous dental experiences in the past, I went to the dental  office for a dental procedure, extractions, and because I was in pain. I remember experiencing pain during the procedure, leaving, and being in worse pain, than when I initially came to the dentist. Upon arriving at my appointment at Affordable dentures for my procedure, I was immediately led to the dental room, given a sedative, and instucted to lye down on the dental couch. While on the couch, I received some gas as I waited for Dr. Latimer. The first time he checked on me, \" I told him that the medicine probably wasn't going to affect me much, since I take a lot of pain medication, sleep aids, and other medicines for my health conditions, that are mostly ineffective. He waited a while, and checked on me again, I said, \"I told you, I have a high tolerance for medications.\" The third time, I was being awakened to go home.. Stop! thinking about it, and procrastinating,  and like Nike, \"Just do it!\" Thanks to Dr. Latimer, and his entire staff. I truly appreciate the great care, concern, and service that I received..", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSC3KmCTVbLOuP_TX24XNsEY_CH6hCAo-0Q8as=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1591709558304, "text": "Thank you so much for sharing, Janie!"}, "gmap_id": "0x8888dc1393e8a8c3:0x79c40bdc88238aee"}

The dentist even came in and checked on me. And I wasn't even their patient!! It did not matter because they just saw my mom's concern and wanted to make sure I was ok. The dentures I purchased for my mom really were affordable and there were no hidden fees or additional costs; we paid exactly what they said we would on the phone.

At that time, I took my old denture in for reference, though it was broken in half.  I paid over $800 which included a 4 year warranty for the replacement denture that they made.  Though I no longer live near this affordable denture location, I felt getting the crack repaired would be simpler if I drove the 2 hours to the office from which I originally received service.\nThe office had no familiar faces, not receptionist or dentists or hygienists.  I left my home at 6am and after fighting morning traffic, I made it there in 2 hours and 15 minutes.\nI was told that I needed to update my file, so I filled out 3 pages of information. When I was called back, I told the not so amicable hygienist why I was there.  She examined the denture, saw the crack and then asked me where I had it made.  I responded, \"Here.\" She then excused herself and came back to tell me they could repair the denture but I would have to return at 2pm.\nAt 2pm I was called back to see the repair and to be fitted.  There was grit of some kind on the denture which made it rough.  I told the hygienist this and she said she could polish it, if I'd like.  She and the dentist returned with the denture grittier than before.  The bite was totally off, the gum of the denture met my bottom teeth when chewing. I complained to no avail.  I felt as if I was a hindrance in their day.  If appearance is all affordable dentures and you  care about, then I would say go.  If follow-up service and useful teeth are concerns, you might want to think twice.\nI am 72 years old and for the 5 to 6 hours I spent on the road and for the service I got and the gritty denture I still have, I think 2 stars is being quite generous.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888dc1393e8a8c3:0x79c40bdc88238aee"}

The visit was to determine what we needed to do with me 71 year old Fabulous Mom. \ud83d\ude09 The office  was patient  and helped us get a bottom denture made and CREATED A PLAN  to work on the top after the bottom  was completed. Now Mom's on hospice care at home\nalong with the influx of Covid 19, we had to cancel many appointments.  Well  all the \"planets were in alignment today\" and I actually got her in to get  the denture. Mr. Kym spoke extremely curtly to her and quite frankly. Afterwards quickly , what I felt to dismiss us. Mr. Kym actually wait for it...........sent us home with this  denture only.\nNothing  else. So fast forward as Iam looking at it sitting on my table \"on a napkin\"  I called the office to inquire as to how to care for it. What to put it in (other than her mouth of course) And remembered her telling him that a tooth on top was sharp and causing pain to her tongue. To which he offered NO assistance. Pretty Inept  is the opinion I have of this guys practice.  He also made it quite clear he would offer no  further assistance with her remaining denture situation. You remember, the \" plan\" he had established prior. At any rate  I am simply at a loss.  Mr. Kym, Kim whatever at the very least owes her an apology for the lack of respect that he obviously felt was OK to show towardmy Mom. And at this point,  perhaps he could have one of his assistants  forward His  initial  \" plan \" if you will,  to a DMD whom can assist us in finishing her needs?

After my first visit I felt something was off about the way they handle things but I thought maybe I was overthinking it so I decided to go to my second appointment .\n\nDuring my first appointment I just needed to get a diagnose to see what I needed to get done . I saw Dr. Tan.  When Dr. Tan came and check my teeth and X-ray said I probably just need a cleaning and I had 2 cavities that need filling. They offered to do the cleaning that day and  I was ok with it. I have insurance so I knew that was cover and didn\u2019t have to pay anything. The hygienist also told me I needed a panoramic x ray and that my insurance doesn\u2019t cover so it was going cost me $92 and handed me this paper to sign it . I get very high anxiety at dentist office so I sign it without thinking any of it . She didn\u2019t explain why I needed she just said it was to check if everything was normal . I\u2019ve never had this done so I went with it. Now after my second visit I realized that panoramic x ray  is just a way to get money out of you and just to makes you pay for something you don\u2019t really need . After I got my teeth cleaning dentist never came to check on hygienist work and they never went over the panoramic X-ray . I went go head and got my second appointment to get my \u201c2 fillings\u201d done . The girl at the desk told me it was going to be $116.\n\nI went to my second appointment and of course I was anxious. The dental assistant tells me I need 3 fillings and it was going to cost me $155 . I asked her why 3 since I was told it was only 2 . She said her chart shows 3 fillings. Being anxious and wanting to get this done I just said ok and sign . Got my fillings done and paid . I went home and checked my teeth I can barely see the \u201c3rd\u201d filling . It makes me wonder if I even had 3rd cavity or was this just made up to get more money out of me ? . I don\u2019t know wether there was a miscommunication or if they\u2019re really just dishonest and taking advantage of people who are anxious ? !!!\n\nI know part of it is my fault for not speaking  up and just sign a paper .

She said that since it was decayed that she might have to dig around down there and if I was feeling pain, she could not do that. She did not offer me nitrous oxide or more lidocane.

We could have \"charged\" $1000 for the work you had done, and we would have been paid the same and written off a higher amount.  In fact, we typically have to write off ~33% of everything we do.

Did you know you're supposed to brush and floss your teeth? You have to be good about it, or else your teeth will end up looking like this...\" at which point he gestured to a horrifying picture mounted on the wall featuring blackened and rotting teeth. He told me that my teeth shouldn't be so bad for someone my age and the cleaning shouldn't be so painful unless I haven't been taking care of them. People, I have been seeing dentists twice a year throughout my entire life, keeping up with my regular cleanings and x-rays, and no dentist has ever been this critical of me.

I made an appointment for today to get a cleaning and I even made an extra trip before my appointment time for them to verify my insurance and I was told yes they take it. My insurance pays up to $1500.00 per year for dental. I get to my appointment and after waiting 35 minutes past my appointment time they take me back and do the x-ray then put in another room where a woman comes in and does a very brief look around my mouth and I am told I have no cavities but I do have a very bad build up on my teeth which is true. They also say I have mild periodontal disease which is probably true also but here is were it gets crazy. The tell I am going to see another woman to tell me what it will cost me. I said it shouldn't cost me anything my insurance pays up to $1500.00 to which they reply that the insurance will only cover a normal cleaning and since I need a deep cleaning I have to pay. Then they proceed to tell me that even with my insurance my cost for a deep cleaning will be anywhere from $2000.00 to $3500.00 I told them no way and that I thought they were crooks and walked out. After I left I did a Google search for what it should cost to have a deep cleaning done and it comes back the it should cost between $750.00 and $1200.00 meaning my insurance should have covered it. Now I have no idea how much they are gonna bill my insurance for what they did but I would bet it will take a huge chunk out of my $1500.00 of coverage so when I find a reputable dentist I now won't have the full amount available for that dentist.

They were very accommodating and got me the first emergency appt they had. When I arrived at the office they checked me in on the phone in the parking lot in adherence to social distancing during this pandemic. They got me in after an extended wait. But bear in mind this was an emergency appt. Once inside they took a full set of xrays. The dentist came in and discussed the options with me all of which included the extraction of the tooth that had cause so much pain over the last few days. I met with the office manager, paid for the extraction, and went back to wait on the dentist to perform the extraction . I was moved to a procedure suite and the extraction was preformed under local anesthesia. I was released about 20 mins later. I was at the office almost 4 hours but again this was an emergency appt. I returned home and continue antibiotics prescribed by the emergency room 48 hours earlier. The swelling in my jaw and face is slowly going down. The pain is being controlled well with tylenol and advil. Give the fact that they made the emergency appt on Saturday for the first thing available and that I had to drive 40 miles to the office, I was grateful to get the appt as even emergency appointments during the pandemic are hard to get. The experience overall was positive and the staff was very friendly and professional. Thank you a gain for your help with this very painful and unexpected event. I will use aspen dental locally as a dental provider and recommend then to anyone whether having a dental crisis or for routine dental care. The treatment plan and cost are explained up front. They offer third party financing should you need it which could have been a viable option had it been necessary. Thanks again Aspen Dental. Great customer service and great dental service. The cost to get the tooth removed that had caused me such agony for days was $134. Fortunately I had the money to pay for the services.

Most of the other dentists I contacted had about a 3 to 4 week wait. The day I arrived they provided me with x-rays and a quick inspection which included reading a bunch of numbers that were above 5 when they measured my teeth. Shortly thereafter they informed me I needed a deep cleaning procedure and a bunch of other treatments. Of course this procedure was going to be over $1,000 out of my own pocket. It was not covered by my insurance. They also informed me of a cavity that would need a root canal and it would be a separate procedure at an endodontist they recommended that of course would be more. They then tried to get me to go into a small room and sign paperwork to pay for the procedure. I left and figured I would get a second opinion.\n\nI decided to wait and made an appointment with Complete Family Dental also in Phenix City. They were able to do a cleaning for me and also fix my cavity tooth with a filling rather than a root canal and Crown. My insurance also covered almost all of the procedures and total cost out of pocket was only $150.\n\nAlso there was no deep cleaning procedure necessary and the numbers they read when measuring my teeth were all three or less.\n\nIt should be noted that I did not inform Complete Family Dental that I had visited Aspen. I wanted to see what they would say to make sure I wasn't being ripped off and if I indeed needed a deep cleaning procedure or a root canal.  Furthermore the dentist at Complete Family Dentistry fixed another filling free of charge because he noticed some decay building up behind that filling on the same tooth he was fixing already. I had my tooth fixed just this week. Definitely worth the wait.\n\nI recommend getting a second opinion if Aspen tries to get you for their 'deep cleaning' procedures.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccfcb1912be09:0xbb0a473fcae18582"}

Came in with a tooth ache and left with motrin and a 2 week wait. All they seem concerned with is very expensive treatments. I have insurance but it still doesnt cover the level of services they wanted to do. And when i asked about staggering and doing what is affordable they then told me that unless i went with this super expensive plan they would not be willing to do any other work. Even filling a cavity.   They kept pushing their dental credit card on me and when i expressed concern about a dental credit card they assumed i had poor credit and told me they accept co-signers.   I have decent insurance why should i need a credit card for some deep cleaning...  when has deep cleaning ever cost 4k?    Once i went to the dentist for the Root canal he also told me that Aspen is known for pushing expensive procedures and their credit card on people. He reccomended what he called a \u201cnormal\u201d dentist and thats where i will be getting my crown done.\n\nOne good thing about aspen is everything is state of the art and it feels like a expensive clinic for the 1%.

I'm 38 and retiring out the army. So I've had plenty of dentist experiences over the years. First off it's a brand new facility. Yet some how when you walk in you get hit with a horrible smell. Once you get past the smell it wssnt to bad until they wanted 18 xrays of my teeth. Okay not to bad of a idea so they can see everything. Except you will have to listen to the ridiculous joke that the xray tech has patients drool over her all the time. Ok it's a joke I'm ok with that except I had to hear it multiple times. Along with other jokes and comebacks that you may be thinking in your head right now. Then I have to question  how sterile the equipment is. Like I said I had to get 18 xrays. So I had to bit the tools to do so while sitting in a computer chair. There is a plastic sleeve to cover the exposed parts except the metal they want you to bit down on. Then I move to a room and the actual dental experience not so bad and quick. 10 mins to check for cavities. 10 minutes to check my gums. That might be kinda long it was actually very quick. Then I had to sit there and wait for some new employment paper work as I realize I watched 2 episode of daytime TV. I havent seen anyone in a long time. I start to ask my wife via text I wonder if they forgot about me. I go look for someone and finally ask of I'm waiting on something still. I'm told I'm waiting on the facility manager. Who is with a patient hmm. 20 minutes later I get called to their office asked if I had any questions. Then was like no but this was ridiculous and I'll never come back I've been here 2 hours for a check up that i had a appointment for. They said ok thank you. So not even a apology that their service took so long. So I would not recommend this facility to anyone unless you feel like wasting your entire day. Now it's not like it was a ton of paper work it was all filled out it just needed a signature. Which was signed by the dentist when they completed the exam. So I'm not even sure what the facility manager had to do. But if that is the level of management at a new facility they need a new manager immediately.

I am so happy that we were able to work things out with your insurance, so that you can continue your dental treatment. Thank you also for coming in and talking to me. Great to see you again!!\n\nHi Jesse. I am sorry that you are having problems with YOUR insurance company. I have many, many patients with BC/BS insurance whose services are paid for by BC/BS. Please know that with BC/BS there are many, many benefit levels on these individual plans. These plans are elected and paid for by your employer or yourself but reimbursed at different rates. The higher the premium results in better coverage. We have found that some plans pay very well while others cause the patient to pay more in principle than what is actually received as a benefit. Due to the confusion and the large number of insurance plans we call the insurance company as a courtesy to verify coverage for all new patients before seating them for treatment. With the information given to us from an insurance company like BC/BS we quote patient portions and offer advice to maximize benefits, but we can only be as accurate as the information that is given to us. Unfortunately, in this healthcare business there are times that claims are denied. Insurance companies are in business to be profitable for their investors. Usually, with additional patient information, documentation, charting and pictures that we obtain on your first visit, the claim can be refiled once we know why the claim was denied in the first place. If you bring your Explanation of Benefits to the office next week, I personally will help you resolve this so that you may be reimbursed or I will offer a refund that resulted from any error made by my office. I look forward to hearing from you next week. Sincerely, Ren\u00e9 A. Talbot, DDS (256)881-8181"}, "gmap_id": "0x88626cb0df2ccd01:0x8b39f086a9aaa930"}

She left the building before i was able to speak with anyone and the receptionist said this practice was completely normal... I dont know how anyone could think that is normal i asked her if I worked on her teeth for muliple hours would she expect to be written something anything for pain. Mind you she had written pain meds on the first visit and refused to change the script after i found out i was allergic to what she had wrote. Also they quoted one price and my insurance had told me something completely different which when i called to ask about it and try to finish the procedure that was already billed to my insurance company they refused to finish the work unless i paid them what they had quoted me. I dont understand how a practice gets good reviews unless they are fake or she treats her long time patients differently and if I had just been searching for pain meds I wouldn't have done the procedure through them I would have kept searching and I will never go back here and hope that if you are reading this please reconsider and try to find a dentist that will actually care about how you feel and not blatantly lie which she told me I could make payments on the balance but apparently not if I wanted to complete the procedure I would of had to come up with the rest now I have a temporary crown that came off the second day and no way to fix the work she started and billed the complete price for..

I'm not one to write bad reviews on businesses but, I think someone needs to say something about this place.\n\nI went to Aspen Dental in Madison with a brown spot on my tooth thinking it was a cavity. I went through their free exam and X-rays. They found that I had periodontal disease as well, which did turn out to be true.\n\nThe dentist, either inexperienced or dishonest, told me that my \"cavity\" was too close to the gum line to drill and that I would need to have a crown put on (roughly $1,200). She also recommended about $6,000 worth of other work.\n\nI have no insurance and the financing person couldn't work with me due to my low income. I left depressed thinking that my mouth was really messed up and that I needed more work than I could ever afford. Thankfully, I got a second opinion.\n\nThe second dentist I went to took an X-ray, and looked at my tooth. He informed me that I did have periodontal disease and needed a deep cleaning but, that the brown spot that \"Doctor A\" wanted to put a $1,200 crown on was not a cavity or even decay. I had my first deep cleaning session and the spot (\"cavity\") came right off. Again, I'm not dentist but, I'm pretty sure cavities don't just come off.\n\nI thought about just letting this go and not saying anything about it but, I wonder how many people have been screwed over by this business.\n\nMy thoughts are that Madison is a fairly wealthy city and most people have insurance or the money for dental work so, they take the recomendations of an \"expert\" without a second thought. It makes me wonder how many people's mouths and wallets have been ruined by this office. This Madison office has good reviews but, if you look around online, the chain is poorly rated all over the country.\n\nI do not recommend Aspen Dental in Madison.

I was asked several times if I was in pain I told them no. Everyone including the office manager said if I did start to have pain to call in and they would get me in sooner than my next scheduled appointment. Well a few days after them poking at my teeth one of the teeth I was to have extracted on my next visit was hurting I called the office and was told they would have to speak to the dentist after about an hour they called me back and said they didn't have anything open  I asked about the emergency appointments they advertise while you are in hold with them? The person on the phone said I don't know how that works... Really because you would think that when you advertise something your staff would know about it. The sad thing is I still have to go to my appointment next week because they made me pay for what I was having done a week in advance. I'm sure I am going to regret this review when it comes time for them to do the procedure. I honestly believe because I couldn't afford to get everything I need done is why they are making me wait in pain for another 5 days.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886269801f64b7ef:0x9513b99ee93c25a9"}

From the moment your name is called until you exit the front door someone in that building is trying to sell you something. I had 4 different people try to sell me a $200 toothbrush with a $30 mail in rebate. Both the hygenist and dentist were talking and selling other dental procedures but did not discuss what I came in for.\n\nI went to Aspen Dental for tooth pain and wanted the tooth extracted. I asked before making the appointment if this was a type of procedure they'd do. They said yes. So I made an appointment. I showed up and everyone had a fake plastic smile as if we were playing We Happy Few (Google it). I felt so out of place. When I was finally seen the dental hygenist looked at my teeth for about 10 to 15 minutes then spent 30 to 45 minutes talking about how deep of a cleaning I needed, how much everything was going to cost, how important doing that there was, then pushed how they could do it now and it was only $93 (which I found out later was NOT true. It was in total $186). I declined and mentioned my pain and tooth extraction. She brought up that tooth brush and rebate and I had to listen to another 10 minute talk. Then the dentist came in. Another 10 minutes of poking and proding my teeth with a huge fake We Happy Few smile followed by a 45 minute conversation about MORE treatments I needed and AGAIN WITH THE DANG TOOTHBRUSH! I mentioned my tooth and pain again and she replied with \"Oh no I have to refer you to an oral surgeon. Sorry.\" Why couldn't you just say that!? Why did you have to talk for over 30 minutes about all this other junk while Im sitting there nearly in tears from pain as you sell?\n\nNow, let's talk billing. After all those sales pitches you're sent to billing where someone talks forever about payment plans and the debt you have in dental work. Mind you, NONE OF THIS COVERED WHY I WAS THERE! They hardly wanted to talk about my pain or the extraction I asked for. Just how they wanna fill and clean and polish all my other teeth. I felt trapped. Not to mention they \"referred me\" to someone in Birmingham with the billing guy \"texting him and taking pics of my xrays\". Felt VERY under the table black market because I asked twice for his information and both times I was told \"Oh if you want an appointment we can do it for you and text you the way to get there and stuff.\" Wouldnt even tell me his name or phone number. VERY sketchy.\n\nLater on, I felt uncomfortable about this \"Birmingham guy\" and the $350 extraction he wanted to do and how he wanted to use gas, which I did not want because Ive heard bad horror stories about it, so I asked for them to send me my xrays because I wanted to show them to my local dentist. That's when the real moods kicked in. The friendly atmosphere was gone. They wanted no part in sharing my medical records with myself. Before they were \"willing to send them anywhere\" and were texting them to strangers I didnt even know! Now they decline. I was told if I wanted them I had to go get them or I could just go get new xrays. I told them I did not want to be exposed to radiation again for no logical reason so I would go get them. So I did. Drove 40 min back and was given ONE of my twelve or so xrays. ONE! No fake smiles or sales pitches this time though! Just a lot of eye rolling and weird stares.\n\nIn conclusion, they are so happy to get you in there and they flood you with information and dental work with very little processing time. Now, Im not afraid of dentists but this place got me nervous and scared. It wasnt the physical look of the place. It wasn't rude treatment. It was the huge fake smiles and how the whole time you felt like a cash cow they just wanted to milk for money.\n\nTL;DR: All fake smiles and the entire process was a sales pitch, didn't care for my actual problem. Just wanted to sell me $1800 in dental work that had nothing to do with my original issue and a $200 tooth brush. Very reluctant to give me my own records and made the process a hassle.

You are kept fully aware through every single step of the procedures so much that they are actually teaching you about your teeth. You are encouraged to ask questions along the way so you can fully understand and deepen your learning for proactive care in the future. Rhonda was fantastic at facilitating this. A valuable asset for sure.\n\nThe facility itself is nothing less than cutting edge. So cutting edge that in every attempt they will reduce the total amount of visits and time spent in the chair in total (as they understand going to the dentist is not typically the top of the list for most people). There\u2019s even a screen on the ceiling so, if you wish to, you can watch and see everything that is happening while they explain it.\n\nIt is like being at a 5* hotel- but at a dentist. Not sure I could ever imagine an oxymoron such as this, but Dr. MacBeth and his team have accomplished this. Thank you, congrats, and keep up the great work!\n\n- update 10/4/19\n\nThese guys are not only the best, but consistent! Kathy was always smiling and positive at the at the front desk and made sure everything was totally understood so far as billing and working with the insurance.\nIt was great to catch up with Rhonda again who is so personable and professional in what she does. Thank you!\n\nI had multiple treatments that day - and I was DONE IN 3 hours - including a bunch of fillings and 2 crowns (which they made there and then!) and Shana and Dr MacBeth worked like clockwork to get it done, while having fun at the same time!\nThe next day I often didnt realise I had it all done as my teeth just felt normal - totally not what I expected. The work is phenomenal!\n\nTotally blown away by this team - sounds strange, but I cant wait to go back!!!\n\nThank you once again!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1546873243405, "text": "Thank you so much and we are happy that you enjoyed your visit with us!

Very pleased that I was able to get in three weeks ahead of when I had initially scheduled on the 28th, but not so pleased about the wait. I also liked how I was able to come in later rather than first thing in the morning. I read the other reviews before posting this and do not understand the last review about Mrs. Jessica having an awful attitude. She went above and beyond to make me comfortable with bringing me water, helping fill out paperwork on the Apple as I forgot my glasses, and even getting me a blanket once we were in the room as they keep it frigid inside. We had a lovely chat and she even let me show her pictures and made me feel at ease as I told her I have an awful fear of the dentist. I did not like when they took my xray as they kept jamming it into my mouth and the girl doing it seemed very annoyed and like she would rather be elsewhere. I heard her talking negative about other patients with another girl in scrubs while she was doing my xrays as well which makes me wonder what they said about me and my silly fears. She left me in the room for over an hour waiting for the dentist, and the girl at the front came and checked on me more than the xray girl in scrubs did. I enjoyed meeting with the hygienist I belive her name was Miranda as she explained everything I needed done and was very understanding about my fears. She even spoke to me about possibly numbing it before she did any work which definitely makes me feel like I found the right place. The dentist Dr. Ebby was very kind and had kind eyes. He seemed to genuinely care and made jokes to make me feel more at ease once we were in the room. I\u2019m sure he has a nice smile but I couldn\u2019t see with the mask on. He was definitely better than my last dentist who didn\u2019t care about people of my age and only want money. He seemed to want to help me get what was best for me and not drain the little savings I have left. When i spoke about the money to man at the end named Austin he was an absolute sweetheart. I have never met someone so understanding and kind, and he even went out of his way to give me more adorable options and let me take up so much of his time just to make sure I would be able to afford what I need. He gave me his personal office number and told me to call him with any questions. I learned later from the front girl he was the office manager and I find it so refreshing that an office manager is willing to spend that much time with a woman like me to make sure I\u2019m taken care of. The level of care I received was unbelievable and I truly feel like I found a place where I am cared for and taken care of financially and healthily. I would give 5 stars but I do not appreciate the rude xray girl and the wait was rather long.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1594236184016, "text": "We appreciate your feedback.

Many others in that office have been very kind and helpful as well. When I first started treatment at this office, it was brand new and barely established. I received a lot of personal attention and there was no issue getting the needed appointments. I do miss that part. Their popularity has grown along with the number of patients. That is a great thing for the business but not so for the patients unfortunately. I guess I was spoiled in the beginning.

I have never had a bad experience at a dentist office before. I first thought it was weird that they were begging for 5 star reviews when i first started going here. That explains where a lot of these reviews came from.\n\nOn each visit I felt like it was more about up-selling you on the products they offer than focusing on my actual teeth. They were always mentioning teeth whitening, special mouth wash, special tooth paste etc. I am in the sales world so I get it, but don't be pushy. You can usually tell when a person is uncomfortable about the topics. Which I was.\n\nI received a quote for invisalign about a year ago, and decided to save. They quoted me 1800ish without insurance for that visit. Then this past visit they quoted me 3,325 after my insurance pays 1000. I thought that was a bit dramatic increase especially since my insurance now covers a grand.\n\nI go to my dentist every 6 months. I might go two months over, due to work scheduling, but I go regularly. I've never had cavity problems so 8 months ago when I was told I had 6 I almost fainted. I actively brush my teeth and floss multiple times a day. My family and friends make fun of how cautious I am when it comes to my oral health. I want to keep my teeth so I do care for them.  I was told I didn't floss enough and that I needed to start when I asked how it was possible to have 6 cavities. I felt like i was being degraded.  So I started brushing 3Xs daily and flossing after every meal. When I came back 8 months later (2 months over because of a work scheduling issue)  I had 4 more. Only then when I almost started to cry did the Dr. ask about my medical history. I have severe acid re-flux. Apparently that can cause the cavity issue. He then up-sales me on some ORA-Care mouth wash and told me to use it until my next visit. When I return to the next visit if I have additional cavities we will re-evaluate. I'm not sure that I would want to wait another 6 months to see if i get additional cavities even while using the mouth wash.\n\nWhen I went to schedule my filling appointment they told me I had to pay a percentage of the $250 cost before they scheduled me. I told them that I didn't have the money even though I did, and decided right then I would go back to Dr. Sonja Gill's office.\n\nI felt this office is only concerned about the money that goes into their pocket. I get businesses have to make money, but I have never not paid them. Even when I missed an appointment I paid them a $55 no show fee with no hesitation. I felt like I was their personal ATM.\n\nI will never go back to this practice again. I am going back to Dr. Sonja Gill where I am greeted with a smile, and they don't hold out their hand for your credit card every time you walk through the door.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1583345035967, "text": "We apologize and will be contacting you to see how we can make it better for you."}, "gmap_id": "0x886268e976bb6b43:0x3c4d92c0b50a4a2c"}

Content with the service, I decided to have Divine Expressions as my primary and only dental care. And for the most part, it was good. The staff are incredibly friendly, extremely accommodating and very gentle during each cleaning. Not to mention the breathtaking, home magazine worthy office.\n\nWhere it pains me to write is related to Dr. Laurentis Barnett's procedures. Every procedure that dealt with a crown of some sort, always came off. It resulted in me either having to leave work early, take an extended lunch, take a day off and/or come back multiple times that same week. While the staff and Dr. Barnett was very accommodating and flexible with scheduling, the process were still very inconvenient. A particular case was getting an implant for one of my teeth. For starters, the tooth itself was shaped very oddly. It did not look or feel like a normal tooth. It also always popped off, even though the office used dental cement.\n\nWith every visit to either add or replace, I never received an answer as to why this kept happening. Dr. Laurentis also hinted that it was possibly my fault that the tooth kept coming off. I'm not opposed to thinking that I could've been doing something wrong, but after speaking with friends and colleagues with dental implants and explaining to them my daily routine and lifestyle, I was suggested to get an second opinion from another dental professional.\n\nI sought treatment elsewhere and unfortunately had to pay for another tooth implant. The implant printed from Divine Expressions leaves my new dental office with many questions as they have never seen such an odd shaped \"tooth\". My current implant from my new dentist has been in my mouth for nearly 2 months. I had not returned once for a re-application.\n\nThe purpose of this post is not to defame or deface Dr. Laurentis Barnett, it is simply to write a review I felt needed to be written. I wish him and his office the best of success and hope that maybe this review will leave some food for thought. I'm glad there are a good number of patients that are satisfied with his service.

They didn't even know which tooth that I had a root canal on in there office just 1 month prior (this happened twice). One time I called, I was asked what the doctor told me on the last visit I went in.....this is disturbing considering they should keep record of what the doctor says each visit and overall what is actually going on. Also, it would seem smart to keep record of what a patient says for the reason they are needing to see the doctor again so that there is an overall knowledge with other office staff on the situation/patient.

They said I needed a special kind of deep cleaning instead of just a normal cleaning which is fine and great until I was informed that the special deep cleaning was going to cost me over me $200! With my dental insurance 2 cleanings and X-rays are included with my dental insurance at no cost to me as preventive care.  When the dentist told me that she wanted me to get a special kind deep cleaning I figured it was covered under one of my cleanings.  I had no idea that particular cleaning was going to cost me over $200.  So when the office manager made me aware that when I came back in for that kind of cleaning I would need to be prepared to pay over $200 because it wasn\u2019t considered preventive care but basic care because it was a deep cleaning.  I told her that wasn\u2019t explained to me an I wanted to change my treatment plan back to just a normal cleaning.  The office manger said that the treatment plan couldn\u2019t be changed without the dentist approval so she went an asked the dentist.  The dentist refused to change the treatment plan to just a normal cleaning.  At first I thought well maybe I am in need of the special kind of deep cleaning until I sought a second opinion from someone in the periodontal field and they informed me that a normal cleaning would suffice just fine.  So, with that being said I feel like they were trying to upsell me especially since they refused to do any kind of cleaning unless I agreed to pay over $200 for the deep clean! I had to make another appointment with another dentist so I could get the care I need.  More of my time spent on something I had already done.  This whole situation stinks and should be unacceptable!  Dental health is so expensive and stuff like this just makes it more difficult!

After waiting around 30 minutes after receiving x-rays, they came in and informed me that my teeth looked great with ZERO cavities. The lady who cleans teeth came in and looked at my teeth and said that I had some kind of bacteria (I don't know how in the world you can determine by looking at teeth what kind of bacteria they have without placing under a microscope). I said okay when can you clean my teeth? She said she would be right back that she would get it set up. While waiting patiently, I hear her in another room telling someone else they have the same kind of bacteria and would need advance cleaning. After waiting they informed me that my teeth would need an advance cleaning and it would cost $281 to have my teeth cleaned after my insurance (MY INSURANCE COVERS 100% of basic care including cleanings). Basically, for first appointments and cleanings, they tell all of their patients the same thing to try and drag as much money out as possible. After this I was not going to post a review, but I decided to go with another dentist and have called them 5 times to have my x-rays emailed, but they keep insisting that they have emailed them, but have not. They are completely dishonest and are trying to charge almost $300 for a teeth cleaning that shouldn't be over $50-$100. Please save your money and go somewhere else. I asked, \"Can I not just receive a regular teeth cleaning that my insurance company covers?\". They explained company policy that they are not allowed to give regular teeth cleanings for first visits, so basically they lie and tell everyone they have some kind of bacteria.

Since I\u2019d been in last December, they have new doctors and I wasn\u2019t aware, which is fine. However, I\u2019ve had fillings done and the new doctors have no record of the last filling that I had and are wanting to fill and make me repay for a tooth even after it\u2019s already been filled. I feel as if they\u2019re trying to make me think I\u2019m crazy when I know for a fact that I went in to have that specific tooth filled. When I asked them what was it I paid for then, they told me they didn\u2019t know because they weren\u2019t there at that time. So in their minds, there was a doctor messing around in my mouth, telling me he was filling a tooth when he really didn\u2019t? They are also saying I have another cavity that I wasn\u2019t aware I had (they didn\u2019t find it this time, apparently it\u2019s been there sometime but I\u2019m assuming the previous doctors didn\u2019t tell me or it\u2019s not true??). Aspen was fine when I first went to them a little over a year ago but I feel that they have become very unprofessional. I don\u2019t understand how they can just tell patients that they didn\u2019t have a specific work done just because there\u2019s no record of it because they changed doctors. I will not be paying twice for work that I know for a fact that I had done. I will be finding a new dentist that doesn\u2019t have multiple doctors in and out.

Fast forward and I begin to have issues with the tooth that had the root canal. I call the Decatur office (I now live closer to this location, unfortunately) and specifically ask if they will be able to address an issue that another location serviced. The office manager encourages me to come to their office for the issue. A month goes by and it is the day of my appointment. I call and ask if I may come in early since I finished up with work early. The receptionist puts me on hold to speak with the office manager.(DUM, DUM, DUM...*music fit for a villain begins to play**not really, but it should have*) He begins to say that they can't work on the issue and I would need to visit the Aspen Dental location that completed the root canal. ( If you're reading this Greg, in the future you might want to do your research about your company's policies before wasting another person's time) The office manager goes on to tell me that he called and left a voicemail yesterday to tell me all of this information. And I told him that I didn't have a missed call or voicemail from him. And that I thought it was ironic that the other five calls that we exchanged a month ago were never missing from my phone. Only now that I explain that I am irritated that when I called a month ago he gave me a different answer are his call and voicemail from yesterday \"magically\" absent from my phone. He proceeds to say, \"well I know for a fact that I called and left a voicemail.\" To which I respond, \" I know for a fact that I don't have a missed call or voicemail. He then laughs sarcastically. So I told him, \" since he thought it was appropriate to speak to me that way then I decided to respond in the same manor.\" And the conversation ends with him telling me that they will not ever see me in their office. If I could give zero stars, I would. If he would have just apologized and not smarted off, I would have been understanding. Extremely horrible experience.

However, they went out of their way to make sure I wasn't embarrassed, my concerns and worry weren't marginalized, and aside from treating me very professionally, did so in an extraordinarily compassionate manner. While I am still in a fair amount of pain a few days out now, my expectations were managed very well and the procedure and aftercare haven't been nearly as bad as I had anticipated. I would highly recommend this Aspen Dental office and Dr. Stephanie in particular and will continue to use them again for all my future dental needs!

No, there are no implants included in that work.\nThe only downside was, after having my appointment schedule, the morning of, they sent me a message about coming in a half hour early, to have an unplanned cleaning.  I had recently had a cleaning.  This news about the cleaning the morning of, totally freaked me out, and turned me into a slobbering idiot.

I went to them initially to have an annual checkup and to have a chip/break in my front tooth repaire.  The repair they made looked fine but only  lasted less a few weeks.  Then the dentist recommended that I get a crown.  My tooth was prepared and they took molds of my teeth for the crown and supposedly  did a color match (WRONG).  When the tooth came back it was the wrong color.  But the temporary tooth that was put on in it's place fell out the first day.  No adhesive was applied.  The  doctor left before the temporary was placed in my mouth and the technician who put it in obviously used no glue.  I did not go back for them to glue the temporary (my fault/busy schedule).  I just persevered until the crown came in,  When the first crown came in it was too long and the wrong color.  So it had to be sent back for a color change and to be  shorten.  I received another temporary tooth.   Well the doctor put on another temporary this time and  he really glued it on.  He glued it on with an adhesive that obviously was WRONG for a temporary because they could not easily remove it.  The next dentist I saw had to drill the temporary tooth off.  Then the second crown again was the wrong color (WRONG AGAIN!).  Another temporary was made and put on.   So now I am waiting for the crown (Third time) and hoping it is the right color.  In the meantime the temporary I had fell off while I was eating a salad a few days ago and is broken and can no longer be used to hide the ugly tooth stub.  I have this HIDEOUS gap and STUB of a tooth in the front of my mouth.   I have had so much anxiety regarding this dental situation and no resolution in sight for a few more days. This is not a matter of insurance, nor a matter of money...I have both and have paid in full my co-pay for this procedure.  It is a matter of good dental service of which I have yet to receive.  After the first two disastrous  appointments and having not received a crown that matches and is acceptable I  am very disappointed and disgusted with ASPEN Dental.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a43ea0834b16b:0x5e04b49f782ae262"}

But, felt it was important because people so easily post negative vs positive. Dr. Walker and his staff went above and beyond to meet my dental needs. I previously worked as a dental assistant while I was paying my way through college. So, I know a bit more than the average patient. I have to say that Dr Walker is far above average in his skill and chair-side manner. I had to have an extraction of #18. I never felt the injections.  And the actual extraction was done with speed and ease.  I hardly had any bleeding. I have assisted on many ,so I was prepared for the stress and pressure that one typically feels. Experience none of that with Dr. Walker.  A couple weeks later, I lost a significant portion of an old amalgam filling on#32. Yet, another difficult tooth position. Dr Walker was aware that I did not want to extract the tooth.  But, could not afford a crown at that particular time. Therefore, Dr. Walker spent extra time diligently repairing the tooth so that I wouldn't lose it. As previously  stated, it's  been about a year and 3 month and the tooth is still holding steady. Dr Walker is a brilliant Dentist with a kind heart. A combination not often found. Not to mention he makes you feel comfortable. As if you've been friends for years. In sum, He's as good as it gets. Aspen Dental and the Florence/Athens AL area are fortunate to have Dr Walker.  If he moves, I will travel to receive his care.

I experienced horrendous wisdom teeth pain and had put off having them removed because I  have no dental insurance and an extreme anxiety toward needles going into my mouth. The pain got so bad that I ended up in the ER, which resulted in my having no choice but to get them out. I called Aspen Dental and they were so kind and helpful! They allowed me to set up an easy finance plan. They got me an appointment quickly. I had the x rays to be examined and the technician was so helpful by talking to me to make the long process of taking so many pictures go by super fast. I had an initial cleaning with a Mrs. Norma, whose vibrant smile and personality made me feel welcome and calmed my nerves tremendously.  During the cleaning they discovered I had gingivitis and they gave me a full treatment. They helped me get an Oral B toothbrush with Bluetooth capabilities and different modes for brushing and cleaning my teeth on my own. Mrs. Norma took time to give me tips on how to floss better so that I can prevent getting gingivitis again. When it came time to have my surgery, Dr. Perry helped my nerves by telling me what he was doing, when he was doing and why. Dr. Perry took time and didn't rush the process. The dental assistant that day was Mrs. Kourtney. I'll never forget how she kept me calm by reassuring me that I would be fine. She said being nervous was ok and normal. She kept telling me I was doing great. I don't think she knows how much I needed that. She kept my mouth suctioned, which I really liked because I have a tendency to have a gag reflex and that prevented it. Dr. Perry earned my trust and respect especially when he made the decision to divide my surgery in half. He did the left side, then had me wait two weeks for the other because he was concerned about my being able to eat comfortably. When he did the right side, he was assisted by a trainee who was kind also and attentive to my needs. If she continues to do as she did, she will be great! Overall, they really are a great place to go for dental needs. Even though I didn't need to use him, it also felt good knowing they have an oral surgeon with their office too. They will now be my go to for dental work! Thank you Aspen Dental!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1581367889410, "text": "I'm happy to hear that you felt comfortable with the team, Mary!

I, personally, have suffered from depression and anxiety for a large part of my life, as well as adolescent gran-mal seizures since I was fifteen years old. The seizures prevent me from being able to drive a car, which prevents me from from being able to get to and from a workplace easily.\nLacking regular funds/insurance coverage, and being anxious and depressed did lead to my neglecting my dental health, which simply exacerbated my anxiety. I suffered a huge panic attack after encountering some (actually relatively minor) dental pain a few days ago. I made an appointment at Aspen Dental for the next morning, which was impressively easy to do online and your staff here at Cox Creek Pkwy did not disappoint me whatsoever; service was extremely professional. Dr. Konradi and the dental hygienist couldn't have done a better job at reassuring me that my shortcomings can be overcome.\nMy blood pressure at the time was apparently extremely high, most likely a result of the panic attack I suffered the night before, compounded by a minor fever and a lack of sleep. I took my blood pressure this morning and it has thankfully returned to a normal level (111 over 76). I have already purchased the recommended electric toothbrush and a new pro-gum-health toothpaste. I have been instilled with a strong sense of hope already and I have no doubt anymore that I am capable of restoring my dental health. As much as I can, I thank you, and I am looking forward to my next visit whole-heartedly.\nSincerely,\nIsaac E.

We came to find out that most dentists are closed on Friday..and it was Thursday evening when this occurred. My son has been a patient at Deerfoot Dental since his teeth really started coming through. We left a message after hours and Dr. Grovestein called us back! He asked us to text him photos of my sons teeth. We sent the pics and he called us back. He reassured us that it probably wasn\u2019t as bad as it seems and he would meet us at his office the next morning. So he opened his clinic for us on his day off! I mean who does that? He gave us instructions to care for the tooth, we made a follow up appointment, and left. Needless to say..our sons tooth looks great. It actually straightened out almost back to its original spot. We went to our follow up appointment and got the good news that his teeth looked great and to just keep a watch on it. I have never in my life experienced customer service from a healthcare provider like this. We are still in shock that someone would care so much about the wellbeing of our son.

The dentist went over my x-rays extremely quick and the exam was maybe 5 minutes. I had to bring up my issues the dentist did not even ask me..

First the technician who I guess makes the dentures, etc., came in & was able to make an adjustment that would have made them wearable till she had a new set made. When they started to make impressions none of the trays that hold the \"goop\" was small enough to fit in her mouth???? Never had that problem before.\nThey ended up using her dentures to make the impressions, getting the goop all over her, then giving her a towelette to clean up with that came from a container that was clearly marked \"Do not use on skin\".\nWhen we got home & took the bottom denture out of it's baggie, it had been ground down till there was nothing but teeth sitting on a flat base. Called them today to tell them they needed to make her a temporary plate & was told they couldn't do that.  Needless to say we are not going to do business with them.

{"user_id": "113903088197891558201", "name": "nhoenshell", "time": 1570173848793, "rating": 2.0, "text": "I've lived in montgomery for exactly a year now, and I finally managed to schedule a dentist appointment because I was definitely past due for a visit. It was a weird experience at Aspen Dental to be sure, and I cant help but feel as if I was swindled somehow. It was the longest and most expensive dental appointment I've ever had. Being a new patient, I expected extra steps like xrays, but the whole ordeal was weird and confusing from the beginning (starting with when I tried to confirm my appointment via email, which ended up being a phone call, and none of my information was correct in their system). After an awkward xray process, I was led to a room and sat in a chair for about 30 mins. The first obvious red flag that had me wondering if I was getting the wool pulled over my eyes was the TV they stuck in my face (attached to the chair) as the tech and dentist did \"paperwork\" and talked about teeth stuff amongst themselves behind me completely out of my field of vision. Then the dentist said I had gingivitis and two cavities-- which were a complete shock to me since I've never had any in my life and was experiencing nothing unusual in my mouth during my daily life, no pain or discomfort at all. The gingivitis thing I could understand, I guess (i mean it's a reversible condition from what I understand, so I thought it was weird for them to schedule a whole multi appointment treatment process that would take place throughout the month). I dont know anything about teeth, so you could tell me to open up, poke around in there with tools, and tell me it's a whole huge dangerous mess and I'd have to believe you, because what do I know? What I do know is that the visits to my old dentist were always straight forward and I understood everything they were doing because it was clearly explained and they didn't try to schedule 3 visits in a single month. After all that waiting, tv, and a brief examination, I find myself at the cashier's desk and absolutely no work was done on my teeth. I opted out for the 130$ smart brush that was included in my bill. And then they said they could probably fit me in today for my first treatment after I paid for a large sum that was ultimately un-itemized. The paperwork I received was not a receipt for what I paid for in that moment, but a breakdown of all the work they were going to do and how much it was going to cost me later. I agreed to have the first treatment done right away. Finally, I was going to receive some sort of treatment that was physical during this visit, but I didnt truly understand what I was paying for that warranted such a large bill when I was at the cashier's office. The treatment was no different than what any other dentist would do during a routine cleaning so I'm still not sure why it was so expensive. At the end of my visit, I walked away with a lot of fancy products and with the peace of mind that I didnt have mouth cancer...so, that's a relief. The staff was super friendly and kind, and I really appreciated Loretta. She was absolutely fantastic, but I'm not sure I want to go back to this place at least two more times in a single month just to be broke and confused again. I fully understand that I am dumb, but things just didnt add up.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1570203176746, "text": "Thank you for providing this information.

I understand people must eat but she always is eathing at the front desk. I just think professionally speaking she should eat in the break room and then come to the front desk. I should have listened to the lady who was in the office when I first went in she was very displeased about fit and she was about to pay,again for another doctor to get her dentures and she had already paid for these. My dentures have not fit since I got them they r so loss they float around in my mouth. I've come for adjustments but they don't do it right and make it worse. They have made it to where my gums bleed and /or they fall out thry dont seem to have a midfle ground.

It was still very sensitive and painful. The hygienist was very general when taking x-Rays and getting me into my room. The dentist came in and put a bit of numbing medication on my gums. The shot was done before the gum was numb and he started the dental work before the tooth was numb. He would not stop no matter what the hygentist or I did. I walked out of the office in tears and it wasn't until I got to my car the full effect of the numbing medication kicked in.

Needless to say I did not return to have my permanent crown done at this office and for purposes of all emergencies will seek care elsewhere!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a83398ccf29f:0x3b4520c933b799fb"}
