Everything was delivered and picked up in accordance with the contract.\n\nRegrettably, I was very disappointed in the lack of professional guidance and foresight that the company provided concerning the setup for my event on 1/20/19 at Vulcan Park and Museum. First and foremost, the tent was not placed the way we discussed previously. After the initial discussion and sending a detailed floorplan to Top Notch, I arrived to find the tent's short side positioned parallel to the Vulcan statue. Due to this error and Top Notch\u2019s worker's unwillingness to help change it, a domino effect of massive changes that would ultimately have me working to change the entire floor plan two hours prior to the beginning of my own event \u2013 including moving tables, chairs, and other equipment around. The worker did not help with the changes in the floorplan. I even asked the worker if he could get some more sidewall for the other tent. He told me he would and never did.\n\nTo compound the poor set up experience, the tent would not stay warm after being guaranteed that the heaters \"would keep the tent very warm and we did not need any more heaters.\" I think that may have been the case if 1) both heaters worked the entire time and 2) the bottom of the tent would have been secured so the wind would not make them flap. A company that claims to have set up hundreds of events did not even ensure basic set up was accomplished. Due to the temperature inside the tent, the band refused to play. We had to wait nearly an hour before a repairperson arrived to fix the heater. Around 7:00 PM, the band resumed playing.\n\nI have not ever had an experience so horrible and on the day of my wedding reception makes this exponentially worse. As I know mistakes happen, I feel much of these could have been avoided had I been given the correct guidance and Top Notch did their job of securing the tent properly (as well as supplying working heaters). Being unfamiliar with event planning in general and the previous events held at Vulcan, I feel that Top Notch should have provided any additional information to clients to make sure the event would run as smoothly as possible. In addition, I would like to point out I have exhausted every action I could prior to posting this review. I always try to work out differences in a private setting as opposed to in a public forum. Unfortunately, Top Notch was not interested in working things out and felt they were completely absolved from any blame. This company is amateur and unprofessional \u2013 pay a little extra and use a company that knows how to properly set up for any event!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb3e875cc5ad5:0xf71cc8f07b5939ca"}

I hired Blue Rents to provide tables, chairs and tents for my company (a major corporation) for a community event sponsoring a local high school. There were over 300 public officials including law enforcement, firemen, EMTs from the area. Also, the school board and all faculty from the school system. My initial experience with a salesperson, Margaret, was pleasant. I explained my needs and she booked every item as needed. The day before the event- I received a confirmation call for delivery the following day between 12 and 2. This reassured me that everything would go as scheduled. This was not the case. I called 6 times trying to get the salesperson to give me an ETA. This proved to be around 4pm. The event started at 5pm. They sent one guy with part of my order. Because there was only 1 guy- my children unloaded and set up the tables with the table cloths- 18 to be exact! This guy only had the railing for the 2 tents. About 30 minutes later- another guy showed up with a helper. They had to find a faucet to load the water barrels to hold the tents down....After all of this... they had NONE of my CHAIRS! After a call to the salesperson- she had the audacity to say- \"You didn't order chairs\"!!!!!!!!! Thank goodness one of the catering people knew the Vice Principal of this school. Between my children, the lady and my husband- we took our own vehicle to pick up over 100 chairs and set them up ourselves.

Not once did she try to clarify.
