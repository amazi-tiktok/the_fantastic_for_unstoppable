He is professional, knows his craft, and came out to our house often. We wanted to put in a curved edge patio and he came out and measured the land, staked out the space and figured out what would work best. Our schedules didn't align at first but we made it work once we figured out a workable timeline. He came back a few more times and we discussed color of the concrete, size, dimensions, drainage, and a bunch of other details. He was patient and hear do us out, and you could tell he was excited about the project.\n\nWhen the crew showed up they were fast, professional, and methodical. They know their craft. They worked from 6am to 7pm some days, going over the details, re-laying sod, cleaning up spills or little messes (nothing major just normal stuff from the construction), and generally just making the backyard look good again.\n\nAnd the finished product is exactly what we wanted! Josh kept telling us to trust him, he had a plan, he was going to pour some creativity into our project and we wouldn't be disappointed. And he was right! Our once ugly backyard patio space now looks like something out of a magazine! The form is beautiful, it makes our yard flow, and it is just a fantastic job. I HIGHLY recommend these guys.

They are an exceptional concrete contracting company that most definitely puts the customer first. They went way out of their way to ensure they had a satisfied customer with our project and believe me, we were not an easy customer to please. They had to continuously answer questions and listen to our concerns but did so with nothing but professionalism. They take pride in their work and have been very professional throughout the entire process!\n\nWe went with the stamped concrete design with colors to blend well with our brick. We were unsure of the colors and how they would look next to the brick on our house, but with their experience and knowledge they were able to give us what we wanted. The colors are as close to perfect as you can get!\n\nWe've never known anyone personally that had a stamped concrete patio or have ever viewed a stamped concrete patio of this design, other than in pictures, so fully understanding the process and the amount of work it takes to build a patio, such as this, was beyond our full comprehension. It takes a lot of work, skill and somewhat of an artistic eye along with exceptional pride to produce a nice product. Foxcrete did just that!\n\nThe patio is designed with the appeal of a paver patio, but without stones that will move. The brick lined edge comes down the side walls of the patio giving it a realistic appearance of brick pavers. The colors are a mixture of browns and tans, with the brick edge being a darker color than the inner area of the patio giving it a distinct framed look. We love this design and the colors!\n\nThank you, Josh and Foxcrete Construction Group, for doing such a fantastic job on this patio!

They showed up late (without calling) to give me an estimate, and then showed up unannounced the day they came to work. But then things took a surprising turn..\n>   They were hired to fell one tree and heavily trim the lower branches of another. To save money and to give me a project involving strenuous exercise, they were not required to do any cleanup work. When they asked about my cleanup plans, I mentioned using my ATV trailer to move the debris to the street for pickup by the city. At their suggestion I moved the trailer into the work area. Suddenly the logs and branches magically found their way onto the trailer until it was full, with the remainder piled neatly nearby. Despite not being paid for it, they worked hard to minimize the cleanup work remaining for me, a fat 74 year old retired soldier.\n>  It was also interesting and entertaining to watch their tree climber work. He knew exactly where and how to make cuts to have the pieces fall right where he wanted them. And while 20+ feet up into the tree being trimmed, he asked me over and over what else I wanted cut. He never suggested being done until I was satisfied.\n>   Finally, when the work was done, they did a last minute walk-around to check for any tools left behind, and to pick up more debris so I wouldn't have to.\n>   The team's work (and work ethics) more than made up for the early communications problems.

I wanted someone, a supposed professional, to tell me what they thought.

It must be nice that you have plenty of business that you can not only turn away potential new customers but also treat them poorly with poor follow through and lackluster effort. I understand the eb and flow of your operations and how you can't push mow entire yards. I wasn't sure that it required that and if it did I would of possibly still been interested in the front yard being serviced which can be completed with a riding mower.

Also, I was interested in other services your company might have provided but in light of this entire process lacking professionalism and follow through I wouldn't be confident in ANY work you could provide.

They require that they choose the items you want.  The crepe myrtle they installed in my yard last year is nothing but tree stems this year.  I have called several times and was told by Amanda she would have Micheal come by at a specified date and time and look at everything and discuss it with me .  On the scheduled day, i received a 'Health Check' email from Amanda explaining that Micheal had come by earlier than anticipated and then she went on to explain what he found regarding my tree and the bushs.  First off, if he came by, i did not know anything about it because he surely did not ring my doorbell; Secondly, if he did come by, he trespassed onto my fenced in backyard to look at the tree.  I find this highly unacceptable. When i called these people last year, the owner Jacob came out, whom i consider the 'money man.\"  i explained to him that i dont have a green thumb at all and need some kind of consultation regarding what i need to do to get my yard up to speed.  All he proceeds to do is write down how much everything is going to cost me without allowing someone who knows about horticulture to come out and discuss with me first about what would be the proper plants i need based on my unique environment. Needless to say, i'm back at the drawing board, trying to find a landscaper who will listen to my cries of help and actually help me.  I certainly will not spend another dime with these people at Veterans Lawn Care!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1593051505029, "text": "Ms. Wesley,\nI am sorry to hear about your tree and shrubs.

However, he wanted to do a patch job on my fence and I felt the length of the fence should be replaced to keep the fence uniform instead of part of it sticking out like a sore thumb, as was confirmed with my insurance company.

Called a few of the top rated companies on google and could not get a call back. Then Tahj and Pedro rolled by the house one day and handed me a pamphlet. I called them up and Mike responded quickly. Amanda at the office made the scheduling and transaction a breeze. Tahj and Dan started work promptly the day of the project and hammered out most of the clean out before lunch. After lunch Eric and Pedro joined the team and the entire crew finished the job. In 10 hours they had completely cleaned out and dug-up/removed the weeds and 12 over grown bushes from the front, back, and side beds, removed 5 stumps, cleaned out an over grown play area and had taken out 2 dying trees. By night fall, they had the yard mulched and ready for phase 2 - replanting in the spring. The following morning Tahj dropped by to mow the grass and edge the entire property, just as he had promised. You can tell Tahj gave a damn, and treated the place like his own. Eric brought the knowledge and had no problem answering my questions about plants and things while they worked. Pedro kept them honest, while Dan provided the laughs. As a veteran I appreciated that from all the guys. The price was fair for the work performed and worth every penny to us. Thank you guys for your service and for the service.
