We've always liked the private swimming lessons experience and those instructors have always been excellent. We used to love the Kids Night Out program, but they've made it less conducive for our child who is not into socializing. I wish they had some kind of classes for beginners especially yoga. Administrative people are nice but don't seem to be on the same page with information. Cleaning attendants are friendly and always hard at work. Now that my children are 8 and 11 they do not feel comfortable going in the ladies dressing room which I totally agree with but I do not feel comfortable letting them go in the men's area because there is no privacy for them. I'm not comfortable with them being exposed to naked men or having to expose themselves. Probably a lot to ask for a kids dressing area or family room. There is a changing room/storage room by the pool but I think it's really just meant for storage. It would be great if they would post the status of the pool on Facebook or via text.
