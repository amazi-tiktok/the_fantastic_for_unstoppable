When I walked back out on the street, I was trying to get situated with my coffee and straw and other things in my arms and ended up dropping my $25 mug that I just bought for my mom for Christmas. My dad was with me and he picked up the bag and walked us back to the store to buy another one. He knew I really wanted to get my mom that mug because she loved it so much but didn\u2019t buy it for herself.\nWhen we walked in, Dad set the bag on the counter and we went to find another mug( keep in mind these are beautiful, handmade mugs) that looked similar to the one I bought earlier. Everyone working there was concerned and immediately tried to help us find one that looked closest to the other one. Once we found one, we walked to the counter to pay. A man who was so kind and helpful wrapped our new mug and handed it to my dad and said, \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t make us pay for that second mug. We were both shocked. We walked outside and I started to cry. I was so grateful for his kindness. It\u2019s not very often that you come across people with such big hearts anymore. My Dad hugged me and and told me that they just earned themselves business for a long time. He couldn\u2019t be more right.
