The owner himself installed it and he did it in less than 15 minutes. Great deal right? Wrong. I already had a back up camera installed and hooked up to the old system. Dude didn't hook up the wires of the back up camera to the new system he installed. I was in a rush so left and came back another day. Dude tells me the new system didn't have an back up camera input. Yea Right. I wouldn't have bought the system if that was the case. I take it to an Audio shop that I use all the time to get all my stuff installed including the other after market radio that was replaced by the new one. They call me to the back and show me where the wires where just thrown in the back of the dash versus using just 1 cable tie and where on the back of the system, it clearly has a wire and and input that says CAM. Not to mention they gave me a dash kit that fit the radio so you can't see the gap between the head unit and the dash board. I've gotten a lot of cars tinted here by other workers, but never had the manager himself work on my car and never got electronics installed here and will never again.

GO ANYWHERE ELSE! !\n\nIf you don't feel like reading the entire review I understand so the short version is this.\nMy truck left there worse than it went in and I paid them almost $300 to do that. Lights now don't work, instrument lights don't work, if I turn the AC on after starting the truck it resets the audio system. Wires hanging, trash left in the truck and really, REALLY poor service and lack of respect. When I told the owner about the problems and that I simply wanted a refund for labor only  because I don't feel comfortable letting them back into my wiring he said \"good luck bro! Try and get your money back and I'll sue YOU!\".\nI never want back because after checking the receipt it clearly says no refunds which makes sense when you do work like this.\n\nThe quality of workmanship AND professionalism was and still is the worst I've ever encountered.\nI have NEVER written a review and I'm 30 years old and have dealt a lot in business. The fact that I'm writing this review is an extreme for me.\n\nThe stereo system they \" installed \" for me is very cut and dry.  I supplied the head unit, subwoofer and amp for '02 Tahoe. When I called to make an appointment they said come in first thing Monday (I called on Friday ) and this wasn't a problem for me.\nWhen I called Monday morning to find out why my fiance was waiting in the parking lot for 45 minutes just to see someone they told me they're audio guy doesn't work Mondays but \"they'll make it work\".\nAfter 4 hours of \"installing\" she finally left. When I got home from work and inspected the work I found the following:\n\n1) Wires freely hanging run across my pedals.\n2) The sub and amp were installed on the wrong side of the vehicle after being told 5 times and told to 3 different employees where to put it. I even set it up on the side I wanted it on and they put it opposite.\n3) I was told they tune the system before it leaves the shop. They're \" tuning \" involved them turning everything to the maximum capacity and leaving it. Dangerous to any electronics.\n4) They didn't have the materials needed to do a professional installation on my head unit (which is a $650 Kenwood double din) so I still have spaces beside the unit and looks like ass and nothing like a factory install like they assured me it would.\n6) Left trash wire and clippings all through out my truck. When I mentioned this the OWNER told me \"there was already trash there.\" There wasn't. I keep a clean truck. And when I mentioned the poorly ran wiring he told me it couldn't be because he did the wiring HIMSELF! !\n\nI could list more but you get the idea and as I said I don't write reviews.

I actually met his wife before I met him, although I'm not sure they were married or even acquainted that early on. I was in contract food service and she worked in a similar profession dealing with conventions and such. These are people of high moral character. Mark has done my window tinting, alarms, remote start feature, and some small bit of sound systems. I would like to tell you what you can experience from doing business with Mark, but it's much easier to tell you what you will not experience. With Mark's expertise, in his line of business, you can expect NOT to bring your vehicle back in a second time because of something that was not quite right. He is very conscientious about his work and takes pride in the job that he does although you will likely not see that side of him for his humble personality gets in the way of that. My oldest son is a die hard customer of Mark's but his thing is the sound systems in his vehicle. Whether it's me or my son, when we trade cars/SUV's, the first stop is Audio Creations. I have never considered his prices to be anything other than reasonable except for times when I've asked him if he is actually coming out ahead based on the charge. Never does he overcharge or do any unnecessary work. Here is a long story that I will attempt to give you the readers digest version. Some years ago, I bought a used suburban for my wife when she retired. A '99 suburban had a 40 gal gas tank & here is the significance of that. It had been very well kept up & as soon as we took possession from the individual the first stop was to see Mark. He pulled it in the shop & began work on the window tint, alarm, & remote start. A couple of days later when he finished, & went to start the truck & pull it out of the garage, it wouldn't start! What kind of electrical mistake had he made while installing the alarm & remote start? NONE!! Who would have thought a fuel pump would go out after the truck was pulled into the shop & the ignition cut off? That would not have occurred to anyone. Mark back tracked all the wiring to the point where the truck was before his work began. That took hours & hours, in fact days, but at that point we knew it was mechanical. I had the suburban towed from his shop to my auto mechanic, James Daniel, who by the way is just like Mark when it comes to excellence. He knew right away that on that long suburban with the 40 gal tank, it could be nothing else but a fuel pump. After replacing the fuel pump, it was back in Mark's hands to put the alarm system & remote start back in a second time & he asked for no additional charge. I did however pay him extra but not near enough to compensate for all the time & trouble that he went through. One last thing, I don't do business with anyone that I cannot establish a solid friendship with. Mark is my friend first, & my special, tech, tint, alarm, person second. He knows his stuff & you & your vehicle are in good hands with Mark. No one better.Very recently he even came to my house when I was out of town and my wife called him because my suburban, my Chevy Z truck, and even my Harley would not start. Before I left for my out of town trip I suspected I was having a problem with my alarm on our '04 suburban that he put in '09. It wasn't. In all three cases it was the batteries. He found my battery charger in the garage and got the suburban up and running so my wife was not stranded. His kindness in making a \"House Call\" given the circumstances was more than gracious. My wife had to twist his arm to get him to take even a small gratuity. This is the mark of CHARACTER!! This is MARK PICOGONA & Audio Creations.!!!!

Not funny keep in mind me and the manger all ready talked prices and etc so when I confronted him I had to do it all over again with the owner and it was like he didn\u2019t think I could afford the better wire or he didn\u2019t wanna sell it idk didn\u2019t make sense but i felt that was bad business I started to stop everything but I had been waiting almost a year to install so I continued the next part of the bad business I had was with the install itself the install was very clean in the trunk I will give him that but he almost cost me a couple of grands from his either lack of knowledge which I don\u2019t think was the case I feel it was done on purpose to burn up my sundown audio zv5 15 a 800 dollar almost 1000 dollar subwoofer but when he hooked up everything the amp the sub when he set my amp gain he didn\u2019t do it correctly he literally just turned my amp gain all the way up to the max which is not the way you set a amp gain on top of that I got a big three upgrade under the hood so it\u2019s basically supposed to replace three main wires from the alternator to the motorblock and I forget the other one but instead of replacing the wires he literally just added the wire on top of the the existing wires when I said something to him about it he told me that it was better that way and it would get me more power and I should leave it I later once I got home removed the wires myself and hooked up the wires the way I asked him to do it luckily for me he didn\u2019t even know how to work my radio and was unable to get into my subwoofer settings because if was successful then no doubt he would of blew my speaker my radio has special settings which allow me to turn up my subwoofer as high as 15 sub level making it hit way harder he tried and tried to get into it and told me it was a problem with the radio and gave me a spill about that which the radio worked perfectly I later fixed once I got home with a little patience and going through each row I was able to access my sub settings haven\u2019t had a issue with the radio period it\u2019s a kenwood excelon kdc 898 so I didn\u2019t know he tuned my amp wrong it was once I left and was listening to my music it sounded great and was hitting hard I was on my way home and I decided to pull over and make sure everything was ok and not burning up or nothing cause I spent a decent amount of money on this build when I popped the trunk and looked at my sub I touched my amp is was burning hot and touched my sub it was so hot I\u2019m surprised it didn\u2019t break my sundown was so hot it literally from me touching it wiped the logo off of the subwoofer that\u2019s when I noticed my amp gain was set incorrectly some would say why didn\u2019t I go back after paying 500 dollars at that point they lost me never again", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d49fb16f5f0c5:0xced9357f39a34f51"}

That is not what this review will contain. I finally got out of my car,  taking a break from listening to it to give some kudos to Audio X. I'm a huge audiophile and have been into car audio since the early 90s. I lived at the local car audio shop basically in my teens and early 20s,  was the youngest sound quality competition judge on the circuit, and sold high end equipment before moving on to college. I'm just saying this to let you know I've seen sone insane builds and heard the best set ups in the world. When i made a purchase of the mid life crisis mobile \ud83d\ude01, i had the itch to build a sound quality system. I began the search for a high end shop in Alabama and asked a friend who i had trusted with my car audio for years. He sent me pics of his Jeep Cherokee that Audio X had done for him and tagged Steve Cook in the post. I did some research online and saw some really amazing work. Steve reached out to me to get an idea of what i was wanting to do. We discussed some options and i was amazed with his knowledge of everything car audio. I decided to drive 2 and a half hours to check out the store. I was a kid in a candy store,  he carries a wide variety of products from entry level to the best on the planet! There were no stores in my area that had a selection like this or knew so much about every product they carried. So ok,  impressive but let me see the install bay. No problem,  he took me on a tour. It's one thing to carry great brands but another to implement them in a vehicle to perform at high levels. To say i was impressed would be an understatement. He had cars from all over the country that had been shipped to his shop and trusted with him to put out a competition level vehicle. The fabrication of the custom doors,  boxes,  amp presentation, etc. was some of the best I've ever seen. I realized that i had not only found the best shop in Alabama but one of the best period. Needless to say i ordered a rental car and left my car there that day. They went to work on it immediately. Most shops can't do this with a bay full of vehicles because they may have one rockstar installer working on one vehicle at a time. Not the case here,  there's a garage full of rockstars. I'm not a wealthy guy by any means and this was a huge purchase for me. I was anxious,  excited,  nervous. Got the call the next week (brought it in on a Saturday) that it was ready. It was 11pm and Steve was personally tuning the DSP! Drove 2 and half hours back,  returned my rental and they gave me a ride to the store. Steve jumps in and starts demoing it. All that nervousness,  anxiety disappeared 20 seconds into the first song. I had a permagrin and think at one point i actually gave him a high five. The Porsche Boxster S is not the ideal car for acoustics and it blew me away with how it sounded! I obviously highly recommend Audio X. Wether you are looking for a DBL monster (YouTube search Steve,  he knows Bass and a very good windshield repairman! \ud83d\ude0a )or a sound quality build, this store will have a solution for you. Communicated with me the entire time,  sent pictures,  adjusted the plan as needed to make it better,  always fast if i had a question. I would be surprised if there was a better sounding Boxster in the country. For the curious we did Kenwood Excelon with back up camera, Morel 3 way system with 9 inch woofers in the doors along with 4 inch midrange and tweeters on the pillars. Helix P 6 amp with built in dsp (this thing is a beast by the way for its size and functions)  Time to get back in the car and find a reason to run an errand.

I took a brand new Hyundai to them and asked them to run two strands of 9 wire from behind the radio to under the seat and then run 4 gauge power wire under the seat. When I went back to pick up my car my total price was over $100 more than he originally quoted me because he added 2 cheap passive line output converters and RCA cables. I told him thats not what I wanted but he promised me it was the only way. He rushed me out of the store because it was time to close so I didn\u2019t have time to find everything wrong. On my way home I noticed my dash wasn\u2019t put back together all the way and I could not make any phone calls because he summed all of the output signals together. I had to take my car back the next day and we determined it now needed an active line output converter because the cheap passive ones he put in were junk. So then I had to take it back a week later for a line output converter which they didn\u2019t install correctly and charged me a ton for installation. After I got my car back the 3rd time I had a ton of scratches on my dash and doors and it still sounded horrible.\n\nIf you decide to take a newer car there you better very careful explain and write down what you want them to do because they will just do whatever they think is best once you leave.\n\nEdit in response to the owners comments: you did price match the LC7i but still charged way too much to install.

The vehicle in question was brought in because the ignition switch was defective. Due to the connector going to the anti-theft module was not making connection. After I spent 30 minutes on the phone with the chevy dealer I found the connector was not available. I instructed your daughter to go and get a complete unit with a new pig tail. After explaining to them that a code reading would bring no results to identify the issue. I did allow the vehicle to sit in my parking lot until the problem could be addressed. Most places charge several hundred dollars to do this. Several days later they brought in a switch from a junk yard that was ripped out and badly damaged. I told them they could not use part due to being damaged. After a couple days a night time worker offered to help with diagnostics, he brought his scan tool and tried to diagnosis the issue. Found the anti-theft module was not making any connection with the vehicles pcm. He spent over an hour trying to help your daughter for free. He normally charges $70 an hour for this. We have gone out of our way to help your daughter every way we could. Including letting the vehicle sit for over a week. No way did your stand out in the cold while we laughed at her.

On the one hand, Anthony, the sales person who I dealt with, is really nice, helpful, knowledgeable, and wants his customers to be happy. On the other hand, there were so many problems with my install, it just seems like things are really disorganized over there and quality control might be a little lacking.\n\nI went to The Car Stereo Shop because my 2005 car didn\u2019t even have an aux port, and I wanted one. But Anthony then informed me I could get a video head unit which would allow me to use Android Auto like a new car can, and that sounded awesome, so I decided to do that instead of just getting an aux port (I wouldn\u2019t really need the aux port since I\u2019d be able to play music with Bluetooth or USB cord). Also, he suggested a speaker upgrade from factory speakers (without being pushy about it at all), and I realized it would be nice to have non-factory speakers for a change. So I ordered an install of the head unit, speakers, and a new Sirius satellite antenna since the old 2005 one wouldn\u2019t work with the head unit.\n\nThen the problems began. For example:\n\n--When I went to pick up the car after the install, the Sirius satellite antenna had never been installed.\n--When i went to pick up the car after the Sirius satellite antenna was installed, the microphone (needed for hands-free phone calls & Android auto commands) no longer worked.\n--When I went to pick up the car after the microphone was fixed, I found a small chunk of my dash had been ripped out during the latest repair.\n--The Sirius radio kept cutting out, and when I asked them about it they said it was just the trees blocking the signal, but finally I was so frustrated I contacted Sirius and they sent me a replacement antenna, and after replacing the antenna the radio didn\u2019t cut out at all so it turns out I was right.\n--Also, there were numerous times when scheduling was difficult or delayed because they were \u201cshort a tech.\u201d They always seemed to be \u201cshort a tech.\u201d\n--Also, the billing system was really disorganized. There were times we\u2019d be looking around for a paper receipt to see how much I had paid them, how much they\u2019d quoted me on price, etc., rather than just looking it up on a computer.\n\nSo the whole process of the install had a lot of issues. BUT, now that the install is done, I am really happy with my new stereo system. And I\u2019m grateful to Anthony for all his advice. He made me aware of potential stereo improvements I hadn\u2019t considered (video screen, Android auto, new speakers), without trying to push stuff on me. Also, the shop did a really nice job crafting custom molds for the Tweeters and installing everything so that it looks natural in the car. And Anthony couldn\u2019t have been nicer about all of the issues I was having with the install and making them right. He was genuinely apologetic about everything and worked really hard to get fixes done as soon as possible.\n\nSo if you\u2019re looking for a new car stereo, I do think it\u2019s worth visiting The Car Stereo Shop and talking to Anthony. He\u2019s great. Just be aware of the potential issues -- who knows, maybe they\u2019ve improved things there by now.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2a91e4c1211:0xdbfbe1cc1f0cf71f"}

The television was out of warranty just a few months and we had bought an extended warranty.  We called the extended warranty service and they directed us to Samsung the television manufacturer.  We were told that the only authorized service company was A/V video repair.\n\nThe first time that they came they asked for a check.  The technician helped my son get the television off of the wall and he identified the issue.  The technician then helped my son put the television back on the wall.\nHe left without providing a card, a receipt or any documentation indicating what the issue was. Since the technician came in a personal vehicle with no identifying signage, I had to call around town to identify who we had just given our check to.\n\nIn about a week (on a Monday), the company called to say that they had the part and again, the technician helped my son get the television off of the wall only to find out that they had misdiagnosed the problem.  I said at that time that there would not be any way of getting the television back down and that they needed to order the part and be back before the Thursday.  This information was not related to , or the company chose to ignore our request. At no time did the company status us, contact us to let us know that there was not going to be a way to fix the problem before the date we had stated.  Instead, they called on a Monday with the expectation that we would be there and that they needed to come on Wednesday.\n\nWhen the technician showed up on Wednesday, I had to send them back because there was no one to take the television down. I said that we had specifically stated that there would not be anyone here to do this if they did not provide the service in a timely manner.\n\nThey left a message with me trying to arrange another time. I called back and explained that I was not happy with the level of service that we had so far been provided.  That in addition to not getting the right part, we needed to have someone come out with the technician to get the television off of the wall.  I felt that this was the least that they could do given the issues that they had in diagnosing the issue with the television.\n\nAt this time I was told that they could not guarantee that the next part that they had ordered would work and that the television had to be the floor in order to service it.  I stated that this was not an option.  They stated that they could simply send the part back.  I then requested to talk to a manager that said \"The television has to be on the ground\".  I then requested that the manager speak with my husband at which point the manager stated \"Are you not capable of telling your husband what happened?\"\n\nWhen I stated that I was going to file a formal complaint with the better business  and angies list.  He said that I could call 1800 BBB, 1800 Angies list and 1800 I dont give a darned who you call.  At that point I hung up.\n\nI have already called Samsung and they are putting me in touch with another more competent service center that will ensure that the diagnosis identified is correct.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862841ff07ad52b:0x9f9a5d9924d8896c"}

I went here in June and spoke with Ben about correcting an issue that was caused at another car audio place.\n\nBen assured me that it would be an easy fix and told me to come by the following week. I called one day that next week and Ben said that they were too busy on that particular day. I asked if I could just make an appointment instead. Ben said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m kinda tied up right now. Try us again later this week.\u201d\n\nI was in the area the following week so I went by. After greeting me, Ben remembered me and immediately told me that they couldn\u2019t get to my car that day. I told him that I wasn\u2019t expecting a same-day service. I, instead, wanted to make an appointment. Ben thanked me for coming by and told me that the shop had been so busy.\n\nHe, again, assured me that the shop could easily correct the problem. He went on to say, \u201cIt\u2019s really a five-minute fix. I could do it now, but I don\u2019t want to just in case something happens and makes it longer than that and throw our day off.\u201d\n\nMy appointment was set for Wednesday, July 8th at 9:30am. I used PTO at work so that I could finally get the issue taken care of. The evening before my appointment, Ben called and told me they would have to cancel (not reschedule) my appointment because they didn\u2019t get a chance to finish a car from the previous day. He went on to say that they could probably do it at \u201csome other time\u201d and he\u2019d call me to let me know when. Of course, I was never called.\n\n\u2022Why would you tell your customer that you\u2019re too busy to give them an appointment? Especially when there are others working in the office.\n\n\u2022Why are you making the customer chase you as if this is the only place that could correct the issue?\n\n\u2022I understand that the shop may have been busy, or behind schedule. Why not reschedule my appointment?\n\n\u2022If you did not want to (or could not) perform the work, you should\u2019ve been upfront. It was a waste of both of our time.\n\nThis is the second Jimmy\u2019s Car Stereo location I\u2019ve had a poor experience at.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c17a0d019b:0x6ae2aef67374d317"}
