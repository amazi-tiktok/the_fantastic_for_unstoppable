I would NEVER refer them to anyone nor EVER use them again.  They are the absolute worst in customer service.  The salesperson is the face of the company and that\u2019s about as good as it gets.   It is difficult to contact them by phone and when you do no one is ever around who has any answers.  The receptionist or answering service must always get back to you, and usually never the same day.  I don\u2019t know the criteria for Window World being ranked as the #1 replacement company in America, but it can\u2019t be based on any contributions from Window World of Dothan, AL, at least not for doors and shutters.\n\nWe contracted with Window World of Dothan, AL on 1 Oct 2019 for 10 sets of outdoor shutters and a front door.  The install should have only taken a day. The install began on 16 Nov in the late afternoon and still has not been completed as of today, 9 Jan 2020.  The individual sent to install the shutters and door obviously didn\u2019t care about the job because the quality of the installs were substandard.  We tried to give him space and let him do his job, but that was a mistake because when we looked closer at the tall shutters they were installed with only 4 pegs instead of 6 (industry standard) and did not place the pegs uniformly (symmetrically) into the mortar, some directly into the brick.  When asked if 4 pegs was a Window World standard, he said it didn't matter.  We also asked if he filled the old holes and he stated \"some\",  which we knew meant \"none\". His defense was to say there were lots of holes in our house.\n\nThe installer completed the haphazard shutter install and departed because it started to drizzle and he didn't want the caulking to get wet. He was supposed to return the next day (Friday) to install the door.  He sent a text on Friday to say he was still on a job in GA and wouldn't arrive until the afternoon. We responded that we didn't like afternoon appointments because he would be rushing the door install the same way he rushed the shutter install and make more mistakes.  He agreed to return the following day in the morning.  Meanwhile, my wife attempted to call Window World, Dothan several times to ask about the standards for shutter installation but no one ever called her back.\n\nAs he was installing the door on Saturday, we let him know the door was not square in the frame.  His ongoing response was to tell us that our house was the reason the door wasn't straight. Once the install was complete we continued to let him know we were not satisfied with the way the door looked in the frame.  As he prepared to install the storm door, he realized the frame had to be shimmed and stated he would return on Sunday to finish the job.  When he returned at 9am we told him that the thresh hold needed to be adjusted more because we could see car lights under the door and feel the cold air. He appeared a little agitated. He became more agitated when my wife asked \"hypothetically\" what would happen if we wanted to discuss the possibility of getting another door. He then said he could fix the door.  My wife asked him if that was the case why he hadn't fixed it in the first place.  He proceeded to tell my wife that she complained about the shutters and every little thing about the door. He then stopped what he was doing and left the storm door uninstalled.  He told her that day was his last day at Window World so he didn't care if we complained.\n\nMy wife called Window World the following Monday  and asked to speak to the owner.  Instead of being contacted by the owner, the salesman was sent for damage control.  He stated he would have the shutters reordered and expedited.  Another installer was sent to correct the door install.  He made some additional adjustments that helped but was still not the quality of install we expected.  It is currently 9 Jan 2020 and we have not heard from Window World about the shutters or the fact that we are extremely DISSATISFIED customers.  Their lack of care, concern, and communication speaks volumes about the organization.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1578694241397, "text": "Mr. Gatlin, we appreciate the time spent sharing this information with us.

The remainder of the single hungs would be replaced by double hungs and the 3 remaining picture frames would be replaced with picture frame windows.\n\nOnly Bill from Window Depot would listen to us and provided honest feedback some of which may have actually resulted them taking a few hundred dollars the less from us.  They also gave us an honest price since we went with our own financing.\n\nIt was the complete opposite than what we experienced with Champion who insisted on bells and whistles we didn't need or want and cost $2000 more for the same style and quality windows.  Champions sales pitch was also high stress (must sign today shtick to get special demo offer).\n\nWindow World had come recommended from a few friends but they insisted we go with double hung in all but the one picture frame over our bay window.  They insisted it would cost too much and wasn't worth it vs their recommendation for 15 double hung and 1 bay window.
