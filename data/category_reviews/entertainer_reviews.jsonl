That said, I felt like the rooms could have had a more cohesive narrative that drive you in the direction of a logical progression of solving the puzzles.

If there had been something that told us where to go and when I felt like it would have been a much better experience. We did finish but with not much time left. The magician's room was much the same way, there just wasn't anything to tell us where to begin or where to go or what to do and that made it very frustrating for us. You end up just looking at the materials that are provided and trying a bunch of numbers on a bunch of different locks which isn't very much fun. The puzzles were good but without any idea of what order to do them in it just made things kind of a frantic mess. We will definitely go again to try some of the other rooms and I know that the owner seems to read and reply to feedback so I hope I've given enough information.

We used this company to DJ for our wedding and there wasn\u2019t a special moment that wasn\u2019t messed up by the music.

They didn\u2019t start our music on time, and they told us it is because \u201cno wedding they have DJd ever started on time\u201d. Going into the reception our minister went ahead of us after we completed pictures to tell the DJ we were outside waiting to come in. Finally we waited so long and were so hot we had to just walk in, no announcement and we didn\u2019t get to do our entrance song. The whole night we had to tel the DJ what we wanted to do next ( even though we filled out an entire packet of what we wanted to do, what song to play, IN ORDER. We also even had a sit down meeting to go over everything prior). At our meeting we specifically told Brandon that we did NOT want any children songs played (specifically songs like Baby Shark, etc) baby shark was the first song to play after dinner... During the reception the DJ (Juan) went up to my sister (MOH) and asked her \u201cwhat do you guys want to do and in what order, we never went over any of that\u201d. Needless to say, a very very unorganized company they did not communicate with each other at all. We called them afterwards to tell them how upset we were with our service that we paid over ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS for, they said there was nothing they could do to make it right because they provided 2 extra hours of music without charge which would have costed us $200, and we never even asked him to play an additional 2 hours.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88928d9f00fa9f7b:0xc6eff52ef76e5d0d"}

We hired Brandon Dunn as our DJ for both our ceremony and the reception after I saw his services first hand at my best friend's wedding a couple of years ago. We were blown away by how awesome he was! And then our wedding planner (Becky's Brides) recommended him as well, so of course we immediately knew we had to hire him. Needless to say, best. choice. ever!! I have been to weddings with DJs who are not as awesome as Brandon, and you never realize how important the DJ is for the overall vibe and energy of the party until you hear a bad one - haha. Those experiences made me even more thankful that we went with WellDunn because it made all of the difference in the energy of our wedding! Everyone was talking about how awesome Brandon was. He is simply fun and a joy to work with. He is also a genuinely good guy and I can't imagine what our wedding would have been like without him. I was a COVID bride and I was all the more thankful for his empathy and flexibility when we had to postpone our wedding to October. I have to say it was all worth the wait! The highlight of the night was when Brandon let me take over the DJing and the crowd went wild!! Those are some of my favorite pictures from the entire night. Thank you for making our special day and night SO much fun.

His music selection had the crowd on their feet the entire night and kept everyone dancing.
