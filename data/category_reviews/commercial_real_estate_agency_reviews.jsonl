My husband and I purchased our first home this month. We used Pam Files as our realtor and Cindy Morrison for the lending process. Both ladies are from this office. We had heard so many horror stories of how hard it is to get to the closing table and how much of a head ache it is. Hands down, Cindy blew that rumor out of the water. This super woman had us ready to close in less than a month! Cindy works really hard and really fast to get the job done. It was as easy as pie lol. And Pam, this woman is so sweet and lovely but, don't let that fool you. She can get tough if need be to get the job done. We had issues with our builders making MANY mistakes and dragging out the closing date. Pam wouldn't let up on them till they got the job done right! Pam was so caring during the hunt for our home and helped us through the entire process. She was there to answer our questions whenever we had them. She has a great eye for detail and noticed things I never would have noticed when looking at homes. She really took notice to what I like and what I was looking for in a home. She read my personality well. We finally found the home of our dreams (a french country spec home). We were not expecting to deal with problems from the building company but we did. As soon as problems started to arise I thought I would become extremely stressed out but Pam stepped in and handled everything. I am truly thankful for everything Pam and Cindy did for us. I can't wait to get our house settled and decorated so I can invite these two ladies to our home warming party. We would not be in such a lovely home had it not been for these two wonderful ladies holding our hands through the entire process. Thank you so much Pam and Cindy!!! You two are like family to us now. I will definitely recommend you guys to everyone I know who is looking to buy a house or refinance. <3", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889046c4e1ba371:0x9ec2a05ed9bbcf0"}

From the beginning, the women that work there were very short and snooty with us, especially a young girl that worked at the front at the desk with short brown hair. Her nose was so far in the air, I don't even know if she knew what earth looked like. I got the vibe of \"I'm better than you\". No one is better than anyone no matter how much money you make, or what you wear, or what you do for a living. We haven't really had that many issues except a few. First of all, we own a dog. A well trained amazing dog. When we saw the house at first, the carpet was terrible. There was a huge black stain on the carpet in the living room and it was coming up at the seams in some places. You could tell the carpet was cheap and old and quite frankly plain nasty. They (owners/tom west) refused to replace the carpet because we had a dog. Also, the kitchen tile was terrible and in some places of the house, you could tell needed to be replaced. Second, We called Tom West a couple months back about a bed bug infestation. When we moved in, we had noticed little bugs a few places, but in the lease agreement, it stated we were to take care of pest control, not realizing they were bed bugs. We did not have bed bugs at our apartment and had verification from the previous landlord. We never called until about a year later when we couldn't get rid of them and they refused to pay to get them removed after we had tried just about everything. Its laughable now because we are moving out and they are still going to have to pay to remove them. Also, in the moving out procedures, you have to pay to get the carpet cleaned. They want me to have that cheap, stained carpet to get professionally clean knowing they are probably going to remove it anyways. We brought our newborn into this home thinking this could be our home for a bit, and now we are moving out 7 months later because it's just what's best. Over all, I would say the company is ok, but pick them last if you have to. When I rent again, they will be last on my list of companies to go through just mainly because of customer service and not taking care of their customers the way it should be and maybe it has a lot to do with the owners of the property as well in which case they need to be realistic as well.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892927d935f424d:0x3aa0af9aa07a070d"}

They will not do a walkthrough inspection with the tenant before moving out. Then as I expected, my $575 security deposit is taken for painting the townhouse, so called repairs and cleaning. I paid to have the place cleaned as well but they have no plans on returning your security deposit. They make up whatever they can with no explanation.

The problem was, I knew nothing of the \"Magic City\" or its neighborhoods. But on the same day I received the offer for the new job, I realized I needed to find a place, and fast. So I downloaded an apartment app and started searching. I had decided on one criteria. I wanted to walk to work.  That should be easy, I thought, there are a tone of loft apartments downtown. The problem is that the large majority of them were black boxes. To this day. I don't know how one would go about taking a look at and discovering availability on these lofts. Without being overly conspiratorial, I will say that to this day I have doubts about the ethics, motives and business practices of so many of these downtown apartments. I still don't know how to crack those black boxes. There was one huge exception. There was a company that managed a couple of downtown lofts that were located less than a five minute walk from my workplace. When I called them and left a message, they called me back in less than 5 minutes. So that same day, I arranged to meet with their guy, Andrew, who would show me some two-bedroom lofts available at both Goodall-Brown and Fix Play. I immediately fell in love with the 3rd floor loft that would become my home for the next year. I loved the rooftop lounge and the apartment's Modern Amenities with exposed brick, 14 ft ceilings with exposed pipes and ducts and beautiful original hardwood floors, as well as my favorite feature, \"the stairs to nowhere\", which became my meditation space, is all I needed to remind me I was not living in an apartment \"complex\". I was home.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't mention the fact that as someone with a less-than-perfect credit score, Goodall-Brown lofts management company, SPM, was great to work with to get my contract through and approved, as they provide options that most companies do not. They also offered me free rent for the remainder of the month, which I totally took advantage of.  In a few weeks I was moved\n\nAlthough I am not a dog owner, I have really enjoyed getting to know my neighbors and their furry friends. They both, the neighbors and their pets, were amicable and friendly as we constantly ran into each other in the elevator.\n\nI also think the  Goodall Brown Lofts are in the absolutely best location to make the most of downtown living in Birmingham. Within 1 block you can walk to El Barrio, Bamboo, Atomic Lounge and Collins bar. Heck, the Wine Loft is in the SAME BUILDING. Within 4 blocks you can add more than a dozen other fantastic bars and restaurants, like Queens Park, Paramount, East West, The Florentine, John's City Diner, The Essential, Pilcrow, Cayo Coco. I have drank or dines at every one of these places and have yet to be disappointed.\n\nIn regards to the management company, I'll never forget that time a few months that I accidentally dropped my keys down the door crack  of the elevator shaft. (Don't ask, but I could hear them banging all the way down to the first floor) Sheepishly I put in a maintenance request on the website and then followed up with a  phone call the next day. Only a day later, Paris, the delightful general manager for SPM, who is a busy lady responsible for a handful of properties, knocked on my door, my keys in hand. She had had to call the elevator company to retrieve them.  I asked her how much I owed her for that service. She waved my question away. \"It's fine\", she said. Needless to say, they are a responsive company when it comes to service calls\n\nI decided in October that I wanted a bigger place and preferably a house. So I found the perfect place and have moved out of Goodall-Brown  as of early December. I know that it was the right decision for me, but that doesn't change the fact that I miss my beautiful loft and the fun of downtown living.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdiCRYM-UrdJtsgU3JhMuLMK9_BZlZ2_0qskFV=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbnWvkLify3SF0Bm2vCyROizYfMjXWmcjtHzKo=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5JQOodrzB7ayy-735-HEcs-A-QUiu8H1Epf29=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrQd0fsEaMk13o543mgnzhoxiAO6f_kLrGHu_X=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMa6Gq27BY_a-Am4v2LjXTPXCS0LvNyGe2QVavB=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOH22sHV7uTr4r5TqqUaWdUgvYqFwUT5NoWSqfP=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUHRC_u1wxyN2TSiJcz5aWfragpzTxVbwAUGwU=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpBexkOHDpIKt7SFGJ1R8gBRkC_TwspAgdBBBk=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxWD55qu_BJwT4XyKXVxicSfjfFY8Jhy2zjOOY=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2F9F1xwsNhAhy4_jIZrD7WJMpd6d8JkRgSCiI=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPb14_TNXqyjxfvVzYgINrL8ZfitePJanPwUFX0=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1608227254215, "text": "Scott, thank you for this truly thoughtful five-star review of Goodall-Brown Lofts!

We did business with SRG in buying a printer from them. I know it\u2019s not a home or property, but if they were this bad to deal with over a $45 printer, I\u2019d be hard pressed to work with them over a $250k home.\n\nWe were told that it was in working condition, but needed toner. We met Tabitha to pick up the printer and then spent $53 on toner. We should\u2019ve been good to go.\n\nAlas, the printer was missing a piece that was removed when they took their toner. A problem that should be easy to solve. We reached out to Elyse, the girl who arranged the purchase to no avail. I called and left a message for Tabitha with no returned call. I emailed Tabitha and she responded once asking what wasn\u2019t working. I even sent pictures of the missing piece. No response. We reached out every few days and both Elyse and Tabitha stopped responding all together. We had asked to either bring the printer back or have them buy the piece for us.\n\nIt was only a $20 piece, but we bought the dang thing after being told that it should work and it didn\u2019t. $115 later (about 3x the purchase price) and we had a working printer.\n\nScreenshots of our conversations available upon request.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1558714635370, "text": "Jacob - I appreciate your feedback but this has absolutely nothing to do with Superior Realty Group as this printer belonged to someone who works at Superior, Elyse.

I met you at our office where the printer was as a favor to her because she lives over 25 minutes away. Superior Realty Group has a stellar reputation and neither I nor my company have ever received any negative reviews for our customer service and knowledge of the real estate market. I ask that you remove this review immediately as it is not a reflection of myself or my real estate company. I did not receive the money from the sale of this printer and had nothing to with the transaction other than it took place at my office. Everyone that works in my office is a subcontractor and supplies their own computers and equipment. It was never implied that the printer had toner in it so that was an expense you should have expected and you paid her $45 for the printer which was $15 less than she was asking for it. I see you are now trying to sell it for $70 and state it \"works great.

I put a work request in on 8/9/19 no one has yet to come out. I called 8/10/19 they said they will mark it urgent & someone would be out that day. 8/10/19 i took a shower & the water did not run out i had to scoop dirty water out & flush down the toilet. I called 8/11/19 & 8/12/19 about the tub being clogged and they said someone would fix it that day. I come home from work 8/12/19 and it is still a tub full of dirty water. I call the maintenance line and he said he would mark my request urgent and send the on call maintenance man to my apartment ASAP. As the air conditioning man was fixing the air in another apartment he knocks mine out somehow i called about that also. So the on call maintenance man calls me and says that he tried to come out but didn\u2019t have a key to my apartment so i asked him what i was suppose to do about a shower and he said \u201cthe best i can do is be there in the morning\u201d.

I called spectrum and they had no record of this. Then he said the air conditioning man would be out & i am STILL without air. Moral of the story they will tell you anything to TRY to keep you happy.

I enjoy that it is one level and no one is above or below us. The one thing, and it's a HUGE PROBLEM, something that I told them about right after moving into said apartment about is the carpet. I mentioned that it was filthy and the owner of Red Rock persisted to state that it had been professionally clean. And after talking to our neighbor I believe this to be true. But the previous owners were disgusting and I don't know what they did to it but even after us buying a high dollar, well made carpet cleaner ourselves and cleaning it TWICE we still cannot walk across the carpet without our feet being sticky and them nor or socks being BLACK. This makes me sick to my stomach. We should be able to walk on our carpet without this being an issue. We have a three year old and I feel disgusted knowing it will never been clean. We only moved in the last week of October and I hate knowing we have to deal with this problem indefinitely. It has torn places and places where it is coming apart in two areas in a line that will only get worse. You guys KNEW the last tenant was fifthly and knowing that should have just replaced the carpet so no one else had to deal with it. I believe it needs to be pulled up and something else put down ASAP. I know that if it is not that we will be moving out, instead of staying put (as we had hoped to do) as soon as our year is up.

I paid the application fee ($90)  and waited for their call. When I finally received the call (after more than a week, rather than the 3-4 day waiting period they promised), I was told someone had applied before me, so they received the apartment. Things happen, and I was okay with this news. The woman I spoke to on the phone said they would have another apartment available at the same location in two weeks time. That's great! She said they would call me as soon as it was available, and I would be the first person on the waiting list.\nThree weeks go by. I call to check on it after hearing nothing. This time I'm told they don't know what date the apartment will be available---not even a time estimate.\nFast forward three months. No updates. At first I called once a week, and they typically answered the phone, though they were NEVER able to offer a time estimate on the apartment. For the past month, I'm lucky to ever get a person on the phone--instead I have to leave voicemails that have only been answered once.\nAnd now the voicemail box is full. They never answer. I was patient to begin with, but I specifically halted apartment hunting for the apartment they originally said would be ready two weeks after I applied.\nI'm so disappointed with this experience. If you are in a time crunch and must have an apartment quickly, please don't use this company.\nI am lucky to have found a much nicer place to live, with much more helpful staff.

Was treated horribly because of my skin color. My girlfriend put in her application for an apartment which basically got approved but her boss wouldn't verify employment over the phone (that's okay and a safe thing to do). Instead of letting her know of the problem, she received no notification. She called to find out days later about the status of her application because she heard nothing from them at all and was told of the problem. For a company needing to fill spots, since empty spots cost money instead of make money, this is a very horrible way for employees to be. When she put in her deposit and we asked about a receipt, we were told the receipt from the money order was enough (the tear off tab). I guess receivership of money doesn't require a receipt for this company or Brittany doesn't understand how a receipt actually works. Every other company we've rented from gives a receipt as proof of receiving a deposit (Arizona, California, Florida, Virginia). Very sketchy. Not a company we want to deal with.\nUpdate (20181106): The response to my review was horrible. Your core values don't mean a thing if there is no true follow-up to a problem so it can be corrected.

This is one of the most disorganized and frustrating realty companies I have ever had the displeasure of having to work with. The shame is that the apartment itself is quite nice, even if it wasn't cleaned before I moved in.\n\nInitially, after Red Rock tried to overcharge me, I was charged twice for my security deposit. Then, when moving in, I was told that the only way to pay my first month's rent was through security deposit and that I had to drop it off in person at their office. What a thoroughly archaic way to collect rent! On top of the fact that their office hours prevent you from actually getting to their office if you have a full time job. Regarding their hours, even if you call while they are supposedly open, never once have they actually answered the phone. And good luck receiving a timely callback if you leave a message, as it takes at least a week for them to respond.\n\nFast forward two months, and I receive a notice of 2 months back rent due plus a late fee and my security deposit. Not only have they lost the record of my security deposit, they failed to note that they already charged me TWICE for it. After spending 2 days on the phone and numerous assurances from multiple employees there that everything is settled, I hope it doesn't happen again. Next month comes along, and I am told I am being threatened with eviction due to $1300+ back rent missing from their records. I am still awaiting a call back regarding this new report of incompetence.\n\nThis company is absolutely horrible when it comes to organization. The only person who has been helpful at their office, Jordan, appears to be the only competent one there, but the issues still keep piling on.

Read the reviews online. I moved into an apt and 3 days later the worst odor I ever smelt in my life and I had to suffer it for 3 1/2 months before the owner would come out and he was so low down he came out when I wasn't there and removed a dead animal from a crawl space. I saw a dead possum at the end of my building. I made numerous calls & Mark the owner  never  do you need anything  for over 3 months He didn't care. the landlord reduced me to being crazy after the Health Inspector had been to my house twice and sent two letters. The owner said that the letter from the health inspector was not true. I spend a lot of money on Lysol and other products to camouflage the odor and kill the bacteria. the owner to this day still thinks that I don't deserve a dime. and he thinks that he should further punish me by holding my security deposit 5 wks. I have now learned that constructive eviction is not for the tenant it is it is a legal loophole for the landlord to screw you out of your money. Unless you dead or half dead at least in Birmingham Alabama. I finally got the owner to release me from my lease to God be the glory. online reviews or  less than 2.9 now I know why. there was a strong musty odor in the apartment as well.My my eyes would burn a lot I felt my eyeballs were melting . I had headaches & I felt something or someone was dead in the walls to this day I regret not having call the police. Oh I forgot to mention about the so-called preacher Ernest Smith resident manager. Earnest a want to be preacher told as many lies as Mark and red rock. This was the most traumatizing and horrific  ordeal  I do not wish this on anyone. After removing the dead possum from the crawl space I finally got my letter from Mark to release me out of my lease. I moved out the end of June a new tenant moved in the beginning of September. I was told by one of the neighbors a Mexican family moved in at least they had at least two months to clear the air in that particular apartment. Lets name this story the hidden secret why because the apartment was newly renovated. Grandma always said looks are deceiving . I was about a1yr  cancer survivor  and  suffer with COPD with other disabilities. The federal government declared me 100% disabled in the year 2000. Mark the owner apparently thought I was just another hood rat. I lived at 7723 Apartment B 3rd Avenue South. They waited 2 months after I left then moved in a Mexican family. I almost died in there with a stinking possum. I wasn't compensated in anyway. Constructive eviction means nothing in Alabama. Unless you lost a limb or life or a have a class action lawsuit apparently. You call a lawyer and they tell you you should and when you move they tell you to file bankruptcy that's what Jonathan at Legal Aid Society call me with. All the wild suggested that there was no way that legal aid services could assist me. Every 3 months when he's got nothing else better to do he called me stalling till statue has run out. you move they tell you they are glad that you got out of that situation but they can't help you. Calling legal aid is a waste of your doggone time. Constructive eviction as far as I can see is a legal loophole for the landlord to screw you anyway they want to. When you complain they do nothing can't wait till you move don't care about the money you lost. It cost me $1,500 to move in there and $1700 for me to find another place to live. I moved twice in the same year. Everytime Jonathan at Legal Services have nothing else better to do he gives me another call with another bright idea. Is Young still trying to learn his role but I do not appreciate him calling him wasting my time acquiring the same info he got the first time stalling. Whenever you get time Google constructive eviction.

NOT AT ANY POINT IN TIME WAS I CONTACTED AND MADE AWARE OF ANY LATE CHARGES. I HAD TO FIND THE INFORMATION ON MY ONLINE PORTAL MYSELF 3 months later and I never got a formal letter stating that I owe anything. If you owe a business, arent they supposed to send you a letter or written notice? They are so unprofessional because not only did I get ZERO letters, in the lease it stated I was to pay 45$ for late fee not 50$ so someone is not able to ensure things are consistent in this office anymore. I would not recommend dealing with this office whatsoever. They raised my rent and took three weeks to stop a huge rain water leak I had coming through my ceiling, and let me go without a working fridge for nearly a week while leaving two fridges in the tiny apartment for two weeks for storage not able to use either one. It has just been a ridiculous experience I am hoping there is a still a decent place to rent from in this area but so far this place has done me wrong totally I got two babies under 2.
