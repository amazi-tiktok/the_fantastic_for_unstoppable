I finally asked at one point how much longer it would be before I saw the Dr since I had to go back to work. She said it wouldn't be long and she would check on me in 5 minutes after she sent me back to the bright and packed waiting room with no eye protection after dilating my eyes.  About 30 minutes passed and she finally takes me back to another room. I ask again how long it will be because I HAVE to go back to work. She didn't like that but told me he would be in soon. He finally comes in the room and is in there less than 5 minutes to tell me I'm a candidate for lasik. I was also told that I would have to travel to their Columbus office for the surgery because the operating room there wasn't finished.\nMy wait was never acknowledged so of course I never received an apology for the 2 hours it took for a simple consultation.

He has never had contacts before and she was very patient and kind with teaching him how to wear and take care of contacts. Our previous office was not so at all. We have had to wait a bit once or twice but not for too terribly long. (Most medical offices in Huntsville have a bit of a wait anyway because we're in need of more physicians.) But our brief wait here was definitely worth it due to the excellent care we received. The physician was quick & efficient, answered all of our questions, and wasted none of our time once we got to him. The front desk staff, although super busy and quite overwhelmed with taking temps and addressing non mask-wearing patients, stayed professional and kind and so did the employee at the checkout desk. We will absolutely continue to be patients here. As a nurse myself I am very particular about my family's and my medical office experiences so if I give a place a 5 star I really mean it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b51a5eed843:0xb421afa2376ebc2a"}

We were forwarded here by our pediatrician and i called a month and a half ahead to make our appointment. Our appointment was scheduled for 3:15pm and I showed up at 2:45pm to complete all of the neccessary paperwork. My husband and two kids, 3years and 10months showed up at 3:15. We waited and waited and waited. We were not seen until 4:30 (now mind you their office closes at 5pm). However I constantly see the doctor and her nurses talking and giggling at a computer in the hallway. So after finally being called in the nurse does some little eye tests and dialates my sons eyes. While waiting i spoke with another mother that said her duaghter was there for her appointment at that was at 4pm. We are then sent out to the waiting room and wait another 20min for them to pull us into the room to see the Doctor. So after being called into the room we again waited and waited and waited. We sait in there for 45MIN!!!! Now it is 5:45pm and my two children are hungry, tired and are frustrated at having to look at walls. So we finally looked out of the room to find out that the ENTIRE Office Staff had left and the doctor was in another room with the little girl whose appointment was at 4pm which was after my son's. When the Doctor FINALLY made her appearance she said my son was fine and we could go!!! 3 HOURS to tell us he was fine! Now mind you on the paper work they sent it said to prepare for a 30min appointment! This was by far the WORST experience we have EVER had and will NEVER return!

Due to his deadbeat dad not paying child support, the child is on Medicaid, and Schaeffer is supposedly one of only two places in Huntsville that offers eye glasses under Medicaid. The little boy was actually excited about getting glasses - about being able to see the board in his 2nd grade classroom. He was excited by all the cool frames he saw on display. When it was his turn to be seen, he and his mother were ushered to a small table, tucked away from the waiting area, with 3 red boxes sitting on top. In those boxes were dirty frames, with only a few sized for boys and not even a mirror to see one's reflection while trying on. The mother humbly asked a clerk if there were any other options for her son and was told \"what you see is what you get\" then dismissed as if her presence were a nuisance. The little boy was forced to pick out a pair of glasses that, although he needs, we're relatively certain he won't wear past the 2nd day he owns them due to the harassment he'll receive from bullies in school. So he won't be able to see the board, and his education and self esteem will suffer. His mother was understandably upset, but what can she do? She already works at least 3 jobs to pay for food and bills. Life can be hard. You do the best you can with what you have.\n\nBut did this mother and child have to be treated like dirt? No. Absolutely not. The behavior of Schaeffer's employee was abhorrent, at best.\n\nI, personally, have a great job with good insurance and can afford not only new glasses every two years, but new prescription sunglasses as well. Where do I go for my glasses? The WalMart vision center on University Drive. The doctor and staff there treat everyone equally well, no matter how they're dressed, how much they make, or what their insurance status is. I know other high-income families that prefer to go there as well.\n\nI will personally spread this story as far and wide as I can.

Ashley compared the two current promotions to find me the very best price.  Then, several days later, I received a call that my glasses had arrived, but Eyecare Associates had rejected them after inspection and had ordered a new fabrication.  Wow!  Just a few days after that, I went to pick up my new remakes.  I was not satisfied with the field of vision they offered, and Ashley showed me the three types of lenses available.   I selected a set with a broader field of vision and, in spite of the $80 increase each of the three sets would entail, placed my order.  The next day, Ashley called to tell me she had discussed my case with the manager, and they had decided to wave all further fees, so these three new pairs would be free!   Double-wow!   I was impressed and, frankly, touched by the empathy, attention, personal concern, and expert service I received from Eyecare Associates.    EA went out of their way and beyond all my expectations to insure a fair and positive experience for me, and I simply cannot recommend them enough!

I was really impressed with Dr. Jackson on this occasion. He took his time explaining everything he was doing and why he was doing it. His explanations and genuine concern went a long way in putting my fears to rest. He not only took an interest in my eye health, but he was also very forthcoming with sharing some possible solutions to other areas of my overall health that could potentially affect my eye health. He offered some possible solutions to help with bouts of vertigo I have been experiencing for a couple of years now. He suggested some things that I could try to help to minimize the severity of the migraine headaches that I have been suffering for more than thirty years. No one else had ever made the suggestions to me that he did. I can't wait to put them into practice to see if they will help even the tiniest little bit. Thanks, Dr. Jackson, for one of the most enjoyable appointments I have ever had. And trust me, I will make sure that you are highly recommended to everyone that I know who needs a good optometrist. Keep up the good work.\n\nHad my yearly exam on February 4, 2015 and must say that it was a very interesting experience. Even though the wait time was a few minutes past my appointment time, I clearly understand why. The doctors spend as much time as needed with each patient and I realize that I will get the same type of treatment when it is my turn. Also, Dr. Harris' staff are extremely kind, considerate, and compassionate. I just love Dr. Harris to death (no offense Dr. Jackson, I love you, too). Even though he informed me that I have cataracts, he took the time to explain all of my options and shared his experiences with his father's surgery. I left the office feeling very good and felt that Dr. Harris had provided me with all the information that I needed to make a decision. Once I made the decision, he even scheduled an appointment for me--talk about the personal touch approach. I would highly recommend Primary Eyecare Associates to anyone. As a matter of fact, my entire family uses Primary Eyecare Associates. So, if you are looking for a good eye care center and optometrist, give them a call, THEY ARE THE BEST I have ever used. KEEP DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2c8b91388603:0x42b2aca4bd0cfa92"}

They are providing me with a new set of frames and lenses with everything in the lenses I wanted except for the polarization without cost; and still will fulfill my original order once the new vendor is acquired.

Staff and Dr. Harris are always nice and professional.  I don't have vision insurance, but price on visit is always reasonable.  Wait time is a little long but I never make an appointment either.  I'm always a \"walk-in\".  The eyeware part is a bit higher on retail prices for contacts so I choose to buy my contacts online.  They are always nice and helpful in providing my written Rx to purchase my contacts elsewhere.  Overall, I would recommend Dr. Harris @ Marx Optical to anyone looking for a good optometrist.......\n\nUpdate : I have officially quit seeing them after  10+ years.  After sitting waiting for almost 3hours with an eye injury,  I felt as though greater concern should have been given to at least administer a triage type exam to assess the situation,  but none was given.  In much pain,  I decided to leave after nearly 3 hours of waiting, since no concern was given.  I don't know if  my doctor knew that an eye injury was waiting,  but if not, his office staff have been poorly trained to deal with medical necessity Vs.  Standard eye exams.  I have seeked out an ophthalmologist and will begin seeing Dr Cain from now on instead of any optometrist office.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862847643db3f51:0x1eb815f284b146b5"}

Would you please send me an email with a good contact number so I can call you to discuss your experience in more detail and offer you a personal apology? If you'd like to talk Dr. Anz as well I know he will be disappointed as well to hear this and want to know how he can improve so we can accomplish a few things.

My direct office number is 334-321-9705 but I'm still deployed to EAMC helping with our Covid-19 response so email will be the quickest way for us to connect.

Rude, refusing service to a person with an appointment. Yelling, rolling eyes, and snatching papers. My five year old knows better than to act that way.

I am very disappointed in my \"very short\" visit with Dr. Rosenstiel and staff. (Well I didn't even meet Dr. Rosenstiel???!) Being that I live in Montgomery, I have to request a day off for ALL my eye appointment visits.  I am not new to UAB Callahan Eye Hospital as I've had multiple surgeries within the last three years there. As a matter of fact I just had an appointment there two weeks ago with the incredible Dr. Priscilla Fowler and staff.   I've been diagnosed with Kerataconus and Dr. Priscilla Fowler is my primary eye doctor.  Dr. Fowler and staff are some of the nicest people I've met in the eye care industry. Earlier this year and this past month I received the Cross-Linking  procedure.  I spent over $6000 within the last three years at Callahan eye.  Dr. Fowler and staff treat me with respect on EVERY visit,  yet on December 10 with Dr. Rosenstiel and staff I felt the lesser of.  This visit was scheduled to replace my old sclera lenses with new.  You would think before my arrival they would've did their research on my condition.  Upon my arrival in the room, Dr. Rosenstiel's nurse asked if I ever had sclera lenses?? (I'VE HAD SCLERA CONTACTS FOR THE LAST 6 YEARS??) From there, he goes straight into and I quote, \"before we even see you, you have to pay X amount of dollars!?. Furthermore, he adds, \"The Lenses will be an additional $XXXX.XX amount of dollars to get them?   Now at this point I was feeling as though they did not want to help me as Dr. Fowler and staff did you for the last couple of years.?  Now do mind you I've already spent thousands of dollars to get my eyes corrected.  The money is not an option, but I felt inferior to his demands.  I also wondered have they even looked in my charts from previous visits.? \"Have they even checked my insurance\" I thought to myself?  At that point I asked him a series of questions in terms of verifying my insurances and deductibles. To no avail he says nothing will be covered. Now as I mentioned money would not be a concern as I've spent a lot of money to fix my Eye disease. ( As well as the removal of an tumor in my eyelid two years prior ).  More questions came to mind in this parlay with Dr. Rosenstiel's nurse.  At this point I felt that the nurse is trying to rush me so he leaves then comes back with a business card and prices on it. He then states, \" if you have any questions please call Melissa\" on the business card. I agreed and proceeded to leave. Upon leaving, I felt very embarrassed to even be there. I rushed out and got in my car. I kept thinking to myself \"have they even check my insurance\". So I called my wife, and she confirmed we do have Eye insurance.  I decided I needed to call them back to confirm and verify with them that I have insurance, the same insurance I've used last three years. Two calls later and one left message, I still have not heard from Melissa, Dr. Rosenstiel , or the male nurse that was talking to me. I never even got to meet Dr. Rosenstiel??? I will still come up to visit Dr. Fowler but I will do my business elsewhere in finding new Sclera lenses!\nVery disappointing!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bea1d7b458b:0x2741eb9855e3054"}

I am a little perplexed at your negative review, regarding our high prices, rude doctor, and limited selection. I have searched our data base and don't see you as a previous patient, or someone having ordered product from us in the past. I have reviewed previous posts from you regarding many other business', and it seems you have a long history of leaving negative reviews. All I ask from you is you actually come in to our clinic and experience it in real life for yourself. We have over 1000 frames on display and many different brands, and our prices are actually lower than competing national chains. At AFO1H we have honest, transparent pricing on 1 and 2 pair eyeglass packages. The pricing is fair and easy to understand. No up-selling or pressure to buy like at the national optical retailers. As for the doctor being rude, please give me the pleasure of actually meeting you in person, before forming your opinions. Regards, Dr. V. Owner/President AFO1H"}, "gmap_id": "0x888bb17e6c59ab19:0xaf44bc1b8331da6c"}

My husband went back with all of our children to see Dr Albert while I waited in the lobby with our baby. Upon completion of the exams, they were kind enough to offer recaps on all of my children so that I was up to speed. All four children had to pick out frames and the staff was SO patient and informative with any questions we had. A huge change from the last optometrist office we had in town. Our last office rushed myself and my children and since we have amazing coverage,\u00a0 pointed us in the direction of frames that were the most expensive instead of helping us look for more kid friendly and durable options. Total game changer with Dothan Optometric Clinic. We were so pleased, my husband and I have already set up our appointments for ourselves and will take all of our children to them from here on out for all their vision needs. I am always nervous trying new doctors and changing locations for care, but this is one that I'm so glad we took that leap. I only wish we had chose these doctors sooner!

I finally was in the back at this point. The assistant that helped me was very nice and patient! I hate the fact that I didn\u2019t get her name but I loved her attitude and how she was willingly trying to help me! I was sent home with antibiotics! The same antibiotics they said they didn\u2019t give after a extraction smh and steroids for my swelling. He also gave me more tabs for pain as if I\u2019m a junky or something or if that was going to make me happy. I\u2019m not going back at all. Thanks but no thanks. On another note!

I came in with 3 of my kids and one of them was my 2 year old son, first time at the dentist, who was nearing the end of potty training and after they finished with him, making his first experience an easy one, and while I was in the back myself, they watched him play on the playground. WELL, he had an accident and peed all the way down the slide and they did not even hesitate! They shut the playground down climbed in that slide and cleaned up the entire thing while I was still in the back! They never once made me feel like it was my fault and they actually blamed it on themselves for giving him water. They are always so sweet and accommodating for me with my 5 kids.

Unfortunately the dentist doesn't seem like he should be working with children. The past two times I have been in,  my son complained of not being numb when they started the procedure and the dentist flat out ignored him.  The first visit (for a pulled tooth) the dentist eventually stopped and gave him another shot, after which he was fine. This 2nd time, we were told we were the ONLY patients in the office, but the dentist seemed inconvenienced to even come in the room,  didn't say 2 words to me and acted in a rush to leave. He started a filling and my son raised his hand and made noises to let him know he could feel it, but the dr kept going and told the nurses \"He's fine.\" Then when my son finally jumped & grabbed his hand, he got aggravated and said to refer us to a pediatric dentist to be sedated. Very rudely made a point to say he wasn't even touching his teeth when he jumped. He didn't even offer to give him another shot or try to comfort him/talk to him about what he was feeling. My son is 11, knows what he can feel & has never had this problem with other dentists. :( I am very disappointed that an office so heavily geared towards children & close to home, has such an impatient & unkind dentist.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889badbf94081c6b:0x4f3c6da5ce8f1c70"}

I\u2019ve worn contacts for over 30 years...never have I been required to do a follow up...until they have me on the hook for $189...oh, it costs $40 to miss an appointment at a place that accepts walk-ins...so never make an appointment with these people.\n*gotcha*\nYou will have to come back in a week or they will withhold your prescription so basically you will lose $100. They know the follow up visit is not something that all Optometrists do, so the follow-up visit seems worth a mention.\nOh, FYI\nThey did not disclose that the contact lenses had to be in your eyes for 4 hrs before they will perform the follow up so you will have plenty of time to kill if you\u2019re an honest person.\n*gotcha*\nthen they dated the prescription the day of the initial visit. So, no bonus for coming all the way back for the follow up. That seems to just justify them charging $70 more than their nearest competitor.\n\nThe staff in the front where the glasses are made were very friendly and helpful. They did a great job on my $313 glasses. I was really impressed with their utilization of the digital system to measure my pupils and adjust my daughter\u2019s glasses so both of us had a great fit.\n\nI expected to pay a premium for the convenience of having the glasses immediately...but the people at the Optometrists practice really go the extra mile to beat out all the convenience.

The ladies at the front desk were lovely, but the man who did my prescreening was awful. He was rude right off the bat. I'm generally a nervous person when it comes to doctors and I like to know what's going on, however when I was asking questions about what he was trying to do to me, he got annoyed and kept trying to rush me into doing things. This automatically put me off, and made me feel unsafe. The puffer  test, for Glaucoma always has made me really nervous, but usually I try my best to get through it. However, I felt so unsafe and uncomfortable in the small room with this man that I was not about to do anything I wasn't comfortable doing to begin with. When it came to doing the eye mapping, he kept getting frustrated because he wasn't getting a good picture and ended up pushing my head pretty hard into the equipment. I wish I would've left at this point, but I figured it was probably just all in my head. He asked if he could hold open my eye, but made no attempt to even put on a glove, and at this point I had 0 trust in the guy. When I went into the exam room, the doctor was condescending. I try to tell doctors that I get anxious around them, and it typically helps the appointment go smoother, but she as well rushed me through everything which made me feel really uncomfortable. She then went to put drops in my eye, because I denied the puffer test and became really mad and threw down her paper towels she was holding when I refused. I know it is an important test, but they didn't try to establish any trust, and made me feel really freaked out and uncomfortable. I figured I don't have to go here again, and will take the test with a doctor who I actually trust, and who treats their patients with kindness.\n\nTo sum it up I will never be going to this location again, nor will I suggest it to anyone. They made me feel uncomfortable and unsafe.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da239f8e191:0xca264ffb151bf5e2"}

Still I didn't learn from them overcharging me from last year, that was partly due to my not so great insurance coverage.  I've been wearing corrective lenses for decades.  This would be my second visit to this office, I was in need of new glasses and my old prescription expired, so I dropped in on my lunch break.  This was one of few places my insurance covered.  The office assistants were nice.  They tried to upsell my dilation but I told the girl that I wanted to keep everything under my insurance coverage.  Everything went fine until I had to wait 45 minutes for Dr. Davis finish her causal conversation with the patient next door. When she finally appeared, she touched base on the astigmatism in my left eye.  I've had an astigmatism in that eye for years and there has yet to be any issues about it.  She said she wanted to try a specific contact lens for that eye, she would order me free trial and that I'm to come back for a follow-up.  She also suggested that I change my disposable contact lens from daily to weekly.  She asked if I slept in them, I said no because I rub my eyes in my sleep and I have symptomatic reactions with allergies which causes severe protein buildup.  She said she will write a prescription for some allergy drops.  I didn't think I needed them because I haven't had an allergic reaction like that in a while. So I thought I would just not get the prescription.  Finally I am about to check-out and the lady at the desk, Sarah, tells me that my final total is over $100.  I only assumed that my copay would be $40. Sarah said that my eye exam \"became a medical visit because the written prescription for the eye drops and the specialized fit for the new contact lens we are ordering.\"  I was blown away.  I had no room in my budget for that.  I know I signed the form understanding there would be extra costs but they should at least TELL me as they are working what costs are to be incurred.  Sarah saw I was distraught and made and additional comment, \"You know, I'm working on getting a coupon for these drops.  I don't know what your co-pay is, but these drops are expensive.  The coupon will make sure you don't pay more than $25. Oh and the follow-up visit is free.\"  Thanks but no thanks, you obviously know what you were doing and got caught.  I don't plan to fill out the unnecessary prescription.  I don't plan to use this office again.  I'll go back to get the rest of my contact prescription and that's it.  No more.  I've been seeing an ophthalmologists for, years under basic insurance and my copay was not over $20, let alone any surprise charges for a non-invasive visit.  My suggestion is to go elsewhere.  A medical office is supposed to take care of their patients, not rob them blind.\n\nUpdate 7/18/2014:  I came back for my follow up for my contact fitting.  This time I was seen by Dr. Bradley.  He asked about the contacts that were given to me, I told them that the left lens was difficult to adjust to because it was thicker than the right lens and that with my new job, I'm looking at a computer more so they dry out faster.  He examined my eyes and found out that it wasn't the computer use that was drying out my eyes.  He said the contact lens material was not working with my body chemistry and that my tears were being repelled from the lens and not being absorbed for normal wear.  He then looked closer at my prescription and said that I didn't have a need for these special lens.  I was doing fine before and this was not a solution to my problem.  He referred me to use a different lens, free of charge, and crossed out Dr. Davis' previous notes in red marker.  I'm so glad there was a second opinion in the same office that could help me out.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da239f8e191:0xca264ffb151bf5e2"}

I'm quite sure this office has someone designated to take care of these orders and to reach out to the customer when there is an issue. The office on Stanton Rd hours are different as stated on the website and is very hard to reach anyone in office.

Not only were they none attentive, but did nothing but rush & try pushing my teenage son to switch from glasses to contacts. Instead of giving a teenager time to think about whether he was comfortable with contacts or wearing them, they insisted on forcing you to pay for a lesson and a contact exam on top of his glasses exam before making a decision. After leaving the first time with a horrible experience, we got a call that his lenses were in after 2 weeks. Then, after calling to make sure they\u2019d have time to complete the service before driving the distance again, we get there to be told they had ordered the wrong lenses for his frame. The frame in which he specifically had with him at his first visit & had taken a picture of with him in them. The employees were unfriendly, unconcerned, and sat there arguing with me about them having more than one frame listed in the system for him as an excuse. Regardless of the fact that his current frames were there with him on his exam visit & they were responsible for making sure they ordered the lenses for that exact frame! They completely disregarded checking the frame model he had with him before ordering the new lenses I paid $362 for, and we were not only out of another long drive for nothing, but ended up being  left without him having his glasses.

I am 60 and have been wearing eyeglasses since I was 13, so I know how to take care of my glasses. A close inspection revealed that the Perry Ellis frames were shrinking over time, placing constant stress on the lens material. I will never buy eyeglasses from Costco again.

I use a different eye doctor so I brought my prescription and my insurance cards in about 10 days ago and everyone was so helpful! The lady at the desk looked up my insurance and told me what my insurance would cover and what I would have to pay out of pocket. She told me someone would come out to help me shortly so I started looking around and I found one pair I liked. Then Darren came and looked around with me. I told him I wanted something unique and he asked me some questions. He found these awesome Oliver Peoples glasses that I probably never would have tried on, but I did and I loved the way the looked on me! Darren really went above and beyond helping me find the perfect glasses and even educated me about my vision and taught me some techniques on how to preserve my vision. So I had two pairs I really liked and a couple different employees came and looked and gave me their opinions. I decided on the Oliver Peoples frames kind of unsure about my decision but everyone told me they looked great. He told me they would take 7-10 business days so I wasn\u2019t expecting them to be ready until midweek next week. But I got a call yesterday and Darren told me my glasses were ready and he remembered me saying I live in Cullman and he told me he spoke with the manager who said she would be in Cullman on Thursday and offered to bring them with her to deliver them to me or they could ship them to my house. I couldn\u2019t wait to get them so I got them yesterday and they are perfect! I love the way they fit me and I have already received so many compliments!

Two weeks went by and my son would complain that they hurt his nose and ears so I stopped in to walmart eyecare center one day when we were shopping and come to find out they had measured him wrong at Meyer, he was fitted for too small of a frame.  I returned to Dr. Meyer's office and they confirmed that he was indeed in too narrow of a frame and reordered him some new glasses and once they came in he was fitted as well as possible.  the technician suggested picking a different frame all together because that frame did not support his facial structure as he has a very flat bridge of his nose. My children are on medicaid and although i understand that only a certain amount of frames are offered to medicaid patients, I would have been more than willing to make a payment plan for the difference if it meant he would be more comfortable in his glasses as these are crucial to his correction of amblyopia if it is going to get better, he HAS got to be comfortable in his glasses so that he will want to wear them. the tech who fitted the new glasses (same frame) noticed that they dont fit his nose well and that they push out on his ears(which would be who he was complaining of sore ears.  It has been over a month and he wears them more regulary but its a struggle everyday putting them on because he simply does not like them. In my opinion as his mother I believe he would be much more comfortable with a frame that truly fits his face that he actually likes and thinks they are cool. I would love to be able to have him re-measured and re-fitted for some more appropriate corrective eyewear.  he is, after all, four years old and that in itself is a challenge with glasses.  we were never offered a band to go arounf the bacl of his head to potentially help hold them in place beter.  I freel like this office is not extremely equipped with frames for little ones and are geared more to high end adult frames.  I've had two different opinions from optometrists that suggested a differnt frame all together, maysome something not metal and instead colored resin so that he would be more excited about them looking \"cool\" instead of just a plain metal frame. both times weve been into the office he is drawn towards the colorful frames and not the metal frames, and I have noticed that these seem quite flimsy and I worry that due to the nose piece and ears not fitting right they may fall off and break while he's participating in everyday four year old activities such as bike riding, skooter riding, and the occsional basketball with his older brother.  If someone could read my feedback and help rectify this problem i would greatly appreciate it, i feel as though the amblyopia is not having a chance to heal in that eye due to the fact they slide down his nose and hes able to see over them, and does NOT like them at all. Thank you for all you do, the staff was spectacular with children I must say, however, maybe the technicians fitting children with the frames need to have a little more continuing education on adolescent frames, proper fits, and have a more enthusiatic approach when helping a child decide which frames are right for him/her. the technician we worked with fitting him picked the frames for him although they were no where remotely close to the ones he loved. thank you for your time, and again I cannot say enough about the technician who assisted with his exam she was nothing short of amazing and the front desk staff is always so courteous and friendly.  thank you again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889243051f62799:0x3b7b351e33debcc6"}

I was using Medicaid to cover the cost of the exam. They checked his eyes and told me that he needs glasses full-time. He was very upset with the news, but we picked out some frames anyway. The selection of Medicaid covered glasses was terrible and cheap looking, so I paid out of pocket for the frames we picked in the amount of $211.00.\nI received a call that his glasses were ready for pickup on 8/5/2016. I took him in to get them fitted to his face and out of curiosity and clarity I asked Dr. Michael Redus, that performed the eye exam, again if they were for full-time wear. He responded yes.\nA day or two went by, my child wore glasses to the first day of school and I started to question if he could see better with the glasses. He said that he could tell no difference. I put the glasses to my eyes and could tell no difference from the way I normally see. I decided to go for a second opinion.\nI took him to Walmart Vision Center on US Hwy 280 and paid for another $70 eye exam out of pocket. That doctor told me that my child did not only have no use for the glasses, but he had 20/20 vision. I have documentation of both visits. One from The Optical shop stating he was prescribed glasses and that it was .075 in each eye. The Walmart one states 20/20 vision with no prescription needed.\nI went back to Optical Shop after my visit with the Dr. at Walmart and brought it to his attention. I was told that they were only for reading when before the Dr. said full-time wear. I told them how awful of them it was to prescribe glasses to a 7 year old child that they don\u2019t even need.

But, my opinion of Dr. Mark Shirey, who is also trying to run for public office - has changed.\n\nDr. Shirey was a savior to me when he helped me with a nearly debilitating ailment. I have photophobia - no I'm not scared of light. It's a diagnosis for high sensitivity to light. Bright light, and all Sun light, are very painful for me. Dr. Shirey gave me the prescription that helped me deal with this while driving, of which I can't describe how grateful I was for this. It was literally life changing.\n\nBut - during my last visit, Dr. Shirey told me that he \"doesn't do that anymore\". He doesn't recognize a diagnosis that's over 100 years old and recognized by all major medical institutions. His excuse was \"ALDOT doesn't recognize it.\", which is not true. Neither ALDOT or ALEA list any diagnosis that they do or don't recognize. The law in the state of Alabama is very clear in this regard.\n\nWhen I got home, I did the research on this. I compiled the information and sent it to Dr. & Mrs. Shirey for review and follow-up. I haven't received anything back from them.\n\nI've dealt with tremendous pain in my life, and live with severe musculoskeletal pain every day. Every day I deal with challenges doing things that most wouldn't have a second thought about. But the pain from bright light is something that stops me from being able to safely operate a vehicle. I have to close one eye and squint the other - all while they're watering. depending on how long I'm exposed, my vision just starts deteriorating - colors start blending/fading.. etc. It's not a pleasant experience when I'm without shaded lenses.\n\nI've been very fortunate to have doctors and specialists that have helped me with a number of things in my life. Doctors that listen to their patients and seek to understand them.\n\nThis is the first time I've felt discriminated for a medical diagnosis. By a Doctor.\n\nI'm sure Dr. Shirey didn't think of it like that, or do it out of spite. But it's still a blow to the quality of life for me. Dr. Shirey, like the rest of us, is human. But, in a position where you're responsible for providing care for and improving the quality of life for your patients, you should never assume, discount or interpret your patients plea as unimportant or conjecture.\n\nI'm the one with the condition, not you. You're responsible for having the knowledge and authority to help me cope with the condition.\n\nI do not take any pleasure in giving a review like this. Especially for a local owned business and a member of our community. But, I also take professional responsibility very seriously - and this was an irresponsible action that negatively affected my quality of life, where I was a patron seeking professional help to improve my quality of life. It was a request well within the realm of service that one would expect from this establishment.\n\nThis is very important as a leader in the community as well. If you want to run for office, don't start by discriminating against your own patients by directly denying them the help you're tasked with and responsible for providing.\n\nI guess it's good practice for becoming a politician...\n\n5 years ago: 5 Stars\nI've visited this office twice and will be back. Both times I was promptly taken care of by the staff. Everyone there was polite and showed great hospitality. They have excellent equipment and are truly capable of providing great vision care.\n\nThanks! =)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb20b61f7d133:0xe258a2eb70da471c"}

Not only is it a waste of resources there's no way it is more sanitary than my own that I wash constantly. They refused to even talk to you or see you until you put their paper mask on so I put it on top of my cloth mask each time.\n\nThe front desk staff has been friendly but I have not had a lot of interaction with them and I'm not sure that I really want to go back.

When you schedule an appointment they tell you if it turns into a medical visit your insurance will not cover it. They preform the same eye exam Walmart on I65 does for $88 with no insurance.  At no point during the visit do they inform the patient they are changing the visit to a medical visit. Only when you are done do you find out that your visit was changed to medical and your insurance doesn't cover that. As I said, SCAM ARTIST. I'm surprised Lenscrafters allows such a company to do business inside thier doors and under thier banner. Myself, I contacted my insurance immediately and informed them of the scam so they can appeal the charges. Hopefully others will read the reviews of this place before becoming the next victim.\n....\nActually my statements were all true. I was never told my appointment was turning into a medical exam.

After paying, I asked again for a trial pair of contacts and they told me that I had been finalized and could not give me a trial pair, as they had a limited supply and those were for \"patients who had to come back.\" She acquiesced and said she would ask the doctor if she could give me a pair.\n\nAfter FORTY-FIVE minutes, she apologized for the wait and told me that she was able to give me a pair of trial contacts, but the right eye was not the correct prescription.

I was recently due for a contact eye exam. Because I had a good experience previously, I chose to return to the office for this procedure. The entire office is clean, bright and friendly. I was brought to the back almost immediately for my exam. The office had both standardized and progressive eye exam tools of technology. The office staff member who had worked with me explained all price upgrades for the exams on each of the machines that was not included. Dr. Moore was professional, informative and thorough. He was patient throughout the exam and took time to explain my current eye health and prescription. He also went above and beyond to explain the contact brand options that would work well with my eyes. After the exam, I was told that Dr. Moore preferred me using trials of the new prescription prior to ordering. I appreciated this long-term because it ensured that I felt comfortable in my new lenses. Since getting to know this office, I will not go anywhere else in Tuscaloosa.

Mr.Dr.McCurdy was very respectful and a very good doctor. My experience with Mrs.Dr.McCurdy, on the other hand was a nightmare. I came in with an eye ulcer and Mr.Dr.McCirdy helped me a lot and asked for a second follow up visit to see how my eye was feeling. When I returned I did not seem him. I saw his wife who works along side him. I was ok with this until she figured out I was a victim of a rare disease. When this became apparent to her, she began pestering me with questions. It ended with her asking \"If you would mind me taking a couple pictures of your eyes?\" I was reluctant but agreed. Instead of using the provided equipment to take professional pictures, she instead took the machine with a light and mirrors and instead of putting her eye to it, she took two pictures with her iPhone 7. I remember it being an iPhone 7 because it stated that it was on the bill right next to the 75$ price tag of each picture she took. After this I did not want to return for my yearly eye exam but I agreed to with the condition I would Mr.Dr.McCurdy instead of Mrs. So when we made the appointment we made it VERY clear we wanted him, not her. Well wouldn't you know it, who do I see when I walk in the door of the doctor's office. She was happily smiling with one of her nurses there. I sat in the chair waiting for the exam to begin. Instead of doing that, she asks the nurse to sit there and stare at my deformed eyes. After a couple minutes, I spoke up and asked if we could start the exam. She agreed and proceeded to put dilating drops in my eyes. When she got down to look she asked if I still had my contacts in. I said yes. She immediately pulls each of them out of my eye and throws them in the trash before I can react. I tell her those were my last contacts and she pulls them out of the trash and puts them in solution. Well we go on with exam even though I should've left right there. We finish and without asking me anything, she reaches to get the contacts and starts to try to put them in my eye. I ask her what she's doing and I explain to her I don't want contacts from the trash. She tries setting me up with a pair of sample contacts, which weren't even fit to my prescription, the equivalent of me putting on reading glasses when I'm legally blind without proper aid. She tells me we'd laugh this off and I left as quickly as possible. It's been three years or so, Mrs.McCurdy. When do I start laughing?", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a0335d9dc6d17:0xd729b4754302373e"}

My vision is so good in them I am shocked. Every interaction with staff from making the appt to the eye exam and testing the health of my eyes was SUPERIOR.

As was the case with last year\u2019s visit to Target Optical, the exam part is the only reason I could give the three stars. My experience LAST YEAR in getting my glasses was a total disaster from start to finish. From being given the wrong glasses which I took home and had to return, to then getting glasses that were marked completely wrong and had the reader part of my bifocals as 75% of my lenses, and beyond.....It was completely subpar in every way. This year I came in knowing that I would not be getting new frames, but may need to get new lenses. I had pre-priced everything on our EyeMed insurance site, and knew within $10-$15 what I would (SHOULD) be paying. Upon talking to the person who tried to help me, I was given an estimate which was over $100 what my insurance told me I am supposed to pay. We went round and round, and ultimately I left without even ordering my lenses. I was also told that even though I wasn\u2019t getting frames, they now have a $25 frame fee to just get lenses.(WHA???) When I got home, my husband and I put in all the information on the eyemed website and again came out with a cost which was over $100 less than what she had quoted me in the store. This experience reminded me that last year, I also had this problem, with upgrades and extras to my prescription being the \u201cdefault\u201d, and me having to beg for things to be taken off in order for me to get to the simple figure that my insurance would pay. WHY would they not start with the most simple lenses and frames and then give me the price to upgrade and add on extras? Why would they immediately start out with the most expensive features my insurance won\u2019t pay for, and force me to navigate removing the features to get what I want? Particularly since from the get-go I said I wanted the basic package for my glasses (plastic, not poly, etc) and was very clear about the cost that I was expecting? I guess I\u2019m old-fashioned, but I still consider an eye exam to be \u201chealthcare\u201d. I\u2019m not looking for a used car salesman in a person who helps me with my healthcare. That is exactly how I would describe the experience with target optical, and how I would describe the experience I had last year as well. The ladies who helped me were very nice, but I could say the same about all the folks who have ever tried to sell me a car. Want to win my 5 stars, Target? Talk with me about what my budget is. Talk with me about my insurance. Start from the ground up in building my package with my eyeglasses. Be honest with me about what is necessary, and what I can live without. I have always had plastic lenses, and because I am an adult who takes care of my glasses, I never have had so much as a scratch. Don\u2019t try to sell me polycarbonate when I tell you that it\u2019s not something I need! I hope you are getting my message here. I don\u2019t leave feedback lightly, and because you are a partner with our insurance we would like to continue to use your store. I\u2019ve given you two chances, and I\u2019m going to go back one more time to try to get lenses for my eyeglasses AT THE COST I EXPECT even though you are charging me an outrageous $25 fee for frames that I am not actually purchasing. You have two strikes. Hopefully you won\u2019t let me down when I go back.\n-Laurie Hill", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886212f944f99d41:0x50c1acb0e1adf057"}

Also, since my employer is so strict on the glasses, they provide me with a free pair every year, but my prescription has to be up to date. The ladies behind the desk refused to give me my exam results because it was against their policy. Basically they didn't want me to take my prescription to a competitor and purchase glasses or contacts. I explained my situation and that I had just spent almost 500 on glasses and contacts (and thats additional to insurance paying 150 toward my frames) with them. Didn't matter. I walked to the back and grabbed the optometrist. He gave me my prescription so I could take it to work.

Just click on each review and notice how the commenter says similar things for different locations of this branch out in muscle shoals and Madison.\nBut thank you \u201cowners\u201d (management) for replying to your own employee to toot your own horn and make yourself look like a half decent medical establishment.

I have written a previous review concerning the immense amount of professionalism and care that the doctors and personnel provide; but once again, they have exceeded my expectations of their care. From the minute you walk into the door, you notice the constant upgrades that the facility is experiencing due to them becoming a part of Family Eye Care. This demonstrates that they wish to be on the leading edge of optical care with new equipment and a welcoming patient waiting area. I was welcomed by Cindy and Paige at the reception desk with a pleasant smile and greeting (unlike some medical practices that basically show that you are bothering them by requesting assistance); you will not see this here!\nThe wait time was incredibly short and I was escorted back to the back with questions of my day and further concerns of my wellbeing. Once I was in the examination room, I was greeted by Melissa and Dr. Mary-Kate Moring. They both intently listened to my eye concerns and took attentive time ensuring that my eyes were examined and explained any problems or developments with by contacts and vision. I didn\u2019t feel a bit like I was rushed out of the office by \u201cwriting off\u201d any questions or concerns; this gave me confidence once again that they really do care.\nAfter my exam, Melissa took as much time AS I NEEDED to ensure that I fully understood how to place and remove my contacts, as well as care of them. They also supplied any contact lens products that would assist me while I was getting used to the care and wear of them. While talking to Melissa, I told her that I recommended them to a family that needed eye care, but they probably could not afford eye care. She informed me that they work with the needs of many families when it comes to eye care, and they fully understand the hesitation of families to seek eye care due to finical needs. She continued to tell many that they have many eye care packages to assist those families in need of eye care; when comes to vision, cost should not be a factor. Again, this demonstrates a deep concern for an individual\u2019s eye care needs.\nOnce again, this visit amazed me! They really do care when it comes to my vision and eye care. It is ironic in the fact that they are becoming a part of Family Eye Care; each visit leads me to believe that not only do they care for me and my families\u2019 eye care, but now I can say that they are now a part of my Family.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1493320622796, "text": "We so appreciate you taking time to review us once again!

They were supposed to be shipped to me so I called them and reminded them (They told me they would take care of it and apologized). At this point, I thought \"No big deal. Accidents happen.\" Another 3ish days go by and I didn't get a UPS tracking number so I called again (They told me that the glasses were still there and they would send it out that day, apologizing again). I started to get frustrated at this point. After all of this, I finally got an email saying my package has shipped. Too bad they sent it to my parents' address in town. At this point, I got fed up with the incompetence so I asked my parents to send them to me on their own. At least I knew it would get taken care of. To top it all off, they refused to refund me the shipping. I guess I'll be refusing to continue my business with them if they dont care about correcting their mistakes.\n\nI highly recommend not going to this location for anything other than an eye exam.

My insurance requires them to use a VSP lab and the VSP lab has extremely poor quality control. For example, on June 14th I ordered glasses and paid over $500. Glasses arrived 4 weeks later but the lab messed up the order and they were sent back. Glasses arrived again on July 16th and were sent back because lab messed up again.
