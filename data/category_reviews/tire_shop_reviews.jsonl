Since my initial visit to the McGee rd service facility back in December,  which did an excellent job, I have had 2 bad experiences.  1st bad experience was with my wife's car. She had the oil changed at the eastern blvd facility.  Approximately 1 week later her car's check engine light came on and the fault was for dirty oil. She had the oil checked at a local change facility and it was a quart low. They did another oil change, and I have the filter from that change and it is not as clean a filter as you think from 1 week previous. I had also gotten my oil changed in my truck a few days after she did at the eastern Blvd facility.  So I decided to take a look at my oil and filter. The filter on my truck had an install date written on it from the McGee Rd facility of 12/9/19. The date I first got Express to change it. They supposedly changed my oil and filter on 2/7/20 at McGee rd. I will also attach a pic of the filter . Needless to say this is a very bad way to run a business.  Engine damage from dirty oil is very significant possibility from these action.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO43eqZAxl6i36R5mIsoxQpWPbaVCPg79nGVXA2=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1582925050257, "text": "Hi there, Ernest.

They were over priced compared to other dealers, and the service department is terrible. For instance, I had my oil changed and they did an inspection that is routine. They gave me the sheet showing everything they had checked, to include the tread on my tires. A couple of weeks after this inspection and maintenance my tire almost blew out. It was in terrible condition for some unknown reason with no blame attributed to them because yeah it happens. They told me they could have me a new tire in 24 hrs. So, I agreed. They also added that it would be in my best interest to replace all four tires because the rest of them were in such terrible condition as well. Now, why would they have checked the tread on my tires less than two weeks prior and marked them good if they were in terrible condition?? So, I obliged and told them I would just order four new tires. But, I also told them I wanted to keep the old ones just in case I needed a spare. When I came back to pick up my car it did have new tires. I asked where I could pick up the old ones because my fiance at the time told me to keep them, and they assured me that I didn't want them. One guy, I'm guessing the supervisor, even included that his wife wouldn't be driving around on tires in that bad of shape. So, lesson learned: they will try and take advantage of you in any way they can when it comes to getting the most money out of you. I left without my old tires and to top it all off they even charged me a recycling fee for them after I told them I wanted to keep them. I went back not too long ago and the service was just the same. My AC had went out on this same car. Long story short, they charged me a diagnostic fee and couldn't even tell me exactly what was wrong, but worse case scenario I was looking at $2000 worth of repairs. So, after the tire incident I went elsewhere and got a second opinion. They took less time and narrowed the issue down to a relay problem. But, told me worse case scenario $1500. So, again they are over priced. I ended up trading my car in at a dealership in Bay minette and I couldn't be happier. I purchased the extended warranty on the rogue with them, and it served no purpose. It ran out at 100,000 miles and every issue i had either wasn't covered  or started at 104,000 miles. Another lesson learned. I will not shop with them again, or use their service department for anything to include routine maintenance. I don't recommend them to anyone. Of course this is just my opinion of them from what I experienced.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889aca479d1fc0cd:0x50e17575c246f828"}

I brought my car back and then they said the tires were  separating on the inside, so I paid 367 for four brand new tires. Replacing the tires only helped the car drive smoother but the problem was now worse! So I brought my car back today and now there saying that the back tires are the cause of the front tires shifting and that wasn't something they could fix, I would have to take it to the dealership. The guy said he could try to align the front to see if that would help but it made the issue even worse then when I had initially brought the car in. I am now sitting here after closing hours so they can set my alignment back to were it was. I just feel like if they were unable to repair the car in the first place then they should've said so instead of me coming out of 446 dollars for no reason. I asked if I could a refund for the alignment and the guy said that he wouldn't be able to refund me, would have to wait until next call and ask for a refund or he could credited as two free oil changes which is not acceptable for my inconvenience", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889293c0a719e971:0x35d4a5b6c0bf8d4a"}

Oh and the tech had the nerve to say that he could use my Ford lug nuts, but that would put more work on him. With that being said, they put their lug nuts on my vehicle for their convenience not my satisfaction. But I did get back my perfectly good Ford lug nuts for husband to put back on when we get home.

We do our best to advise our customers on where they can go to get their worn out studs replaced.  We can even order this $2 part for you at Auto Zone.  What's great about our tires is every one is air tested before it arrives in Tuscaloosa and then we check it again in a dunking tank before we put it on your car.  I know how easy it is to run over debris in Tuscaloosa with all the construction.  We have done 35 repairs in a single day before!  That is why we offer a 30 day warranty on all tires.  Even if you run over something!  Whenever you have a problem please call the manager and I assure you all your tire problems will be solved."}, "gmap_id": "0x888602828bda0125:0x232396317e317641"}

When I got there and tell them the problem they took the tire off and said my valve stem was bad and charged me $20 to replace the valve stem. I thought all was good, woke up Tuesday morning it was flat again. I called & spoke to Chris who told me that it was more than likely a cracked rim and there was nothing he could do about it. Today...FRIDAY, I took off work to take my car to Fortners. They first told me that the tire was the wrong size. Then when they got it off the rim they showed me 4 plugs where the tire had been repaired 4 times, previously. For $30 I got an almost perfect Firestone tire, that was the right size with alot of tread.

There were only two employees working at the time an I guess they got overwhelmed because more people were in need of service; mind you I was the first customer an they should have been working on my car, but the guy kept stopping to help other people that had pulled up. So finally I had enough an asked the guy to please finish with my car, because I had to go rest before getting on the road (at that time I had been there close to 2 hours). So he did, an I was on my way. We made it through Montgomery without any problems, an then I was awaken by a loud noise, screeching tire sounds, and the sight of my front driver tire rolling away parallel to my truck, heading towards the grassy median. By the grace of God we were not hurt. The inside of the rim was shredded, the bolts were gone, the studs ate up. All this was caused by the a negligent employee that didn't properly tighten the bolts to secure the tire. I spoke with the owner about getting help, but none was offered, an he even tried placing the blame somewhere else. But I will never give Chris Tires anymore of my money/business nor will I recommend them to anyone. I spent over $600 to have my car fixed.

I gave them the verbal to proceed and they called back an hour and half later to tell me that their original diagnosis was incorrect and that they found the problem.  A beach mouse/rodent chewed the fuel line to one of the cylinders and the bill would be $136 parts and labor.

When we got to our destination we noticed the wheel cover wasn't on the tire he had changed. We called and they said they didn't have it there. I drove by to ask them if they had found it yet and they said it must have fallen off when we were driving. My boyfriend says he remembers the cover not being put back on, but he was in such a hurry that it didn't really register. I think maybe it was broken or lost there and someone didn't want to be responsible. They're cheap covers though, and I would not have been mad. I just feel like they should have offered some sort of compensation or a discount on my next tire or something because I was obviously disgruntled about the situation. The only way my cover would have fallen off would be if it wasn't put back on right. I wasn't accusatory or abrasive when I went to see if they had found it.

Doug and one of his workmates took the tire off and had it fixed within 15-20 minutes. They made sure all our tires were aired and ready to roll again.

Hands down they are the absolute best, and in my case saved the day, and what would have been a long cold night on the side of I65. Thank you Gary and D&D, I owe you guys breakfast next time I'm up that way. AAA doesn't hold a candle to D&D 10/10 would not hesitate to use them again or recommend them to anyone, anytime.\nJohn  B Porter\nSysAdmin\nAirbus Americas Inc\nMobile Engineering  Center", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1607988253337, "text": "Thank you so much!

But they have to do their part and Landers was a BIG FAIL! I needed 2 new wheels and tires, and despite telling them to go ahead and upcharge me for overnight delivery, they ordered replacement wheels with normal delivery... and when the wheels arrived, they had ordered the wrong wheels! But the most egregious act was promising to call me and then closing up shop and not calling me and notifying me of their mistake, and keeping my car over the weekend with no notification. Ultimately took my car to the dealership and they did in less than 36 hours what Landers could not do in a week. NEVER, EVER AGAIN! ----- Response to Owner's Reply: Potential customers here should be advised - The owner misrepresents the facts in this matter. I was the one who contacted them on Friday morning (car had been delivered Monday afternoon from Walmart because replacement wheels for that vehicle were not in their supply chain - not because Walmart \"was not good enough\" per the business owners implication) and was told by Shannon (co-owner) that my wheels were in Oxford per the tracking label. I then questioned that \"if the tracking info shows the wheels still in Oxford, they probably would not be delivered today\". She then stated \"No, they are out for delivery\". Now comes the most salient point - I then requested that she call me THAT DAY (Friday) to 1) to let me know when the wheels came in and 2) to let me know when I may expect to pick my car up that evening, or if not, when I may expect it. I never received a phone call, and when I went to their business to check on my car at 4:30pm, they had closed early (Their hours of operation state 8:30am - 5:00pm). I think the lesson for potential customers in this from both my experience and the owners acerbic response to a critical but legitimate review is simply this - \"CAVEAT EMPTOR\" (\"Let the buyer beware\").", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1582216660786, "text": "Sorry that you feel this way, but let's start out with the truth. You were called Friday and you were informed the wheels hadn't arrived and I told you it would be Monday. I also explained the whole overnight thing with you and you were fine with it. And I ordered the correct wheels, but unfortunately they sent me the wrong ones. I told you I would get the right ones in, but that was not good enough for you sir. You had your car at Wal-Mart before you called me and they were not good enough for you either. In fact that's why you had the car towed in to me. I can only hope that you didn't talk to them like you did me. We do not live in a perfect world , and all I can do is treat you with respect and try to help you the in the best way I can.

Editing my review from last year because at the time I said \"Don't expect a shiny showroom floor with fancy tire displays and brochures.  The office is full of tires--it's a small shop and not much room to store them anywhere else I suppose.\"  This is no longer true.  They remodeled the interior of their shop, moved the tires somewhere else and really cleaned the place up.  Definitely more inviting inside.  Don't want anyone to be put off by my original review stating that the office was crowded and full of tires--it's now clean, shiny and even features a few tire displays.\n\nWhat you can always expect is great prices, friendly, and prompt service.  It's a mom and pop type shop, which appeals to me vs the big chains.  Also, since they are not a big chain, they are hardly ever busy.  It's rarely taken more than a few minutes for anything I've had done there--four new tires mounted and balanced and out the door in the time it would take most tire shops to even get your car on a lift.\n\nYou won't beat their price on the tires or installation.

I went with the discount tires, because the last set I got from a Mavis ( trussville AL) lasted a decent amount of time mileage wise.\nHere is my list of grievances\n1. About two weeks later, I noticed one of the lug nuts was almost falling off. One round and it would have been off on the ground .This infuriates me even more, because I specifically instructed the technician to make sure I could get the lugs off with a regular lug wrench, as I do my own tire rotation and oil change every 5-7.5k. Three of the lugs were so tight I had to stand on the hands. Again, one was falling off, three were almost impossible to remove.\n2. of course I got talked into the 89$ alignment\n3. Its not my vehicle ( wife ), so it took me a couple of weeks to notice the bad vibration at 70mph, so back to the shop to get tires re balanced, which I already pay 75$ for. I did not go back to the Mavis because I don't trust them. They couldn't even tighten my lugs\n4. When I get to the new tire place, I find out that all of my tires are set to 41 psi. 41!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Now the tires are cupping, which means they will need to be replaced soon.\n5. One of the tires was out of balance\n\nThey were super quick to get an alignment and do it, but they couldn't even get my lugs on and get the tire pressure right?\nThis place is an embarrassment.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1591476660676, "text": "We apologize, Phillip, We at Mavis believe you deserve nothing short of the best.

I ordered the 3rd set of tires down the list that were recommended for my vehicle (2017 Ford Transit 250), Michelin Defender T+H. I work 6-7 days a week as a contractor so Sunday was really my only option to get tires on my work vehicle. I arrived early for my appointment, confirmed my appointment, and confirmed the tires with the employee behind the sales counter. I confirmed that the tires I ordered will be the best fit for my vehicle with the employee and he said they will be great for it. So my wife picked me up and we went about our day. I received a phone call at 11:18 informing me the tires are installed on my vehicle but they\u2019re not going to work then proceeded to tell me they can order the correct tires for it but they won\u2019t be here till Tuesday July 21st. I explained I can\u2019t just leave my vehicle up there not working for 2 days, and asked if they can just put my old tires back on the van. The employee responded with yes but we will have to charge you for mount and balance, my only request was to install the tires with the best tread on the rear which he agreed to. I received a second call at 4:10 stating my vehicle was ready but that they close at 5 and needed to be there before 5 to pick it up. I arrived paid the clerk $75.96, received my keys, walked out to my truck to find my tires low, tire light on and the rear tires (almost bald) on the passenger side and the front tires (still had a good amount of tread on them) on the drivers side which was not what I asked. I asked if they could add some air to my tires and get my tire light to turn off. They did add air to my tires but when I asked about the tire light the manager had to stop putting Alabama stickers on his truck brought a computer tpms sensor out and showed me very quickly the tire pressure was fine and told me this would be expected with used tires... My tire light never went off like he said it would. Today is July 29th and I have yet to receive a phone call stating my tires have arrived or a update. I emailed Mavis corporate on July 23rd and have not received a response or anything. Never once did anyone apologize for the inconvenience that this mishap caused me that was clearly Mavis Tires fault and caused me to pay for their mistake. I at no point complained or expressed any frustration to the employees there because I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. I don\u2019t ever leave bad reviews for businesses because I know what that can do to a business, but I did want to take a minute and send you a email about my experience. I ended up purchasing a set of tires from Discount Tires on Hwy 280 and it was a great experience. I called them in the morning they called me as soon as the tires arrived, and installed them the same day in less then 1 hour after leaving my vehicle with them. Upon arrival there was no tire light on and the tires had the proper amount of air in them. I hope this email helps in one way or form, I\u2019m not complaining but just find it hard to understand why Mavis Discount tire would charge a customer any amount of money for a issue/mistake on their end.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1596119205061, "text": "We're sorry, Nick Lions. we apologize your appointment time was not honored.

I was told to come back that Saturday; May 2nd so that a mechanic can look at it. I went that Saturday and had the lights repaired. That same Saturday night my entire driver side taillight went out. I knew they were closed Sunday but I called just in case I could leave a voicemail to give them a heads up about me coming in on Monday; May 4th regarding the taillight. May 4th they tried to repair the issue however ALL of my lights started malfunctioning. They tell me to come back that Wednesday; May 6th so that their mechanic can look at it. They gave me a work order stating that they are working on diagnosing the problem in case I got pulled over for no brake lights, reverse lights, headlights or turn signal. They proceeded to pull my vehicle through the shop and when I got inside it I noticed an airbag sensor that was not there before. I asked John if he could have it cleared out and he said that he would have the mechanic do it on Wednesday and that it should be no problem. I then attempted to turn my AC on (which was on while they were working on it but John said that he had turned it off) but the AC wouldn't come on. I get out of my vehicle and ask John if he could have the code cleared because I felt that it was messing with the operation of my AC and it's been 90\u00b0 lately. John then tells another employee named Skyler to come clear the code however the code does not clear. During this time the owner comes and introduces himself and asked me and another customer if we were being tended to, the other customer stated that he was already tended to then I stated that I was being tended to and pointed to my vehicle. The owner then leaves to never return again. They then proceeded to turn the vehicle off in hopes of resetting it however at that point the vehicle would no longer start. John then told me that I needed to leave and that I could return Wednesday to have their mechanic look at it but at this point, I had no dash lights, interior lights, exterior lights, no AC, no radio, no power steering, and sensors going off. The vehicle would no longer start up. I started to get upset, John claims I brought my vehicle in like that which is 100% untrue, I drove it in with no issues other than the driver taillight but I was unable to drive it away. I defended myself and vehicle over that statement then John pulled their doors closed while several employees including a manager/ assistant manager watched. I ended up having to call the police (because I had no clue what else I could or should do). The shop then claimed that I had a bad battery and that was the result of all of this however when they put a brand new battery in there it did NOT fix all the problems, the vehicle did start up and it did have headlights but that was it. After me refusing to tow my vehicle away and almost 2 hours later Mitch (I believe the manager or assistant manager) then offered to let the vehicle stay and have their mechanic look at it on Wednesday May 6th. May 6th, I went to go pick up my vehicle and John was working the front desk, they tried to hand me my keys in the lot hoping I would just leave immediately but when I asked for a full detail work order on what all had been done to my vehicle, I received attitude and was told that I should be happy that they fixed it for free and that they don't document all the work that's done on vehicles. I sat up there until I received a work order (over 30mins later) but when I received the \"work order\" it stated, \"gave customer a battery and replaced 10 fuse\". I told the mechanic that that was not a detailed work order but I was told that was all I was going to get. I do not believe that they would have fixed the damages their employee, John, caused to my vehicle if I did not have 4years of documentation from the one and only other mechanic I've been to, video footage from my own vehicle and computer readings from my Vivint smart security proving the condition of my vehicle.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e9b414671032d:0x29e4a24dd6f16484"}

They fixed it as fast as possible while ensuring everything was done correctly so that we could be on the road as soon as possible. I would highly recommend them to anyone!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8887c8caf953d153:0x7ef27ddf85dd16c4"}

Also my power steering fluid was extremely low and my coolant level was low. once again drove off and noticed oil burning. I couldn't come right back but came back a few days later and it was the plug gasket. So either it wasn't checked when the oil was drained or the tightest plug too tight. Once again even left after gasket replace and car is still burning oil. Now it smokes too.

He asked multiple times if it was ready, was told only 20 more mins, then 30...well 2 hours after the said time he left. We had plans at 11am, so those didn't happen WHICH could have been planned for-like loading up my kids (one being a newborn) in the car and picking him up. No apologies for the extra wait time and never honest about how long it was going to take.\nCome that following week, SURPRISE, there was an oil leak on the garage floor AND the check engine light was back on. So we took it back once again. He was told that it was just old oil coming out and it was fine and that some other piece needed to be replaced for the check engine light. Like why wasn't this fixed the first time!? Unless we got super unlucky and something went wrong within the 3/4 day time.\n\nWell now it's about 4 months later and there's still oil spots on the floor!\nSo we called today, I got a so-so person on the phone and was told to bring it back in, no \"oh my goodness! That's not what we like to hear..please bring it back in!\" It was just \"bring it back\".\n\n1st, can we make the comparison on the comment from Ashton Morgan below?? This was the SAME day, the SAME time and my husband remembers talking and waiting with Ashton.\nWe aren't very knowledgable on car repairs and we should've gotten a 2nd opinion(the Garage in Pelham is literally walking distance and everyone always has great things to say about them, but this was just for a cheap oil change-never again!) ..but we just had a baby and didn't have much spare time or sleep to decide these things with a clear mind.\n\nI just reccomend going somewhere else for piece of mind EVEN for an oil change, even if this was just a random bad day (which look at the rating-use your brains people! We didn't and now we're paying for it with our time and now a nasty driveway and garage floor) for the people working on cars, there has yet to be a verbal apology-and now if we get one it will just seem forced.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1463972408579, "text": "Dear Jennifer,\nMy name is Rick and I am the owner of Precision Tune Auto Care of Pelham.

It was a very welcomed change from the experience I'd had at another local shop I'd been referred to (but later warned about from several other past customers) where I repeatedly had to endure rudeness from the know-it-all mechanic, immediate breakdowns from same issue I'd just paid to have repaired, & ignored voicemails asking to speak to the owner. Guthrie's owner followed-up the very next day to make sure everything was going well with the work on my car. I would much rather pay for a job well done the first time than a little less and keep breaking down, having my car towed, finding another way to work at the last minute to keep my job, and then constantly being talked down to in person & over the phone (while the owner justifies it as him \"being from New York\",... to which I reminded them both that he's now n ALABAMA, & that cocky attitude won't do here, especially with me!!... 3 different types of repairs... never fixed after being told they were!).

The person was condescending and spoke to me like I didn\u2019t have a clue. After I explained I had cleared the repairs with the first person and we had emailed the parts needed, this new person demanded to see the email. I retrieved the email and the reply was \u2018wow, that was an expensive part\u2019 and told me I needed more parts. I left the store because further conversation was not going to improve the situation. The next day I called the store and spoke with the original front person.

With the late open and the trashy appearance I should have left as these are signs of poor management. They took custody of my vehicle for the remainder of the day, of which I had to call them at closing time to see if there was an update, they were unaware of the status and had to call me back. When I heard back from them they said it was done and we agreed I would pick up the following morning, when I arrived they indicated half of the things I asked to be done weren't done and they can not do them (rear dif & and tire service). I was not charged for the items but now I need to make another service appointment elsewhere.\n\nSeparately, one of the Technicians blocked my wife and kids in while they were dropping me off.

I bought my 2011 Chevy Malibu here to get my headlight replaced. If you are familiar with cars, you would know its not easy to do this, for the front bumper almost needs to come off. Before being serviced here, I talked to 3 men who told me they would be able to fix my headlight and to go get the bulb so it could be serviced. After buying this bulb, i came back to this business and parked in their garage. One of the men started working on it immediately. I was satisfied until i noticed he kept walking away and coming back, so i sat in my car. After this, I notice all the employees are gone. My car still not fixed, its passing an hour now. I go looking for everyone and the employees are sitting there eating and watching TV. I say \"Um, are you going to finish what you were doing?\" He doesn't answer, someone speaks up for him saying \"Well he's on lunch break\" , I go back to my car .Another 20 minutes pass and im still sitting in my car. Guy comes back and says \"I cant do it\"... These people 1. Assured me they could replace my headlight before he even started taking my car apart, 2. Disappear and go on a \"lunch break\" with my bumper half off and never notify me, and 3. Had me sitting there for OVER an hour and I end up leaving discouraged. Please find out who owns this business.

The vibration was not in the steering wheel but the chassis. It felt like a u-joint to me so I proceeded slowly at 25mph to try and locate help. I pulled into the A-1 Tire Sale & Service Goodyear dealer and asked if they could repair my vehicle and what I thought it was. They said they would look at it and see if the could. After some time the mechanic returned to get the Service Writer and they exited and soon she returned to let me know that what was wrong was both front wheel bearings were bad  and my idler arm and bracket were worn out. I asked how much to fix ans was quoted $446.00. I asked was u-joint bad ?\"no it OK \" I was told. I asked to see my vehicle and when I spun the wheels I herd no noise, when I checked for play by lifting up on tire I noticed none. Then moving tire side to side I felt no play in the Idler arm. Now mind you anything can break at ant time, but I had my vehicle in the shop last week for a tie rod end and front end alignment by men I have trusted for years. So I refused the repairs and for my vehicle to be taken off the lift. The mechanic then came over to where we were, I then asked him \"you didn't find anything wrong with the u-joint? NO was his answer. As he backed the vehicle off the lift a loud ping could be heard, like that you here when you have a bad u-joint. I then drove to another shop recommended by my son-in-law, and when their mechanic walked under the vehicle he could see the u-joint was bad with out touching it.\nU-joint was repaired and $70.00 later I was on the road with no vibration.    So before I let A-1 Tire do any work on my vehicle I would recommend you take it to a honest shop to determine what is really wrong.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892955dfe266a9d:0x660c350c5bf1fd5e"}

I must've ran over something because my inflation light came on and when I pulled off, it was nearly flat.  At almost 5pm on a Friday.  These guys are very near the highway so I kinda limped the van along to their shop after finding it on Google.  Knowing nothing of this town, I won't lie, appearances made me a bit nervous.  There were no strobe lights, electronic signs, or LED TV's.  No tires set up to convince you that you needed that model.  But this place was a gem, and I'm so fortunate and lucky that I stumbled on it.  They didn't have a tire for my van, so the owner himself drove across town to get one, in what I know was work hour traffic (because I was soon back in it).  You know these guys wanted to go home for the day, but they balanced my tire and pulled it together after their posted hours.  He could've charged ten times what he did, for after hours, or having to pick up a tire, or for my clear lack of knowledge and na\u00efvet\u00e9, but he gave me a total price MUCH cheaper than the price I bought those tires for during a scheduled appointment at another place.  Made it safely home with little wait time, with my two littles.  While I was there I saw a couple guys stop in that clearly knew the owner/place, and I realized..... this type of place is the one, if you find it, you go there the rest of your life.  It's a bummer when your car breaks down and usually a surprise expense, but these guys aren't going to rip you off - they'll do the right thing.  I don't live in this town, don't know anybody there to refer personally, and unless that happens again, I'll probably never go there again, but he still did the right thing.

This is not my first Hyundai since reinventing itself and blowing our minds. Needless to say I purchased what is now my 5th Hyundai.  However, i'm here to brag on the man who walked my husband and I through this entire process in this humid Alabama weather.  Initially, I came in to take advantage of the $50 GIFT CARD that Hyundai was offering for simply test driving its vehicles, but I also knew that I would potentially be driving off the lot with something new as well. Brandon Blagg was awesome from the gate. He stood and walked over to me, invited me to his desk, and inquired concerning my business. A few questions later, a copy of my license, and \"BAM\" we were test driving a base model Santa Fe.' One would think that this guy designed these vehicle with his level of knowledge concerning them. Recalling that I have own several vehicles in my lifetime, it is feasible to understand that we have dealt with our share of sales consultants. This is by far the first person who not only informed us of what we would potentially enjoy about the vehicle, but patiently explained in detail its benefits, and demonstrated  to us its functionality. He took a base model vehicle and literally painted a picture that lifted it beyond it's level. He hung out with us for over an hour doing comparisons and contrasts. He was honest concerning pro and cons, but never negative.. not one time. For him every vehicle had its benefits, and for every person there was vehicle that fit them. THIS IS WHAT HE DID! He didn't interfere with our choice, but he made sure that we would be satisfied once we left  the lot for good. In the end we ended up purchasing a Santa Fe' SEL 2.4 engine with both the Convenience and Premium Package. He didn't use a hustler tactic to cause us to go for a higher grade, it was simply his transparency and patience that ultimately led to our selection. Recalling that this was in 90 + degree weather, this man didn't stop until the tires shined.  He made me laugh, shared stories, explained who was whom of the CEO vs. COO, and also wasn't shy around me whatsoever. He even blew bubble gum bubbles for our delightful 6 year old who stood amazed at the excellence his gum blowing abilities. Brandon Blagg, job well done. You deserve all that's coming for your hard work and dedication to service. Aside from our direct experience with Brandon, everyone rocked. Their pleasantness was superb, two of the women conversed with me, they offered treats to my babies, and others smiled and waved. There wasn't a rude attitude in the building. The lobby and bathrooms are well designed and clean. As lengthly a process that car buying could be, they have enough going for themselves to make you relax and enjoy your time.\n\nThanks Again, Tae A.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b128e81df3f:0x8980930b2c0cfffb"}

I test drove the vehicle on a Monday and pointed out a few cosmetic issues that I feel should have been addressed prior to placing the car up for sale (only a few hundred dollars to correct).  That combined with the manager coming outside to talk to me smoking a cigarette, should have clued me in to the professionalism and pride taken at the dealership.\nI was asked that if the problems I pointed out were corrected,  would I purchase the car? I agreed.  The following day I recieved the bill of sale and I noticed that the price shown on the internet was not the price shown on the bill of sale. When I asked the manager, the explanation I recieved was that the car was headed to auction the day I saw it and the price on the internet was the auction price, not the sale price (what does that have to do with me? And the price I came intending to pay is the price that I saw advertised ).  I was then told that they would sell it to me at the internet price but I would have to pay for the repairs which would be $400+.  Since the price was still under book value,  I agreed.  I was then told that the car would be repaired, HAND WAXED and ready for me in a couple days.  I was informed Friday that the car was ready. I drove up Saturday only to find the car just as dirty as it was when I test drove it on Monday(they sprayed the dirt off but there was still hair and dirt on the inside of the car.... wheel wells were dirty, etc). Of all the cars I've bought,  no one has ever tried to delivered me a dirty car! I discussed this with the manager who appeared to care nothing about it.  I left with no intention of buying the car,  but the salesman,\nMr. Willie, called and said that he would take care of it...... he took it to a local shop and had it washed and vacuumed.  As a customer, when money is spent, whether it be $30 or $30,000, you want to feel good about spending it. That's not the feeling I left with.

And if you do, please, make sure you ask them to print and show you any TSB's (Technical Service Bulletin) on the vehicle you are considering.

However, I can almost promise you that they will not make the repairs before selling you the vehicle. I purchased a used 2007 Hyundai Entourage van from Jim Burke Hyundai's used car dealership in March this year after having purchased a new Elantra from them last year. I did not make them show me the TSB's because I wasn't aware of them at the time. Unfortunately there are several of them on the van I purchased. One of them had to do with a part that causes called the \"Junction Box Switch\" or Instrument Panel Module that causes the battery to discharge. That means when you go out to your car it simply won't start!! I found the TSB on it and it says in large print that it was issued to all Hyundai General Managers and that the repair should be made before retail sale of the van. Many of us believe that purchasing a used car from what you think is a reputable dealership will protect you from these type issues. Well...this dealership is not reputable and should be put out of business. I have contacted them to give them a change to try and make this right to keep customers happy and try to get return business but they obviously are not intersted in this.

I normally avoid chain stores like Firestone because I know they try to scam people, but it was my last option to get my car examined.  I was helped by a woman I think was named Sabrina, and she fed me the biggest scam I've heard with my car, I don't think she realized I knew more about cars than she probably did.  She told me the tires were done and needed to be replaced NOW, the air filters needed replaced NOW, the battery was dead and needs replaced NOW, and the radiator needed to be flushed - and they'd conveniently do all of this for me at a hefty premium.  I was silently laughing at myself because two of my tires had 20K miles left on them (yes the other two need replacing soon), my air filters were replaced 8 months ago, my battery was brand new (I took it to auto zone AND advanced auto parts and they showed me the readings and the charge was fantastic, they laughed at Firestone for trying to pull one over on me), my radiator was also flushed within the last year.  I finally called her out on the battery and she looked me right in the eye and had the immoral audacity to say the battery was still worthless.  These are common things places like Firestone try to trick people into having repaired, because most people don't have the knowledge to know any better.  It was funny because they didn't even identify the things that were wrong with my car that I knew about.  They checked off that both headlights were working great, even though I knew and verified that one of the front headlights was dead... did they really even look my car over or just pretend to then hand me an appraisal for all the \"broken\" items I needed to have them fix now?  If you do not know much about cars, do not trust Firestone, they will sense your naivete and pull a fast one on you.  Always get a second opinion from a more reputable garage shop (I prefer privately owned places that rely on their honesty for business).  This just reaffirms the longstanding distrust I've had for places like Firestone, avoid them if you care about your money and your vehicle's longevity.  This visit was a total scam and employees like the one I dealt with do not belong in a customer service position.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889164cb1f7e4bf:0x4ed3bd94504e471a"}

Update (3-19-18) - When I picked up the truck from commercial van it was very dirty and there were little pieces of bed-liner plastic stuck all over the truck. It looked like over-spray, but they came off when I wiped them, thinking that this wouldn't be a problem I took the truck home (that was my big mistake). I didn't notice the paint chips until after I went home and washed all the little pieces of over-spray plastic off. There are 2 chips next to the drivers side Z71 emblem a gouge in the clear coat right above the drivers side tail light and 2 large chips in the clear coat between the bed and cab on the passengers side. All of these are in the immediate area around where they were working.  I also found a scuff where something rubbery with grit on it was dragged across my passenger rear door and had to use buffing compound to get it off. If you have work done there you need to stay and watch them, because as with any auto shop damage done will never be \"their\" fault.  Troy the owner called me this morning and asked if I was the one that wrote the bad review of his business. When I told him yes I wrote it he said that review is unnecessary and that I had planned to scam him from the start. When I got tired of listening to his accusations I hung up on him. He then calls me back and leaves a message telling me I was extremely unprofessional and I was no longer welcome at his business. As the owner of a business that relies on good experiences with customers it is HIS job to be the professional. And the professional thing to do would have been to ask me to bring it back so they could look at the damage instead of accusing me of being a scammer. All I was going to ask for was some touch up paint so I could fix it myself, but all I got was hostility and accusations. My father is going to get a bed-liner done on his truck, but he will not be using Commercial Van Specialists in Loxley. Troy and his \"business\" will never get another dime of my money, nor will they get any business from any of my family and friends.  When I give someone money to work on my vehicle I expect them to treat it and me with respect, but these people fall terribly terribly short.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a6e8131eab6fb:0xa40d31008c34e55a"}

I went in on Tuesday 12/18 because my car was running hot. Tammy was nice enough to give me a ride home while I waited. Firstly my car was not correctly diagnosed I spent over 500$ here and still having the same issue. When I picked it up drove toward Wal-Mart it immediately got hot so the looked at it again right before closing then i leave again same thing finally I park in publix to let it cool down. Again in the morning I take it back. Again they check it send me on my way 30 minutes later car hot again. I call and was pretty much brushed off and was told that they fixed what they thought was the problem. So as of right now I've been charged all this money car still running hot n they acting like it's cool I came in with 1 problem which has still not to be resolved. I will I'm so disappointed I travel alot for work and I'm in Alabama all alone no family I came here expecting a1 service seeing that it's connected to a napa but to spend this type of money and my issue not be fixed I'm so disappointed.

Wish I could give them no stars. I called and asked for 2 tires for my car, they gave me the total price for both being installed for $155.16 before taxes. I told them let's do it and to order the tires. They called me back a few hours later telling me the tires were in. I drove 30 minutes down 280 for the tires. I pulled up and they told me they would get me right in and taken cared of. I went inside for a few minutes and saw my car was up on the lift, I waited for about 15-20 minutes and noticed my car was out of the shop, so I asked them if it was finished, and waited and waited and waited, and after talking to three different people it turned out they didn't do anything to the car at all. They just pulled it into the shop lifted it up, and then lowered it and pulled it out, and never relayed the information about why they did this. When I finally got someone to talk to the guys, they said that they didn't have the tires I ordered, and I told them that they had called me and told me they did and that I have a voicemail from them stating that they did, and I played the voicemail for them, and then talked to the guy directly that left me the voicemail. So, they go and look and turns out they do have the tires after all. They pull my car back in and put the tires on, then ring me up for $211.00, and I'm like, \"I'm not paying that\", then I have to talk to the manager that's \"running\" the shop, and finally after 3 hours I get the price they told me, thank goodness I had the voicemail from them for proof, and I got out. Never. Going. Back. Maybe the most unprofessional atmosphere and experience I've ever had with a business. Truly disappointing in every way. They were also very rude to the other customers that were waiting patiently as well. They would blatantly ignore you when you'd approach them with a question about your vehicle or the situation they were putting you in. Just straight up walk past you and not say a word to you or look you in the eyes. If and when they finally did talk to you, they just mumbled their words and you couldn't understand a thing they were saying. They need to clean house, get rid of the manager and all. If not that, then just do the entire state of Alabama a favor and close up shop completely, because you're not doing any good for anyone. Like, you're not even doing your jobs, like at all. Since I left, I've actually been wondering \"what's even the point of this shop\"? The guys are all just hanging out. Finally the guy that did put the tires on my car was just some dude, that wasn't even in a uniform like the rest of the automotive crew was. He was just in some shirt and ball cap with sun glasses, so I'd at least like to thank the random guy that probably doesn't even work there that actually did the work. Maybe he was an angel or something....? If it turns out he is an actual angel and it's some kind of real miracle, it's still not worth going back for.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889166b0910fbb5:0x6f7e7664c9e1abdf"}

I walked in and shook the guys hand being very friendly and told him I was looking for somebody to do a front end alignment on my truck. The guy walked out from behind the desk and called an older man who was in the garage. The man walked in and told me it would be a little over an hour before he could get to it so I would have to wait. I told him that I would have to come back later as I have a ton of homework for my college classes to get done and the guy got so mad. He said, \"I don't really want to fool with you anyways. If you don't have time to wait an hour then you don't have time to get an alignment so just go somewhere else\" and then he walked back into the shop and slammed the door behind him. Apparently he was the owner.\n\nI kept my cool the entire time because I understand that work can be stressful, but that is absolutely no way to run a business or treat your customers.

One of the bolts, I had to stand and jump on the breaker bar to loosen it....come on guys, I don't even want to think about what that was torqued to...\nYall made me think my trusty impact wrench was failing me\nAnd they charged me for tire disposal, even though I took the all-season tires that was taken off back with me... but thats a story for another time.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1586715400581, "text": "Hello Sanghoon, we are sorry to hear about this issue after tire service and would be happy to help.

Started to buy the tires and then realized that the tires had a warranty because they were not that old. So I call and tell them to cancel putting new tires on it. I take it to get the Goodyear warranty honored. Then find out there is NOT any metal showing through the tires and the tires still have mileage.

Purchased a used vehicle from this dealership in May of 2020. I was sold when I was told that my vehicle had an Auto Nation warranty of \"90 days or 4,000 miles.\" Sounds great doesn't it? Well after being hurried along in signing paperwork so the vehicle could be mine I was very happy with my purchase. However, less than a month later, and still well within my \"warranty\" coverage period I got a Christmas tree of lights on my dashboard. I was told to take it to its dealership and from there I could then make the claim. When I called to make the claim, Auto Nation's warranty service said there was no vehicle with my VIN in the system. I then called the manager there who told me, \"I never signed any contract stating I had a warranty and it doesn't matter what I was told because it isn't in writing.\" I realized the manager was right about this however, I was being told one thing then they intentionally rushed me through signing paperwork so that I wouldn't catch that I never signed anything for my \"warranty\". The deceptive methods of these people shows that they are talented at one thing and, one thing only and, that is lying to people. These people are clearly slimy and cannot be trusted, save yourself the hassle and do not purchase a vehicle from here. Learn from my mistake, don't come here.

For the amount of work and parts I was happy with price. They called about half way through our week long trip to give us an update and the shop owner stated he would have it done before we got back or worst case senario, the day we got back. He also stated he thought it would be a bit cheaper, about $950, well that's great. No problem there! So the day we got home he called and said the car was finished and that he was able to do all the work for $860!!! He very well could have charged me the $1000 and I would have gladly payed.

I went in back in April because I needed new brake pads and rotors. After waiting about 5 hours for them to install, it was finally done. About a month or 2 later, my vehicle starts to squeal anytime I apply my brakes. I took it into Goodyear at the beginning of October as the sound was getting unbearable. They checked my brakes and said that the rotors were cheap and needed to be fixed. They suggested me to take my vehicle back to fix the shorty work Mavis did to get warranty work as Mavis said I had a \u201cwarranty\u201d. The next day October 3 I took it into Mavis. Sure enough after looking at my car for 30 minutes my calipers were hanging down. I waited another 4 hours for them to put 2 calipers on. Why I paid them another 400 dollars is beyond me. As I was leaving there parking lot my vehicle was squealing when I applied the brakes but it seemed to be better. About a week ago, I noticed my vehicle started to shake and when I backed up it sounded like I had a flat tire. At this point I know I was intentionally being conned out of over 800 dollars from Mavis tire. I take my vehicle to pep boys on Sunday.\n\nMy calipers were loose again. They didn\u2019t tighten the damn bolts on the calipers. One caliper bolt was gone. The other one was about to be gone. Could have caused a huge accident. This is a terrible place of business. Eugene has no integrity in my opinion. I want to get my money back.\n\nI called customer service today talked to an answering service. Customer service never called me back. Please avoid this place at every cost.\n\nI have tried to send the picture of the receipt to the gentleman's phone. He asked me to take a picture and text him...

We left and the tire pressure sensor was still on so we brought it back and waited 30 mins for them to try to fix it and they said it was fixed and would go off after we drove it 10 miles.

I went to Ford initially and they told me new tires would $1000. I thought \u201csurely I can do better than that at Sam\u2019s.\u201d\n\nWrong. I may have gotten tire and install for $600, but these mechanics DID NOT KNOW AND DID NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES to take the two-piece locking lug nuts from my Ford. Here are the things that transpired:\n1. First visit, didn\u2019t have but one type of tire in the size I needed. I was told to go home and order some from the website. Great, that\u2019s fine with me.\n2. Tires purchased from website did not fit my car DESPITE me typing the year, make, and model of my car onto their tire bank. Told to order another set.\n3. Order second set of tires from online, go to store to have them put on. I hang out in the store for THREE HOURS while they\u2019re \u201creplacing my tires.\u201d I finally get fed up of waiting and ask why it\u2019s taking so long, only to be told THEY HAVEN\u2019T BEEN ABLE TO GET THE LUG NUTS OFF OF MY CAR. Why wasn\u2019t I CALLED or PAGED while I sat in the store after 30 minutes of trying. I get told I need to purchase new lug nuts.\n4. $100 and 20 lug nuts later I\u2019m back at Sam\u2019s. At this point I have already paid for the tires, install, and a complete set of lug nuts ($700). Once again I go sit on the patio furniture for what I suspect to be an hour while they replace tires. 1.5 hours later I\u2019m starting to get concerned again. I go back to the tire center to see what\u2019s up, and what do you know. One tire is off and they\u2019re SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS AT THE LOCKING LUG NUTS AGAIN. The mechanic proceeds to tell me that I need to go to ANOTHER TIRE STORE TO GET THEM TO CHANGE THE LUG NUTS TO THE ONES I PURCHASED. I drive across town to a tire place where they replace my lug nuts in a matter of minutes. $10.\n5. Now back to Sam\u2019s at 6:45 (tire place closes at 7:00, but the guy swears he\u2019s going to get it done today because of the trouble I\u2019ve gone through). He decides to take his dear sweet time finding an outlet to plug his phone in and check his text messages, because that\u2019s clearly vital in order to change my tires. I arrived initially at 3:00, and my tires are still not done at 7:15.\n\nI have spent, in its entirety, MORE than a work day getting my tires replaced, which when you consider costs, etc. was MORE EXPENSIVE than spending $1000 to get the dealership to replace my tires.\n\nMoral of the story: I WILL NOT be back to this location to get my tires changed ever. \u201cSave\u201d your money and go somewhere else where the mechanics are better equipped, more knowledgeable, and less lazy.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891ed491ad040b:0x41d575c1389f55e6"}

Learned I needed the outer tie rod ends done, among a couple of other things. So I shopped around for cheaper prices and came across Midas in Hoover, AL. Took my vehicle to have the radiator and outer tie rod ends replaced/repaired and an alignment done on January 29, 2015. A week ago or so I noticed something was off with the ride of my vehicle. It would pull and had a slipping feel when turning and braking and just driving in general. It worsened and I felt I shouldn\u2019t be driving it. I started thinking I needed to take it back to Midas because something wasn\u2019t right with the steering and suspension (which they\u2019d \u201crepaired\u201d). On February 23, 2015, I cranked the car up to leave work and the steering wheel loosened and turned far right on its own. Called AAA to have my baby towed. The AAA guy instantly diagnosed it and said the tie rod wasn\u2019t done right. The pin wasn\u2019t inserted in the tie rod end. We found the bolt that came off in the parking lot.\n\nAll three AAA guys diagnosed the problem and confirmed about Midas improperly installing the outer tie rod ends. One even said that could be a lawsuit and Midas would eat the cost. Had I drove home, that could have been my life on the road. My baby was towed home on a flatbed and then towed straight to Midas the next morning on February 24, 2015. I was not confident in Midas working on my CRV again. Especially since they didn\u2019t do the job right the first time and it had to be done again. And on top of that, the same technician from the first time ended up working on my car this time around. They apologized and claimed the part was defective. I seriously doubt that. This was completely their fault. Point blank.\n\nAnd to top it all off, that same technician (initials TT, according to my invoice, I believe) that worked on my car both times and drove it out afterwards, stole $20 from my ashtray compartment. He reached down and picked something up off the floor and got out of my car while putting something in his pocket. We caught it before leaving and went back to confront the guy, a short white male that looked to be in his 30s maybe; thick southern drawl. They compensated my stolen possession\u2026with the exact money he stole from my vehicle -- minutes before. We made a little scene about it. It\u2019s the principle of the matter. I usually take my stuff out of my car when having it worked on or having it in the care of someone else. But I failed to completely take all my significant possessions out\u2026like my frikin\u2019 gas money left in the ashtray. Another technician informed us that that wasn\u2019t the first time something like that happened around there and that \u2018we didn\u2019t hear that from him\u2019.\n\nSo not only does Midas not properly repair parts on a car, they also search it and steal possessions. I\u2019m not confident in the repairing of their wrongdoing. I\u2019m wondering if something else might go wrong. Their credibility is shot with me. I actually feel I should be refunded the cost for labor, if not the whole amount. And since it was a \"defective part,\" they should refund me the cost for parts since the problem had to be fixed (and hopefully it actually is, this time and nothing else goes wrong from them working on it). I will be going to the home office about this. I will reach out to corporate about this. I will review the hell out of this Midas location. A situation like mine was potentially life-threatening and a definite lawsuit waiting to happen. They will not be getting my business.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1424964016387, "text": "Hey there, thanks so much for sharing this with us. Very sorry to hear about your experience.

I usually get depressed when my car gets sick because RARELY do I walk away without spending a grand. But this visit was very pleasant. The customer service man asked me what was wrong with my vehicle, then asked me for the key. He went out and took my car for a test drive, then onto the rack. I waited in the lobby waiting area for a very brief time and then he came back. He told me I had a couple of options. Option one included replacing brake rotors and option two, pads only. I took the less expensive option two because money was tight. My total bill was HALF of what I assumed it would be. At JacMac, the difference is simple. They don't seem to want to drain your checking account like other places around Tuscaloosa who want to bill you no less than 1000 dollars every time you walk in the door. And I really like that he OFFERED me the different options. Most places dont do that. They make you ASK for less expensive options then say, welllllll, but, if you do that then this will happen, etc.\nI think I just found \"my mechanic.\"", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1600105344536, "text": "We're glad we were able to offer you the service you needed, Brooks!

We almost made the deal twice. After making our down payment and payment requirements very clear, the sales persons involved went to get approval. When they returned, the vehicle had been discounted, but they added a \"fee.\" That's the only thing he would say, \"a fee.\" They were trying to deliberately be vauge and, in our opinion, dishonest. After discussing their \"fee,\" we never actually achieved full disclosure. We were told the vehicle was at a different dealership within our city and we could go there to finalize the deal. They said that they would call ahead and we should just go over there. Our credit had already been run multiple times, and we had received approval from the credit company. With this in mind, we went to the other dealership location. As we arrived at the other location, they hadn't been given all the details as we had been led to believe. So the process began again, running in circles of double talk and running our credit again... We left at closing time and expected a phone call the next day to complete the deal... That has yet to happen days later. I used to have great respect for Greenway Automotive. It appears that Greenway has only taken over these dealerships at face value, and the same crooks that were already in place are still running things just like they always have.

It was running fine, but I wanted to get it checked out before it could develop into something worse. It was throwing a catalytic converter code and the mechanics told me that they could get it fixed by replacing two engine valve cover gaskets. While they had it they also replaced two oxygen sensors and two spark plug coils. The grand total came out to $850 but I was satisfied to just get it fixed. The same day that I picked it up I was heading up to Auburn for a football game. I had been driving it for around 2 hours since I had given them my money when the engine made a loud pop, smoke poured out of the hood, and the truck shut off while I was driving down the interstate. I managed to pull off to the side of the road and come to a stop. After letting it cool for a while, I tried to restart the truck but it was completely shot. I always get my oil changed regularly, but I did check the dipstick and it had an appropriate amount of oil. I of course then called Riviera and explained what had happened, expecting them to arrange a  tow back to the shop since they had had it there less than 3 hours ago. Unfortunately, they told me that they could not possibly have done anything that would have caused that, and they would not cover the price of a tow or diagnosing of what had went wrong. This left me stranded on the interstate where I had to call and pay for a different towing company to give the truck a tow to a local mechanic as well as a rental car to get me to Auburn. The next day the mechanic gives me a call letting me know that the engine was completely shot and that the only options were to either scrap it or put a new used engine in for $3700. I called Riviera and told them the news and once again they told me that nothing they could have done would have caused that and that they could not help me. Since then, I have called trying to arrange a meeting with the owner/operator of Riviera to discuss what has happened and what our options will be moving forward. I have been told that I am unable to have a sit down meeting with him and whatever I need to say can be taken care of over the telephone. Basically, they have offered zero help or willingness to see what happened and if one of their guys caused it. I have gotten several second opinions from local mechanics as to what could have caused this and they have all said that it would be extremely rare for a 2005 engine to just blow up with absolutely no indication beforehand and with plenty of oil. They all also agreed that it would be the responsibility of Riviera to at least tow it back to the shop, pull out the engine, and determine what went wrong and if they had caused it. One told me about a similar situation that had happened at his shop, so he got it towed back, pulled out the engine, and found that one of his guys had dropped a wrench in the engine, causing the failure. So he took care of it and ordered a used engine for the customer and installed it at no charge since they had clearly made the mistake. I have had no other option, so I am currently in the process of taking the management at Riviera to court in hopes to get some compensation for the $850 service that I payed, the $3700 engine replacement, along with the rental car and towing charges that I have had to pay.\n\nThe bottom line is, pay the money to take your vehicle to a better quality mechanic shop that actually has a reputation they must live up to to avoid a situation like this!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1548081275748, "text": "Hi Tom, thank you for your review.

They also informed us that there was a significant amount of sludge in your oil pan that happens over time, not immediately. We are sorry that this incident happened & it is very unfortunate, but the repair facility where your vehicle was towed advised us that it was a fluke & nothing we did caused the engine failure."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a0546a9d7dc7f:0x6967ea0471410581"}

I write this review after driving an hour and a half to do business with them.  First off all, they do more than trucks.  30 inch rims for your car they do it, headlights, taillights, lifts, flares, tonneau covers, etc... if you want it they can get it.  There prices are hard to beat.  But let me talk about what sets them apart from everyone besides their exceptional pricing.  From the moment you walk in you are treated with respect and that they are glad to see you there.  They listen very intently to what you want whether in person or on the phone.  This is missed by so many other places.  They go through getting prices as well as can show you options.  They do this to make sure you get exactly what you want for the best price.  While doing so they take notes on the conversation to ensure they don't have to ask you several times because they forgot.  Making sure they stay on top of it and making everything move flawless.  The business is very well maintained and the showroom is definitely a showroom, not just a display, spotless.  Respect and honesty is projected so loudly by the staff, you will feel like its your own family that runs the business.  I can't say enough about this because I have been there a few times for different purchases and  the entire staff is friendly as well as great to interact with.  As I return to them next week to make another purchase, driving an hour and a half versus using the internet, I know I am meeting people who are like family, getting the best price, the right part, quality parts, but also the best service that I have seen in the state.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bfdfe2467e0eb:0xd5c2a691b573b7bb"}

Usually I go to one of the big name stores but they had what I needed in the price range.  About $640 for 4 new tires and getting them mounted and balanced.\n\nOverall everyone seemed nice enough, but it took a little over 4 hours to get those put on.  What I was assuming would be a 1-2hr job took half of my day.  Several vehicles came in and left while I was waiting, the individual mounting the tires even kept getting pulled away to put air in other people's tires.\n\nDon't get me wrong if you're just buying tires they can get them for a decent price.  But if you need them put on, I would go somewhere else.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1584263129512, "text": "Ernest sorry to hear that you had a bad experience shopping with us.

Let me start off by saying im unsure of my internal repairs. Diagnosis was great. He knew what it was... but when i got my car back and took it on a trip to florida I almost didnt make it back. 3 out of 8 of my coil packs where so lose they could have came off. They also did work on my chain guides and tensioners. 2300$ worth of work. The car jumped timing and had to be towed back.\n\nUpdate. They did honor their warranty and repaired the work that was done. They got it done quickly. The only guy that gave me a little issue was the front desk guy. But the owner stood by his word. And I respect that. Their are 2 reasons this is not 5 star. And one is the mechanic did not care enough to check what was throwing the new codes. P2004 and P2005. And what i mean by that was just eye balling it to see if it was anything obvious. But it was very simple. The wiring harness in the back was not clipped back into its holder and was blocking the control arms of the actuator from moving properly. Cleared codes and issue is fixed.\nThe 2nd thing is where my coils were in fact not replaced but the boots were replaced instead of the actual coil packs. It was way cheaper for me to just order all new preformance MSD coil packs (that come with new boots) . If anyone would like to buy my coil boots please hit me up. They are barely used and i have no need for rubber coil boots.\n\nOver all glad to have my Mustang GT back.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c271a9ac65253:0xcca215749ddbacb2"}

I haven\u2019t heard another thing by phone or email from management. I don\u2019t really expect to at this point. Just wanted to update so others would not think all of these issues were resolved.\n\nI have used this location for more than 10 years to service my cars and buy tires.  They bought my loyalty by fixing a flat before I was a customer. Today, they have lost me as a customer. One of my daughters took her car in for the managers special oil change which includes a tire rotation. They did not do this service. This is the second car in a month that they did not rotate the tires when getting the oil changed. The tires for both were purchased at this store. Last month, sending my oldest daughter to get her oil changed, not only did they not rotate the tires, they tried to charge her for the high mileage synthetic oil change when she ordered the managers special when setting the appointment in the app. She only gave her information. When she picked up her car, the charge was over $60 for the upgraded service. When her father questioned why so much, they said the app doesn\u2019t tell them which oil to use and they just have to make a judgment call. When he told them that I usually take care of this and to put in my information, they came back and apologized, issued a credit for the price difference, and gave us a free oil change. After what happened today, I no longer trust them to service my cars. I feel my daughter\u2019s were taken advantage of and have warned them that this is what they face as young women. Also, as this is a corporate owned store, I will no longer recommend Pep Boys or trust any Pep Boys location with my vehicles.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1617918643223, "text": "We\u2019re sorry you had less than a 5 star experience.

Maybe I\u2019m just used to the awesome service I\u2019ve received the past 15 years from the fantastic guys in Crisshaven Drive at Express. Unfortunately my husband has been driving my car lately and he didn\u2019t get by there. However, I did receive my car as promised within the hour. I did feel really bad for a lady and her daughter that was told it would be an hour for two tires to be put on and she stated she had already been there longer than an hour when we arrived. I recommended she remind the manager that her car was still in the parking lot and Leland did go get her car and take it into one of the empty bays. I stood at the window and watched as my oil was being changed. I\u2019m not sure the guy that changed my oil was very knowledgeable with tools. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll know soon if he was or not. There was a lot of cell phone action going on with employees and one employee actually let the phone continue to ring up front as he went and found a charger (in the back) for his phone. I will definitely return to my safe place in Birmingham that is fast, efficient, honest and clean. I gave a four star review because Leland said it would take an hour when we arrived and we were out within an hour. But seriously you should be informed of this online when making an appointment. One thing I noticed as did the other lady and we both did not like... I have a 2019 car and when they finally came outside with my paperwork they WROTE (using a ball point pen) on the HOOD of my car. If my paint is scratched I\u2019m going to be one mad lady! I guess I was raised that you don\u2019t mess with other people\u2019s property like that especially if it can damage. Noticed the guys in the back did the same thing (on the other side of my hood) when they were done. Ugh. Not ok with this new car owner.

I know it's all to protect them from liability suits. What ever happened to trust, recommendations, honest opinions? Every answer to every question seemed will rehearsed. Two days later my alternator goes out! Maybe a coincidence, but it seems like everyone I put my trust in the professionals, things start going wrong with my car. Don't trust mechanics, lawyers, maintenance individuals, had one of them tell me, \"if we fix it too well, we'll be out of a job, always have to leave something for another day.\" There's no real honest people in this area, not anymore. Bureaucrats have got their fingers into everything. Law suits are the \"American Way!\" So you can't really blame them to avoid taking responsibility for their actions. I know what my part costs, they were going to charge me nearly $500 in labor to loosen and tighten bout 6 bolts? A little extreme, they did an estimate but I never got to see it, I asked to see the defective part, but was given the excuse we would have to put it back on the lift. Since it wasn't on the lift, they had no plans to fix it!\n\nAllen from Phenix Firestone called, his only concern was why I was so critical of him. I thought that was clear, but this was the second time I took this vehicle there for the same issue, the first time I was told nothing was wrong with it. In any case in order to resolve the problem Allen stated, \"we're not working in your cars anymore!\" I guess I hurt his feelings?\n\nI used to love taking a vehicle to Phenix Firestone, always felt like they were looking out for me, always trusted them! Now I get the feeling I'm unimportant, it's really changed over the years!\n\nEnough said hope you all have a great holiday I'll be home fixing my cars!

I dropped my 2005 Nissan Titian off to have some recall work completed, diagnostics ran, O2 sensors replaced and an oil change.

I woke up in the morning and the car was not there. I talked it over with my roommate and we agreed i should call the police. Long story short, I tried calling Nissan to let them know the situation. I left several messages, tried calling my appointed service tech, sent an email and even had a conversation with the online chat. This happened Wednesday night- Thursday. I finally received a response, via email, stating my truck was finished. Total cost was just over $300.00. The recall work was covered, the cost was for the rental. All of the work I requested to have completed was not finished. The invoice didn't even reflect my request, the issues my truck is having or why I brought to them.

You left our shop and purchased a used tire and then had us install it. The next day you came back and stated you were still hearing the same noise. Chris drove the car again and indicated that the used tire was no good. We even moved the used tire to the back to make sure the noise followed the tire, which it did.\n\nOur team did exactly what was asked of us and provided you with an honest assessment of what your vehicle needed.

However, all I can think of is how my singular bad experience may help someone avoid spending thousands of dollars on an issue. I recently took my vehicle in because it was not running properly. The called me back stating \u201cwe think we know the issue because our technician had a car like this once and this is how he fixed it\u201d. That statement should never come from your mechanic. There is TOO MUCH technology available today for mechanics to be guessing. Even if the mechanic knows emphatically what the problem is based on their experience, they can confirm with technology. But, I needed the car so I asked how much this would cost, he said \u201c$450 and this does not guarantee a fix, this is just where we need to start...\u201d I asked if I\u2019d get a refund on anything that was done and did not fix my issue, he replied with no. I asked if codes were generated and he replied with yes and told me what they were. I declined service, paid for an oil change that was needed and for the diagnostics fee. Googled the code, watched a video on how to diagnose the code, ordered the part on Amazon(18$) and repaired it myself in less than 1 hour including diagnosis.

Tyler told me that it would take an hour and a half to get the tire there, but that once they had it, it could be put on very quickly.\n\nTyler had the delivery of the tire expedited for us, because we mentioned that we had to get up north by a set time.  The entire visit took about 45 minutes, including the delivery of the tire.\n\nThank you so much, Tyler Thurmond, for your exceptional customer service.

Here is what happened.  Called got a verbal quote of $139-189 per axle for a brake job with rotor's turned which is fair they are just below the dealer which was $200 per axle.  Went the next day to have services done to my car.  Before they began work they inspected it and determine I needed pads all the way and rotor's on the rear and a brake fluid exchange.  Estimate price was over $700.  I declined the brake fluid exchange and they offered some \"competitive\" discounts brought my total down to about $580.  Still more than it should be.  Asked for a printed estimate when I saw the estimate I knew something was up.  They had part numbers and prices on the estimate.  Quick Google search confirmed the part numbers and prices from a local part supply store that they would be getting the parts from.  They are marking up parts pricing 100+%.  Industry standard is between 10-25%.  Then they told me that the estimate was nearly at cost and if he went any lower he would lose his job.  Nothing but scam and scare tactics were used with me and I didn't take the bait.  Tried to email the address on the general managers card it wouldn't ever go through.  Called the corporate office gave them the info and the pictures I have attached here and they said a regional manager would get back with me still have not heard from that person either.

The last straw was when the manager promised to take in both of our vehicles in one day.

When we came to pick up the first car, the same manager acted like we had two heads and told us he couldn't service our second vehicle since they were too busy. It really irritates me when people make promises they can't keep. When we explained why we were upset, we just got brushed off and told to have a nice day.

We were out of state visiting Alabama when the transmission went out on my SUV.  I didn\u2019t know my transmission was bad or about to kick the bucket.  We called around to several nearby shops but no one seemed to have time to take us in.  We were traveling with our three young kids and the situation was getting grim.  We eventually made it around to calling Bodiford\u2019s Automotive Service.  Frank Bodiford attempted to remedy the situation while on the phone. However, all attempts to get out of first/second or go in reverse didn\u2019t work.  I tried putting an additive from AutoZone in the transmission but it was a no go (mind you I am not a car guy).  Mr. Bodiford agreed to look at the vehicle.  It took about 30 minutes to arrive because we could not go over 10-20 mph.  It was late on a Friday and he obviously had other vehicles to repair, which I know now is a testament to his service and crew.  We basically were at his mercy.\n\nMr. Bodiford immediately took in our vehicle.  His staff ensured we felt like family.  They put on a movie for the kids and made us comfortable as possible.  Although, I was sweating bullets because I figured we were about to get taken advantage of given our urgent situation.  I began searching online for transmission replacement cost, estimated repairs, solenoid issues, etc. and was shell shocked at the prices.  It became apparent we needed transmission work immediately or was not getting very far.  Mr. Bodiford soon emerged and confirmed our fears.  We were weighing our options about how to get back home, getting the vehicle serviced, paying for the diagnostics, paying Frank for the time he took to service the vehicle, etc.  It seemed a bad situation was just getting worse; I was ready to just pay up, get a rental, and be done with the situation.  Mr. Bodiford provided us with all the information needed to help get us situated.  To my surprise they were able to get the vehicle into reverse and the transmission was at least operable.  Apparently, they disengaged the transmission safe mode and used an additive the actually worked.  I stood there with credit card in hand and Mr. Bodiford declined.  He serviced the vehicle as much as he could at the last minute and we were ripe for the taking; however, he wouldn\u2019t take a penny.  I stood there in disbelief and was extremely grateful.  I was thinking about the bad publicity some mechanic shops get and here Mr. Bodiford stood just as concerned, courteous, and empathetic to our situation as if we were his family.  We departed Bodiford's Automotive and traded in the vehicle that evening.  We didn\u2019t want to press our luck with trying to drive home.  Although we took a hit on the trade-in value because of the transmission, we were just elated with Mr. Bodiford and his crew.  Hopefully I do not have any repair needs in the immediate future since I now have a newer vehicle but if so, I am taking it to Mr. Bodiford.  Enough cannot be said when you deal with good people.

A new water pump was installed, but didn't last 100 miles. I returned the vehicle only to have the auto shop refuse to replace the water pump free of charge. I removed the water pump that weekend to find they cross threaded the new water pump and warped the unit. No wonder it did not function properly. After re-tapping a couple of screws and several hours out of my Saturday I replaced the new pump myself. Now I am out the price of another water pump, thanks a lot.\n\nMany people do not know this, but each repair job has an attached amount of time associated with it. So, if an auto center changes your brakes in 30 min but the book says it takes 1.5 hours, then the shop charges you for the extra hour as an extra rake. Now, I do not mind paying the extra as long as the quality matches. This shop may do quick work, but it is not at the quality I am paying for. Poor value given, and they would not make it right either. Basically the repair guy did not remove all the necessary components (like a radiator) to save some time and shoved the water pump in at an angle.\n\nI will never use them again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888c4e6e0b99431:0x62babd6da353f44f"}

They fixed both and stuck to fair estimate.\n\nI wouldn't do business with them now after my last experience.\n\nMonth 1 & 2\nOur car needed a new engine. The shop owner wanted to get an engine from his supplying junkyard. He missed one that became available. This process took about 2 weeks before we decided to find an engine ourselves which he was not happy with but agreed to. He said they could have it put in within a 3 day period. The engine company we bought from needed it done in 10 days for warranty purposes. Griffith used all of the 10 days to because other cars came in front of me while we had to wait on engine. They finally got it in and started but had to send to dealership because the car went into anti-theft mode and wouldn't start. We had to actually arrange the drop off to the dealership ourselves. I feel like we were running his business for him because he was almost never there. The employees even mentioned that problem in passing.\n\nMonth 3\nWe become worried after not hearing anything from dealership or Griffin for about 2.5ish weeks. I had to contact dealership for them to tell me that they told Griffin that the car needed a major fuse panel that could be $1200+. I called Griffin to tell him I approved the install because we really needed the car. It's month 3 folks!\n\nIs it Month 4? Getting close anyway.\nWe had to go ourselves to the dealership to confront them about not getting to our car. This should be Griffin's job. The dealership says that the part didn't fix the problem. Car still doesn't work. We decide to give up because the car needed another part for $2400 to \"maybe\" fix. We decide to just give up. Dealership is trying to get more money from us even though they didn't fix the problem. Griffin is trying to put that on us. We said we would pay for his time, but does this seem fair? Griffin himself might be a knowledgable mechanic, but he is a rookie business owner with no organization or management skills of his people.  He wasted a huge amount of our time (3+months), money ($6000+) and stressed my wife and I to no end. We are going to have to scrap our car with a new engine that doesn't run.\n\nThey do good oil changes and put a muffler on another car we brought, but he also made me pay for the part up front which shows bad business to me as well.\n\n* FINAL RESULT\npaid griffin $1400 because the car ended up not working out. He said he made no money and it would have been $2000 if it had worked + whatever it would be to charge AC. When we walked in to pay he didn't even recognize us. My wife and I talked to this guy several times in person and on phone. The waiting area had mice running around too FYI if you are scared of them. After that we went to the dealer shop that had our car and basically gave it to the tech working on it. he paid for the dealer work and gave us a little cash. When we went to clean the car out I noticed that the driver seat leather looked very dirty and worn. Griffin said he was sorry.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888c4e6e0b99431:0x62babd6da353f44f"}

One of my tires was entirely too low (pressure at 15 when should be at 35, all other tires were only at 30).  Any knowledgeable technician would have removed my tire to check for a leak, but he insisted the tire was fine.  After filling the tires & resetting, the tire pressure light was still on.  He told me not to worry and to \"be careful\" with that tire--incredibly vague.  Turns out there was a leak, which left me with a flat tire & stranded in Atlanta the next day.  It's clear that the technicians I dealt with had a blatant disregard for my safety and the safety of my vehicle.

I didn't know for sure exactly where or what was causing it, didn't want to spend my only free evening of the week with my wife and kid trying to figure it out, but also didn't want to leave a leak overnight so I took off work early to go get it fixed.  My vehicle needed an oil change as well anyway so I took it in and explained it was likely the filter or one of the lines that needed replaced.\n\nSure they changed my oil no problem, but the guy came around and said he wouldn't fix the leak, that it was a \"missing o-ring that they didn't carry in stock\" and I'd need to take it back to whoever put the existing filter on and have them do the repair.  Now, I replace my filters every 40,000 miles or so and I've moved a couple of times since then.  I have no idea where I was exactly when I replaced my filter last, because it's a small fix.  I got there at 4:30 pm, close of business at 6, so it wasn't like I pulled up at quitting time.  I had to take more time off work the next morning to disconnect everything myself and find it was simply a hairline crack in the filter.  The mechanic that I talked to didn't even verify anything, except what I already knew that yep there's a fuel leak there.  He just spewed some bs that he thought sounded good because he didn't feel like doing his job...

The gentleman looked at my low tire for about 30 seconds and told me there was a nail and because of where it was on the tire they wouldn\u2019t be able to patch it and I needed a whole new tire. Also that the tread on all my tires was getting low so I needed a whole new set. The set he tried to sell me was almost $1,000. Luckily I had my dog in the back seat, so I had a good excuse to get out of there and tell them I\u2019d come back later. I don\u2019t know a whole lot about cars, but I know when my tire tread looks low and I\u2019ve got at least until the end of this year or the beginning of next before I\u2019ll need new tires. And as for the one with the nail, my cousin patched it and I\u2019ve driven to Birmingham and back on it with no problem at all.

I went in to get oil change and a get a quote on new master cylinder for my son's car. My son had a free oil change card that his mother gave him.  This his first oil change of his first car I bought him last year. He's had the card for over a year and it has no expiration date on it. The service tech \"manager\" said he didn't think the card was still good. Again, it had no expiration date on it. He said well it should've been signed by manager, though there's no place for it to be signed by a manager. The \"manage\" said well anyone could've just picked it up and put the date on it and brought it back.  I said I didn't do that nor did my son or his mother. I told him I didn't appreciate being accused of stealing a free oil change card. He said two other people did that yesterday. I said that is not my fault nor an excuse to accuse me of doing the same thing. He could not understand what he had done over a $34.95 oil change. He called the owner and the owner said the card fine, of course. He did not apologize for accusing me of stealing the free oil change card. He said he had to make sure it was ok or it would come out of his paycheck. Again, no reason to ever utter someone could have just picked one up and brought it in unsigned. All he had to say is he had to call his owner to see how to process the card not accuse me of possibly stealing it. With that lack of ability to understand the damage to the customer for your handling of this made me question giving someone like that the responsibility to work on the brakes on my son's car. So, I took my free oil change card from his fingertips and told the inexperienced \"manager\" that I'd take my business elsewhere. As I left he said the free oil change card was \"null and void\". He just had to be right. He would not listen to the customer who was getting ready to pay $559 for work plus and extra $36 for the full synthetic oil change. Hint empathy people. I only do business with people I like period and though I just met this guy he gave me reason not to like him in under 10 minutes. I had never been in a Meineke in my life until today and will never do so again. Thanks to this manager at the South Huntsville shop. I wonder if this is the intent of the Meineke representative who gave this card to my son's mother?", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1622217384048, "text": "Hi Tom, this should never be the impression we leave.

First issue was my skid plate was not reinstalled under the engine. The store manager told me that it probably fell off when I was driving and I didn't notice. They were able to replace that at no cost to me. Secondly, screws were missing and clips weren't reinstalled. The manager assured me they would be replaced, and they were. Lastly the radiator was mounted improperly (very wobbly, almost hitting the engine). This was initially resolved with plastic zip ties and told by the manager that it was repaired and I was good to go. Obviously this was unacceptable at an initial service fee of $105/hr.

I must say, that the service rendered was indeed, \"service with a smile.\" After my delightful purchasing experience, I returned to my hometown approximately 41 miles west of Auburn and elected to, for the sake of time, have all my service needs performed by the local Honda dealership nearest me. This would be the trend for the next couple of years until I started experiencing a problem with my keyless ignition system. Time and time again, I would go in to this local certified Honda dealership and my problem was never resolved. I was even told by them that the only way they could get to the root of my problem was that my car would have to stop working completely. Well needless to say, this caused me extreme stress and anxiety. At this moment, I picked up the phone and gave Mr. Dave King of King Honda Auburn a call. Immediately, he pledged his absolute commitment to working with Service Manager Randy Melius and the other dedicated service professionals to identify and fix my ignition problems. Within two days of making contact with Mr. Dave King and getting my car to King Honda of Auburn, my fears subsided. His service team did just what was assured to me. I am no longer living in fear of my car not starting which compromised the safety my family and me.\n\nIn closing, please know that the automotive professionals of King Honda of Auburn will be there for you years after the ink dries on your purchasing contract. Words could never express my appreciation to owner, Mr. Dave King, service manager, Randy Melius, and their bonafide service professionals for their commitment to meeting the needs of their customers!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c132456a45:0x37bab76a5afd1067"}

The vehicle still have 40% life of oil before the next oil change.  Since I live some 900 miles away from Auburn and not sure when is the next time I'll be here.  But I want to get the oil change for my kid before I leave Auburn.  I came in the dealer at 3:30p and since this dealer is the smallest honda car dealer and pretty confusing if you are the first time visiting the service (no sign or direction to the service dept).  At 3:45p, I entered the door to the service counter and saw two man sat by the counter texting on their phone and asking him (buck is the name) if it is ok that I can do a quick oil change.  His replied was \"we are closing at 5:00p and we are wrapping up so no more service for the day\" I told him you have at least 1hr 10min left.  He notch his head but we are closing.\n\nI laughed so hard because this honda service dealer is so much unfriendly and not willing.  How can you show up to work and not working?  Something is really wrong here.\n\nI am writing to share my bad experience at \"king honda service dept\" so reader out there to save your time, energy and money else where you and the service you like other than king honda.\n\nOn my way out I stopped by the front sale office and share my experienced to mr. Randall / GM.  He seems to acknowledge my concerns and took down my contact info.\n\nI took my business to \"Express oil Change\" 3min away from king honda dealer and they really treating me like a real customer.  My fav guys are Michael and Zack.\n\nUPDATES...3/15/2017 @ 5:47p = 4-stars\n========\nI received a phone call from Mr. Dave King (the owner).  He first introduced himself and sincerely apologized to me of his service dept staffs behavior.  I have to give Mr. Dave King a lot of credit to reaching out to me as a upset customer and asked me to come back to his dealer to offer to do oil change if I havent done it (he actually said he would do it him self).  That enough to tell me that he genuinely care.  Instead he offered a certificate of free oil change on our next visit.\n\nI want to thanks Mr. Dave King and Mr Randall for their action and care to their customers.\n\nBecause of these efforts I have decided to move my rating from 1-star to 4-stars.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c132456a45:0x37bab76a5afd1067"}

I was not blaming anyone, I just wanted the work I paid for to be done. There were a few things that maybe on me but if they were real professional people they would not of teamed up against me like they did.

It did not solve the problem, so they took everything apart and replaced my coil - saying we will not charge you for what you do not need - nor charge you for the additional labor.

They are very professional, kind, and pleasant to work with.\n\nI had a blow out, on Friday, September 7th on I-459 while driving South @ 5:45 pm. I hit SIRI on my phone and located the closest tire store to my location and I sure am glad she steered me towards Darrin Gilliam and his team. I slowly limped my way to the store and got out at 5:55pm on Friday afternoon and Mr. Gilliam asked how he could help me. I told him I needed a tire that I just had a blow out and was traveling to Hale County and needed to get home. He checked his inventory, but did not have the tire size I needed, but went well above and beyond to find one for me. He had two other guys and himself on phones calling all around to different stores trying to locate one and I was worried about them closing the doors at 6 pm, but he stated they do not close the doors until all customers are taken care of and would not leave me stranded.\n\nAfter locating a tire and having it brought there, Darrin Gilliam, Jasson Trammell and Matt Ramirez installed the tire and rim and helped me get back on the road. I have never ever been to ANY BUSINESS 5 minutes before closing time and especially on a Friday afternoon to receive great customer service like this. These gentleman stayed over with smiles on their faces just to make sure I was taken care of, regardless of the time.  While I was waiting, I did notice this location was very well organized and everyone there worked together as a team. This store definitely has their ducks in a row.\n\nThe management and workforce in this store is \"bar none\" the best I have ever seen. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t live close enough to do business with this store, but I will recommend anyone in this area to make this your \u201cgo to place\u201d for all of your automotive needs. I will check out the store in Tuscaloosa and see if their standards are as good as this store on 5036 Bond Blvd. Thanks again guys for all your professional and kind help on a short notice at quitting time on a late Friday afternoon.
