They did not seal off contaminated rooms from other areas.\nThey took advantage of my elderly in-laws.\nWould give no stars if possible.\n\nIn response to your response. The proper protocol plan that you told my wife you were going to follow was not followed. You set bags of contaminated items on our personal items in a separate room. You stacked contaminated bags against the face of a flatscreen tv. There were pieces of contaminated sheetrock all over the floor in a room that you claimed was clean. Yes, I was upset because of all of this.\nAs my wife explained to you in the beginning,  she is highly allergic to mold. So, when I saw contaminated items drug through our living room and placed on our non contaminated things, it upset me. I even took pictures of it. I'm sorry your feelings got hurt, but you ruined our things and wasted our time.\n\nWe have now discovered that more things were ruined in the bags they carelessly packed. A bottle of shampoo was thrown into a bag where it broke open and poured onto my daughter's $300 camera, the bible she received from us at her Baptism, and many other valuables. That was just one bag. The amount of loss from this company is beyond a money value. Personal, irreplaceable  items were destroyed also.\n\nIn response to what you responded to my wife and her comments. All I can say is that you're shameless.

What you failed to mention was your erratic behavior towards our crew.  You verbally assaulted our crew and even continued yelling after our crew had exited the house.  You displayed a total lack of self control.  We did not create the mold issues in this house but we are well qualified to remediate any mold problem.  It appears that your personal problems boiled over and you chose to take it out on our crew.  That was a cowardly move.

I met with Rick and his wife at the beginning of August for them to run air sample tests on my parents house. They ran the test in 4 rooms, and called me 2 days later with the results.  When Rick called me he said that the levels of Stachybotrys were among some of the highest indoor levels he had seen in his 15 years of experience. In addition to the phone call I received an email from him with the results and a message stating that it was very dangerous for anyone to enter that area without protective gear on. He also insisted that we allow them to come back out and test 2 more rooms in the same area. He and his wife came back the next day, August 11th or 12th, to run the other 2 tests. WE STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE RESULTS FROM THOSE TESTS THAT WE PAID FOR 2 MONTHS AGO. We have asked for the results multiple times and the only answer my Dad got was that the tests came back ok.\n\nBefore Paragon Industrial was hired to do the mold remediation, I spoke with Rick and his wife about their protocol for removing contaminated items as to not cross contaminate the other rooms and items. After talking with them at length about how they would do the job, I felt comfortable with the protocol and encouraged my 80 year old father to go with their company.\n\nThey told my parents that they needed to run the air scrubbers upstairs and clean the air ducts first. Why would you clean upstairs before you remediate the toxic black mold downstairs? That doesn't even make sense. The mold should have been remediated first, then the air ducts, and last the air scrubbers.\n\nWhen they came to start the remediation THEY DID NOT FOLLOW ANY OF THE PROTOCOLS THAT THEY HAD EXPLAINED TO ME IN DETAIL BEFORE BEING HIRED! As far as erecting containment barriers, they put up some plastic sheeting with duck tape that began peeling off of the walls and door the same day they were put up. The air conditioning vents were not sealed off and the unit was not shut off while they were ripping moldy Sheetrock down. Also, they threw everything into black garbage bags from the contaminated room and threw it on top of our furniture in the living room causing CROSS CONTAMINATION. There was also moldy Sheetrock strewn down the hall where they drug it out! They explained to me that the Sheetrock would be taken down in small pieces, bagged and sealed before being removed completely from the house.\n\nMy ELDERLY father called to tell us what was going on at the house and I told my husband to go make sure things were being done like they said they were going to do them. When my husband, Sean, got to the house he found a huge mess! EVERYTHING HAD BEEN CROSS CONTAMINATED! My husband was in shock at how careless they were being because he was concerned about the impact it would have on my health! We had recently found out that I have lesions on my spine, unusual rashes, peripheral neuropathy, daily debilitating migraines, and chronic sinus infections ALL caused by exposure to black mold. My husband had to leave me alone in bed after being released from the hospital to come over to the house to find out what was going on. That is the reason he reacted the way he did, because he is genuinely concerned about the health of his wife! Any man who saw someone doing something that would bring harm to his family would react the same way!\n\nMy father called Rick and released him from the job the next day. He was supposed to return some of the money that my dad had paid upfront, but of course that has not been returned. My parents paid out almost $4000 for them to make a grand mess out of everything!\n\nSince then my parents have had a professional air conditioning company come check the air ducts upstairs that were supposed to be cleaned for $900 and he showed them that they had only been wiped out a couple feet. He inquired about what was paid, and couldn't believe that they paid for the service!!!\n\nI would keep going if google would allow me more characters.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1509138999688, "text": "Like your husband, your recollection of events is inaccurate.\nThe work upstairs was a completely different Indoor Air Quality Issue.  The work upstairs was not mold related.  Because your parents were living in this area, it was the priority.\nThe work downstairs was performed using industry protocol.\nI would like to remind you that we did not cause your mold problem and we did not cause your illness and health problems.\nPlease stop making false accusations against our company. I wish you the best with your family and your health."}, "gmap_id": "0x888c9327b068c7fb:0x7e68a4db3203cee2"}

When one of my two HVACs went out in my new home, I called the company that installed it and they said the earliest they could come was three days.  When I called ACS, they were there the next morning.  I have been calling on ACS ever since.  During a heat wave, after Robert explained he would have to charge overtime, ACS fixed my HVAC on a Sunday morning.  Whenever ACS was at my house to fix my HVAC, after analyzing the problem, they were clear on what needed to be done,  how long it would take to fix it, how much it would cost, and why.  If necessary, they also provided a variety of payment options so I could choose what best met my situation.  So when one of my two HVACs needed to be replaced, ACS was one of two companies I called for an estimate.  While the other estimate was flowered with discounts for various reasons, the ACS estimate was clear, concise, and competetive.  Robert Akins spent a lot of time explaining options and whether they were worth the expense.  The unit ACS proposed has a lifetime condenser replacement warranty if the compressor ever fails.  An option ACS had that the other did not was a ten year warranty on the labor for warrantied repairs.  Finally, when the competitor said it would take at least a week for the replacement HVAC to come in, ACS had my new unit installed the next day on December 22, the week of Christmas!  So whether you are looking to replace your current HVAC unit or just repair the one you have, I highly recommend Robert Akins and ACS.  They have always been there when I needed them and taken care of the problem efficiently and professionally.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862657b007200dd:0x7c27a392b36f81dc"}

Unfortunately, occasionally, due to whatever reasons whether by our fault or other circumstances, a customer is dissatisfied.  In this case we did not learn of Mr. Hastie's dissatisfaction until he posted a negative review.  There was no phone call, no inquiry, no attempt to communicate or seek a resolution to his complaint, just a negative review.\nAfter speaking to the technician and reviewing the statements associated with this service I found the following facts to be true:\n\nMr Hastie called to report his house was hot and his air conditioning was not working late in the afternoon.  I diverted a technician to his house after 4:30 pm to help him so that hopefully he would not have to go through another hot night in his house.  (We go on overtime at 5:00 pm).  The technician found the primary problem and responded by installing a part from his truck which was close to what was required but not the correct spec.  The temporary fix allowed the unit to run and cool the house overnight providing immediate relief for Mr. Hastie.  The technician did not charge for the overtime.\n\nThe part required was an odd spec which the technicians and many of our professional vendors do not carry locally (often an order Item).  The next day our technician searched among our vendors until he found a part locally.  He returned to the Hastie residence and exchanged the temporary part for the correct one.  Our technician also inspected the refrigerant charge and found a need to add some refrigerant to achieve the correct cooling specs per his instruments upon this return visit.\n\nMoreover, our technician did not charge Mr. Hastie for the procurement or travel time required to serve his needs.  For the more than 3 hours time involved working exclusively on Mr. Hastie's behalf our technician charge him only for a service call and 1 hour labor.  As far as the cost of the part:  yes we, like most service operations who provide a responsive service, charge a markup on parts.  We do not attempt to compete with internet pricing.  Our pricing structure reflects the convenience of having the part, our vendors supporting us to have a part available, and the network which guarantees and supports the quick response business.\n\nOtherwise, a client is free to diagnose his own problem, order his parts online and wait in the heat until the part arrives (hoping he did not make a mistake or that a wrong part was shipped.)\n\nIn conclusion:  Our technician followed pricing guidelines which have been satisfactory for our extensive client base for more than 40 years.  He waived labor costs in the hopes of establishing Mr. Hastie as a long term satisfied customer.  Mr. Hastie indicated to the technician that he was satisfied and grateful for the prompt service and relief from the heat.\n\nHad Mr. Hastie called to inquire about the charges, we could have explained to him and even offered him a coupon if he was still not happy.  Personally, I see this negative review as simply malicious with the intent of harming our otherwise excellent review status and without any interest in understanding or seeking a resolution with ACS, Inc."}, "gmap_id": "0x8862657b007200dd:0x7c27a392b36f81dc"}

I told him that it sounded like we needed to send a tech out for diagnostics.  He asked me what the charge would be and I told him the minimum cost of a service call and labor for a call out.  He then asked me an unusual question for our industry.  He asked me why we charged for diagnostics.  From having dealt with the public for 40 years I understood that he was not familiar with how service companies operate.  I proceeded to explain to him why a company had to charge to send a tech to a remote location, time, equipment cost, travel, insurance, education and training, overhead and all of the costs associated with a working company.  I explained that the tech, for instance, had to be paid from the moment he clocked in which included the driving time to a residence and back, hence the service call.  Nathan took offense at the explanation and told me that he did not need a \"lecture\".  I asked him then why he asked such a question if he did not expect or want a comprehensive answer, to which he abruptly hung up the phone. There was no profanity.  Moments later this negative review arrived in my email.\n\nPart of the service we provide is educational.  We are a very empirical and logic based company.  We deal with applied science.  When a question is asked we do our best to answer it thoroughly.  I often help clients solve heating and air conditioning issues over the phone at no charge when able.  I have recently successfully instructed non technical house wives in restoring their heat over the phone. My communication skills are very good.  In this circumstance it was very important that the potential client understood the charges and per his questions why there were charges.  If the customer does not understand that he will be charged for a visit and that he has an obligation to pay, or if he protests the value of the service prior to a visit by a tech, then we cannot send a tech to his residence.\n\nUnfortunately, part of the job of dealing with the general public is to screen the potential client to make sure that the interaction with the company and the technician is successful and satisfactory for both parties.  We will not send a technician into a contentious situation.  We would have liked to have helped Nathan but the initial phone interaction and the \"hang up\" indicated that the interaction would not be successful."}, "gmap_id": "0x8862657b007200dd:0x7c27a392b36f81dc"}

My wife met with Cason and we went into wanting multiple options which i thought were all fairly presented and well explained without any pressure of which to go with. I have a close friend who worked for many years for both Trane and Carrier with many of the dealers throughout Birmingham. He gave me a list of 3 companies he would have out to his home personally. Skelton was one of those, another company that i liked very much, and then one we didnt have a great experience on the quote with. Between Skelton and the other competitor, although Skeltons price was higher we were sold by the labor warranty and some of the other written guarantees, along with the rec from our friend. Installation - I believe it was Mark, my wife was the one on site - went way better than i could have imagined. We arranged last minute to have the unit moved to a new location. All of the work was very well done. I had an idea in my head of what \"the aftermath\" should have looked like and the equipment involved in the move and all that, and i probably would have been satisfied with a lot less. Its obviously a lot of money for most families, so I was bound to have some mix of buyers remorse and hesitation about whether or not we'd gone with the right people However, when i got home and saw the quality of the work, how neatly and efficiently and professionally everything was done, i immediately felt entirely confident in our decision and knew we had some true professionals out at the house. I think its the first time in my life ive spent that much money on something and dont have any regrets or second guessing about who we chose to spend it with. Kudos to both Cason and Mark's teams.

Well, the A C didn't come on so I called American Home Warranty which provided me with my info and called Same Day maintenance (cause I've used them before to install a thermostat in my home), the technician came out flipped the switch on and never went outback to check my unit...naturally I was happy because now I'm knowing I have air. Kept my doors and windows opened and up until around7:30 because it was really hot inside and I didn't want the unit to work as hard cooling the house inside. 3:00 before day Saturday morning; I was drenched in sweat.not understanding what's happened, got up, checked the A C inside..on. Went out back, checked the unit..no fan turning, unit very hot..turned off A C inside, called SameDay around 8:00 that morning, left emergency message..no return called. Called again all day every30 minutes- an hour...no phone call. Same repeat for Sunday. Monday morning I was on the phone calling them from7:30 until the answering machine picked up and I asked them to please call me back..didn't call me, I called back again finally getting someone who told me they would check with the tec. to see when he can come b out( mind you, this is a re-call) so I should have been a priority along with other people who had an emergency over the week-end not wait until Wednesday to try and work me in. I was told Wednesday morning that the Tec. would be out between 1and 5pm. Okay... I'm trying to hold my self in check because now I'm feeling disrespected and ignored. 4:35 no Tech..I called their office back after the 2nd phone call I was told this guy name Andy would give me a call...what???\nIt's already4:55 I said\" call me\" he should be here by now i2don't need him to call me.. She said\" that's what he told me to tell you\" . long story....so he called5:10 said he would look at his schedule and see if he could get to me tomorrow( Thursday)....I'm sooo pissed now, hot and disgusted...called American Residential warranty back, explained this same thing to them and told them I will not use Same Day Maintenance anymore and to place that notation on the computer by my name...so now I'm searching the internet trying to find someone else who will come out asap to get me up and running......I recommend no body uses this service...at all.

So I called several HVAC companies, and I quickly found out that the repair cost was high enough that I was better off getting a new air conditioning system. So I did some research, and then I got quotes from 11 different companies. Of the price range of quotes, Xcalibur was among the lowest. So I chose Xcalibur, and the next morning, Ryan, Mark, Jacob and Zachary showed up and installed a new air conditioning system and furnace (I actually didn't need a new furnace, but the extra cost to add a new furnace to the a/c installation job was low.).  The installation guys were professional (for example, they put on shoe covers before entering my house) and knowledgeable.\n\nI'm glad that I chose this company. First, Ben and Ryan are actually honest people. Also, Ben and his employees seem to take pride in doing a good job.  My new a/c system not only comes with the standard 10 year warranty for parts, but also a 10 year warranty for LABOR.  Call other HVAC companies yourself and ask if they include a 10 year labor warranty on a/c installations.  When they say no, ask them what the labor cost is to replace a compressor or an evaporator coil.  Also, Xcalibur installed new line sets with my a/c system. But some HVAC companies cut corners by not installing new line sets.\n\nSince Alabama Power is my electricity company, I can track my electricity usage via Alabama Power's website or their app. My new Bryant a/c system uses about 39% less kilowatts than the American Standard system that it replaced.  In just the first month of using this Bryant a/c system, I saved over $100 on my Alabama Power bill!  I also found out that Bryant equipment and Carrier equipment come out of the same factories because they are sister companies.\n\nIf I could give Xcalibur 6 stars, I would.

Drew one of the sales guys made up stories about the situation, told my tenant I had told him things when I hadn't even talked to the guy yet and told two different things ones to me and my tenant .I asked Drew why he did this and let him know I would be calling the office and  he proceeded to call my tenant a couple of times and send me a  6 page text over the situation which I found very unprofessional . When I called to complain about this Jacob the owners son took  up for the actions, was rude to me, did not listen to me and acted like I was bothering him.I was told my cabinets needed replaced when they did not. They pulled the vanity out of my master bathroom that did not need pulled out to begin with  without cutting the caulk and when they pulled the vanity it caused the mirror in the bathroom to fall on the sink shattering my mirror and busting my sink in the bathroom and tried to blame it on the heat in the room.I called  David the head of the construction department several times asking a start date and was told no repairs would be started  until they had 18 thousand upfront, Half the cost, and to ask my adjuster to call  his cooperate office and have Fed Ex deliver it to them.I asked my adjuster about it and he said that they did not that money upfront and was beyond shocked I had been told that.They still have their little lock box on my door a week after I told them I will not be using their services anymore, I have called four times to ask to have removed.I have called and asked  three times to speak to the owner of the franchise and got no response. The office staff is not friendly, they have horrible attitudes and make you feel  brushed off.  Brandy the girl in the office is very rude and  blows me off and acts like I'm a bother to her when I call to ask to speak to a manager or owner  . This is the most unprofessional company I have ever came into contact with in my life. And I strongly suggest people think  twice before using them for any reason. You will regret it if you  use this company, trust me on that.They thought since it was an insurance claim they would  take me for a run and rob me and  my insurance company blind and have caused me nothing  but a headache and  added stress from what happened to my home.\n\nChelsea\ndon't know how to reply to you  but this way.

But then everything got very confusing. We didn't know what was going to happen or when. Then they came in and packed all of our things up, first our clothes and no one told us to keep out any clothes. So we had no clothes blankets or pillows by the time they finished. There was 2 rooms that just had to be cleaned but they threw out our beds and furniture and took out all the carpet. We put notes on two closets and put don't enter.. I found the notes in the floor when we returned. They packed up everything and took it with them but nothing was cleaned it was just in the box they had packed it in.\nThey told us they we're going to clean the duck work, it was not cleaned, the ceiling fans were not cleaned nor were the blinds. We have had to just  about replace everything  we own plus we had use or own  money to eat at the hotel for   for over 2 months. Being nice is great but we had to many people telling us different things..it took a month after we got to come home before they started bring things back. It made difficult to cook. We had to buy new pots just fry an egg.\nWhen they finally brought things back they were very confused about everything because the young guy and 3 woman that packed us up were fired. They didn't seem to know what was ours and what wasn't.  There are quite a few things missing.  Some of the items are antique and can't be replaced.  The thing is these items problem  went to someone else  and they just saw it was old and not there's. Maybe I need to go check the thrift store.  I didn't think this was going to be easy but this has been a nightmare. I have items that have tags on them, but they didn't take them or clean them. My blinds still have soot on them and it is not easy to clean. They we're supposed to clean and check or duct work , not even touched. And we saw the check our insurance sent them and that was way too much for this mess.

For two weeks, we checked every\nday, no workmen.  We were assured we would be back in by Christmas.  We went through three Project Managers, and\nthree different set of drywall and painters.  The first painting crew stood on my washer and dryer to paint the\nceiling in the laundry leaving dents and scratches.  We had stored the liquor from our bar in tubs in the garage,\nas Servpro would not remove alcohol from the home.  Apparently the painters had found it and consumed a great deal\nbefore they were removed from the job by Darin Ingle.  They also got paint all over our floors so Servpro brought\nin commercial scrubbers which removed the finish on all of our floors.\n\nTo shorten this story, I will cut to the return home.  We finally returned to our home in early March with work still\ngoing on, Painting and damaged floors. The first night home the water under the sink of my brand new cabinets\nflooded the kitchen.  They had to send in dryers and a plumber who said it was not hooked up correctly and\nreworked all of the kitchen dishwasher and sink plumbing. They sent in a professional flooring company  to assess\nthe floors. Their solution required us to move back into a hotel for at least a week so they could clean, reseal\nthe tile and recolor the grout.\n\nThe only thing that saved this project was Darin Ingle who arrived on the project in February.  Darin was sent in from another state to resolve the\nproblems at the Montgomery location that included our home.  Darin took the reins, brought in new crews and came\nevery day to ensure the work got back on track and that it was done correctly.  Darin's arrival was months into\nthe project and while we have never sued anyone, we were on the verge of doing just that to get another company\nto come in so we could go home.  I am not sure if Servpro's executives realize that Darin not only saved our project,\nsaved them from a lawsuit but did an amazing job saving their reputation.  I would only call them again if Darin Ingle handled the job.\nBecause of Darin, I am giving Servpro a 2 star rating and Darin a 5.\n\nAn update to my review.  I was contacted by Mr. Bowen, an owner.  Mr. Bowen was determined to do something to do something for All we had been through.  He offered to send in a crew or something.  While his offer was appreciated, we had already fixed many of the issues and did not feel we could ensure another work crew I agreed to think it over and get back with him.  The one thing, as I explained to him, that distressed me everytime I went into the laundry was the dents and scratches on the tops of the washer and dryer which he eagerly agreed to replace.  With much of manufacturing shut down for long periods, appliances are in short supply.  However, Mr. Bowen and Darin Ingle were able to replace order And have new ones installed.  My frustration is no longer renewed when I walk into my laundry room.  My thanks to Mr. Bowen for reaching out and making this a better experience, and to Darin Ingle for making it happen.  It is good to know they cared to make things better.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1600260211243, "text": "Hi Judy, I am one of the owners and I am terribly sorry to hear about your experience.

The owner, Shane, is very personable and the kind of guy you can trust with your door unlocked. Opie (dead ringer for a younger Ron Howard), his technician, is a relatively young guy (23), but mature beyond his years and a very good HVAC tech. He's also trustworthy and the kind of guy you would want to represent your company. Most importantly, he was able to diagnose my heat pump problem quickly and efficiently...10 to 15 minutes. The HVAC was over amped.\n\nThe company that installed my TRANE XL14 heat pump in 2007, Alabama Climate Control (ACC) of Huntsville, apparently did not notice that the heat pump was rated for max amperage of 40 amps because they did not bother to change the 50 amp circuit breaker in the panel in the garage. One would expect a professional HVAC company to do a basic electrical circuit check/test to ensure the electrical circuit is compatible with your NEW heat pump...right!?!?\n\nAnyway, this oversight by ACC resulted in a fried circuit breaker in the junction box at the heat pump. Opie said we were lucky this situation did not result in a burned up motor or worse a burned down house. After all that, Opie tried to give me a $25 discount because I'm a veteran.\n\nThank you for the sentiment Opie, but also thank you for identifying a problem that has caused me great anguish over the years. I had to replace 3 or 4 compressors on the original heat pump (a Rheem) about 15 years ago when we first started renting out the house.\n\nThe HVAC company (same ACC) kept replacing all those compressors under warranty at $250 to $300 a pop for labor, but just couldn't figure out what was causing all those compressors to burn up (the same 50 amp circuit breaker in the breaker box). Then, I was dumb enough to hire them again to install a new TRANE in 2007. Remeber, the TRANE is rated for a maximum of 40 amps, but ACC left the same old 50 amp circuit breaker in the breaker panel. Voila...we get a fried junction box this time.\n\nIncredible...that it took a young 23 year old tech with a lot less experience (but more common sense and intelligence) to recognize that a 50 amp circuit breaker is going to eventually cause some problems if it is not compatible with the rest of the circuit.\n\nThe cautionary tale here is...be extremely vigilant and careful about who you let work on your electrical systems and watch them like a hawk when they do...until you find a company like SMS that has techs like Opie..

Sometimes a unit is too old, and has too many problems, to justify repair. We issued a refund after the customer decided to buy a new unit rather than approve further repairs. -- Initially we traced her leak to a clogged condensate drain, but she continued to have the leak. After the drain was found clogged again and cleared, it continued to leak. Further investigation found that that her drawer was not closing perfectly because of a defective gear, which was allowing moist room air into the freezer which was building up high levels of frost, which was also causing her drain to clog. When the unit defrosted, it would produce the leak called us about in the first visit. The rails to the drawer were also rusty, which interfered with proper drawer closure.

This is one of the companies LG forces you to use. Even with LG covering the expense of the compressor, about 350.00 the quote was 800.00 for then to spend 2-3 hours to repair.  The worst part was the tech told me it was a 50/50 chance it would last. The reason behind the ridiculous price, the tech explained that there was a strong possibility that multiple service calls would be made in the first year and they dont get paid for those, meaning the price hike was to help cover their possible future expense  The going rate from several other companies not affiliated with LG was approximately 400.00 to swap out the compressor, vacume to 5 microns and refill with r134.  Today, I am having another company come to my home and swapping the compressor to the non linear compressor, all paid out of my pocket, the entire job cost me 595.00. So how can it possibly be so much for the LG compressor swap if LG is covering the cost due to warranty? Another noteworthy mentioning is that I told the tech I would mount the compressor myself and would sweat on the copper connections myself, but that wouldn't change the price according to the tech. It's called price gouging and its pathetic. Be very cautious when dealing with this company, there are much better options out there, thankfully I found one, thanks Appliance Service LLC.

The invoice I received from the tech clearly states that only one was ordered for a parts/installation fee of $560.11 which alerted my spider sense. Customer service offered me an ultimatum of either $200+ refund because of tech\u2019s alleged mistake (meaning I still paid over $300 dollars to replace a $35 dollar part that took 30 mins to replace) or they would come out to take out the $35 part for a full refund. Despite having been charged a fee of $80+ for an in-home quote which by their own admission was inaccurate they refused to refund that. I only agreed to the repair because based on the description of what needed to be done to repair the unit seemed extensive and beyond my skill set. If I didn\u2019t have to take another day off wrk (on top of the 2 I already had to for the quote and the repair) for them to come out to take back what they put in I would have gladly had them come out and take it out. Found a step by step tutorial video on YouTube and the repair is actually quite simple.\n\nService Care this type of business practice is shameful to charge such ridiculous amounts of money for simple repairs. This is flat out fraudulent and predatory. Their excuse for such high pricing basically boils down to \u201cWe use nationally recognized software to provide quotes...\u201d Translation: We do it because we CAN. Not because it\u2019s RIGHT. They knowingly charge SEVERAL hundred dollars an hr for labor for relatively simple repairs. Buyer beware and be sure to do your research first. This repair could have been easily DIY and done for $35 bucks in parts and a Phillips head screwdriver.\n\nThe owner himself discourages buying parts off Amazon in his response but the Service Care website  actually contains a link that customers can use to buy \u201ccheap\u201d OEM replacement parts...from Amazon. :l\nAgain, a total scam, folks. Stay clear of this place.  Had I not questioned my order I would have been duped.  This is supposed to be a repair that the company does \u201chundreds\u201d of times but no one from company realized I was over charged by several hundred dollars (not a few dollars but several HUNDRED dollars) until I said something about it. Had I went to Publix to buy a gallon of milk and it rang up for $50, the cashier would have instantly thought, \u201cHuh...it\u2019s usually $3.99. Something must be wrong.\u201d Not Service Care. They will take your money and run without thinking twice about it. They still refuse to refund my in-home quote fee for a quote that was inaccurate.\n\n*Technician\u2019s name removed from review at the request of the owner", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1559075893140, "text": "Hi, I'm sorry you were so unhappy with your experience, and I can see why. The technician made a technical error while building your quote. Instead of quoting for a pack of 4 rollers, he quoted for four 4-packs of rollers. The pricing software that we use thought we were replacing those parts 4 times, which increased the quote. (We would be happy to send you a copy of the original quote, which included the 4 rollers, not one). I feel certain that we would have caught that during our billing process, but we appreciate you calling us so soon after your repair to let us know. We're issuing you a refund for the difference. We stand behind our repairs with a one-year warranty which requires us to use OEM manufacturer parts which are usually more expensive than the cheap ones you find on Amazon. Of course, most of the cost of any repair, from any company, is the labor and skill that it takes to diagnose the problem correctly and replace it in a timely manner. I appreciate the feedback!

He couldn't find one.\n\nI'm giving them three stars because there was sufficient information given to them to be able to tell me over the phone that they wouldn't be able to find a replacement part. I explained my frustration to the technician. He said that they mostly deal with appliances and he'd never been unable to replace a main board for a somewhat new Panasonic (< 5 years) and that he wouldn't have time to train the staff to get all pertinent information. To me, that's a training issue.\n\nPolite and responsive people, but they need to do better with the information that they are given. They had the part number and the description of the problem.

The technician, Craig Harris, was professional, personable and most importantly knowledgeable.  After inspecting the downdraft and learning how new it was, he got on the phone with the GE Customer Care Team and they took over the resolution since the product was covered under warranty (in a previous call that I made to GE... they blew me off with the reply that the unit must not have been installed properly... which it was).  That situation was resolved with a swap of the defective GE downdraft.  Craig then diagnosed the DW problem as a broken soap dispenser that was surprisingly allowing the high pressure water to get into a small hole and leak down through the front panel and out to the corners and then onto my floor.  A 2nd visit was required to allow time for the part to be ordered (expensive little plastic booger).

After checking our attic and seeing that the squirrel had not yet made an entrance into our house, they told us there was nothing they could do.  The guy didn\u2019t even have a ladder to check our gutters!\n\nSo we call Jim from Exclusive Wildlife & Pest Control.  He laughed when I told him the previous encounter with the Critter Capture company and then proceeded to get his ladder (that he brought himself!) and take a look at our gutters and ensure that the squirrel had not damaged our roof yet and also took the time to double check our attic. No damage was noted except for the fire pit cover we caught the squirrel tearing up the previous weekend.\n\nJim gave me two options on how to get rid of our furry new houseguest; we could capture him alive and release him elsewhere or set a trap similar to a rat trap that should kill him instantly. After much discussion my husband and I decided on the rat trap since the evenings here have been very cold and the poor squirrel may freeze to death in a live trap. Jim was so very patient as we weighed our options and was able to give me the pros and cons on both methods.\n\nAfter one failed attempt to trap him (the trap caught his tail instead of his neck) Jim text me throughout the evening to reassure me that he would get him the next day and that all would be OK. Jim returned promptly the next morning, set the trap again and was able to get the squirrel instantly. He disposed of everything and cleaned the nest out of the gutter.\n\nJim was so very pleasant to work with I will definitely be calling again if any other squirrel decides to make his home here!\nI would recommend Jim and Exclusive Wildlife to anyone who is looking for good, quality, and prompt service.\n\nThank you Jim!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBbVC-1NoRZZKkz46lqwpMR0kKMUXVSo0HNWyH=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpMImbqi6WT6TFmbGFntrWu9R1ePdVJL0QITRP=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1548888877159, "text": "Thank you Mike & Stephanie Freeman, it was my pleasure helping you rid your home of your unwelcomed guest and it was nice meeting you."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a1b2dea85547d:0x4c0bde02d4614206"}

There is nothing more aggravating than to have your air conditioning unit quit. Although it is mid-October we needed our air conditioning fixed ASAP. Our unit was 17 years old and I knew we needed to replace it if not immediately, within the very near future. I emailed a few companies Saturday night asking for estimates and to please contact me Monday morning. Only Autumn Air and one other company returned my call today. Autumn Air was very pleasant and offered to have someone come out to price the unit immediately. Since I knew I did not want to start throwing money away repairing such an old unit I asked for a quote for a new unit (with and without the furnace). Skip came out and priced the unit with three options and it was clear if I wanted more options he would give them to me. He did not acted putout or frustrated with my request. He did not pressure me to make a decision nor did he push me to buy the most expensive product. Without me asking, he let me know the specials that were being offered. I asked how soon they could install the unit and he said either this afternoon or in the morning. I called my husband and sent him the estimates. My husband was impressed and even showed his fellow employees who were also impressed with the prices. After weighing the pros and cons we decided to replace the entire unit (with furnace). I called Skip back about 2:30 saying we did want to go ahead and replace the unit, he said he would call me right back, that it would be either this afternoon or in the morning. I was floored when he called me back shortly afterwards and asked if it was okay with me if they could install it today. Skip and two other gentlemen came and installed the unit working hard until close to 9:00 pm. We were all extremely grateful to the diligence of these men. In addition, Autumn Air included a 2-year service plan where they will come out to service/clean the unit twice a year. They have earned my trust.

{"user_id": "117764367263681419355", "name": "John Hosmer", "time": 1505317915712, "rating": 5.0, "text": "For a long while there have been atmosphere issues in our basement where the previous home owners had never taken care of sealing up the rooms and keeping temps and humidity in check. We had addressed those issues and we had tried using good filters at the returns to prevent as much of any dust, mold spores, etc. from recirculating and spreading, but it ended up being a losing battle for both comfort and our family's health.  Finally, about a month ago I disconnected one of the flexpipes at the end of the trunk run to see just how bad it was and found almost 100% coverage of dust, mold, and nastiness throughout the system. It was in every bit of the trunk, and every flexpipe throughout the house (See pictures). Even a few of the vent registers had started harboring mold growth which was a really bad sign as well.\n\nSo, I did what any good panicking homeowner would do at that point. Went to Google, pulled up nearby HVAC companies with good reviews that could do duct replacement, and called for appointments for onsite inspections. Out of the four highly reviewed and reputable companies (minus individual contractors) in the Pelham area that actually showed up for their appointment, Autumn Air's rep Baker was the only one who showed up on time, actually visually inspected inside the ductwork even after I showed him the initial pictures I took, and then spent a solid amount of time explaining to me options for replacing the entire ductwork system so we could see about what would be right for our budget. In the end, the price that Autumn Air was able to provide for an upgrade to a new round smooth metal interior and outside insulated wrapped system, including new boots and registers, throughout the entire house, plus a new central AprilAire Space Guard filtration and iWave-R GPS ionization system upgrade (per my request) beat out the one other company who actually sent me a quote by almost half. Let me say that again differently...TWO of the four companies NEVER sent back a quote. This told me that two of the highly reputable companies in the Pelham area that have a high amount of favorable reviews simply did not want a job. Pitiful for them.\n\nFast forward to the install a week later...Led by two guys named Javy and Charles, they took care of making sure everything was treated with care when taking out the old ductwork so as to minimize spreading of dirt and mold as much as could be. Then, they proceeded to assemble and install all of the new system on site for custom fitting plus making sure all seams were taped properly and coated with mastic so that the chances of air leaks past the coils is forever kept at a minimum. They arrived early in the morning, and worked until the job was finished that evening (on the day of Harvey storms coming through too!).  Any questions I had concerning anything with the job was answered and explained with no hesitation on their part.  They went beyond expectations with accommodations and I just can't be any happier.\n\nI can't say it enough in this entire description here how great Autumn Air is for an HVAC company. They want someone's business in the best way because they give the work the best service they can at reasonable prices, and offer great financing options too if needed. They understand how to go the extra mile to make sure the customer is being taken care of in the end as well. I can say I have also had the pleasure of meeting Jeff, the owner, later when he came back to look at a minor issue that crept up post install, and he is just as awesome about discussing more than the \"here's what we'll do\". He takes the time to explain the why and how's (if you are interested to know and ask) and will work with you as a customer to do everything he can within reason to make sure you are satisfied with him and his company. Because of all of these things described about everyone at that company and how we were treated, we now not only have clean, sanitized fresh air, but the confidence to know it will stay that way due to the complete service and professionalism we got from Autumn Air.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMabAWy162GH96gyl3m37sUEbn3lZkhH_QMnw5p=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_X0ScvBCZDov4a77tJ8--jNZxa4SLKPRwf7ZQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2_SRCsbshQYMwunCW_Svt09o-TDruxZ8tozW8=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKpjJ6ZJSD3l76fC4DaZ5moDrfqENk5DrC3V5m=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVryaFeSx9Ipmsmn5UNXwMOBC9HZqnM-6Io7MO=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1593532681755, "text": "Thank you for sharing your review of our company!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888924e52224bd39:0x2e611205e661f050"}

You get a discount on all service  after you sign up !\nReally, $120 a year for the PM plan  ?? i thought he misquoted so I jumped on it but its for real ! Great service, great guy. You rock Corey !

My existing furnace kept cutting off in the mornings, but then it ran fine for most of the day.  It was a difficult thing to track down, and they never quit troubleshooting to get to the root of the issue so they could fix it the right way.\n\nThis took several trips, they tried several things, one at a time, to narrow it down.  Instead of changing a bunch of things or applying \"band-aids\", they worked hard to pinpoint the true issue.  It ended up being a piece of metal (limit) that was popping and shutting it off prematurely (before the heat limit actually occurred).  So a tiny faulty limit had to be found, and they found it.\n\nIt took a lot of patience and tedious work at times.  They just had the attitude of \"I'll find the root cause no matter what it takes, and I won't stop until I find and fix it.\"  I truly believe others would have given up or chalked it up to an issue with my new thermostat.\n\nI really appreciate the time and effort that was put into troubleshooting, not giving up, and finding the real issue, and fixing it the right way!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888924e52224bd39:0x2e611205e661f050"}
