We cannot clean rugs with pet urine in the home as you do not want your hardwood floors to get wet.  In our facility the rugs go through many steps to be cleaned properly (dusting machine, submersion bath, centrifuge, hung in drying room and then any fringe is repaired).

It smells and looks great and Steve worked very hard to clean thoroughly and comply with requests.  He was also fair about giving me the best price he could.  A couple of things I would say could be improved - Steve was not provided anything by Chem-Dry to put under my heavy sofas to protect the legs since those could not be moved out of the room.  In the past, the company we used had some plastic squares.  Steve used plastic grocery bags from Target that I provided him and one faded the red onto the carpet but it is in an obscure place that is not noticeable.  Also it would seem ideal to have 2 people working the job vs. one because of better control of the long hoses, etc. which dripped some moisture and dirt from someone else's house onto my hardwood foyer.  Not preferred but not a big deal either.  Also, I signed the paperwork at the end without reading the words written, just the price.\nLater, my husband read it and asked me why the work was not guaranteed against the stains coming back, etc.  I plan to call and ask them about that.  Hopefully the stains won't come back so a moot point.\nI would recommend just the basic cleaning plus any pet stain treatment for rooms that might have pet soiling.  The basic formula is supposedly with baking soda and that is truly all natural.  There were options to buy two add-ons in the cleaning formula - an anti-microbial spray and a scotch-guard product.  I opted out on these 2 and don't think there were beneficial.  In fact have read that scotch-guard can be harmful to health.\nAlso, if you are expecting this service to have very little moisture after cleaning, not really so.  Even un-pet-treated rooms needed overnight to completely dry to move furniture back and my cleaning started at 11:00 am ish.\nHave a great day!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1553714008857, "text": "Susan, Thank you for your comments & for choosing Huntsville Chem-Dry to serve you.  We always strive for 5-star reviews but we welcome the opportunity to learn & improve from other reviews.  Your input is very valuable.  I want a take a minute or two to clarify a few things.\nIt is standard that we provide plastic tabs for furniture legs so I am embarrassed to hear that we did not have them on the van that day.  Plastic bags are not acceptable & I apologize for the inconvenience.\nWe run one man crews on the van to help keep the cleaning costs lower for our customers.\nOur paperwork & signature is an agreement confirming our price before the work begins & our agreement that we will do everything we can to remove stains but we cannot guarantee complete stain removal.\nWe do have 3 packages to choose from, our Basic Cleaning, our Stain Fighter Package & our Healthy Home Package.  Our Chem-Dry proprietary cleaning solution is called The Natural.  It is not like baking soda but it is a Green-Certified cleaning agent.  It is a wonderful product that does not leave a dirt attracting residue and has amazing cleaning abilities while still being safe to drink (tastes awful though)!  Our Stain Fighter package consists of co-applying the stain protectant (another Green-Certified product called PowerGuard) with the cleaning.  Scotchguard is a brand of protectant that is toxic but we pride ourselves on using safe products for the home.  Re-applying stain protectant is very important to extend the look of your carpets.  The original protectant wears off over time with vacuuming and normal activities.  You mentioned that yours is fairly new so it's always good to re-apply once a year on average, this will make cleaning up spills or muddy paws so easy on you in between professional cleanings.  Most companies spray some kind of protectant on the carpet after cleaning which creates a crusty top layer.  Our co-application of the protectant allows us to protect the entire carpet fiber, not just the top.  Our Healthy Home package is the combination of the cleaning, the protectant and an Ant-Microbial pre-spray which removes bacteria in the carpet (especially if there are pets).\nResults can vary with drying times in carpet depending on how dirty it is and what kind of carpet it is.  2-3 hours is average but we run our cleaning machine until the carpet is clean without soaking the carpet pad & we use a powerful extraction method for the best possible results.\nAgain, thank you Susan for your recommendations & please let me know if I can help in any way.\n\nTara Outson\nOwner, Huntsville Chem-Dry"}, "gmap_id": "0x88623e0338d7b62b:0x9436b519d7638670"}

It smells and looks great and Steve worked very hard to clean thoroughly and comply with requests.  He was also fair about giving me the best price he could.  A couple of things I would say could be improved - Steve was not provided anything by Chem-Dry to put under my heavy sofas to protect the legs since those could not be moved out of the room.  In the past, the company we used had some plastic squares.  Steve used plastic grocery bags from Target that I provided him and one faded the red onto the carpet but it is in an obscure place that is not noticeable.  Also it would seem ideal to have 2 people working the job vs. one because of better control of the long hoses, etc. which dripped some moisture and dirt from someone else's house onto my hardwood foyer.  Not preferred but not a big deal either.  Also, I signed the paperwork at the end without reading the words written, just the price.\nLater, my husband read it and asked me why the work was not guaranteed against the stains coming back, etc.  I plan to call and ask them about that.  Hopefully the stains won't come back so a moot point.\nI would recommend just the basic cleaning plus any pet stain treatment for rooms that might have pet soiling.  The basic formula is supposedly with baking soda and that is truly all natural.  There were options to buy two add-ons in the cleaning formula - an anti-microbial spray and a scotch-guard product.  I opted out on these 2 and don't think there were beneficial.  In fact have read that scotch-guard can be harmful to health.\nAlso, if you are expecting this service to have very little moisture after cleaning, not really so.  Even un-pet-treated rooms needed overnight to completely dry to move furniture back and my cleaning started at 11:00 am ish.\nHave a great day!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1553714008857, "text": "Susan, Thank you for your comments & for choosing Huntsville Chem-Dry to serve you.  We always strive for 5-star reviews but we welcome the opportunity to learn & improve from other reviews.  Your input is very valuable.  I want a take a minute or two to clarify a few things.\nIt is standard that we provide plastic tabs for furniture legs so I am embarrassed to hear that we did not have them on the van that day.  Plastic bags are not acceptable & I apologize for the inconvenience.\nWe run one man crews on the van to help keep the cleaning costs lower for our customers.\nOur paperwork & signature is an agreement confirming our price before the work begins & our agreement that we will do everything we can to remove stains but we cannot guarantee complete stain removal.\nWe do have 3 packages to choose from, our Basic Cleaning, our Stain Fighter Package & our Healthy Home Package.  Our Chem-Dry proprietary cleaning solution is called The Natural.  It is not like baking soda but it is a Green-Certified cleaning agent.  It is a wonderful product that does not leave a dirt attracting residue and has amazing cleaning abilities while still being safe to drink (tastes awful though)!  Our Stain Fighter package consists of co-applying the stain protectant (another Green-Certified product called PowerGuard) with the cleaning.  Scotchguard is a brand of protectant that is toxic but we pride ourselves on using safe products for the home.  Re-applying stain protectant is very important to extend the look of your carpets.  The original protectant wears off over time with vacuuming and normal activities.  You mentioned that yours is fairly new so it's always good to re-apply once a year on average, this will make cleaning up spills or muddy paws so easy on you in between professional cleanings.  Most companies spray some kind of protectant on the carpet after cleaning which creates a crusty top layer.  Our co-application of the protectant allows us to protect the entire carpet fiber, not just the top.  Our Healthy Home package is the combination of the cleaning, the protectant and an Ant-Microbial pre-spray which removes bacteria in the carpet (especially if there are pets).\nResults can vary with drying times in carpet depending on how dirty it is and what kind of carpet it is.  2-3 hours is average but we run our cleaning machine until the carpet is clean without soaking the carpet pad & we use a powerful extraction method for the best possible results.\nAgain, thank you Susan for your recommendations & please let me know if I can help in any way.\n\nTara Outson\nOwner, Huntsville Chem-Dry"}, "gmap_id": "0x88623e0338d7b62b:0x9436b519d7638670"}

I'm not quite sure what went wrong, but the owner, who answered the phone, was brusque and acted as if I was wasting her time... although I spent less than 3 minutes talking to her and only inquired about 2 things. I have a medical condition that makes it hard to speak quickly or process the speech of others, maybe that's where we got off on the wrong foot. Anyway, I tried to ask about the price for one room and a couple of other spots throughout the house. I was confused when she told me the price would be $135, as the website says a living room is $55. I asked her about it, and she told me the minimum is $135. That would have been fine (even though other companies I've called either do not have a minimum or have a smaller minimum), but the attitude behind the comment was if she was talking to a clueless employee rather than a potential customer. Wouldn't you get more customers if you spoke pleasantly and said something like, \"I'm sorry about that. Although we'd like to serve as many clients as possible, because of our high quality service, our overhead to come out for less than the price of 3 rooms wouldn't allow us to stay open for business.\" rather than \"No. There's a $135 minimum.\" in a rather snotty and abrupt tone? Because I had wondered why they weren't listed with the BBB, I asked if they were considering registering with them. I actually wasn't planning on asking about that, but I needed a minute to think after the first part of the conversation went so poorly. Things only got worse. In the same 'you're an idiot, leave me alone' tone, she said \"All that means is that you paid them a yearly fee.\" So after this friendly and pleasant interaction, I told her thank you anyway and hung up. I'd work on my customer interactions if I were this business owner. Who knows, maybe she was having an off-morning, or maybe my voice reminded her of someone she didn't like.

If you get nothing else from my review, get this: use anyone but Landmark.\n\nThis company dragged my relatively small project on for months. The employees are nice enough, but are unbelievably slow and inept. More than once, I had to call the main office to \"tattle\" on Ben, the project manager, who had gone totally AWOL and would not communicate despite my house being in complete disarray thanks to his project management.\n\nInstalling quarter round proved too difficult for this company. They had to come out over 4 separate times to complete this job. They literally skipped parts of the wall because there was furniture or a floor mat in front of it. They skipped the kitchen entirely. And when they did return to install it there, they literally just left giant gaps in each corner without joining the pieces together. They were dumbfounded that I wanted the quarter round to join at the corners. WTF!\n\nThey destroyed 2 toilet lids by putting tools on them.  They re-seated toilets crooked and rocking and leaking.  They left the closet bolts uncovered and did a caulking job you'd expect from a toddler.\n\nThere are places in the laminate floor with visible gaps between planks. There were gouges in it that they filled with wood filler and called it a day. They did a sloppy paint job in both bathrooms (at least they got the color right, though).\n\nIt was unbelievable how many times these people had to come back to my house to fix their screw-ups and even now, a year later, I'm still finding fresh, mind-boggling issues.\n\nIf you care about your house at all, use someone else.\n\nI would like to add that the owner of the company did reach out to me within 24 hours of my review with apologies and an offer to make it right.

Two days later i got home and I could not believe my eyes. There were two large storage pods in the driveway, all the furniture was removed and stored. All the cabinets and cupboards were removed, the place was completely stripped. There were big fans all over, and the rooms were blocked off from the rest of the house. Once dry, they came in with contractors and started to restore my home. The job when finished was outstanding. I love my new kitchen,  and flooring in the great room and dining room. the site manager was outstanding, he checked with me every day to make sure I was satisfied.

I wish he would have been the project manager on my rebuild. However on the rebuild side.. not so much.. said project manager who I will not mention he knows who he is did not communicate well with the contractors on my rebuild. I had to fix AC vents myself that said project manager had told contractors to fix as I told them not to take down. they taped around them and when they took tape off. they ripped em out... they had no knowledge of it to fix them and were not told.. They damaged my drawer in my kitchen and tried to blame me for it. Broke my kitchen faucet as they should have taken the faucet from the sink.. Instead I find my sink on the floor all willy nilly . On the paint process they puled nails and picture hooks and patched but on other areas they just painted over the pic hooks and so forth. They also painted without using drop cloths on my wood floors and set a paint tray on my wood floor without a drop cloth under it. and I will have to pay someone to pressure wash my front sidewalk as they got paint spatters everywhere when they were cutting and working outside.. They did fix the items in question, drawer faucet and cabinets. but project manager said we will go thru this during the walk thru.. To me it would make sense to take care of this BEFORE THE walk thru.. I am visually impaired and I am glad I had friends to point out stuff they needed to fix.. They got it all fixed but it should have never come to that had the project manager been on the ball. Y'all need to put me on the payroll for this job. and he charged me for a Dump truck that did not get used for hauling away debris.. This was a rebuild no debris to haul away. He got snappy and angry.. \"I am not taking that truck charge off\"  and took it personally when I questioned the Dump truck charge. I am not trying to nickel and dime anyone I just expect things to be as they were before it happened. Said project manager was very aloof and uncaring or understanding. I might be legally blind but I am not stupid. If I was totally blind with no help my place would have been totally jacked up after the sign off. and lastly they put my upper kitchen cabinets in crooked.They had to pull and put in correctly... who does not use a level when putting in cabinets. Very hasty sloppy work that should have been done right the first time.  I understand that folks try to get over on folks like y'all but I just wanted stuff done right..

I had my  rental house flood and it was the worst experience of my life using Serve Pro of Tuscaloosa.I had to call them 3-5 times to even go to the house to get the clean up  process started.Kept being told they was going out to start and when contractors went to give me estimates on repairs there would be no one at the house working on the clean up.They have lied to me several times about my property.Told me several different start and finish dates.They left drying fans in my house 7 days running after they had already cut the drywall and  insulation out. Drew one of the sales guys made up stories about the situation, told my tenant I had told him things when I hadn't even talked to the guy yet and told two different things ones to me and my tenant .I asked Drew why he did this and let him know I would be calling the office and  he proceeded to call my tenant a couple of times and send me a  6 page text over the situation which I found very unprofessional . When I called to complain about this Jacob the owners son took  up for the actions, was rude to me, did not listen to me and acted like I was bothering him.I was told my cabinets needed replaced when they did not. They pulled the vanity out of my master bathroom that did not need pulled out to begin with  without cutting the caulk and when they pulled the vanity it caused the mirror in the bathroom to fall on the sink shattering my mirror and busting my sink in the bathroom and tried to blame it on the heat in the room.I called  David the head of the construction department several times asking a start date and was told no repairs would be started  until they had 18 thousand upfront, Half the cost, and to ask my adjuster to call  his cooperate office and have Fed Ex deliver it to them.I asked my adjuster about it and he said that they did not that money upfront and was beyond shocked I had been told that.They still have their little lock box on my door a week after I told them I will not be using their services anymore, I have called four times to ask to have removed.I have called and asked  three times to speak to the owner of the franchise and got no response. The office staff is not friendly, they have horrible attitudes and make you feel  brushed off.  Brandy the girl in the office is very rude and  blows me off and acts like I'm a bother to her when I call to ask to speak to a manager or owner  . This is the most unprofessional company I have ever came into contact with in my life. And I strongly suggest people think  twice before using them for any reason. You will regret it if you  use this company, trust me on that.They thought since it was an insurance claim they would  take me for a run and rob me and  my insurance company blind and have caused me nothing  but a headache and  added stress from what happened to my home.\n\nChelsea\ndon't know how to reply to you  but this way. I too have a  job.

But then everything got very confusing. We didn't know what was going to happen or when. Then they came in and packed all of our things up, first our clothes and no one told us to keep out any clothes. So we had no clothes blankets or pillows by the time they finished. There was 2 rooms that just had to be cleaned but they threw out our beds and furniture and took out all the carpet. We put notes on two closets and put don't enter.. I found the notes in the floor when we returned. They packed up everything and took it with them but nothing was cleaned it was just in the box they had packed it in.\nThey told us they we're going to clean the duck work, it was not cleaned, the ceiling fans were not cleaned nor were the blinds. We have had to just  about replace everything  we own plus we had use or own  money to eat at the hotel for   for over 2 months. Being nice is great but we had to many people telling us different things..it took a month after we got to come home before they started bring things back. It made difficult to cook. We had to buy new pots just fry an egg.\nWhen they finally brought things back they were very confused about everything because the young guy and 3 woman that packed us up were fired. They didn't seem to know what was ours and what wasn't.  There are quite a few things missing.  Some of the items are antique and can't be replaced.  The thing is these items problem  went to someone else  and they just saw it was old and not there's. Maybe I need to go check the thrift store.  I didn't think this was going to be easy but this has been a nightmare. I have items that have tags on them, but they didn't take them or clean them. My blinds still have soot on them and it is not easy to clean. They we're supposed to clean and check or duct work , not even touched. And we saw the check our insurance sent them and that was way too much for this mess.

Please be sure if dropping off a high ticket item regardless of the emotional state you may be in to get an exchange of a paper trail, the employee\u2019s name, and would even add to take pictures.

For two weeks, we checked every\nday, no workmen.  We were assured we would be back in by Christmas.  We went through three Project Managers, and\nthree different set of drywall and painters.  The first painting crew stood on my washer and dryer to paint the\nceiling in the laundry leaving dents and scratches.  We had stored the liquor from our bar in tubs in the garage,\nas Servpro would not remove alcohol from the home.  Apparently the painters had found it and consumed a great deal\nbefore they were removed from the job by Darin Ingle.  They also got paint all over our floors so Servpro brought\nin commercial scrubbers which removed the finish on all of our floors.\n\nTo shorten this story, I will cut to the return home.  We finally returned to our home in early March with work still\ngoing on, Painting and damaged floors. The first night home the water under the sink of my brand new cabinets\nflooded the kitchen.  They had to send in dryers and a plumber who said it was not hooked up correctly and\nreworked all of the kitchen dishwasher and sink plumbing. They sent in a professional flooring company  to assess\nthe floors. Their solution required us to move back into a hotel for at least a week so they could clean, reseal\nthe tile and recolor the grout.\n\nThe only thing that saved this project was Darin Ingle who arrived on the project in February.  Darin was sent in from another state to resolve the\nproblems at the Montgomery location that included our home.  Darin took the reins, brought in new crews and came\nevery day to ensure the work got back on track and that it was done correctly.  Darin's arrival was months into\nthe project and while we have never sued anyone, we were on the verge of doing just that to get another company\nto come in so we could go home.  I am not sure if Servpro's executives realize that Darin not only saved our project,\nsaved them from a lawsuit but did an amazing job saving their reputation.  I would only call them again if Darin Ingle handled the job.\nBecause of Darin, I am giving Servpro a 2 star rating and Darin a 5.\n\nAn update to my review.  I was contacted by Mr. Bowen, an owner.  Mr. Bowen was determined to do something to do something for All we had been through.  He offered to send in a crew or something.  While his offer was appreciated, we had already fixed many of the issues and did not feel we could ensure another work crew I agreed to think it over and get back with him.  The one thing, as I explained to him, that distressed me everytime I went into the laundry was the dents and scratches on the tops of the washer and dryer which he eagerly agreed to replace.  With much of manufacturing shut down for long periods, appliances are in short supply.  However, Mr. Bowen and Darin Ingle were able to replace order And have new ones installed.  My frustration is no longer renewed when I walk into my laundry room.  My thanks to Mr. Bowen for reaching out and making this a better experience, and to Darin Ingle for making it happen.  It is good to know they cared to make things better.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1600260211243, "text": "Hi Judy, I am one of the owners and I am terribly sorry to hear about your experience.

Paid for tile cleaning and grout sealing. Crew had to come out 3 times in one day to attempt to fix and finish. First, they forgot to seal the shower that we paid $90 for them to do. Then, we noticed a film all over every single tile that would not come up; Technician did NOT allow the tile and grout to dry before spraying grout sealer..Then, did not wipe off the excess grout sealer, just left it all over each and every tile. 3rd trip out of same day to day to try and fix it, they used every chemical, scrubber machine, everything they had to try and get it off, guess what, didn't work. So now, my grout is wet UNDER the sealer, which never had proper curing time, because they did not let the grout dry before applying, and my tiles have giant stains, splotches, blobs all over every single one because they did not remove the sealer from the tile after spraying the grout. And on top of it, one of the technicians decided that no, all of my white grout was actually completely stained before they got here that's why it's dark (Not because it was wet, which was the case)..He ended up arguing with me and cursing at me. So corporate will be getting a call this afternoon. Floors look 10x worse than what they did before they were out.

They were worried that they would not be able to correct the damage I had done,  so Dane went into great detail about what to expect (he did not want me to be disappointed).  After much discussion, I told him to \"go for it\".  He did a superb job of fixing what I had messed up with his corrective cleaning technique.  He cleaned to rest of the floor sparking clean and fresh.  The results were much better than I expected and I am very happy with his hard work and diligence in making certain I was fully informed about potential upside and downside of the process.

He didnt even fully inspect the job, he didnt want to get dirty. So, I called Restoration One to get a different quote. Jeff came out and put on a saftey suit and actually went in the crawl space to accuratley inspect the problem. Well he found a mold issue just beginning and brought it to my attention and also pointed out the reason i asked them to come, to check ansewage clean up, he said wasnt necessary for him to do if i had the time to do it myself. Cost me about $100, compared to $2500. So ofcourse I went with this company to do the mold removal. They were on time and respectful, always kept in touch and kept me up to date with the job. They did an excellent job. If you are in the position of trying to find a company who will be honest and not take advantage of you, this is the one.

In the mist of the Pandemic Crisis, our washer and kitchen sink overflowed and flooded a large area of our home. Blake and team arrived at my home the very next day. They worked as a team and set about examining the situation.  They were careful to inform me and my wife of each situation and problem found. They worked to remove damaged cabinets, flooring, and drywall.  Blake painstakingly worked to remove cabinets and countertops without more damage to each of the items.  Over the next several days, Blake continued to check on our situation and closely monitored how our situation was improving.  He amazed me not only with his efficient clean-up but with his knowledge about what was needed. Blake was especially helpful in explaining what had happened and the steps they were taking. He is very helpful and conscientious. Thank you for sending such a dedicated individual (Blake) and a great team that supports him.  It was awesome to see such compatibility in the mist of our crisis.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88628ddf3b6b933b:0xf8def96c6bcd5f60"}
