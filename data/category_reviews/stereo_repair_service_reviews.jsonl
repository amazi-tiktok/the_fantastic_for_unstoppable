DOES NOT REFUND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY  WHEN HE DOES NOT REPAIR YOUR  ITEM. YOU WILL  STILL HAVE A BROKEN ITEM AND LOSE MONEY.  VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!! MY opinion  a total SCAM  ARTIST.  TAKES MONEY AND DOESN'T REPAIR  YOUR ITEM!!   How can you  do people like that?? I hope karma  treats you the way you treat your customers. You sir are what is wrong with this world, people trust you to do  the job you are paid to do, fix their items. Instead you don't fix their item and keep their money. In my opinion  that is stealing, you didn't earn the money!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88929267ca8160bf:0x7f02642ec9910a5"}

I hired him to repair the circuit board in my welder. Paid him for the job, which only half of it was done. Asked him to replace all of the capacitors on the board. He did not. He left a diode that he had cut loose. The soldering was the worst looking hack jobs I have ever seen. He picked up the board and was paid $90 initially to check it on the machine. I had to drive to Dothan to retrieve it from him and paid the balance of $145. Installed the board and the welder has no output at all now. Originally agreed upon price was $220. When I got the board back the diode was never reconnected, the solder joints were ridiculously poor. And the welder still does not work. He came out and wanted another $25 to \u201ccheck\u201d the board again. He came and \u201cchecked\u201d the board again. He said there is another bad part on the board. How could there be another bad part if he checked the whole board. So after seeing the poor workmanship displayed. I asked for a partial refund. He said no. So now I am out $235 and my welder still doesn\u2019t work. If I had only known that he couldn\u2019t do the job to start with, I would never have hired him to do it. This guy does not know what he is doing! Please save your hard earned money. Seek out a professional. Don\u2019t get screwed like I did!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88929267ca8160bf:0x7f02642ec9910a5"}

We set up an appointment at 4 the same day. I drove from Daleville with a 60 inch tv (very heavy to lug down a flight of stairs during a storm) to get it fixed. When we got there it was a little past 4 so I called him on his phone. He said he was on a service call and to wait for him til 5. Okay sure. So we drove around for a bit before coming back at 5. We tried calling but he wouldn\u2019t answer pick up.we waited out there til 6:25 and tried calling a few more times before giving up. If you run a Business and set up an appointment please be professional about it. Because not only did you waste my time but you wasted my gas and that\u2019s money. :/ the least that could have been done was to set up an appointment for another day or at least tell us you were too busy or something. Ignoring customers is not the answer.\n\nEdit 1/3: he messaged us to repair our tv a few days after the above incident. We let him take it. He stole our tv and closed his business. What a scam.
