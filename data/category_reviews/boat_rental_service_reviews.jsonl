They have a modern web presence, very organized process for collecting information, and just overall seemed way more together than I was used to.

Their boats are all newer and in great shape, and on top of that each member of the team we worked with - both over the phone and in person - could not have been nicer.

Lights didn't work. (didn't need them) but if we did- too bad. I would question if fire-extinguisher would have worked and I didn't look for all the floating devices.  Boat seemed out of balance too. Not really complaining. We had a good time. My point is why not have everything in good working order. As a one time a year boater I didn't notice the other things until we were underway.  That is my fault. It's like renting a car. I expect the tires to be good, safety belts, breaks etc. I don't care if the lights aren't needed or can't be used. If we broke down and needed assistance - and it was after dusk/dark. We'd have no way to show our location. Using our phones should be an option, not a requirement. Having a working Horn is a requirement. I didn't leave a review to argue. I left a review because I received an email from you guys. I stated facts. I am not saying I wouldn't use your rental again.

They scam people and they refuse to own up to anything. We rented a boat through OB Water Sports (charge was through FH*Southern Rose) and the boat was faulty. They tried to blame us and we barely even got it out of a no wake zone and we were never able to use the tube we also rented in a separate purchase. We immediately called and told them there was a problem with the boat and it would not accelerate. Before we even told them what it was doing, Blake (who works for OB Water Sports), said we must have hit bottom and damaged the prop, but we never did and we no that for a fact. We also did not give him enough information for him to have any idea what was wrong. We called them 35 minutes after we left the boat slip (and we had been in a no wake zone for 33 minutes). We asked if they could bring us another boat and he said he didn\u2019t have one and he didn\u2019t have a way to even come to us. He said we would need to bring the boat back for him to replace the prop (which again he told us was the problem before we even gave him any details). We had 6 children with us that were so disappointed since we never got to do anything and it took us 1 hour and 20 minutes to get back to the dock because we could not go more than 5 MPH because the boat was not working properly.\nWhen we got back to the OB Water Sports, Blake told us immediately that the prop was messed up and we must have done it, but again, we know for a fact that we did not hit bottom. We had 4 people on board with boating experience and we know that did not happen.\nWe asked him for a refund and he said they don\u2019t do refunds. We told him that the boat did not work, but he kept making excuses. He told us we could take the other boat they had  for 1 1/2 hours because that was all the time left until 6pm which is when he had to go home. We asked to speak to the owner and refused to get him or tell us his name. He said if he gave us his name, he would be fired. We asked what other options we had and he said we could take the other boat (which he all of sudden had available...even though he didn\u2019t when we called). We told him it would take us 30 minutes to get back out of the no wake zone, so we would have 30 minutes before we had to bring the boat back). He said that wasn\u2019t his problem. He can\u2019t control the Alabama water speed limits. We kept asking for him to please work with us to...give us different day or more time today, but he refused. He also told us this happens every day and they never do refunds.\nWe then asked if he would refund the tube rental since we were never able to even put it in the water and he immediately said...no refunds.\nHe told us twice that this happens every day!!! His excuses sounded rehearsed...like he has said the same thing to customers multiple times.\n\nWe feel like this was a breach of contract because they provided a faulty product!!!!

Attendant who took us to boat offered very little introduction re: safety or operation of boat. Reason they didn't want to show us anything became evident once we left the dock - while the boat runs, none of electronics including gas gauge were operational. No GPS, no air horn, no depth finder, no speedometer. Only noisemaker for event of emergency was a filthy old whistle taken apparently from a life jacket. When we realized almost immediately, we called - receptionist cut us off to say none of that stuff works. She assured us we had a full tank of gas, but was unconcerned that critical safety components of a boat they rented out were broken. Boat's speed was severely hampered by dysfunctional engine, which made it difficult to get anywhere in our allotted time, or to make it back to business by return time.

Imagine my surprise, when we fished with Captain Dan aboard the Explorer. What a difference! The Captain put us on fish, and knew when and where to move to keep the action consistent, and stayed out a bit longer than planned to ensure everyone had a good shot at a catch. The crew, from First mate Jason to Julie, Steve, and Ashton, the entire team was first rate. They were fun, lively, VERY helpful and worked hard to keep lines in the water and made sure everyone was attended to, with bait, and fish removal as well as quickly fixing tangles, and kept everyone fishing.\nBy far the hardest working, and most attentive crew in Party boat fishing.!!

As we walked up the stairway to the upper deck to view the dolphins there were no benches or any permanent seating just the cheap white lawn chairs you buy at Dollar General. This not such a big deal but very in professional looking. Second of All as soon as we sit down in our lawn chair we noticed there were way to many people on the upper deck for the amount of chars provided. This was due to the lower deck witch is enclosed and air conditioned smelling like raw sewege. We not talking about a little stick, it was so bad not one person could stay inside and by the end of the trip the smell was leaking out of the lower deck and was ingulfing us on the stairway outside on the boat.This was my chief complaint just due to the fact I have 3 small children that use the bathroom a lot and I was having to go in and out of this stink a lot!! Also could have seen more dolphins from the beach and we had got a lot more close to the dolphins the day before fishing. It was hour into the trip before we seen a dolphin 200yds away.

Which will come off just by operating this boat. I asked exactly what damage had been done to the prop, and I was told I had damaged the (Stuff) inside the the propeller.  When asked which part? Like, shaft, bearings, gears, or seals! He was confused and only could explain that if the paint was gone the lower unit was damaged! The boat was returned in perfect working condition. But I was still charged an additional 75$. I bought this mistake. There is no need for u to do so as well. Consider someone else for your rental needs or be prepared to pay an additional 75$ God Bless!

It does not come off at all unless you drag  4000 Lbs boat thru the sand. It\u2019s a lot of wear and tear.\nPrior every departure, there is 15min orientation on video which clearly explain the operation around sandbars,\nthe GPS shallow water alarm and there is a special section informing you if you run into the sand there is a $75 charge. No hidden fees, everything is loud and clear upfront.\nI would like to believe, We have it almost foolproof, There is GPS which color-marks shallower waters less than  6 feet in blue color, Deep water is white color. You go less than 3 feet \u2013alarm sounds.\nWhile cruising sandbars are bright yellow visible from a distance by untrained eye.\n\nWe specifically ask in the video to not beach the boat due to our shallow access. We ask to keep the boat floating in at least 2 feet of water with motor trimmed up.\nI am sorry my helper Stahl was not able properly explain the damage of the Propeller\u2019s  hub.\n(Rubber and composite bushing between the transmission drive shaft and Prop it\u2019s self)\nThis is a sacrificial part to protect $ 2,600 lower unit.  Can\u2019t be seen by eye, it\u2019s inside the prop.\nCost of this Power-tech hub is $ 69.00 plus $ 6.00 shipping, labor 45 min on my end \u2013 No charge.\nIf prop shop does it, cost is $ 280.00 .  Damage does not stop here, as the propeller work in the sand the blades loosing the cup.

I had called several other places but they were either booked, didn't sound interested at all, or were very rude. Brooks at Wahoo talked to us like a personal friend, fixed us up with a brand new pontoon and treated us like royalty when we arrived. We loved the boat. It was so nice and roomy and we just had the most incredible time. We took food aboard, fished a little, spent time looking at all the porpoises following us and came in about 5 p.m. with the joy of an incredible family time together.  My daughter replied, \"Best day ever, Dad!!!\" Such a special thanks is in order to Brooks who made this day so special for us.  Forget about all the other places that promise you the moon.  Ole Brooks delivered!! We will be back next year and the first place we will call to book our boat will be Wahoo Watersports. Did I mention that it was incredible?
