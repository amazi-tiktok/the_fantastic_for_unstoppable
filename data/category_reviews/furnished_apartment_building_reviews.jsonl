The gym was often dirty and provided no disinfectant spray or paper towels. I notified the office and they cleaned the gym and provided supplies, but within a couple of weeks the gym was dirty again and out of supplies. As a result, I started going to another gym. On another occasion, I was having recurring noise problems from a neighbor. I contacted the office four times about this issue and they did not do anything about it until I was able to email them a video of how loud the noise was. Lastly, in the middle of my lease, the business started using a new payment system that charges the residents almost $20 as a \u201cservice fee\u201d to simply pay their bill. The worst part about this was that The Beacon did not tell the residents about this new policy. It was up to the residents to figure it out.

But from August this year(2020), The Beacon started to use Simplebills and it would mandatory charge a \u201cmonthly fee\u201d for no reason. It seems like If I don\u2019t creat an account of Simplebills, I can\u2019t get my new parking permit card. I went to the office and asked once, the manager just seems like didn\u2019t want to solve it(monthly fee) seriously, and just told me to call the Simplebills\u2019s service people. Before went to the office, I emailed them twice to ask about the \u201cmonthly fee\u201d, but got no reply. I was very disappointed. For now I still will be charged a \u201cmonthly fee\u201d every month.\nAnd the most important thing is that the microwave in my apartment doesn\u2019t work for over three months, the maintenance staff came to fix it twice but still doesn\u2019t work.

Since I\u2019ve started living they\u2019ve had 3 different general managers. Their assistant manager left so they went without one from November until April. This property is completely unorganized. Once one general manager leaves they don\u2019t leave hardly any notes for the new general managaer to work off of. I had a terrible roommate for most of this time. She was breaking the lease and I brought it to their attention and they didn\u2019t want to handle it. The last general manager Angel was awesome. She handled everything exactly how it should be. The new general manager April is amazing also. She handles everything in a timely manner and makes you feel like she cares and actually listens to you. Some of the community assistants are fantastic but others aren\u2019t. Luke is amazing and will treat you with kindness and respect no matter what. He\u2019s always super nice and very willing to do whatever he can do to help you. There is a community assistant who is very rude and isn\u2019t very helpful. This person was nice at first when I got my tour but when this person was handling the issues I would have they would tell me that they would get back to me on a certain day and wouldn\u2019t. I would have to reach back out to this person to get them to fix whatever issue was present. This person also refused to let my stepmother talk to a manager. This person left my stepmother on multiple holds to talk to the manager when this person should\u2019ve let my stepmother (who\u2019s name is on the lease) talk to the manager herself like she asked to. This person also doesn\u2019t really make an effort to listen to you or show that they care in any capacity. Very cold individual and very emotionless. I wouldn\u2019t live at this property ever again unless they cleared out all office staff except for a few individuals like Luke, April, and a couple of other community assistants who\u2019ve actually been helpful and kind. The maintenance staff is impeccable. The 2 men I\u2019ve worked with in the past have been wonderful and awesome. One of the men had to come to my apartment at around 10PM for an emergency and I never felt uncomfortable or wary of him being in my apartment  late because he is super kind, respectful, and will get the job done and do it well! The older man who is on the maintenance crew is also super kind and helpful... he\u2019s never come into my apartment to do any maintenance while I was home but he did when I wasn\u2019t there and he did an amazing job and got my new washer/dryer in super quickly, locked my door back, and didn\u2019t leave a mess!! If you plan on living at this community with someone you know well and won\u2019t have issues with and don\u2019t need to go to the office for anything you will be good but if not I do not reccomend living here. I\u2019m moving in August and I\u2019m disappointed because I like and appreciate so many members of the staff there but a couple of rude employees will ruin your experience especially if you have issues with anything big. But I do have a feeling that April is here to stay and she is a wonderful general manager so you might could get her help instead of a couple of the rude community assistants. Rooms are small. Bathrooms are gross. The lining between the bottom of my bathtub and floor was coming off when I moved in. There was dead bugs in my room when I moved in. There are paint brush strokes on the granite and on the white baseboards and also on the floors. The desk was stained with some white stuff. The grout in the shower was dirty. The kitchen was disgusting. Living room is a nice size. The kitchen is tiny. Not enough space for anymore than 2 people to live happily in one of these apartments. I lived in a 3 bedroom and we were constantly all over each other. There simply isn\u2019t enough space in the kitchen for 3 people and all their food. The pantry is also too small. Hardly any storage space. The bottom of the cabinet under the sink is rotting because of a water leak and has been that way since I moved in. It smells absolutely disgusting.

I have never called the police on any one, I have never identified someone for the police, and I have never filed a formal complaint against a person. Normally I would not respond to a review, but since you have explicitly mentioned my name on such a public forum, claiming that I was the cause of such a horrid event, I wanted a chance to rectify my name. Again, I am not claiming that this event did not occur, but I want to make it clear that I was never apart of it.\n\nThank you,\n\nBrandon Ray", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3bb507f5291:0x66f31486c15f55b2"}

HONESTLY, I would not live here unless it is a last resort. The prices they are asking people to pay, considering the size and age of the apartments here, is absolutely ludicrous. Maintenance is decent, but sometimes the delays result from things the management can't help (i.e. waiting for parts from an outside source, requiring contractors, etc.). Management isn't the best and will absolutely do their best to screw you. (I.E. I renewed for an unfurnished apartment - the new management told me they were going to put furniture of their own in the apartment. I e-mailed and told them that I had signed for an unfurnished apartment so I would not allow any of their furniture into the apartment (because of pets). Amber, the GM, e-mailed and said that nowhere in my lease specified that I had an unfurnished apartment. She said this because she wasn't aware that I had a copy of the lease which clearly displayed an X beside an unfurnished lease.) I sincerely recommend ANYWHERE else to live because the cost and headache of the management just isn't worth it. My water bill for one month was $80, another was $60 and they are still working on reimbursing me. (The water bill is split between the four people, so there is no way we racked up a $320 water bill).  They have a record of losing payments, and charging late fees because management was too lazy to process the payments on time. I implore you not to live here. Their computer lab printer HARDLY ever works, and they've decided to start making residents supply their own paper.

Also, I had to pay $100 each month for a \"short term lease\", but I kind of understand that because they probably can't rent the apartment during the year again.\nThe only thing I had a lot of problems was the electric bill: I only charged my tablet and my phone, while my roommates were always on the playstation and the computer, were listening to music through a big stereo and their TVs were always on. The Beacon doesn't charge the power directly, in every room somebody has to sign up at Alabama Power. Of course, my roommates wanted to split the bill even (which already brought a lot of discussions)... And one roommate just left in the middle of the semester without saying anything and, of course, without paying the electric bill. In the end, Alabama Power cutted off our power and I had no choice but to pay a lot of the others' power.....

The management is very helpful and maintenance is very good at getting to your request within a few days. The pool is nice but could use to be cleaned more. The exercise room is nice but needs more treadmills because one of them is either broken or always in use. The tanning bed is awesome and they are even nice enough to provide goggles if you need them. The only negative thing about this apartment is the card keys you use instead of regular door keys. You might think it's great at first, but trust me, you'll grow to hate them by the end. You can't just close your door to walk your dog without your card. If you forget your card, you have to get a lock out key and if the office is closed, you have to call the after hours number and it can take a while for someone to get back to you about a lockout. I wish I could have a normal lock on my door with a normal key. It's nice to have a tiger transit and we are the second stop which is great because it can fill up in the mornings and you don't want to have to be standing on your way to campus.

Management randomly decided to change all the locks on the bedroom doors and they expected you to come get your new key on their terms. They left one note in the door saying it would be done the next week but didn't tell you what day your apartment was going to be changed and expected you to pick up your key that day during business hours. I work out of town a lot and didn't come home sometimes for a couple days at a time and got home very late sometimes so I didn't even see the notice until the day before this was done. There was no email or phone call (even though they made sure to call/email me at least 4 times a week asking if I wanted to renew my freaking lease.) So I call the office, from out of town, the day the lock is changed and told them that I wouldn't be home before the office closed and tried to see if I could get my key given to my roommate (who works in the office and I've lived with for 6 years, so I trust) or maybe get it put in the mailbox. They wouldn't let me do anything and I left several messages for the manager who refused to call me back. Finally after calling over and over again I get the manager, Amber, on the phone and she tells me that I can call the on call number when I get home that night and pay the $50 fee to get let into my room. So you mean to tell me that I pay $555 to rent this room and because you decided you want to randomly change the locks for no reason I now have to pay $50 more for you to let me in? I don't think so. After arguing with Amber about not paying the fee she finally agreed to let me sign a piece of paper stating that I consented to let her leave my bedroom door unlocked and she would personally do the change so she would make sure to leave it unlocked and I would just have to pick up the new key the next day. I wrote it up and emailed it to her immediately after getting off the phone with her and she confirmed that it was received. Fast forward to later that night, I get home and the damn door is LOCKED.  I also tried to call the parent company to speak with someone higher up about this issue while not being able to get in touch with Amber all day and the receptionist there told me \"she didn't know what I wanted her to do about it, she was getting off in 15 minutes\" then after telling her that she needed to do SOMETHING about it TODAY, she said she would have someone call me and I never heard from anyone from there again, so don't even bother trying to go higher up.

Pet friendly\n\nBad things:\nThe apartments are VERY small, good luck fitting a bed larger than a full in the rooms. Whoever manages this property doesn't care too much about making sure the units are kept up. You can tell each year when they repaint the walls they just paint over the plug plates instead of removing them. As a result you can't use every plug because it'll be too caked in paint for the plug to fit. There is also painting drippings around the border of the room, from them not putting anything down to cover the carpet before painting. This wouldn't be an issue, but the carpets are a brown/black fabric so the white spots stand out like a chocolate sprinkle on vanilla ice cream.The appliances are old. The kitchen is literally stuffed in a corner, and the counter space is awful. If you have a microwave on the counter good luck fitting much else. Pest control, if they even come, must use water when they spray because you will have bugs!!! They'll come from everywhere, the windows, the shower, the sink, wherever! So if you don't like bugs I'd suggest finding another place to live. They recently painted the buildings and claim to have renovated the apartments, this isn't true. All they did was put in new mattresses and living room furniture. The walls are paper thin....so thin I can hear my roommate snoring in the next room. And if you have someone above, forget everyday being peaceful and quiet. They could be walking from the kitchen to their bedroom and it'll sound like a herd of cattle are moving around above you. Not only are the units noisy for lack of insulation, this place is like the party spot. So if you like to spend your nights studying at home, you might as well hang it up here. Someone will always be partying, riding around with loud music, yelling, whatever. But at the same time this can be expected from a lot of living places in a college town.\n\nI lived here very briefly and moved on to somewhere nicer and quieter. I would never live there again, you couldn't pay me to live there again. In all I'd look around for somewhere else to live, and come here only as a last resort.\nHope this helps!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3bb507f5291:0x66f31486c15f55b2"}

There's a Tiger Transit stop, and it only takes about 15 minutes to get to class, so it doesn't get much better than that. Other than that, the apartment you'll be living in is nothing like the model they show you. It's pretty much luck of the draw: I got one of the nicer apartments where mostly everything worked, but my boyfriend's apartment had the linoleum coming up in the bathroom and mushrooms growing out of his bathroom wall because of the mold. Management does not care about fixing any damages; in one apartment, the crown molding had been scratched off because of a past resident's dog, but all they did was paint over it. The space you're getting is nice, but be prepared for something to break, and I've had instances where my roommate and I both put in over 5 maintenance requests for just one issue before they came to fix it, and we've even had to call the office. Walls are paper thin, and you can hear your neighbor's conversations through the walls; you can even hear the person above you using the bathroom. The place uses key cards, like a hotel, instead of actual keys, which seems cool at first but eventually, it's a nightmare. You'll lose them, or they'll break, in which case you're charged money for a new one. God forbid the front office is closed because the person who is on call to come and help you usually takes a long time and seems more bothered than anything that you called. As a resident, I've had my car towed before (even though there was a parking permit in my car), and I had to pay $100 to get it back, but the office didn't seem to care. People who don't even live at the complex come here to throw parties or use the pool, and once again, the office doesn't check or care. I've seen bunches of young children in the pool during the summer who I know are not college students living here. Parties are constantly being thrown after hours, but the person on call seems more annoyed that they're being bothered to do their job, so the police usually end up getting called. Amenities are pretty cool, and there are always fun events being had for residents, but the printer in the computer lab, never, EVER works, and even if it does, there are residents who use the computers in the front office to watch movies, listen to loud music, or play games for days on end, and nothing is ever done about it.

The whole process was horrible because you would ask the employees questions and they never had the answer and during the weekend the manager was not there at least when I called. During this awful process I still kept going with the process. Fast forward to Monday I have spoken with that office over 10xs. I receive a call from Taylor saying everything was good to go and I can move in Tuesday 4/25/17 and I would just have to bring payment of 102.00. I was excited despite the issues with the process. I packed my car that night and was handing off my key today Tuesday 4/25/17 to my old place. Amber the General manager sends me an application for my son and I fill it out. I then arrive at the beacon with the money order ready to bring my stuff upstairs since I was already told I could move in. Amber then tells me since my Son is 13 months which still means he is a 1 yr. old I can not move in after yesterday I was told everything was approved and I could move in. Now I have my car packed with no where to go so Now I am homeless with a one year old. I have to spend money at a hotel so my son can have somewhere to sleep after the beacon told me I can move in and then takes it back.

At first glance the facility is well maintained and there was some upgrading going on the last time I was there, thats a positive. The negative I experienced was with  an individual who should have been representing the facility but instead discredited it. As a good father should I was loading my daughters furniture on my trailer to get her moved out of her apartment on 28 Jul 2016. While fastening the cargo down I saw a golf cart pull up behind me and a short round heavy set young man rolled off the cart and started running his mouth about something as he headed into the buildings breezeway. He stopped short of the building and started saying somethingto the effect of \"I bet your having a better day today then you did the other nite\" and\" I'll make sure you dont ever get the chance to,\" l continued with securing the load. I then asked my daughter what was that guy talking about and why was he taunting her. She said he lived above her and it was something that happened 2 or 3 nights earlier, I then asked is he a resident or does he work there, she said both. I told her if it wasnt for her moving out I would file a complaint with the office. It was as if he was trying to start a confrontation but let it be known he was in charge. He came out of the 2nd floor apartment headed towards the golf cart, mumbled something else, but before he could leave another young man standing on a scaffold at the building next to hers. He went back to the cart and left, a minute or so later my daughter and her friend left in her car and was behind them in my truck w/trailer. As I headed out of the complex an Auburn police vehicle was heading in. I stopped and waved the officer to pass in front of me, he waved back and continued. I got on College headed towards I-85 and was pulled over, questioned about making threats against an employee at the complex, told I was identified as the one that made the threats, my truck was identified as the vehicle that was involved, forced to stand outside of my vehicle while another officer went and got Mr Brandon Ray, the accuser, so he could identify me. Well long and longer story shortened, Mr Ray in his haste to re-inflate a situation from 2-3 nites earlier decided to call the police and put a new flame on a already extinguished iincident,  ironically against a wrong person. Not to mention that whatever had happened earlier was taken care of by the authorities nites earlier, the proper authorities !!! The whole thing was sorted out, the police explained the misunderstandings I said I understood however it was totally unnecessary, we shook hands and went our seperate ways. However, in my 90 minutes of unnecessary detainment and somewhat mild harassment I decided that Mr Ray should learn from the error in his ways. It was the \"right thing to do\" to use local law enforcement to handle non conforming residents or guests of residents a few nites earlier for whatever reason. When you represent a multi million dollar apartment complex always be a part of the solution and not the problem. It is the \"right thing to do\" to exercise the authorities to uphold and maintain rules and regulations of the property you work for and represent. It is \"not the right thing to do\" to taunt or badger residents or guests for any reason. It is \"not the right thing to do\" when you attempt to recreate a bad incident so you can change or control the outcome !!! I sincerely hope the owners of this complex takes a hard look at the many many negative things written in the reviews about the management team of the The Beacon. I hope they get proactive and make some necessary changes. I would not recommend spending money here until so. I would also recommend that if Mr Ray is going to continue working for them, he take some courses on professionalism, stay off that golf cart and do some walking. This will allow him to become better at dealing with the people who pay his wages.\nThis was my experience and my opinion.\nThanks, Contributing parent of the class 2017 & 2019", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3bb507f5291:0x66f31486c15f55b2"}

My family and I moved from a large neighborhood with an expensive mortgage to Peppertree Apartments over five years ago.  Our intent was to \"downsize\" in order to afford to put our two kids through college, debt free.  What a great idea!\nOur expenses at Peppertree Apartments are less than half of what we were paying, and we don't have to mow the grass, clean the pool, or keep up with any of the outside chores we used to have when we were homeowners!  Apartment life DOES have its advantages!\nThe complex has changed ownership 3 times since we first lived here, and currently it is run by a staff that really cares about their clients.  Our packages are received in the rental office and stored until we can pick them up.  Maintenance issues are usually handled within 24 hours.  Major repairs are taken care of --- or else the unit or appliance is replaced.\nPets are welcome, but management requires them to be on a leash when outside.  Neighbors get to know each other.  The staff throws occasional parties to encourage social interaction with new and old neighbors alike!\nAll in all, I recommend Peppertree Apartments for the 1) friendly staff, 2) prompt attention to maintenance and safety; and 3) the AWESOME convenience to everything in the Peppertree/Sturbridge area.  EastChase is just minutes away.  You can walk to the Walmart Neighborhood Market or several restaurants nearby.  Most of the stores are \"pet friendly,\" so you have no excuse not to walk your pooch!\nKids are always having fun playing, neighbors watch out for their safety, the tennis court is newly renovated, and the living is easy.

Unfortunately, things changed.  Maintenance orders do not get repaired-when I was finally able to reach someone in the office to ask about my 3+ week old maintenance order the response was \"oh, we don't check those messages.\"  I received two warnings for throwing cigarette butts on the ground; when I said \"I don't smoke I think those butts are my downstairs neighbors (who did smoke) the response was \"don't you live upstairs?\"  When I said yes I was told \"then they are your butts.\"  When I turned in my notice, I was sent a letter listing the things I needed to do prior to move out and to get my security deposit returned.  Three weeks after sending me the letter confirming they had received my notice the office manager told the new company I was trying to lease from that I had not given a notice; Peppertree was not aware I planned on moving.  The day I signed my lease with Peppertree I paid a $300.00 pet fee, provided a picture of my pet, and provided my pets vet records.  When my new landlord called for a reference he was told Peppertree did not know I had a pet.  It has now been four months since I moved from Peppertree; I have called eight times to ask about my security deposit.  Eight times I have been told \"the manager is at lunch I will have her call you back.\"  I finally sent an email to the management company.  After sending the email, the Peppertree manager did call me; she told me they did owe me my security deposit and a check would be cut on July 17 or 24th.  Well, it is now August 3rd and no check.  I called today and the manager told me \"the cycle of checks for July 24th were not cut.  I'll call you by the end of the day to let you know when you can expect your check.\"  Unfortunately a place that started out so great turned into a nightmare.

The number one concern we have had is outside of our building the ground stays flooded, even when it has not rained which may be part of the water damage we have had. When we moved into the apartment there was water damage all around the windows in the living room, my husband contacted the office and they sent someone out to \"take care\" of the issue, when we came back to the apartment they had just painted over the water damage. We had water damage under the kitchen sink which we reported to the front office, they sent someone out a few weeks later to replace the wood. We later found out that the reason the wood under the since had water damage was due to the dishwasher was flooding the kitchen, when we called about that issue it took weeks to have someone come look at it and then a few more weeks for the dishwasher to be replaced. For several months our outside lights did not work, we have had roaches since we moved in, after reporting that several times the pest control people came out and I was told that what they spray when they come out would do nothing for the roaches we had and they were not even aware we had roaches or they could have used other solutions to get rid of them. The guest bathroom toilet has broken several times and they finally after 6 weeks they came out and just super glued the piece back together.

For Mobile, they are nice, updated, and spacious. When we first moved in, we were extremely satisfied with the place: great customer service, nice grounds, and quick response to maintenance requests. However, after three or so months, an up stairs neighbor moved in with two kids. We could hear EVERYTHING. For the price, you would think that the walls wouldn\u2019t be so paper thin. I could hear conversations, the garbage disposal (not to mention it would even rattle the ceiling), I would hear when they vacuumed, their kids would sound like a marching band all hours of the day/night. I\u2019ve lived in apartments before, but I have never experienced anything like that. Even cheaper apartments never sounded like that. I had a new born and only wondered if my neighbors could here him cry at night. Towards the end of our lease (month 12-13), we started to feel stuffy in the master bedroom and ended up discovering black mold around the windows (in both the master and guest bedrooms). I wish I would have gotten a picture, but between the move and living with my parents for most of the last month, I forgot. Lastly, upon moving out, we were told that we did not owe anything after a walk through inspection. the girl who assisted us, I think her name is Sarah not sure, only requested that we check the tubs (which are super cheap and hard to clean) and the oven. After we checked those and cleaned those, we signed a paper stating we did not owe anything. A week later we received an email stating we owed $468.26 in carpet damages. The girl who did our walk through tried saving herself and told the manger that she told us about the carpet; however, she only mentioned the oven and tubs. I believe I could have gotten the carpet clean (only 4-5 little spots).

Now they have remodeled with plank flooring (mimics wood) and these apartments were not\ndesigned for that. If you move here you better get an apartment on the top floor. Even before with carpet I could somewhat hear my neighbors upstairs and next to me due to the walls being paper thin, but now it's 100 times worse. Now it sounds like a zoo above me. Even the new neighbor above me stopped me and asked if the noise was bad. I guess he heard me banging on the walls because it was driving me crazy. They woke me up at 2:30 am the other morning and I'm sure they heard me banging the walls and cursing at the top of my lungs. They do have a new baby that constantly runs all day and night. The sad thing is I read reviews of others complaining to Management about this and when I asked about it on two separate occasions, two different members of Management lied to me and said they haven't received complaints when I know for a fact they have. With these new floors, it's not just noise that's bad, it's miserable because you can feel the vibration as they walk around. It's nerve racking and when I complained one response I got was \"well it's no different than when it was carpet\". Trust me, it's different. Typical BS... staff taking it personally and don't want to take a complaint seriously.\n\nThe next issue I have which, seems very minuscule with the noise issues, is that about 8 or 9 months ago they had the fire alarm company doing some maintenance work. Several of the apartments required them to actually come in and cut hole in the ceiling in the living area. They said that Management had a list of apartments that required this and they would be coming back around to fix it. So, not only was there a hole the size of of an iPad, the contractor was a klutz and dropped his drill, hammer, and other tools a few times, and caused the pipe to leak from the ceiling onto the carpet, which I handled my self. When he dropped the tools he scuffed the walls, and put a few noticeable dings in the sheet rock. He stated that it would be all fixed. Well a couple of weeks go by and I asked staff about it and they acted like they had no idea but they would come out and fix everything. That never happened. A month or so goes by and I ask again. Finally got someone from Maintenance to come by and at least patch the whole in the ceiling so i wouldn't have to look at pipes and worry about a rat or some other creature falling out of the whole while I'm watching TV. Well after he patched in the ceiling, that's the last I heard from them regarding this issue. The hole never got smoothed out and never got the ceiling textured. I went to look at a model home with the head manager and I asked about my ceiling stuff and she said she would have someone come out. I asked if I needed to put in a maintenance request so they wouldn't forget but she told me that was not necessary. That never got fixed and I just got tired of asking about it.\n\nI've got nothing negative to say about the maintenance crew. On the few occasions I needed something they've always been prompt and resolved all maintenance related issues.\n\nSo basically, I'm paying a thousand bucks a month for a two bedroom apartment and I've got to look at a hole in my ceiling and dings in my walls. But nothing tops the noise issue. It is terrible. I'm miserable every day and it's driving me nuts.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1549301156563, "text": "Scot, we hate to see that you are having such a negative experience and are looking into this further.

I\u2019m on the 7th floor and I can hear people having normal level conversations outside. The parking deck is awful. People speed, it\u2019s hard to maneuver around, and people are constantly parking in the deck without decals and parking in spots that are not actual spots therefore blocking other people in. There\u2019s also no guest parking so if you have friends they probably won\u2019t be coming over. They also have the WORST staff and management I\u2019ve ever dealt with. I got locked out of my room one night and tried calling the emergency after hour numbers multiple times and they never answered so I slept on our couch. Some of them are nice but most are incompetent and even rude. The manager Christina is rude and mean. She literally yelled at me before I moved in and was scolding me like a child. I honestly don\u2019t see how she still has a job here because she\u2019s terrible. Really, the only good thing about living here is the location, and sometimes they give us free food.

At Evolve, move-in resembled a WWE Royal Rumble. Entering the deck on move-in day took two hours. The lines for the elevator were longer than those for Space Mountain, so we had to climb the stairs with our arms full of heavy boxes. I had lived in the dorms at Auburn previously, and they staggered the move-in days. The management at Evolve, however, thought it was a great idea to have 1000 people show up all at once trying to cram their stuff up the building.\n\nThe management is not so much malevolent as they are incompetent. They are unknowledgeable and unprofessional. My work order took over a month to complete because the management ordered the wrong part. The wi-fi is spotty. Heaps of garbage bags accumulate in the hall. After the elevators were overworked during move-in day, the residents compounded the abuse by splattering them with vomit. The whole place just reeks. If you still want to live here, I\u2019d recommend a HAZMAT suit and experience at a bio level 4 lab. But seriously, always carry hand sanitizer and shower twice a day.\n\nAs bad as the management was, some of the tenants tried their very hardest to out-do them. The delinquents stripped the buildings of all signage: room numbers, elevator signs, even the exit signs. It\u2019s going to be a disaster the day someone gets alcohol poisoning because the 911 first responders will die of old age before they find where to go. If you want a good night\u2019s sleep, your best bet is to go to your car, which will not be anywhere near the assigned parking spot that you paid for.\n\nIn the end, what should have been a great experience was marred by constant frustration and disappointment.

The cons far outweigh the pros, and I want to share my experiences with you so you can avoid the disappointment.\n\nThe pros:\n-walking distance to UAB, 5 Points, downtown\n-gated parking\n-new, better management (I wish them the best)\n-utilities included ...more on that later\n\nThe cons:\n-When I rented, it was $910 for a small studio. I've seen that apparently the price was reduced...GOOD.\n-When I first moved in, I was given the keys to a unit after I signed my lease. I walked into the most revolting room, and I called my parents in a panic. There was trash strewn from wall to wall, dirty dishes in the sink, bloody towels, cigarette butts, and broken furniture. That should have been my cue to immediately get it of here! I went back, and the leading agent apologized before giving another set of keys to a more acceptable unit.\n-There are beyond disgusting conditions in the unit and pool area. The pictures I've included illustrate that clearly. The building is old, smelly, and run-down. At night, it is so dark with loud neighbors. I was always shocked when I found another short-cut taken in \"renovations\". They didn't bother to take the stove out when putting that flimsy flooring in, so I discovered nasty carpet underneath when I dropped something behind it. The pool patio featured gross outdoor carpeting that was stained and stretched by the puddles of water that would collect outside your door. Ooh, a coffee lounge? Yeah, $2 for a 6 oz cup made from stale Starbucks beans.\n-The management and maintenance were so unprofessional. Every time I needed something, there was rarely someone at the desk to help. They put up the sign saying they were showing on-site property so I sat for 45 minutes on occasion only to see them pull up in their car. The number included on the sign would never reach anyone. The one time I needed maintenance, the man (who I had only seen moping around previously) was unfriendly and almost rude. He spoke not once. Often, you would find announcements taped to your door that were sometimes curt, sometimes advertising lame \"community events\". They have package acceptance, but they gave my package to another resident in their lack of organization. I later found that package in the mail room trash...goes to show the quality of people who live there. They have online payments, but it's ridiculously expensive to do it! I believe $20-something to use a card.\n-Your utilities are included, but cheap is cheap! Once, I filled a mug to make tea only to find that the water was brown with flakes of insulation floating in it! Horrified, I took it to the front desk where I waited 20 minutes for someone to show up. I was told that they had reset the water, and it should be back to normal. A half-hearted apology was offered, and I was nervous to drink the water after that. The wifi is laughable. I think I would have preferred to revert back to dial-up with the insanely slow and unreliable service in the lounge. They once had the gall to put a notice on our doors that said we were to limit our water usage because their bill was too high. They claimed they would monitor usage and charge an additional fee to any unit using too much. That made me want to run the water 24/7, but instead I laughed.\n-The \"amenities\" are a joke. The laundry room was expensive and FILTHY. I opened a washer to put my clothes in, and I was greeted by a puddle of murky, stinky water full of hair. (Take a look at the picture, if you dare.) The fitness center was open for 3 of the 12 months that I was there. The gated parking is laughable. First of all, they charge $60 for one car. The lot is small, especially since the closed parts of it to do messy roof construction. The gate was broken when I arrived home one night, and I was forced to park on the dark street instead of the promised gated parking. It was left open for anyone to stroll in when it was broken the other 4 times that happened while I was there.\n\nIn short: if you love yourself, live somewhere else.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOSdm9eKXPG4anwZa3-4D-s1EGQ6I1rhExm1KI=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc258ddfb23:0xcbe8f5bbac970782"}

I payed $1000 a month for a studio and a parking pass on a 12 month lease(the price is even more expensive when leasing for a shorter term or month to month) Place is very old, expect windows to leak, MOLD to grow, and things to break. In my year living here, I had to get the tub in the bathroom replaced, the refrigerator replaced, the window resealed and have multiple other maintenance trips and while I didn\u2019t have to pay for any of it, it is very time consuming having deal with all these repairs on top of having a full time  class schedule and a part time job. Honestly, too much to deal with when asking for $1000 or more a month.\n\nFurthermore, brown water came from the bathroom faucets frequently and the temperature rapidly fluctuates when in the shower which is incredibly annoying to deal with and made showering here unenjoyable for me. When I told them about the issue, they would come and run their hands under the water for 30 secs see no issue, and told me to take a shower at a less \u201cpopular time\u201d. I\u2019m sorry, but if I\u2019m paying $1000 a month I better be able to take a shower whenever the hell I want.\n\nI would only live here if being within walking distance to UAB is a must for you, that is literally the only benefit of living here over anywhere else. If not, I would definitely steer clear of this place as the constantly needed repairs, brown water, fluctuations in water temperature, and myriads of other issues are not worth the $1000 or more they charge.\nThe complex is just getting too old and is going to need a major remodel in couple years unless they want to go bankrupt paying for repairs.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc258ddfb23:0xcbe8f5bbac970782"}

There were only two tenants living in the apartment this summer, and both of us were gone a minimum of 8 hours a day, often more. The lights were kept off, the dishwasher not used, and the A/C set accordingly. Every month we were charged at least $20 extra for power. I went to the front desk and asked to see my bill and requested an inspection to see why our bill was so high. The representative was friendly and submitted my request on July 8th. My request was not completed until July 30th, two days after the power bill had been posted. In the report they filed, there was not a single note for me to read about if they found a reason the bill was high or anything of the subject. Keep in mind the other tenants who are not residing here are also having to pay for these power overages. It has been extremely frustrating dealing with these issues. We are all college students with other bills the pay, and it feels like every day I look I have another charge on my account.

They pick and choose which parts of the lease they want to follow, most of the front desk staff is either extremely rude or doesn't know what they're doing. By the time I turned in my keys we were on the 3rd general manager if that tells you anything about the staff here. Maintenance requests were constantly deleted or cancelled by staff. Was told I could store my stuff in an apartment before move-in day and was also informed that I would not be living there, so imagine my surprise when they stuck my preferred roommate in there. Holes in the walls, infants, and drugs everywhere. When I came back for move-in day I was told that maintenance would help me move my stuff, instead, the manager at the time helped me move trash bags filled with not only my stuff, but with actual trash as well. Absolutely ridiculous. Charged a $65 move-out cleaning fee that they wrote in in the special provisions tab which I was told covered the price of someone coming in to scrub the toilets and bathtub. Really? $65 for something I had already done? Also got stuck with a $50 carpet cleaning fee. When I inquired about this additional $50 fee I was not told what was actually wrong with the carpet and then hung up on by the first person, and then told by the assistant manager that typically if someone lives there for a year the carpets just have to be cleaned. So be prepared for that if you choose to live in this fresh hell. This place is just NOT worth the price! I'd much rather live in my car.\n\nRoommate matching is a TOTAL fraud. Got stuck with the messiest, craziest people. I'm trying to go to school and get out, not listen to a bunch of psychos partying in my place until 3am and bringing drugs in and out 24/7. Was told that my roommates nor I could be in the apartment when we had our one TERRIBLE roommate move out. She had keys for 4 days when only permitted by law to have them for 2, did not have to pay the transfer fee that the rest of us were told we would have to pay if we chose to move, also stole from my roommates and destroyed personal property as well as attempted to destroy appliances. Wasn't in school, burned the couch with her curling iron, which the rest of us got charged for upon move-out, abused her two dogs that she didn't pay for, and was constantly smoking weed with all of her friends. Tried to blame me for her drugs and friends, and only after we called the police did she decide to go to the office and say that she was too scared to live with us, and to top it all off call us all racist while she made racial remarks to us the entire time she lived with us. Got a call from Kenyatta telling us that they had \"proof\" that we were racist. Talked to corporate manager about this disgusting accusation and was told that nobody thought that we were racist and seemed confused as to why I was there.

I called and kept showing up at the office asking them if they found the owner of the dog but they of course didn\u2019t do anything about it. Never even called to check on him or to tell me that they couldn\u2019t find the owner. SECOND, they charge you for random things all the time then call you over and over again trying to get the payment. Like what\u2019s the point of having a balcony if you can\u2019t actually use it? THIRD, I only have two roommates, one of which has already moved all of her things out while the other still has her personal items here, she has only been at the apartment physically 3 times this whole month and Im usually only here at night due to working, so why were we charged $30 in overages?

The apartments are nice to a certain degree and the area is convenient that's for the two stars that was given.

They are overpriced with their made up electric overages and will not repair anything unless the parent actually calls. Ms. Kenyatta seemed to be very helpful from the very beginning but upon moving out apparently she became frustrated and was very mean to my daughter so I begin dealing with her.\n\nThey will overcharge for things that you never even heard of and its ridiculous that they rip off young adults that are becoming the future.  They tell you one thing then do the next. I think they would be better if they were to increase their customer service skills and explain to tenants their procedure upon moving out. They will create charges like never before and will repeatedly tell you that its going on your credit. I think they actually enjoy that part.\n\nAlso there were shooting incidents in the parking lot and the only response they could give was \"everything is fine\" we will have security to patrol the area. It seems to me they should have been more proactive. The shooting was the last straw for me.\n\nIf you move here make sure you take pictures upon moving in and moving out.  Try not be so needy.

I would have an overage of 30 bucks or so in the month of December. (I was home 90% of that month and the air would be off and windows cracked) Then in the middle of July, air on, windows closed, my overage was around 7 dollars. Makes no sense.\nSo I move out, turned the air off, left my apartment clean. I get a text from my ex-roommate saying that there was mold all over the place.

That's enough money to clean an entire 2 story house with mold worse than that.\nNot to mention that maintenance barges in whenever they please (email or not), dogs are off-leash everyday.

This \u201cluxury style\u201d apartment, in my opinion, should be no comparison to other residential apartments that I have stayed at such as The Grove, The District, and many more. If you are in college to party and do drugs this is the place for you. You will smell Marijuana continuously throughout the day and night everywhere throughout the apartment. Do not stay here if you are planning on sleeping whatsoever. Constantly getting bogus overages for charges that were not my responsibility was a major issue. One instance Was trash leftover in the balcony that was not mine, was fined heftily for this. Being fined for leaving a trash bag for less than 30 seconds while going back inside and getting my car keys was another 50 bucks. This does not come close to the most ridiculous and idiotic scheme i have ever heard. They tried to fine me for having aluminum foil on my window \ud83d\ude02 this has to be one of the most poorly managed, un organized place that i have ever stayed at.

After having a terrible roomate leave, another even worse roomate arrives UNNOTICED!! By being assured that they would interview me if another roomate arrived, another roomate arrived surprisingly unnanounced. This has to be the most terrible and unprofessional establishment that is in Mobile. Please do yourself a favor, if you are a parent and you want your son or daughter to thrive and be successful in college, do not let him/her live here. You will be stuck in paying overpriced unreasonable rates to these clowns.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fd707dddb79:0x2e7adfd03c4f33a1"}

However, I HAD to choose something. This place is a sorry excuse for \u201cLuxury Student Living\u201d. I had so many issues in my time here.\nSo, upon getting my keys and finally getting to go look, I went in and did my little checklist when I noticed that there were very gross yellow and green stains on the base boards behind my toilet. They came and cleaned it, no problem. (still disgusting)\nThen the AC went out in the MIDDLE of the summer. It got up to almost 85 degrees in there if I remember correctly. Took maintence almost 2-3 days to come and assist. (Only for it to happen again a few months later)\n*ATTENTION PET OWNERS* If you have a dog with ANY types of social anxiety, this is NOT the place for you. They have a \u201cleash law\u201d in their lease stating that all dogs must be on leashes at all times. BUT 99% of the people that live there DO NOT follow this rule. Their dogs run away from them and don\u2019t listen when their owner calls. I had my dog ATTACKED right in front of my apartment one day from someone not having their dog on a leash. Management did nothing but send out a small email about it.. and getting your $250 back from your deposit takes up to 4-5 months to come to you.\nNow, I need to get this out there so you guys can see what kind of people they hire. One day, I heard BANGING on my door.  It took me all but about 3 seconds to get there before they were already unlocking my door and coming in. I get to the door, and my dog is doing what he does best and investigating the people coming in his home. He comes up with a toy in his mouth and sniffs their feet, very friendly,wagging his tail. THEN the guy that was with a girl to do the inspection, puts his hand on my dog\u2019s chest and SHOVES him back(20 lbs dog) and tells me to \u201cwatch my dog...\u201d From there, this man straight up went in my room, opened all of my drawers to my chest of drawers, all of my cabinets in my bathroom, snooped in my closet, and did the same exact thing to my roommate\u2019s room as well and left EVERY light on and EVERYthing open. NOT TO MENTION they are supposed to email you a notice about inspections. I did NOT get one for that day or hardly any others.\nThem being able to come in if someone doesn\u2019t answer the door is just a huge invasion of privacy in my opinion. Imagine getting out of the shower or being IN the shower and not being able to hear your door being knocked on and someone comes in your apartment.. a stranger at that.\nTowing has a $250 fine PLUS its like a 30-45 minute drive to the super sketchy, very obviously cheap towing company where the staff is insanely rude.\nOVERAGES. Always, always about 20-30 dollars in overages every single month. No matter if you weren\u2019t there for all of a month (like December for example\u2026 Christmas time)\nSo, I moved out at the beginning of March in a rush to leave that place for multiple reasons. I get a call (in July) from management saying that there is a HUGE mold issue in my apartment due to \u201cexcessive moisture\u201d. I cleaned my apartment from head to toe before I left. Down to vacuuming, sweeping and mopping. And left it just how I found it, except probably better. I received pictures, and the mold is EVERY where\u2026 ceiling, baseboards, couch, chair, walls.. you name it. And they are blaming ME for it. It is all due to the AC closet in my bedroom that has an oddly direct flow from outdoor air. I even mentioned that I had turned my air off to someone at the front desk before I left and was told, and I quote, \u201cOh that\u2019s perfectly fine! No problem!\u201d Now, If I hadn\u2019t had the overage problem the whole time, I would have left it on anyways. But I just do not see the point in paying overages for not living there in the first place.\nPLEASE read these comments, guys. They WILL rob you of your money... DO NOT DO IT. Paying this much (about 1400 for a small two bedroom apartment w/ overages) with this much of a hassle just to be so close to South is NOT worth it. Clock an extra 10-15 minute drive and live somewhere much better and worth your time and money.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1532302173113, "text": "Hi FreetoFly16 - Thank you for your review and feedback.

It asks us to rate it with a star, and I cannot figure out why there aren't any stars on the negative side of zero.  My daughter moved in there for college 2 years ago this past August and at first all seemed fine, but as time went by my thoughts on that changed.  My daughter was charged overages every single month and there was never an understanding as to why.  Maintenance would pop in whenever they wanted without any kind of a notice and I do mean POP in.  We got something for her door so she couldn't be surprised unannounced again.  She decided to move out towards the beginning of the year.  She was paid up in rent, so as soon as she found her a better place she moved all of her belongings out and cleaned the apartment from top to bottom.  The apartment was 100% clean and ready  for a new tenant.  My daughter turned the air off when she left because that's what one does when no one will be living there.  Fast forward maybe 2-3 months..........She gets a lengthy letter from them demanding $7,000 in damages because of mold!  Her little apartment had mold from ceiling to floor, all on the walls, in the cabinets, in the toilet, all over the furniture, everywhere!   Any and everywhere was covered in mold.  It was unbelievable!  Her ex-roommate sent her pictures and I'm here to tell you it was disgusting,  but it was not my daughter's wrong doing or fault that caused this.  I am not one to bad mouth anyone, but if the shoe fits, you wear it!!  My question is what is wrong with a buildings structure or inner walls to make a room become so overwhelmingly engulfed in mold in such a short period of time?  What has been behind these walls all this time?  Is this why my daughter's nose stayed stopped up?  Is this why she was always sneezing?  Lots of questions are coming to mind.  I could understand if my daughter was being negligent or irresponsible, but that simply is not the case here.  They are now holding us responsible for their problem.  Do NOT let your child live here.  It is NOT what it seems.  The people who consider themselves to be \"in charge\" take advantage of our children because they know that most children straight out of high school are easily mis-lead and easy to screw over.  They figured wrong when speaking about my daughter.  So many kids live here and the bills are paid without question from \"mama and daddy's\" bank account, and most parents don't even think or ask to see a bill probably.  I wonder how much money they make in one month alone in overages??  Imagine how much in a year.  It's ridiculous!  Do yourself and your child a favor and look elsewhere.  Oh!!! and don't be fooled by the good reviews from the tenants.  That's the new ones who were promised a little gift card for writing a good review.\nSusan Sumrall", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fd707dddb79:0x2e7adfd03c4f33a1"}

There has been a time where they lost my money order and told me to re-issue out another money order for their mistake and then didn't apologize or updated me on if they found it or not. They will say they will work with you and then renege on what they have said. I even spoke with the Headquarters that was over the entire complex and she hasn't complied or come to agreements with me on anything and there has been plenty of other students who were not satisfied with this complex and has left or is in the process of trying to leave. They are not elevated student living because anyone thats not a student can live here which going against they title of being a \"elevated student living\". If you dont believe anything I am posting stay there and find out for yourself but i highly suggest you save your kids the trouble and save your money and live anywhere but here. if you would like more information on the things ive been through just send me a message.Also I am currently in the process of leaving, couldn't find anyone that wanted to live in this chaotic and unprofessional place.

Honestly I'm not sure why they got rid of it because it was probably the only good publicity they would get.\nThis review is kind of long, if you don't read the stories, at least read the last two paragraphs.\n\nWithin the first two months of living here, I realized that this place was awful. If I had this semester to do over again, I would definitely have opted for the hour commute each day. Seriously, even on-campus living would be better than here.\n\nIt feels like they could care less about your satisfaction once they have you locked in to a lease. There was a time a few months ago where I went 3-4 days without internet. (Internet outages happen really often here) I was working on a homework assignement when it just quit working. I figured out that it wasn't my router, but a problem with comcast (who were super helpful and friendly when  I called). Comcast told me that they see the problem but were unable to do anything about it unless they had an employee tell them to reboot. So I call CQ get transferred to someone saying they were the manager and explained to her what Comcast said only to be cut off and informed that it was a Friday afternoon and the office was closed. But I still paid for utilities that month, right? Oh well, they don't care.\n\nOver Christmas break, my roommates and I were gone almost the entire month. When we left, we turned the AC and all the lights off and were still charged $20 overages a piece. How does that work?\n\nMost recently, I woke up one Sunday to my air conditioning and fan not working. So I check the thermostat to see if I can fix it, nothing. Luckily my parents were coming over to visit that day so I asked my dad to make sure I wasn't doing something wrong on the thermostat, still wouldn't work. So we call CQ (seriously it's July and it's hotter in my apartment than outside) and ask for someone to come fix the AC. That was around 3:00pm Sunday. They said they'd have someone come out to look at it that day. No one showed up until the next morning when i got back from class around 10am. I had to sleep on my couch with 3 fans blowing on me (I've been on more comfortable camping trips). Got charged a huge overage for this too.\n\nOh and my favorite part is when the maintanance guy mentioned above comes in to fix my fan. He stands on a chair in my room and tells me to flip the switch. Nothing happens. Then he spins the fan with his and a few times and tells me to call if i have any more problems. I don't think he made it to his car before it quit spinning.\n\nSeriously this place is a joke. Students reading this, you can do better. Parents, don't let your kids move somewhere they'll have this many problems with.\n\nP.s. They go in your room whenever they please. Granted, they knock first, but I have heard them knock and go into my empty roommates' rooms before. Honestly, this makes me uncomfortable.  And this part might be too much information, but one day coming home from class I see one of the maintenance workers going door to door and it looks like he had just come out of my apartment. Myself or my roommates haven't been there all day, but when I go in, there was an unbearable smell. He had used my bathroom.\n\nI'm sure not many people will take time to read this, but if I could tell you one thing it would be - when you come to visit try to come in and walk around the complex and ask people you see walking around their honest opinions and if they would recommend living here. I'd be willing to bet that there's more negative than positive answers.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fd707dddb79:0x2e7adfd03c4f33a1"}

Pest control may come, but never resolves the issue. Sometimes pest control says they\u2019ve came and they actually never come so you\u2019re left waking up with gnats in your bed! Renovated apartments look nice until you move in and find a ton of things need to be done. Gym sucks, pools are about the only great amenity.

I was asked to take down this review by the property manager here at The Magnolia because she didn't want anyone to know what I really thought of this place and its management. Well, I'm putting my review back up and this time it's staying. The Magnolia has some of the worst management I have ever come in contact with. The managers are rude and dismissive of issues that I've had. They have allowed their vendors to enter my room without my knowledge, violating my privacy and then treating the issue like a small minor problem. Maintenance is stoned whenever they come to fix things, never in a timely manner, and the manager denies this fact. In the end, it doesn't matter if you fixed it or not, the process was arduous and awful for me. They were rude almost the ENTIRE time and did not treat me like a customer who is paying their salary. They in NO WAY went above and beyond to assist me. They did the BARE MINIMUM. I have many more complaints that I've already sent to corporate that contain way too much for one google review.

I have renewed multiple times due to the proximity to my workplace and the relatively low rent but working with management has been a nightmare. I have called and visited the front desk FREQUENTLY to try to get a hold of the manager but she is always conveniently \"in a meeting.\" I believe the front desk student assistants do their portion of the job taking down my name, unit & phone # to have her call me back but I have NEVER gotten a call back. It has taken my roommate and I 2.5 YEARS of harassing the front desk student workers only to get a flooring issue \"semi\" resolved by the management. OCCASIONAL email replies as a result of the harassment is the only form of communication we have been receiving. I am also expecting TWO concession payments: one of which clearly states that it would be given out within 30 days (it has been almost two months now) of the lease renewal date and another for referring a friend. This latter one does not even have a contract or a form of agreement, so the only argument I have in favor of my case, is a screenshot of the advertisement from two months ago. When inquired about this issue, the office only came back to me and said that I would hear from corporate soon and took no action whatsoever to accelerate this process. The only positive side of this complex is that the in-house maintenance is usually quick to respond (and the high water pressure is a bonus). There have been more than enough hiccups with our air conditioning which eventually got switched out to a new one (most of the A/C units are probably in need of an upgrade due to age). Gates have been installed as a \"solution\" for all the shootings that have happened recently, but have not been activated as they are still waiting to pass out parking passes/gate access as we approach the THIRD month of the lease term. There have been three changes in management companies in less than three years, which should explain the mess that this apartment is in, but I believe the actual on-site manager, Christina, who has stayed at the site despite the changes, is a main source of all these negative reviews from current residents. If \"short-staffing\" is the issue here, please hire someone else to help her address these matters - this apartment is not maintained well enough to justify the rent and the lack of response that the residents are receiving.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1569528416498, "text": "Clara, thank you for sharing this experience with us.

I wouldn't say my experience has been perfect, but you get what you pay for. As The Social is one of the most affordable apartment complexes in Auburn, you shouldn't come here with overly high  expectations. For the price you pay, this is a great complex. They are not as renovated as I had hoped, but the appliances are in good working order, which is all that matters to me. Management has worked with my roommates and I each time we have had an issue. Recently, they credited our accounts after a broken AC unit ran up the power bill. Next week they will be replacing the unit. Maintenance can be slow to respond at times, but this typically coincides with times when many people are putting in requests, such as on move-in day. The staff at The Social are always helpful and have resolved each issue I have presented them with. I would say overall that The Social is a great place to live and I would recommend it to others.\n\nUpdate: Since my original review, all of my kitchen appliances have been replaced. The kitchen was completely redone and I was told I should be getting new furniture in the near future. A new management team has taken over and made vast improvements to the property and to many, if not all, of the units. Currently they are resurfacing the front pool and soon they will be putting a dog park in the back of the complex.

The complex never issued us guest parking passes in the first place. They complain about non residents parking in guest spaces when they never gave their residents guest parking passes which would have cleared that problem to begin with. Most apartment complexes issue their residents one parking pass and a guest pass but not the social!

When I first move in the apartment was a mess. Then my roommate kept taking what wasn't hers and when I confronted her about it she got scared and told the office something else and they made me move to a different building in the apartment complex.  It's a good location because Walmart is right across the street. When my lease was up I moved out and was suppose to get my security deposit back. They claimed they didn't have my forwarding address (which I wrote down on the move out paper and outside the envelope I turned in) so they sent it to THEIR address and told me to come pick it up. Once I got there they claim the move out check wasn't there and I drove 30 minutes from another location so I basically wasted my gas. Still waiting on my security deposit refund. I have called numerous times and even called the company that owns the social.\n\nUPDATE:!!!\nI moved back in about 2 years later since they had changed management thinking things were going to get better.

I see security frequently patrolling at night to make sure we\u2019re safe. Also, parking is not an issue. I\u2019ve always found a spot for me and my guests when I have them. However, the Tow company does not play. If you are not in a visitors spot come night time your car will be gone. I\u2019ve experienced this before I was a resident.

I have no issues with my apartment if I did, maintenance was here the next day. I\u2019ve never lived anywhere where maintenance showed up so fast. Speaking of maintenance they are also pleasant and clean. I\u2019ve dealt with maintenance men who would get the job done and leave tracks of whatever they fixed, but not here.\n\nThe complex has many events for us.

When I first moved over here it was under different management than it is now. The second year was not so great, my roommates and I was living in apartment where the cabinets door fell off the day we moved in. Which it was only hanging on by hope then.They NEVER came to fix it the entire TWO years we stayed there. Then, once we moved out they wanted to charge us that fee. Yes, we know kind of jacked up since we had put it a work order for it the day we moved in and it fell off. This year I stayed here by myself, my roommates had it with them but, due to the fact I use the Interstate to travel back and forth to Montgomery its closer so I stayed. BIG MISTAKE. I had to pay them $200.00 to transfer into a two bedroom apartment which they stated I could move in mid July. I did not move in until LATE AUGUST. The apartment I moved in was not cleaned properly especially the carpet. The reason I say that was b/c when I moved in here they carpet cleaners people says they were suppose to clean the carpet in the apartment, which was suppose to be VACANT I assume since they came. Well folks the carpet cleaning people NEVER showed back up. So now in this apartment, there are PEST  in the carpet and its literally attacking me. HOW SPOOKY is that. In the words of Dr. Cunningham there are fleas in the apartment. Yet, I have NO DOG NOR ANY OTHER TYPE OF ANIMAL. So that had to come from someone who lived here before me. They don't follow the roommate matching paper that you do. They stick you with anyone here. The people at the front office is VERY RUDE!!!!! I would not dare waste another year over here. Its so unprofessional, and they have no care about if the apartment burns down. If you have another options (which there is) please don't come here....

The staff is extremely rude, no professionalism whatsoever. If you have a concern and try to explain it to them, they never let you speak and try to talk over you. I\u2019ve left their place in tears because I was never reassured that my concern would be taken care of. They talk to you in a condescending attitude and act as if it\u2019s your issue to deal with, and that they have \"no responsibility\" over it and shouldn\u2019t have to deal with it. They act as if it\u2019s an inconvenience on THEIR part, even though this is their job\u2026\n\nIf you requested random roommates, congratulations, they pair you with the ones who don\u2019t meet your compatibility/ preferences whatsoever. Mine was the complete opposite of me in regards to cleanliness, noise, having friends over, pets, etc. Then they expect YOU to figure it out when there\u2019s conflict, even though the pairing was done on THEIR part. Don\u2019t even bother indicating your preferences on that little \u201cRoommate Matching\u201d sheet because it makes zero difference.\n\nThe first time I got my keys, I was paired with a MALE. I\u2019m a female\u2026 which apartment complex pairs males with females? That just goes to show they don\u2019t even look at the preferences you provide in regards to floor level or roommates. So I had all my stuff ready to move in, but I had to be delayed because of the FIRST mispairing on their part.\n\nI moved into another unit but realized soon enough that this female and I would not work as roommates. You can\u2019t randomly put people together and \"force them\" to work things out. Some people are just NOT meant to live together\u2026 There are things such as pets, having guests over, and electricity use etc that people just aren\u2019t willing to compromise for. After my roommate situation got out of hand, I again went to management demanding a new room assignment. He sat down with my roommate and I and we still couldn\u2019t resolve our issues. He first told us to just \"put up with it\u201d  until our lease ends. Oh okay, so I\u2019m paying $600 a month to \u201cput up with\u201d someone who\u2019s making my place basically UNLIVABLE for me. Y\u2019all, I\u2019m not lying when I say I would have to look for excuses to be out. I felt as if the place wasn\u2019t even mine\u2026 and hated being there because I felt uncomfortable. Anyway, so he FINALLY agreed to move me out into another unit. So that weekend, I packed up all my stuff, said sayonara to my roommate \u2026 and guess what? I NEVER heard anything back from them. I tried to get in contact with them multiple times and\u2026 nothing.

When moving in they told me that the keys to my apartment had not been cut yet that I would need to wait in line for 45 minutes. it was actually closer to two hours. Then I get to my apartment to find that my bedroom door was kicked in and had no way to lock it, they where made aware of it immediately. (it took weeks for them to come and half way fix it). Also there was a roach infestation in every room and my roommates and I had filled a maintenance request on it multiple times. I then went to the office and the bug people came later that week. It took about four weeks for them to actually go away. The apartment was supposed to be newly renovated and mine was not. It has patched walls where someone had started to repair the walls and didn't sand them down or paint over them (this is in every room). the walls are covered in stains and sticky stuff and it does take a while for maintenance requests to get done. The towing people also love to screw you. If you do not have you tag hanging up even if it is on your dashboard they will tow you. I saw an older guy hooking my car up and went downstairs to explain to him that it was right there and he said that it would be $50 because he had already hooked it up or $100 if he towed it. of course I paid it. The security here sucks because it wasn't even 12 am yet and there was domestic dispute/violence and you could hear the female screaming but no one was around to do anything until the cops where called. Also if you choose random roommates they do not do a good job picking them out.

Move in had no organization at all, was given numerous incorrect keys and so were the roommates. Most of us gave up after a bit and just shared.\nOnce we get to the room, it was in horrible shape. Most apartment complexes inspect units and ensure everything is in functional shape before a tenant moves in. This is not the case for The Social. I had somewhere in the range of 8 work orders just from day one. Dryer wasn't hooked up, kitchen sink didn't work, ice maker didn't work, garbage disposal didn't work, half our lights didn't turn on and the list goes on. It was roughly 2 months before the Social actually addressed some of these issues, and it took a heated email to corporate and literally CC emails to everyone in the company. There excuse was they only had 2 maintenance men for 1000 units, as if other complexes around Auburn don't have that many.  When they were repaired they were not fixed correctly and I ended up having to go back and fix their mistakes.\n\nThe unit wasn't clean on move in. I bought a $20 vacuum at Walmart did 5 passes on the carpet and the bin was full.  Our countertop was charred and burned and so was the carpet, neither of which was replaced during the stay. The day of move in about 6 guys in \"The Social\" worker shirts , not sure if they were maintenance just spent the day seeing how long they could keep the maintenance golf cart doing a wheelie. Not professional, and definitely a waste on man hours for the company.\n\nThere was never a maintenance schedule to the units, I had to remind them each time that they needed to replace the air filter for the AC unit. The unit itself was an old R22 unit that costs more to run than that in my previous unit that was three times size. The light bulbs in the unit are a round fluorescent type that cost a small fortune to replace and barely produce enough light to see in the living room.\n\nThe majority of the office staff are rude, and love to place blame on others. They had blatantly lied to my face about packages arriving simply because they didn't want to go find it. Many times I had asked to see the property manager, and the simple response was that \"he is on the property but not in the office.\" I said I'll wait for him to get back and they claimed he probably wouldn't be back and they could only contact him if it was some sort of emergency. I eventually got ahold of him by CC an email to his boss and his boss's boss. As a business this is extremely fishy way to operate and train your employees. They lost our check as well and then proceed to try and evict us, then blatantly ignoring us in the office when we went to confront them. Even with check receipts from them written in their handwriting and with their signature they did not believe us.\n\nTo continue their *optional* utility subcontractor made a clerical error,  and charged everyone for power even though we didn't sign up for the service.  Instead of the head office taking care of there contractor all at once the property manager instructed the office workers to tell the residence to handle it themselves. I had no affiliation with their contractor, and yet again they wanted me to do their job for them.\n\nThe general property is not taken care of. Many railings and posts along the steps are missing, along with the wood that is all splintered and heavily cracking. They have a poor locking system on the  basketball and exercise rooms where anyone with the code can get in. So when  people from other neighborhoods come in and trash it they blame and punish all their residence for there inability to provide a halfway decent secure locking system. Most of the equipment in the gym didn't work anyway, so no real loss there. There is 1 dumpster for about 3/4 of the apartments that is a very long walk away compared to most complexes.\n\nThe only pro I can think of is they did have a bowl of mints in the club house, most of which were stale but still edible.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1534359607670, "text": "Thank you for your feedback.

It took over 2 weeks to actually see maintenance after submitting several work orders the first day. If you ask anyone at the front desk anything, prepare for at least 3 different answers and for none of them to be correct. As previously mentioned, the internet they provide is excruciatingly slow. Don't expect to be able to play any kinds of online games or watch Netflix without serious buffer times. Parking is TERRIBLE for visitors. There are only 105 guest parking spots for everyone in the apartment complex. So don't expect to be able to have more than one friend over without them getting towed. I recommend The Social for anyone who wants to legitimize ongoing anger issues.\n\nUPDATE: Well they had forgotten to post electricity on our bill. So once they finally noticed, we got a notice on our door saying that they would charge us $40 a month per month they missed. This is insane.

When I initially moved in my washer nor dryer worked, my toilet did not flush, only two of the things on the stove worked. All of this the first day of moving in, I had to report my issues a few times before someone was sent to fix them, I understood due to them having only one maintenance guy and he is super nice. Even with these issues I overlooked them because the apartment was nice and ok for the price. As time went on I had numerous issues with billing and them adding charges for electricity to my account multiple times for no reason resulting in large fees that I had to pay to them out of pocket when my electricity was hooked up with Alabama Power and has been. I still overlooked these things, but other things continued to break. My dryer still does not work properly I have to start the dryer over 3-4 times for it to dry clothing which makes doing laundry extremely long. The renovations to the apartment makes it look better and worth the amount I'm paying, however, WiFi is included in the rent and stated as such in my lease but I have been without WiFi in my apartment since the beginning of May and I have contacted them about this and they stated for me to call and send a technician out but a technician has not came out and I have been contacting Charter back and forth for over a month now. If you bring your own router you can connect to the WiFi and establish your own WiFi for your apartment. This was working perfectly fine with me until their workers came to redo the carpeting and flooring in the apartment. Now for me to have the personal WiFi that I had in the past I will have to PAY CHARTER MYSELF FOR WIFI MONTHLY WHICH IS RIDICULOUS. If I'm paying Charter for WiFi then there is no reason that it should be in my rent, the $49 I have to pay Charter should be deducted from my rent. The office staff is really nice but they don't understand a lot of things and aren't much help with things outside of paying rent and the front office. On numerous occasions I have went to them for packages that we delivered and that they signed for and they would tell me that they did not have my package and I would not get it for 2-3 days when they finally decided to do some work and sort through the packages. They don't do much work and rarely are doing anything when you enter the clubhouse. I initially love living at The Social due to it being in a great location, good parking, and located very close to campus. But now I am beginning to regret resigning to live yet again at this nightmare of a place. Whenever there is an issue the property manager of office staff will attempt to contact you to save face but ultimately won't try to fix anything. If you can move somewhere else that will look at you as a priority and not just a rent check.

Other than that, nothing major.\n- Move-in day was cluster of craziness with double parking everywhere making it difficult to navigate, but that was only a one-day thing - management was a bit disorganized that day I must admit.\n- Apartment lights weren't very bright\n\nAnd now the GOOD:\n- Brand new carpet - very nice\n- Staff for the most part is quite nice\n- Pretty area\n- Close to campus\n- Lots of restaurants, shopping areas, gas stations and the like nearby\n- Open space to park your car\n- Love the bus transit system that runs every 15min-20min\n- Basic appliances work fine\n- Excellent value for the $$$\n- Lots of amenities include in such a low price\n\nI don't understand the mass amount of negative reviews - maybe the old management/maintenance team really was bad, who knows. I feel as if these negative reviews are either competitors logging in and talking trash to each other or old tenants that had really extremely high standards for the money they were paying and were disappointed when one little thing went south. Or maybe just people only leave negative reviews.\n\n$395/mo for a 3-bedroom with utilities included (minus electric) even with a few faults really should leave no room for anyone to complain.

There are hidden fees that were not explained and I was unaware of until I got my last bill. I had made numerous attempts to reach the office and was unsuccessful until I sent an email stating that I wanted someone to address the complaint I had. Finally I made contact with the Property Manager. I asked for explanation and I got some crappy excuse about the cost of my bill and told \u201cSorry for the hidden fees.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m fine with the rent, water, trash and sewer fee. My first sewer bill was 88 dollars and I think that is unfit and unfair. I understand that there may be an inflation cost with the County or BWW but this is ridiculous. Still it\u2019s been paid on time like everything else. The kicker for me is the \u201cMandatory Cable Service.\u201d I was told that it came with my unit. I\u2019m being charged for 1 HD cable box and 10MB of internet speed that I never even had set up. Recently, I called to get it set up and the customer service rep had a horrible attitude and said that there is a 65 dollar service connection fee due upfront BEFORE they come out to set up service. I was told that this is mandatory although this unit came with cable and internet and I\u2019m being charged 75 dollars monthly for it. Pathetic.\n\nI constantly have problems with my toilet, there\u2019s mildew in the hall and bathroom and my air constantly goes in and out. I\u2019d rather turn a fan on. DO NOT BRING YOUR BUSINESS HERE.\n\nThe staff seemed nice and friendly and that\u2019s what will draw you in. Response time to application was swift. Which is what impressed me. But stay away.

However, here are some good things about the Connection:\nThe maintenance guys are quick to come fix problems.\nThe price is competitive.\nManagement is pretty nice.\nThey have a lot of resident events.\n\nOn the other hand, some negatives:\nCleanliness: when my roommates and I moved in, all of our rooms and bathrooms were dirty. There was an abundance of hair in my dresser, mold in our bathrooms, and we had to scrub, not just wipe, every common surface. I\u2019ve never had this experience with an apartment complex.\n\nCommunication: The complex does not notify us of many maintenance repairs; recently, we had the shower heads and sink faucets replaced (unfortunately, these replacements were major downgrades from the nice high pressure shower heads we used to have); we never got any emails or notifications that they would be coming, and it was a bit startling when people enter our apartment unannounced. This has happened a few times over the past year.\n\nAmenities: the amenities are poorly maintained. The grills are dirty, the chairs are dirty, and really anything but the pool in the front and the clubhouse is run down. The gate rarely actually works, it stays open most of the time. If I had to estimate, it was working properly for maybe a total of a month over the past year. I don\u2019t care for the gate, it wasn\u2019t a selling point for me, but if you advertise yourself as a gated complex, maybe your gate should work.\n\nLighting: the parking lots are lit incredibly poorly and I feel uncomfortable walking to and from my car at night.\n\n\u201cSecurity\u201d: On two accounts in the evening, I have been sitting in my car, or standing outside my car in the parking lot, being quiet and nothing of a nuisance, just enjoying the fresh air. On both accounts, security told me I had to go inside.

The wifi has always been problematic, but manageable so I'm glad that they are upgrading it (it was long overdue). The difference between the 2 and 4 bedroom was negligible considering the price difference so the 4 bedroom is really the only good option. The hardwood floor in the 2 bedroom I had was absolute garbage, I mean it was stained with paint and was chipped in multiple places, and that doesn't even mention the hardwood itself was like plastic more than it was wood. The appliance where all great, but the heating and ac always seemed to act up. Which wouldn't have been a big deal if they fixed it in a timely fashion. The selection in terms of the fitness machines is lackluster. The walls are paper thin and the big gap under the doors sure doesn't help. You can hear pretty much everything from all the neighbors.

I read some of the reviews that describe management issues as well as issues with payments and things like that but I have never experienced anything remotely similar.

Make no mistake, this apartment complex is absolutely terrible. I lived here for 4 years, and had constant problems with management losing/returning my mail without explanation, threatening us with fines for keeping items on the porch of the apartment we paid to rent (\"Unsightly Balcony\" was the official \"charge\"), maintenance requests taking close to 2 weeks to be addressed.)\nFeatures that were used as selling points stayed in disrepair (front and back gates were constantly breaking, forcing you to drive all the way down S college to go around if one was closed; hot tub was never working for more than 3 months the entire time I lived there) or were \"closed\" via security patrols after 9:00 (pool, basketball court). If you're not a fan of having the cops called on you for playing basketball in your own apartment complex, seek other arrangements.\n\nThe most recent and irreconcilable complaint I have, however, is The Connection's predatory move-out practices. After 4 years of occupancy, never having missed a month's rent, my roomated and I were told that we owed over $2,000 in combined move-out expenses to cover the slight cosmetic damage to the paper-thin, cheaply made couches they provide, very minor scuffs along the walls, and \"cleaning costs\". When I called to dispute the charges, I was told that my only option was to communicate through email, where I was basically told to pay up or be sent to collections.\n\nI reccomend renting anywhere but here.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3b98240b121:0xd0895806d3612fdd"}

Also with the front gate being open and a chain link fence around the back, people that dont live at the complex come in and ended up breaking the basketball goal that was at the pool. They did their best to enforce a 2 guest minimum per resident, but people would just leave and come back as soon as the worker left.\n\nAll in all, my experience was pleasant for the most part after i found friends to move in with, i made a lot of friends in the complex, but i am extremely upset about losing my bike due to poor timing of only having a day to move it and being out of the state for family.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3b98240b121:0xd0895806d3612fdd"}

I'm glad I'm leaving this place in August. First, we negotiate with the property when we sign the contract. We need two sets of houses that are next to each other because we have eight partners. Connotation promised us, but! ! They did not achieve it. Under my understanding, my other friends encountered the same problem. They are also separated. Second, when we registered, we requested apartments that live on the second floor and above, but! ! ! The property gave us the first floor and now my room has a lot of bugs. Outside the windows on the first floor there are flowers and in the summer there are many bees. This makes me very troubled. Third, when we registered, we were misled and chose to pay for parking spaces. However, since we stayed here, they have not mentioned this issue to me. They gave me an ordinary parking permit and continued to charge. When I discovered this problem, I came to the property to find help. The front desk recorded my problem very friendly and did not help me. I will still be charged until next month! ! ? ? ? When I was looking for management, they doubted the authenticity of my problem and repeatedly asked me to check my license to ensure that they did not make mistakes. Until I provided all the photos to the managers, they promised to cancel the next month's fees. but! ! They will not give me the cost before returning. I did not enjoy the proper parking spaces and it was their fault. They refuse to admit it. I am sorry for this place. Finally, the electricity bill made me understandable. In the first few months, our electricity bill was maintained at $150. Even if we often use air conditioning. but! ! ! In the last winter vacation, I was alone at home, and my electricity bill reached $300. In the following month, the electricity bill was still $300 until we completely shut down the air conditioner. This change was sudden and huge, which made me very shocked and unacceptable. My advice is to stay away from this place. Its service is not as imaginative as it is irresponsible! And so on, during the last winter vacation, the door of our laundry suddenly fell. It hurt my friend. I confirmed that we didn't touch it, and that its junction was broken. I have a suspicion of this place, it will enter my blacklist with my friend. I will never live here again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3b98240b121:0xd0895806d3612fdd"}

Let me just tell you SOME of my experiences over the years.\n1. The apartments aren't really that clean when you move in, you can still have someone's stuff still in drawers and things like that.\n2. You're suppose to get a notice that people are coming into your apartment. There have been MULTIPLE instances people just show up, luckily I was home. However! One time I didn't hear the door and they just walked right in. They never sent any type of email they were coming or put anything on the door.\n3. Maintenance is slow and important. I promise you SOMETHING is going to break in your apartment. It's all cheap. My dryer, dish washer, AC, toilet has all broken and for all of them it took us having to bug them for them to even come up in a timely manner... ESPECIALLY for the AC that broke in the middle of the summer.\n4. Black \"stuff\" grows in all of the bathroom drains. They claim it's just \"dirty\" but I've never seen this black stuff ever in my life. Just here at the connection.\n5. The office staff can be friendly depending who you talk to, but management is truly useless.\n6. They will find anything and everything to charge you for. They're definitely here to take your money.\n7. When I moved in I was told every year you stay and resign your lease rent will go down. That's what kept me here for 3 years. However I'm now moving out because they started raising prices and I promise.. ITS NOT WORTH IT!\n8. The \"security guard\" they have here is rude. I asked him a simple question about when the club house closed and he gave me a very rude response and laughed at me.\n9. The hot tub has been broken forever. It's not even clean. It's truly disgusting.  Half the equipment in the gym is broken. Last time I went to the computer lab, more than half the computers didn't work and the printer didn't work either. The pool table and ping pong table are both broken in the club house, make sure not to lean on them. Almost all the chairs at the pools are broken and the ones that you're suppose to be able to sit in in the water are never cleaned so they have definitely grown some bacteria.\n10. The front gate is always broken. If you're looking for a safe place with a gate and security, this isn't the place.

Then, they never came back to finish the apartment. Every week we called and were met with the same response: \"we'll send out a schedule next week.\" Turns out next week means the day before they claim renovations will finish. Except it didn't. Keep in mind, all of our kitchen items and drawers have to be removed for them to change the countertops. Imagine my surprise when I come home the following day after working my Saturday morning shift to find these people working in my apartment. This was almost TWO months after it was supposed to be finished. I had received no notification that they were going to be working in my apartment on the weekend.

The Connection is easily the worst place I have lived in, I cannot stress this enough. Take your money somewhere else and save yourself many headaches and stress. If you don\u2019t have the time to read my whole review with all the details, then just take a look at all the other reviews to get an idea of the quality of this place. And don\u2019t be fooled by the 5 star reviews you see in the last year, because the connection offered the residents $100 dollars in exchange for a positive review. This is how desperate they are to make themselves look good. It should also give you an idea of how duplicitous their style of management truly is. They invest money, time, and effort into putting up a front and tricking people to sign-in instead of using that time to actually do their work properly and fix their current problems.\nI lived with them for 2.5 years. My first year with them was ok, and I had no issues. However, everything started to go wrong when the new manager, Matthew, came in. This is why you should avoid this place at all costs:\n1) Incorrect Late Fees and payment problems:\nAll apartment complexes have a resident portal where you can pay your rent online. These portals also allow you to save payment methods so that you don\u2019t have to re-enter your payment information every month. I made my payments with the checking account of my bank (NOT my debit/credit card, because I don\u2019t have to worry about changing the payment information if it ever got lost or stolen). When you make a payment, you receive a message and an email telling you that the payment went through. One day during my last semester with them, I received an email informing me of the following: My payments for the last two months had been rejected, that I had over $300 dollars in late fees, that they tried to reach me by calling me and by going to my apartment, and that if I did not made the full payment of that last two months plus late fees and charge back fees in the next 3 days, I would be evicted! I had no records in my phone of any calls being made to me from them, and I\u2019m never at my apartment during business hours because I\u2019m in the Auburn campus. But they could not be bothered to email me about this until 3 days before I would get evicted! They waited more than 70 days to send me a freaking email, and gave me less than a week to pay them. I immediately told them that I will pay the two months of rent but that I will not pay any extra charges or fees. I proved to them that I received a confirmation email from them for both payments. Apparently, that email was worthless, because that email only means that your payment request went through, not that the bank transferred the money. They told me that I must have made a mistake when filling out my payment information. I proved to them that this is impossible because  I used my saved Checking account to pay, the same account that I have used for the last 2 years without any issues. Then, they told me that the payments did not go through because I did not have enough money in the bank at the time of the payments! So now I had to give them proof of my bank records of the last two months to show them that at the time of the payment, I had more than enough money in my account. I felt like I was had to be a lawyer to not get overcharged by these people. But what really made me mad is that after all this proof, they still had to \u201ctalk\u201d to their upper management to check on this. They proceeded to tell me that they wanted a freaking bank representative to basically prove to them that the bank did not make a mistake. Ridiculous! They could not admit that their online portal had a glitch or messed up. I had to invest too much time and effort in order to not get screwed over.\nThere is not enough space for me to write everything I want.

The floors were installed looking scuffed and the countertops are great at hiding spills and messes so be sure to clean often. The 40\" smart TV is nice if your roommates don't mind the noise, and the extra deep sinks are fantastic for hand washing dishes better than the dishwasher ever will.\n\nManagement doesn't communicate with the residents well, when they bother communicating at all. Even the people at the office are left out of the loop so you can hardly ever get straight answers from them, though they are always nice and never at fault themselves.\n\nThey cut bike locks and took all bikes off the property on short notice, while students were away on break, and have not been able to provide an adequate place for locking up bikes despite initially repeating promises of new equipment \"next week\" or \"in a few days.\"\n\nMaintenance has always been wonderful for me. They're always busy so you should expect to wait one or two business days, but I've never had to wait longer than two for any issue big or small.\n\nThe back gate is always padlocked and the front gate is always broken and left open. Don't let them fool you into thinking they finally fixed it, it will likely fail again after a few days and is a lost cause.\n\nJunk mail is a huge problem. There are literal buckets of overflowing junk mail at every set of mail boxes.\n\nThe internet provider, Airwaves, was bought out by Single Digits and the connection on our (recently upgraded) networks have become unreliable. The connection became slow and intermittent overnight. Basic security procedures are not provided for guests and the connection is even worse if you don't register your MAC addresses online, which can be a glitchy process requiring a call to tech support.\n\nI will no longer be recommending The Connection to others.\n\nOriginal review w/ 5 stars c. 2016:\nThe rent isn't bad for what you get. My apartment is clean and hasn't had any issues. Management can be tough to deal with, but it's even worse at most other places. The key is to go to the office yourself and speak with someone in person, and keep coming back. I had trouble even signing my lease; errors with the website and repeated phone calls with different staff. But on my first visit about the issue everything was sorted out and on the second I had my lease signed.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1547506126995, "text": "Good Afternoon Chase,\n\nThank you for the review, I will try to address your concerns in the order mentioned!\n\nFor most properties, rent will change from year to year. To keep up with the ever-evolving market, we decided to renovate last year. These renovations included installing hardwood flooring throughout the entire unit, replacing the previous countertops with granite in both the kitchen and bathrooms, putting in new sink fixtures in the kitchen and bathrooms, and setting up a 55\" tv in the common area of each renovated unit. While not everyone will appreciate these renovations equally, the majority will agree that they are both aesthetically pleasing and more practical.\n\nAs a management team, we do our best to make sure residents share the same knowledge that we do, whether it be through signage posted throughout the property, emails, etc. For the majority of updates, we will send an email to residents. To ensure you are receiving these emails, please make sure you are opted in to email updates in your resident portal. If you need any help changing this setting, please let us know!\n\nStoring bikes in the breezeway of the buildings is not only unsightly, but also a fire hazard. Resident safety is of great importance to us. With this in mind, we required residents to either remove their bikes from the breezeway or we removed them. However, upon removal, we stored the bikes for about two months and gave residents the option to have them returned for free.\n\nWe are glad to hear that your experience with maintenance has been so wonderful! While each issue varies, it is nice to hear that maintenance has always responded in a timely manner.\n\nYou are correct that the back gate was locked for a short time period around the summer. At the time, our gate contractor was unable to get to the property immediately and we made the decision to lock the back gate with resident safety in mind. Otherwise, the gate was able to be opened with or without an access device. With all technology, there are issues that inevitably occur. We have actually recently spoken with our gate contractor and they will be here by the end of the week to take a look at the gate. We will work with them to make sure this is not a routine occurrence!\n\nWe completely understand your frustration with junk mail. Unfortunately, with the amount of companies who advertise through mail, there is not much we can do on our end. To encourage residents not to litter any junk mail, we set up bins by each mailbox area for disposal of junk mail.\n\nFor any internet issues, Single Digits has asked that we advise residents to reach out to them by phone at (877) 778-9283. The internet service being provided is the same that was provided by Airwaves. However, we have reached out to Single Digits to see if there is anything we can do on our end to help and are waiting to hear back.\n\nWe sincerely appreciate everything you mentioned in your review and hope that we helped clarify some of your concerns. If you have any future recommendations or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at (334) 821-3301 or info@connectionauburn.com. We are always open to resident feedback!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3b98240b121:0xd0895806d3612fdd"}

Signing two leases at once is illegal.

This is age discrimination and also illegal. And finally with our fourth applicant, even though he passed, they made him pay the entire year up front. Also illegal.

No one on site knows anything and management likes to keep it that way, so getting things done or getting information is impossible. This is especially infuriating when they do renovations.

I feel compelled to write this review to warn present and future renters/parents of the issues with leasing at 160 Ross. My son has rented from 160 Ross and is now in his 4th lease. As noted, the rent rises every year with no new updates inside or out. THIS IS NOT WHY I AM WRITING.\nThis year because the complex did not fully rent out my son is in a 4 bedroom apartment by himself. Some would think this is a great thing but be warned, regardless as to the number of un-rented bedrooms in the unit, the utilities for that unit are the responsibility of whomever is living there. His utility bill for June and July was over$160+/mo total.  He does not use or have access to the other 3 bedrooms. After several discussions the complex agreed to subsidize the other 3 rooms @ $20 each (which is part of their lease agreement). That is helpful but does not cover the full utilities for the apartment unused spaces. Less the subsidy his portion was $80+.  Since he has lived there for 3+ years and in the same room for the last 2+ years he knows what his utility bills averaged.  He has never paid over $30+/mo. I thought these were supposed to be individual leases and a shared utility bill. He has no option other than to sublet (HA! HA! like anyone would be ignorant enough to do this) or pay the higher utility bills for the remainder of his lease. 160 Ross chose not to put anyone in this apartment and instead optioned to fill up other apartments. He did not even know he was not going to have roommates till July of 2019, well past his time to get out of a lease that was signed back in Nov. of 2018.  When you get down to it 160 Ross has decided he was going to be alone in the apartment and would be subject to cover all the utilities over the paltry subsidy. As I said before I would think very carefully about moving yourself or your son/daughter into 160 Ross or any American Campus Facility given the treatment of the residents.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2e3e18dd913:0xde2917d43088c354"}

They still need to amend their contract with the towing company so that it does not grant so much  autbority to the towing company, their interpretation  of towable vehicles is bias.\nI am dumbfounded that this company would allow a towing company to enter a permit only garage and tow the cars. According to Auburn Express towing, they have a deal with the complex to tow any car that does not display both the hang tag and decal to their satisfaction. One of the primary reasons students have cars is for their safety. This compromises their safety, because it subjects them to unsafe alternatives when their vehicles are wrongfully towed. I would understand if the complex issued warnings regarding the accurate placement of decals. I wonder what incentives the towing company offers the complex to give them such liberal access to a permit only garage.

I just got towed since I didn\u2019t have my hang tag on my car for about 48 hours while being parked in a spot that I\u2019m normally allowed to park in. This happened without my knowledge since I was out of town for the weekend. It happened even though I had my sticker that said my car\u2019s allowed to park in the deck in addition to them having my license plate and description of my car on file so they know the owner of the car lives here! You\u2019d think that would be enough or that someone would have the decency to let me know my car has been towed! The hallways are always trashed and cleaned on Friday morning before they get messed up again Friday and Saturday night. Resident activities are a waste of money and the good ones require you to show up a good amount of time before it starts to even allow you to get so much as a chicken biscuit. Finally, the wifi is either not working or acting like it works while still not working. All of this can be yours for the hefty price tag of 12 payments of $749 a month not including the skyrocketing prices of utilities. The price keeps going up even though the value keeps going down.

And the only good reviews on here are from a month ago and that is because they were giving out free food if you wrote a good review. If you are thinking of living here because it is close to campus and has great amenities, DO NOT LIVE HERE. 160 Ross was made fast and cheap. The walls are thin, you can hear the person above you, below you, and beside you, along with people walking in the halls. If you have a balcony, then good luck because you will hear people partying by the pool until early in the morning. and if you complain, they wont listen unless you tell them every day for a month. the doors to get in building are broken except for two. and the security guards will open the door for ANYONE. and when it is hot outside, the fire alarm will go off daily. It is now the fifth day in a row that the fire alarm has gone off in the morning. The rent amount goes up every month and i now pay 1000 a month. People throw up in the hallways and it is not cleaned up for weeks. Yes, 160 has a pool and gym but so does the Rec Center which is free for students and is way better than the pool and gym at 160. The wifi here will also randomly cut off and wont turn back on for a while. and the study rooms here are a joke! And they wont stop calling you to renew your lease after you have told the you wont renew 5 times. Also dont expect to park on the floor you live on if you get here past 7 pm and if you do park in the parking deck, be cautious because it is a CRASH ZONE! everyone drives fast and you cant see when you are turning the corner. also they forget to call pest control and roaches will appear in your freshly and weekly cleaned kitchen. walking to campus was enjoyable until construction started and now you have to walk on the street. If you call maintenance, dont except them to knock when they come. They have the key so they will walk right in, even if you are in the shower. another problem with privacy is that of you leave your blinds open, you are able to see directly into the whole room even if they are all the way across the courtyard. Also if you ever except to have guests, they will not find any parking. And the \"resident activities\" are always something random and scheduled in the middle of the day when everyone has class.

You can either trust me and start looking for other places or feel free to read about 160 Ross:\n\n160 Ross puts on a facade that they care about their residents and keeping everything running smoothly but a group of monkeys could run 160 better than the management does currently. You will never speak with a manager, they always send out the young kids to deliver their messages because it's usually is not what you want to hear and they don't have the spine to come out and say it for themselves so they always have others speak on their behalf. And when you call to speak with a manager, they are out of their office and won't be back for a few days. And then they are supposed to be back, they're \"out of the office\" again.\n\nI understand that the employees at 160 can come into the residents rooms if they have a reason but a little bit of notice would be nice. I have been getting out of the shower and had a 160 employee walk into my room without knocking. If they do knock on the front door, it's after they have already unlocked the door and began to open it.\n\nWhen it comes to maintenance, don't expect anything to ever get done. Our living room fan had water leaking through it from the ceiling and they came to take the fan down and fix the leak but they left our fan on the ground outside for about a month before we had to call again to get them to put it back up on the ceiling. And the very next storm, it leaked again and they came, took the fan down and again, it was about 3 weeks before we called to get the fan out back up. Our AC went out for 5 days this summer with extremely minimal help at all. We notified them the morning after our AC went out and we were told they'd come look at it and try to fix it. When they came, they looked at the AC, couldn't figure it out so they told us they were \"troubleshooting\" to fix the issue. This \"troubleshooting went on for 4 days until they finally had an outside vendor fix it. Meanwhile, we were given a portable AC unit to put in our living room. That made the air feel great if you were about two feet away from it. Our room was at 86 degrees at night, and I am really not concerned about us four human residents as I was for the dog we had in our room. And yes, I know it is not a pet friendly place but the dog was allowed to be their as it was an emotional support animal. And 160 was well aware we had the dog in the room. It wasn't until the afternoon before the AC got fixed that they gave each of us window AC units to have until it was fixed.\n\nI have also seen a 160 employee sweep broken glass, bottles (plastic and glass), plastic bags and all sorts of other random trash from the dumpsters into the water drain on multiple occasions. When I said something to him about it, he told me that the drain collected trash and kept it under 160. I told him that it was a water/storm drain but he argued with me that it was for trash and that what he was doing was fine. Eventually I was told I didn't know what I was talking about and to leave him alone, and so I did.\n\nIf you have any questions for them, always get your answers in writing. They will tell you one thing and do they exact opposite, hoping you don't notice or care so having their answers in writing will only help you if you decide to live there.\n\nI understand that this was just my (and partly my roommates) experience with 160 Ross and there very well may be people who have had great experiences with them. For example, the people in the room below us had lived their for 2 years and were resigning again. When I asked why, the main reason was convenience  of already being their, not necessarily the quality of 160. However, my experience with them was far less than ideal and I would recommend not living there.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1506353899124, "text": "Ryan, Thank you for being open about your experience?your feedback helps us to further improve our services at American Campus Communities.

Not only is the furniture and quality always great in my apartment and my actual bedroom but so are the products they provide like the dishwasher, oven, and fridge.

There are two wireless hookups and so if one is slower than you want (usually because of bandwidth issues) then I switch to the other wifi and it is perfectly fine because there's not 600 people on it. There's even a hard-wire hookup if you want even faster internet!\n\nAs far as cost to standard of living ratio I think it is great.

Plus the amenities are great and always clean.\n\nThe apartment community rules are completely fair and not strict at all. I understand that they are there for my safety as well as others so I have no problems with the pool not being 24 hours, etc.\n\nNow for the residents. 160 Ross has an amazing staff, and they are always there to help. I have had to call the on-site community assistant (CA) for noise complaints before and they took care of it at 0230 in the morning. It is a place where college students live so there will be noise but if you ask a CA to tell them to quiet down then they will. Also, after some home football games there is some stuff in the hallways like beer cans, and I walk past them and go to my room but when I go back out they are gone. I really get the feeling that the staff cares about the community and their residents.\n\nI know I was rambling on and on but I saw the reviews online and just had to say something. Everything about living here is worth it, and if you have any shred of knowledge you will understand that not everything is perfect but 160 Ross really does try their best to make it so.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1545347126399, "text": "Hi Robert,\nWe're so glad you're enjoying living at 160 Ross as well as love American Campus Communities!

I don't know how many times I had to call a CA or even the police, but it was ridiculous. Our AC broke approximately 15 times during our stay (I think its safe to say it never got fixed even with multiple maintenance requests & visits), so even when only 1 person was living there, we consistently had an utility overage fee. The rent kept going up and the utility allowance kept going down. The hallways are consistently filthy (albeit not always 160's fault).

As a student, wifi is of great importance and this place really just either doesn't care or just doesn't understand? I'm not sure which it is, but the wifi is laughably horrible. I lived here last year and we were constantly told it would get better- fast forward to this year and it's new wifi & ironically worse than the year before. Not only is it IMPOSSIBLE to do schoolwork from your own living space (that you pay an absurd amount for), but I am also from out-of-state and I cannot even FaceTime my parents, because it's \"poor connection\" every single call. I've held my tongue, because the staff has been great to me and there's nothing wrong with the apt aside from this, but I simply cannot take it anymore. This may not seem like a big issue, but once you can't do schoolwork from your home, FaceTime your own family that lives miles away just to see them, or do anything even relatively productive on any electronic device for longer than 5 minutes, you really start to question if $800+/month even makes sense- so if your life involves any sort of technology and you don't live under a rock, this place might not be for you.

If you have a package delivered you have to pick it up during office hours, but the office closes at 5. If you do not pick your package up within a few days, they will send it back. This becomes a problem for those of us who do not get off work until late. You can't have a roommate or friend pick it up for you. The flooring in my kitchen has gaps from where maintenance had to take out our fridge, the fire alarm is going off weekly, there are very few quest spots (which becomes a problem when people visit from out of town), very unsanitary (vomit is left in the hallway for days), very little security (was told there would be cameras on every floor, that was a joke. You walk down concrete hallways without a camera in sight. Oh, did I mention we have gotten letters about needing to keep our doors locked at all times because people are stealing, wouldn't be a problem if there was cameras), and the parking deck is a major hazard (90 degree turns with no mirrors to see if anyone is coming from the other direction). I pay $25 for reserved parking so I can park in one of about 250 spots. My \"reserved parking\" is not a specific spot for me, it is in any of the \"reserved spot.\" This causes me to rarely (twice this year) be able to park on my floor even if there are open spots for non reserved parking. If someone pays for \"reserved parking,\" then they have to park in the \"reserved spots\" or they will be towed. So basically you are just paying to have just as bad of a spot as non-reserved parking. Last year we actually had a spot, but this year it is a complete scam.

The walls and ceilings are paper thin. I'm not sure if its just the people who live above us by it feels like one of them is about to come crashing through the ceiling at any moment. It is pretty easy to hear your neighbors if they are talking slightly above a normal tone. My roommate often describes the noise as something similar to a flag football team playing above us. The AC unit is pretty loud since its in the living room behind some doors which isn't crazy unreasonable since its not on 24/7. I haven't seen any flooding that has been reported in other ratings so hopefully that's less of a problem now. Living in a room facing the courtyard is nice  and from what i've heard its better than facing the roadway because of noise.

There are many reasons why I love staying in my apartment!\n1. My apartment faces pretty much a forest, so if I'm out on my balcony, I have an awesome view and a lot of privacy. I love even sitting on my couch with the blinds open and looking out of the window and hearing the birds chirping.\n2. These apartments are spacious. Kitchen is narrow, but there is lots of countertop space and cabinet storage space. I also have a coat closet, a pantry (probably supposed to be linen closet, but I put my food there), a walk-in laundry room and two huge bedroom closets. My bedroom is big enough for a king bed. The dining area is big enough for my parent's hand-me-down kitchen table and china cabinet.\n3. For the space you get, the price is right. They're always doing rent specials too, so be sure to ask management what the current special is. When I signed up, I got $300 off my first 3 months of rent, and I really needed that.\n4. Dog park! This complex is so dog-friendly, and my poodle loves the dog park. All of my friends want to meet me at my complex with their dogs so we can have puppy play dates.\n5. Pool and gym... they've been under construction, but they look awesome, and I can't wait to try them out.\n6. Community-wide wifi. It's fast and reliable, and because it's community-wide, it's way cheaper than if you set up wifi yourself.\n7. You can save up for apartment upgrades through their \"Dasmen points\" system. You get points for paying rent on time, referring a friend to move in, etc. Points can be redeemed for new shower head, new smart thermostat, or even a stainless steel appliance package for your kitchen.\n8. Super safe. I have walked laps around the community at 9-10 p.m. with no issues or fears.\n9. SUPER FRIENDLY staff! They all seem to know me and my dog by name. They always smile and wave when they see you. Very responsive via email.\n10. Very quiet.  The way the apartments are set up, my living room doesn't share a wall with any neighbors. So you're never kept up at night from a loud TV or music.\n\nMy only complaints...\n1. I'm not a fan of my carpet. My friend lives in a first floor unit \u2014 these have a beautiful vinyl plank flooring in the living room. But I was told that 2nd and 3rd floor units have carpet (for the sound barrier). I'm saving up for a nice rug to put in my living room.\n2. They have stands for doggy bags around the complex, but they're always empty. So not every resident cleans up after their pets.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHtTzlOVTxgRolO0K8qoxnEDPLHFdcr1_OqEWz=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6TQRQoXawTQi5Tm9i86bthHWbapdojpd8sRhX=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMg6TB-cV4BbWkHLe2UmPMNSRzbroyunQJI6-b-=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUPVFZDU-JLTAjaae5M-O-9-PhiHTqb_eQIwHd=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuCPv_ZKs-qXzUzaqsEENzAAsbjVm3R6MxkjkQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwU8P-u51yJJ9rHdq3ksVp1kHOnh0_eKj-DiTG=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1598903153183, "text": "Thank you so much for taking the time to review our community.

I could not say more positive things about this apartment. The management staff is very friendly and truly make you feel like you are at home. There are community events all the time for residents and the management staff know me by name each time I come in or reach out. The maintenance staff is very courteous and quick to resolve any issues (all of mine have been incredibly minor). I live in a one bedroom apartment and I always get compliments on how spacious it is - the space is very smartly laid out. I can fit a full queen bedroom suite in my bedroom which was difficult to find with one bedroom apartments. It is also the only apartment that I have found that actually had a dedicated laundry room rather than a washer and dryer unit being in the kitchen or bathroom. The only negative I would say on that is that technically it could fit a full sized washer and dryer but I went for a stackable unit so I wouldn't loose accessibility to the extra shelving in the laundry room. Closet space in this apartment is PERFECT and I actually have enough storage space (there is extra storage in the laundry room and two large closets in the bedroom). The community is very quiet and all of my neighbors are very friendly. As a single woman, safety is important to me, and I feel very safe in this community and have no reservations about taking my dog out at night.\n\nThe community is kind of tucked away but it is also very close to a neighborhood Wal Mart and gas stations as well as downtown Birmingham so you don't feel like you are too far away from anything.\n\nI would recommend this apartment to anyone.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1547044298849, "text": "Hi Rebecca, thanks for the positive review!

I feel like they are trying to force me to stay against my will. I could understand if i was charged for 1-7 but not for the whole month and how can you force someone to stay somewhere they just don't want to not because of the property but because of management and the office staff.,CONTINUED on 7/17 So i got a 7 day notice and finally got a returned call back, I believe her name is Shannon, this was the same lady that I spoke with when i gave my 30 day notice the same lady that asked me to remove my last review, she really just tried to handle me!!!  she said they are starting the eviction process LADY I wanted to move 7/7/19 you kept me here (against my will just didn't want a negative mark on my credit so i complied) and said i would pay this month rent when I turn in my key because of lies and miscommunication she told me before I just cant trust anything she says at this point, so I agreed that I would pay July's rent in full when I'm moving out you know make one payment and be done, she told me \"that would not acceptable very RUDELY and because they are filing for an eviction I would have to pay the legal fees!!!! I'm sorry but if my memory serves me correctly I didn't want to stay here either!!! I've already paid my 1st month and security at my new house because I thought I would be out of this apartment on 7/7,  however that was not the case, I have no problem with paying my rent, again I've never had a late fee, never had a 7 day notice good tenant no complaints no nothing!!!I just do not trust the office staff so i would pay everything when i turned in the key I have the money to pay i just dont want them to say i owe anything else, Ive asked on several occasion to speak with someone higher then Shannon she says they are going to tell you the same thing, at this point I wouldn't personally  recommend this place to a fleas on a dogs balls, the apartments needs updates and lets not talk about how high your power bill is going to be because the heating and air conditions are older the Christ him self.

On the outside the apartments look nice and are in a good location (hence the two stars), but on the inside they are a complete disaster. To begin with, when I first moved in all the stainless steel appliances they boasted about were not yet fully assembled. When I first opened up the oven and dishwasher I was shocked to find pvc pipes, tubes, and screws just sitting inside them. Also half the light fixtures were without bulbs. I thought maybe they didn\u2019t have the place fully set up yet and called and they fixed it after a few days. Without a working oven at first and having just moved to a new town, I went out and got some microwave dinners... that\u2019s when I found shock number two. If the TV and living room lights are on and you use the microwave for longer than 60 seconds the power shorts out. They had an electrician come look at it and he told me the wiring was all done wrong and there was nothing he could do. Still to this day I only microwave in thirty second increments to avoid having to use the flashlight on my phone to find the breaker box and reset the power. The next issue I found was that the apartment is on a slant and the floors are uneven. So I had to completely rearrange the furniture in my room to keep the drawers in my chest from sliding out or my TV from being dangerously close to tipping over. The next issue was the plumbing... still to this day from time to time after having had it \u201cfixed\u201d three times all the sinks and tub in my apartment will randomly start filling from the bottom up with dirty water. My neighbor tells me it\u2019s done the same for him too. It\u2019s disgusting and I refuse to take baths and only shower because of it. Also when the Neighboor uses his food disposal the gunk starts pouring in from the bottom up on my side... a nasty surprise to have when cooking diner in the kitchen. And another major issue I had was there was no functioning cable connection when I arrived. The cable wire had been cut out of the wall by the construction crew. Charter made me get written permission from the complex to instal a new one, which took ages to get. My installation fee and labor fee came to  $83, and the complex refused to pay more than $30 because that was their \u201cpolicy\u201d, despite having promised functioning cable connections in the rent agreement. I could go on about issues in my apartment forever, but I\u2019ll stick to those main issues. The next problem I want to warn any future residents about is that the complex is misleading when saying they have a gym and self laundry service. The laundry room is under construction and has been since summer so is completely closed, and the gym was turned into a storage room \u201ctemporarily\u201d for several months now as well so is closed too. The pool didn\u2019t open until mid summer and would only be open a few hours on certain days, which apparently the office didn\u2019t know because several times I called to see if it was open before going only to pack everything and get down there to find it chained up with a big closed sign on it. Also the trash valet service is a mandatory $15/month fee, and they only pick up your trash after it\u2019s been sitting out for days. Oh and  the \u201ccafe\u201d is a kerig set up in the main office lol. Which gets me to the main office... good luck dealing with them. Management has turned over hands three times in the year I have lived here. Nobody ever knows what is going on and you get different answers from different people. Not to mention their hours are constantly changing, they will take one and two hour lunch breaks, and they close frequently for the most random of holidays I\u2019ve ever heard of. So good luck if you work a full time job trying to find a time when you are off and they are open to pick your packages up. I would not recommend this apartment complex.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1543349224918, "text": "Thank you for taking the time to give us a review. We are sorry to hear we missed the mark.

We then moved to Vestavia Place, The water bugs was awful the grounds was not kept and I had to make a police report agent the downstairs neighbor for Threatened me and my grandchildren several times, Although I was not afraid I decided to let the Law handle it, and she was evicted.\n\nThe  staff including the management team as changed more then five times in 15 months there is always new staff. The pool and workout room and Laundry room was closed all summer, and never once have they offered the residence any kind of prorated rent for our inconvenience, Our Apartment has several  internal and external problems  . When it rain it rains inside our kitchen and Mater Bathroom we have to put buckets in both rooms to catch the rain I have videos of the rain coming in. All the floors are cracked underneath the carpet , they have sent several floor guys in and each of them stated the floors need to be redone throughout the entire Property being they are over fifty years old, so when walking through the Apartment I can feel and hear the cracked floor. The leaves are never removed they just blow them onto the grass so we never have beautiful green grass its leaves and dirt everywhere, I had to request for them to repair the Hallway Bathroom the flooring was lifting up molding around the tub was coming off all the vents throughout the unit was full of dust it was nasty my husband and I had to do most of the deep cleaning to even move in, They had promised new appliances at move in instead they had old discoloring Mitch matched stove and refrigerator there, after a couple of weeks they finally replaced them.\n\nWhen we moved in we had ATT after the second week they told us we couldn't use ATT every resident must have Spectrum, so we were penalized  for breaking our ATT contract. Spectrum service are so awful everyday between 6pm and 9pm the internet works like a dial up service because so many people are logged on at once in this area. Just when we thought it couldn't get any worse  Vestaia Place/ Mountain Lodge Apt had Spectrum come in and rewire every united, Throughout December their has been strange men six or more walking through my home. Once I woke up to them in my Living room saying they was Spectrum yes the Apartment Manager had gave out everybody Apartment keys for these strangers to enter each united. On Wednesday Dec 19th they returned several of them they were in the attic which is connected to the bathroom in my bedroom. I asked them were was the Maintenance or Management because  I was uncomfortable leaving them in my home with my key. Spectrum employee re-insured me they would not be in the Apart alone he lied! When I returned I noticed things out of place  my husband sliver chain that was on the sink was gone, so I started to check around and notice my 35mm cameras was gone and two  Zizio remotes to both our band new Tvs. I had just deep cleaned my home and laid two remotes under ever Tv I know they were there. The chain I had just cleaned and my camera was on the table next to my bed because I sell online I was just using it the night before.\nThey didn't re hook the cable I had to move everything back and re hook all the cable cords a neighbor said the office never came spectrum locked the door with my key. I am headed today December 21st to make a Police report because the  Property Manager refuse to handle the problem or give my husband the Corporate office number. Before Spectrum she sent five Spanish guys in my Apartment saying they were the floor guys they to had my Apartment key, now uniform business cards nothing yet once again Vestavia Place gave Strangers my Apartment Key.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1545415928837, "text": "Thank you for taking the time to review our community.

Because I have not been so fortunate to experience any of the great things they are referencing.\n\nI'm sure Josh is a kind and hard worker (never met him), but that does not make actually living in this apartment complex a pleasant experience.\n\nI have lived here for just over a year and this has by far been my worst residential experience.\n\nThe rennovations within these units were very poorly done. I look around in my apartment and feel as though this place could fall apart at any moment.\n\nThe plumbing within these units is also terrible. I have completed countless maintenance requests for no resolve. I have also been asked to no longer use the shower in my bedroom, because it causes a leak in the apartment below me.\n\nMaintenance has even come to cut a portion of a wall out to resolve plumbing issues. I never got a completion notice and the wall was never repaired.\n\nYou should also be prepared for the water within the complex to be turned off without notice, for repairs that could take hours.\n\nThe HVAC System also works poorly and the age of this unit causes it to be quite drafty so expect high utilities expense.\n\nThe keys to my apartment somehow were \"misplaced\" by the leasing office. I was not informed by the leasing office, but by maintenance men when they came and knocked on my door asking for a copy of my key.\nIt was very difficult to take this up with anyone in the leasing office, because the turn over here is crazy. Very rare that I've walked into this office and seen the same face twice. (HUGE RED FLAG IN TERMS OF SAFETY FOR RESIDENTS)\n\nThe walls are very thin... You'll hear EVERYTHING your neighbors are doing and the outdoors areas are not kept clean.\n\nPlease also be prepared for whatever goes down your neighbors kitchen sink/garbage disposal because it will come up through yours and the smell is deathly.\n\nAnd the list goes on and on...\n\nMy suggestion: Before you stop into the leasing office, I suggest you drive through this complex and take a good hard look before they glaze you over with things that sound awesome and show you model apartments that would not actually stand up to everyday living.\n\nAlso, read EVERY review!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1539106463454, "text": "Thank you for taking the time to review our community.

We have maintence staff who are friendly and professional while in your home. Issues are usually handled in a reasonable time with some exceptions.\n\nThe seclusion and peace that my little peace of heaven offers is worth giving this place a look if you are in the market for a good stepping stone. I would not suggest this place for long-term living. The high turn over of office staff will make your head spin and there are more than a few foundational issues in the buildings themselves. There was a remodeling project started last summer that has yet to be completed.\n\nI do feel the pool is safe enough during the summer to allow my little ones to splash around and have been graced with a few great neighbors in my particular building. I don't really venture out beyond that. I also appreciate that this is a dog friendly complex. The complex is kind of cut out of and into a wooded area so the dogs get the run of the few grass areas available, but are kept completely clear ofhe toddler-friendly play area. t\n\nThe gym is figureprint monitored which makes me feel safe when I'm in there early mornings or late nights alone.

And to be the cherry on top my AC ran out of free on the same week. A cleanup crew came immediately after I reported the issue and placed fans and dehumidifiers in my apartment so we left for the night to get some rest being as it was 1230 when they arrived and they were gonna have to set up the equipment needed to dry out the ceiling. Talked to the office and asked if there was going to be any reduction to my rent for the month because of the inconvenience of the AC not working properly again and because of the water leak caused by negligence on the complex\u2019s part. They told me no to file a claim with my renters insurance because that was what renters insurance was for. I had never heard bad things about Alison Pointe but if anyone ever asks me if they should rent here I would strongly recommend them to go any where else. The rent is cheap and I know why now. They don\u2019t buy quality items or replace faulty ones but instead just let it inconvenience the renters.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0e2ab3b9d0bd:0x7137e6d07289207f"}
