Tickets and program said doors open at 6pm. Got there at 5:45 and parking lot was full of cars but no people. The doors had been opened for some time and the place was already full. Although there isn't really a bad seat in the house, there were certainly no choices.\n\n2. Seat savers. There were empty seats sprinkled throughout the venue. 2, 4 seats saved was common. Did see a line of 6 seats that were being saved. We were continually waved off by the seat savers. I suspect that is a result of rude, selfish church members. I don't care about the money but General Admission is first come first served and this was rude. Above and beyond rude.\n\n3. A group of 3 church members were next to us. The one by my wife had the nerve to ask her to stop singing. To stop singing, rudely! My wife is an excellent gospel singer herself and she wasn't singing loudly by any means. Of course, most of the audience was singing with every song. After their confrontation (it was a continuation because my wife isn't a push over for rude people) the woman commenced to belting as loudly as she wanted and so did her friends. (Although it doesn't matter, they were not good singers.)\n\nThe atmosphere was overall wonderful due to the Spirit moving through the performers. The church members need their culture changed. They're selfish and rude. Won't be back to that venue..\n\nTerry Alldredge\n\nFollow up on your follow up - I appreciate that you've responded however you've gone considerable lengths to avoid any responsibility. It figures... The rude lady identified herself as a member and stated she and her 2 friends were a 'singing group' there.\n\nThere is just simply no way that the number of people allowed inside before the posted door opening time had purchased VIP tickets. The place was at least 95% full.\n\nI'm sure you're a Spirit filled church and that you do good work for the Lord. It is apparent that this issue doesn't really phase you.\n\nAgain, won't be back...", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1555337552567, "text": "Terry,\nThank you so much for coming to the event at Clearbranch!  We are sorry you had some issues, but hope that your evening was an overall good one.  Keep in mind that this was not a Clearbranch Ministry event, but instead a national tour where we served as the venue.\nAs for your point about admission, general admission was let in at 6pm.  There were a number of people that purchased the VIP package offered by the promotion company.  This allowed them early entry.\nFor the point about seat savers, we are sorry.  This is not behavior we normally see so we have to say that we are surprised.  Keep in mind that there were a large number of people here that evening that were not Clearbranch members.\nWe are so sorry that your wife had a bad experience with the people sitting beside you.  Did these people identify them selves as Clearbranch members?  We ask because, once again, this is not typical behavior that we see.\nOverall Terry, we are sorry that you had a negative experience, but hope that you did get to enjoy the concert and that the evening was a blessing to you.  Have a fantastic Easter and please call our church office if there is something else we can help you with.\n\nMark Harvard\nDirector of Communications\nClearbranch UMC"}, "gmap_id": "0x8889744fc68de8e7:0x8b0063f4b54ff8f1"}

I toured almost every preschool in Madison County. It became almost an obsession. I wanted the BEST school for my daughter (even though she's only 2), as I'm sure all mothers do.  One where I knew she'd be safe. One where I knew she'd be taught and learn things. One where the teachers actually cared about her well being. One where they would work with me and keep me involved in everything. One that wouldn't break the bank.\n\nWhen I found the Preschool Program at MUMC, it seemed to check all of my boxes. My sweet girl has been attending for several months now and I can say confidently this Preschool Program is absolutely wonderful and everything I ever dreamed for her. My daughter loves going to \"school\" here. Her teachers seem like they truly care about their work and my daughter (shout out to Ms. Angela and Ms. Cheryl). It's not just a babysitting gig - they actually have a curriculum, structure, discipline, and my girl comes home just gabbing about all of the things she's learned and all the fun she had with her \"friends.\" The Director, Ms. Krista, is very kind, welcoming, and really seems to enjoy her job - she's also very organized and is a great communicator with us parents, which I really appreciate. The teachers and Ms. Krista all gave me wonderful guidance and instruction on how to potty train my daughter (I was very nervous because I'd never potty trained a kid before) and after just one weekend, she was potty trained - they've been really helpful with staying consistent at school, support what I do at home, and have been willing to work together with me on anything I've asked for. I feel that my daughter is well taken care of, and actually being challenged and taught things. The tuition isn't unreasonable and actually cheaper than some of those stand alone premium preschools that aren't tied to a church. Everyone is upbeat and full of joy here.  I highly recommend this Preschool Program to anyone!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626585a8c7f22d:0x4aacaa5b11de346f"}
