I had a rather large spider web-like crack in my windshield and decided to call to see if it could even be repaired.  I spoke with Brad, the owner, who was more than willing to help with the questions I had.  It was a few days before I was able to get the repair done but as soon as I contacted Brad, he had one of his technicians get in touch with me right away to make arrangements for getting the repair done.  I made arrangements with Kris to meet at a location convenient for both of us that same day.  Kris was very professional in his work, explaining the entire process to me as he worked and even took care of a couple of minor pits and scratches on my windshield that I hadn't even called them about.  The repair took probably the better part of an hour, but Kris was also working on two small chips in my wife's windshield as well.  All in all, we are happy with the results.  The repair saved us a ton of money in new glass and we don't have to worry about these chips leading to larger cracks.  One thing to remember, if you are getting a large area repaired, you should expect to see some evidence of the original damage remaining visible.  The material used to fill the cracks is good, but may not have quite the clarity of the rest of the glass after the repair is done.  This is a fact for any glass repair job and not the fault of Magic City Glass.\n\nThis was a long review, but I wanted to tell my story for others to see.  I am quite picky with my vehicles and would recommend Magic City Glass to anyone needing glass repair.  They are courteous, prompt, honest and want to do what it takes to make a customer happy.  I did not need any headlight restoration work done, but understand that they do great work in that area as well.  Support a locally owned small business and give them a call!

I was a little taken back, but I use Turtle Wax Professional Rubbing Compound a lot to get out scratches that haven't taken the clear coat off and I got the majority of the scratches off. All but a few were off from the wax.\n\nWell about 48 hours go by, and I started taking pictures of my vehicle to get it ready to be sold and there is a crack coming from the passenger side. I had not hit a rock or anything and it had only been 2 days. I had driven a total of 26 miles. I paid $200 for the windshield repair, which totaled out to be $100 per day with not crack in my windshield. Crazy stuff.\n\nThis was just 2 days ago. In the past 24 hours I have called them (not exaggerating) 12 times. I have left 2 voice messages, 1 just explaining my situation and 1 rather annoyed that it has taken this long to get back with me.\n\nI would not recommend this company to anyone looking to get a windshield replaced.

I had a rather large spider web-like crack in my windshield and decided to call to see if it could even be repaired.  I spoke with Brad, the owner, who was more than willing to help with the questions I had.  It was a few days before I was able to get the repair done but as soon as I contacted Brad, he had one of his technicians get in touch with me right away to make arrangements for getting the repair done.  I made arrangements with Kris to meet at a location convenient for both of us that same day.  Kris was very professional in his work, explaining the entire process to me as he worked and even took care of a couple of minor pits and scratches on my windshield that I hadn't even called them about.  The repair took probably the better part of an hour, but Kris was also working on two small chips in my wife's windshield as well.  All in all, we are happy with the results.  The repair saved us a ton of money in new glass and we don't have to worry about these chips leading to larger cracks.  One thing to remember, if you are getting a large area repaired, you should expect to see some evidence of the original damage remaining visible.  The material used to fill the cracks is good, but may not have quite the clarity of the rest of the glass after the repair is done.  This is a fact for any glass repair job and not the fault of Magic City Glass.\n\nThis was a long review, but I wanted to tell my story for others to see.  I am quite picky with my vehicles and would recommend Magic City Glass to anyone needing glass repair.  They are courteous, prompt, honest and want to do what it takes to make a customer happy.  I did not need any headlight restoration work done, but understand that they do great work in that area as well.  Support a locally owned small business and give them a call!

Then seated it with the debris in the seal. I didn't complain and there were no leaks. I forgot about it.\n\nLess than 2 years later, the whole window is completely frosted. Called July 10th about warranty on window, was told there would be a warranty on the window. Took a week for him to pull the paper work. Took almost two weeks for him to call the manufacturer one time, only to leave a VM. No follow up call to them for a week. I've called about twice a week every week since this started and am getting no where.

I called and received a quote over the phone to replace my windshield. The price was well below Safelite and about average with other quotes. I made an appointment for the next morning and it was ready by noon.  Overall, the entire process was very simple, quick and to the point. The staff were friendly and professional. The inside of the business was also clean and tidy.\n\nI do have one complaint though, and I try my best not to give poor reviews. Also, seeing that 90% of the reviews are good, maybe it was just a fluke, but important to note nonetheless. When I picked up the car, the windshield placement looked fine (from what a non experienced person could tell) but the inside dash had a layer of fine and semi-fine glass shards mixed with rubber debris. It was even inside my air vents so I couldn't turn on the air for fear that the glass particles would end up all over me. Also there were some on the floor and cup holders. I had to clean this up immediately once I got home. I wouldn't have minded so much if it was just plastic/rubber debris, because I've come to expect when you have work done on your car, they leave a little mess, but this was glass and that is not acceptable.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1427131071286, "text": "Stephanie,\n\nI truly apologize for your vehicle not being cleaned to your satisfaction.

My SUV was more difficult. I asked for good quality glass and I'm not exactly sure what I got.\nI wanted the glass installed following the instructions spelled out in the factory Service Manual. When I would explain to the installers how it NEEDED to be done they pushed back by saying that was not necessary. My SUV has a specific way to install the windshield that is out of the ordinary. If steps aren't followed then its going to leak. They assured me that it wouldn't leak the way they did it and I really did not want to put that to the test with their way of doing it. I supplied my own new factory gasket for the job. If I had not had that they would have reused the 20 year old gasket that was glued to the old windshield. The manual says to use a NEW gasket.\n\nAll the glass installers I have delt with to get this done have just about all been the same. They are payed by they job and want to get done and on to the next job. I care about my car and if I'm gong to pay to have this done I want it done right. As the customer they need to consider that I probably have a good idea what I'm talking about and should listen and absorb what I'm telling them because I didn't want it to leak and I know they didn't want to have to come back and fix it.\n\nMy experience with the installers that came today was the reason for the bad rating. I don't appreciate their attitude towards my instructions I had for them.  I walked inside to get cash to pay them while they were working and quietly came back outside to hear them talking about me and how I was trying to micromanage them.  One of the guys actually told me he could see why they other companies didn't want to do the job. Which was a rude thing to say. He couldn't handle I wanted things done a certain way (the correct way).\n\nI'm sure most windshields are simple and easy to replace.
