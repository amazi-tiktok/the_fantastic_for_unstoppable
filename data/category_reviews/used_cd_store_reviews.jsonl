Otherwise my daily triggering isn't as fair as the safe place Im constantly demanding.  Those computer screens, along with cash and cards are much grosser that you'd think. Washing hands before TAKING the order just creates the need to wash them again. We wash hands 100% of the time before making ANY beverages. ALWAYS HAVE AND ALWAYS WILL. But yeah, that's gross, and probably embarrassing to the guy attempting to take your order. Downright deplorable. You know that feeling right?  We've all been there and it ALWAYS happens at the worst possible time.  What matters though, really, is the recovery. I hate that you had to leave so abruptly though, as you missed the part where he washed his hands before preparing the drink you ordered. It was good too. I know because I drank it. We love you either way. Even when we don't meet your expectations. We will put your feedback to good use and make it a learning experience.
