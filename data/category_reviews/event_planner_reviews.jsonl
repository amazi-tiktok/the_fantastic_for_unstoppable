I ordered the Camile club with no mayo. When I received my sandwich, it had mayo. So, I calmly went back up and explained that I didn't want mayo. I was told it could be fixed.\n\nWhile waiting on my sandwich, I noticed the staff watching me and speaking quietly, but I ignored it. 5 minutes later I was called back and when I went to check my sandwich again, I noticed the residue from mayo. It looked as if someone had wiped the mayo off and changed the bread. Again, calmly, I went back up (once again noticing the staff snickering) and asked to speak to the manager for a refund. Said-manager whose name I couldn't get, claimed she was there the whole time they \"remade\" my sandwich and it was fresh. I told her that couldn't be the case because it was now cold, it took her less time to make it than originally and I showed her a piece of lettuce that had mayo in it.\n\nShe then rudely asked me if I still had my receipt, which I did. I was given a refund, but I don't appreciate the way I was treated. If I'm paying for a meal, I expect it to made the way I requested it. I didn't ask them to make me a sandwich befitting God.

I feel that I should be able to pick out  a picture of the flowers and container that I would like to purchase, pay for it, and have it delivered. When I order an item, let's say a new chair,  I can see a photo of the  chair and know what I am paying for ,and when it arrives it should be the chair I ordered. I don't like paying for something that is NOT what I ordered. While I understand fresh flowers may need to be substituted the arrangement should resemble the photo. Flowers should be similar and the container should be exact.  A container should not be in a photo on the website if it is not \" in stock\". This is false advertising. Each individual florist probably doesn't have what is pictured on the Teleflora websites.\nI called the florist and expressed my concern and followed up with an email with pictures of what I ordered and what was delivered.  I ordered a beautiful sturdy white wicker basket with flowers and what I got was a cheap multicolored Easter egg basket. They substituted the basket and after I complained they were willing to offer me a credit of $2.50. What a joke!  I will not use this florist in the future for any reason and will never use a site that is managed by Teleflora. My thoughts are that the Teleflora company has way too many florist and they do not know what each flower shop has in stock. So when you order from a site like this one, you NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO GET. BEWARE. I wish I could put a photo on this commentary. I paid $45.73 for something that was NOT what I ordered.  Here is the response from the florist:\n\nThank you for your recent order. We pride ourselves on delivering the best, most fresh and most similar arrangements that we can for our customers and we have been doing so for over 38 year in the Shoals area! I am very glad you were pleased with the flowers that we provided for you and your mother.\n\nIn response to your recent request for a 50% refund here is our answer:\nThe basket chosen was unavailable and a similar value was substitute per our substitution policy.\nWe were also instructed to call and leave on the front porch if no one was available. Which we did. Our standard policy is to call and if there is no response, and no one is home, we leave a message as to where the flowers are. Since we were instructed, by you, to leave them, they were; only after a phone call was made. Had you not told us to leave the arrangement, and weather was not good for our arrangement, we would have left a message detailing where the arrangement could be picked up.\nAlso, you did not order from a 3rd party person. You placed your order on our website, which is managed and updated by Teleflora. They are our wire service and website managing team. They have thousands of florists that they service and we all obviously have different items in stock. They do a generic picture, and when a picture is chosen we try to fill the order as best we can with the flowers we have on hand at that particular time. Flowers are very seasonal and have a high turnover because of spoilage. Next time, a  call directly to the florist could save you a substitution since you would know immediately what they had available at that time.\n\nAs far as using another florist, they would offer the same substitution policy as us, so I don't know that you would've been happier.\n\nSince you were happy with the flowers provided in the arrangement and they were Pretty and Fresh I can NOT offer you a 1/2 refund of the product, being as though you were please with it. I will however refund you the \"basket\" charge since you were not pleased with the substitution chosen. I will be adding a refund of the Full container charge of $2.50 to your card. I hope this helps.\nThank you for your business.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d4eb6ed4ce74d:0xf4773df3daae3fbb"}

Fresh, juicy tomatoes burst with sweetness along with pungent garlic. The sweetness and acidity of the balsamic add another layer of flavor and fresh basil turns it up with herbaceous flair. Rating: 4.5/5\n\nBrie and Marmalade Bites starts with a phyllo cup filled with orange marmalade, brie, and herbs. It is a light bite and would be great as a passed hors d\u2019oeuvre for a wedding or corporate event. The creamy brie combined with the sweetness and citrus flavor of the marmalade pair perfectly together. Rating: 5/5\n\nCaesar Salad is made with fresh romaine lettuce tossed with house-made Caesar dressing with anchovy. I love Caesar salad but it is very hard to find a place that makes it correctly. If you do not like anchovies, do not order a Caesar salad. It is just not a Caesar salad without it. Chef David makes a great Caesar salad dressing, not too thin and not too thick. The perfect viscosity to cling to the lettuce. I love that Chef David makes a crostini seasoned with butter, salt, and pepper instead of chunky, clunky croutons. It\u2019s easier to eat and elevates the salad as well. Chef David, you need to bottle and sell that dressing! Rating: 5/5\n\nChicken Marsala is made with mushrooms, shallots, garlic, and parsley served over angel hair pasta. The chicken gently bathes in the sauce and really infuses the flavors into the chicken. It is tender and unlike any chicken marsala I\u2019ve ever had. But that sauce is like liquid gold. It clings to the angel hair pasta like silk sheets. You can\u2019t help but lick the plate afterwards. I could see this on a fine dining establishment\u2019s menu. It is so refined and delicious! Rating: 5/5\n\nChocolate Fondant (Americans refer to this as a chocolate lava cake or molten chocolate cake) is basically a bi-product of a flourless chocolate cake and a souffl\u00e9. Chef David served his with macerated strawberries and strawberry coulis. If you go to my Instagram, I have a video of the chocolate \u201clava\u201d flowing from the cake.

Lecia, my day of coordinator, made sure that all of the d\u00e9cor for the reception was taken care of two days in advance and set everything out-it looked absolutely gorgeous. Everything she did relieved me and my mom of so much day-of stress. Hannah, my bride's assistant, was at my side during all of the pictures before the ceremony, holding my flowers when I needed help with my dress, adjusting my train, pinning my hair back and making sure my veil was in place at all times. She was truly a lifesaver and made it so easy for me to enjoy taking pictures and had everything you could possibly need from bobbie pins, to a mirror, to a glass of water. Tina is extremely honest and straight forward, which I LOVE. I always felt that she had my best interest in mind and would give me the best advice so I could make decisions regarding all aspects of the wedding. I am not from Chattanooga, so I had questions about almost every vendor and she never steered me wrong. She was so much fun to get to know and from the beginning, I felt at ease with her, knowing she was going to be on top of everything for the reception. Since I had a church ceremony, she did not coordinate for that, but she made sure to know all of the details and really took my vision and made it a reality for the entire event. If you are looking for a coordinator, and don't want to spend a fortune, In Style Weddings is the way to go. They do not sacrifice professionalism or quality of service, they are extremely helpful, can fit into almost any bride's budget, and are absolutely worth every penny for the peace of mind they provide!

It's truly the BEST BBQ locally.  Everything on the menu is homemade.  They offer everything from the best variety picks of vegetables (sweet potato is the bomb and HUGE, fried okra, corn on the cob, great fried green tomatoes are so yummy, field peas, mashed potatoes, cabbage\u2026 all recommended). The Q stew, i.e.:Brunswick stew is a winner. ALL PORK AND BEEF platters, inside or outside chopped, served with 1 or 2 sides,  French bread or cornbread will fill you up with a to-go box for sure. The ribs fall off the bone,  and I truly recommend the chef salad.  All dressings are homemade. Price per person is about $10-14 for a full meal. Homemade lemonade and sweet tea are outstanding. Don't forget dessert.  The pecan pie and lemon pie are the best around. If you've got the time to wait, their steaks are excellent too. Chopped steak is my favorite, the fried chicken fingers are so crisp and tender. My kids love them. They cater too, and do a very good job.

To my enthusiasm n surprise, Country's BBQ. I grew up in Columbus, Ga and go back from time to time. And EVERY TIME I do go back 1st place I stop is Country's. I LOVE Columbus Country BBQ and longed for it. About 3pm when we first walked in, the Mgr told us \"to walk over there, grab a menu and seat where ever we wanted\". There was 2 other couples in dining area. The waitress was outstanding!! I don't remember her name, but she was super bubblely. But we were so disappointed with the food. I ordered my usual; pulled pork platter. Husband ordered his usual; 1/2 chicken. Well the pork was drowned in chutney n coleslaw juices, which totally ruined the taste mainly b/c I don't like chutney. I used a numerous amount of napkins to dry up the juice. Husband's chicken looked liked it was cooked the day before or real early that morning. The BBQ sauce was dried and skin was wrinkled up and some spots were burnt. It was very dry. Husband informed waitress and she was very helpful and offered another one, fresher or something else. He ordered another chicken. The 2nd chicken was a more moist but didn't compare to the taste of Country's in Columbus. If Jim is affiliated with this establishment, he would be ashamed. Also, the Mgr had fixed a plate for herself and sat and ate. Not once did she come over to ask about why we sent it back.  How convenient it would've been since we travel through Montgomery often and it's closer than Columbus for us. Needless to say, we won't be coming back or if by some chance we do, we will hope to remember and not order the same thing.......", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1448860779322, "text": "Dear Pamala,\n\nI am so sorry to hear about your recent experience at our Zelda Road location.

About 4 orders were picked up while we waited 10 more minutes (added item to order) for our order.

Not cooked what-so-ever. I was soo disappointed. Was really looking forward to trying the side dishes. Now I travel a lot and have been to great BBQ places across the US and outside the US and this is definetly not one of them. Anyone who says Country's BBQ is great has not had good BBQ. Aside from the poorly prepared side dishes the BBQ (chicken and beef) was just okay, definetly not worth mentioning.
