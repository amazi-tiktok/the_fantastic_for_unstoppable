He comes over to find out what the issue is and I explained to him how it's been forever since I ordered a cheese pizza and a bowl of pasta for my kids that are in the hotel Room starving to which he apologized and went to ask the waitress what was going on. She whispered to him that I was being belligerent and rude even though that is entirely untrue the patron at the bar can attest to that. The owner then turned to me and explain to me how the customer is not always right as if I had been causing a problem to which I explained to him the only issue I've created was when I asked where my order was at no time was I ever belligerent and he should talk to people around to find out the truth before just blindly believing his head waitress. In the end he felt he should give me my money back I got my pizza the fed achenia turned out to be linguine the chicken was so overcooked it was in edible. The pizza was great the service was total  Krapp. The airconditioner in the front of the store is leaking water so much that they had to empty a picture and it was all over the floor entire time.

Didn't ask for our name or number to call when it was ready.\n\nWe stood around for another 10 minutes waiting for her to come back so we could tell her to get our number to call us when it was ready. She told us it would be about 30 minutes and they would call.\n\nAlmost an hour later, we received no phone call and I had to call them to ask if it was ready, which they said it was.\n\nI walked back over from our hotel, paid for our pizza, only to find out when I opened the box (because they clearly didn't check it) that she had put the wrong order in for our pizza.\n\nAt that point we told them we just wanted a refund.\n\nWE RECEIVED NO APOLOGIES FROM YOUR INCOMPETENT AND UNTRAINED STAFF, JUST AN ATTITUDE.\n\nI don't care how good the pizza is, your service was awful.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fd7562089b5:0x177315578d833c37"}
