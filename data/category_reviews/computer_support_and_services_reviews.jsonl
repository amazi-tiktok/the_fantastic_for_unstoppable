When sampan picks up the phone i have a feeling that person is administrator or like a supervisor talking (professional) and knows right away what to do or how to complete the task. Or an another example: I send them a ticket with my issues, and the tickets gets answered within a minutes, not like 2 - 3hours like you would expect from another companies.\n\nOverhaul, I am super happy with the service i get and the support from Great Team, and the Performance of my server.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cb0319b2051:0x1e18b592b88f72aa"}

I had an issue with my computer charge port so I dropped it off to get it diagnosed for repair. I was later told it was the DC jack needing replaced and the repair would cost 150.00. I was blown away at the price so I decided to think on it. Shawn told me the part alone cost 50 dollars. I told him I would rather look around for another computer and I would like to pick up my computer. He told me come on by and pick it up the following day. A few days later I decided to pull it apart and see how detailed the work was. As I took it apart I noticed there was no hard drive in it. I called Shawn as he proceeded to say that that happens sometimes and his kid must have forgot to put it back in when they were looking for the issue.

My concern was the fact that I observed a gentle man sitting about 30 feet away in front of the computer store watching.  Once I entered the store, I ask him did he see what was about to happen. He indicated that he did. Then he stated that people have accidents all the time.  I decided to take my business somewhere else because his lack of concern for a welfare of a potential customer. Besides he indicated that he did not need the business when I ask him.  I can not speak about how well they repair computers, I will leave that to the others who have comments.

I have always been treated very well from them so, NO I did not want to change. After a while of thinking about it SEVERAL MONTHS and my Son hammering me with the RJ YOUNG name, I did it. I purchased a machine from RJ YOUNG.\nAt first I was skeptical and to be honest I really didn't want to give it a chance (The Machine), but I did and after several months and barely using the machine I starting coming more around it and using it a little more & more. Then I began to really like it because it really printed so nice and pretty fast. It only took me  8 to 10 months to like it but you have to understand I WAS A XEROX Man and I thought there was NOTHING out there but Xerox. The Xerox machine has ALWAYS  performed outstanding and the SERVICE was the best, I was spoiled from that. However, I found out that there was more out there than XEROX! I found out that RJ YOUNG was REAL and believe me they have made a believer out of me. The Service that I thought would not compare to XEROX, has showed me they are just as good and if not BETTER. I never thought I would say that but it is so true. I can not believe how fast the Service Technicians reply to the service calls. They are always polite, and get me back up and running in a very quickly manner. They have such good personalities and a smile! As for the Ladies at the Home Office, Oh My How can you NOT like them. They are AMAZING. They always tell me they will have my supplies on the way or a Technician asap. IT IS JUST SO HARD TO PUT IN WORDS what RJ Young has done for my business. This is a very caring company and to be honest I am so glad that I have some of their product and that I was introduced to the World outside of XEROX. RICO machines have made my life SO MUCH Better and I am so happy that I have changed.

I take it out to show the guy and he presses all over it, and while he is telling me my battery is swollen and causing the screen to bend, he turns it on and my screen was split in half! I couldn't use half my screen! I work 2 blocks away and have been very careful with my phone (have had a bent-ish screen for months!) so I really don't think this happened in my pocket. I called him out on it as soon as I saw the screen and he said \"Look, you can't even use the screen now\". He proceeded to talk about other things with my phone and didn't address the problem of him breaking my screen. He priced a screen and battery for me, but I declined and walked out because he broke my screen and absolutely refused to acknowledge it. I went back to the office, called this place and asked to speak to the manager. He asked what was wrong and I told him about the staff breaking my screen. He reveals that the guy I'm speaking with on the phone is the one who \"helped\" me in the store, and said that he is the manager and owned the store. I calmly explained to him what he did and how I watched him do it right in front of my face. He REFUSED to take responsibility and tried offering a $10 discount for both screen and battery instead. I said no thanks, and to have a nice day before hanging up. I am SO upset - I ended up just buying a new phone since it was about the same cost of what he would charge for a screen and battery.

Being said that feel free to bring it in anytime and we can diagnose and let you know what other issues you may have and what it will cost but we don\u2019t have any guarantees for phones that have been worked on by nonprofessionals.\nThank you and have a great day"}, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc46fc6b8c9:0x315fad46bea8efd0"}

Not only that, but the device was dropped off quickly, without any contact information, and with very few details.\n\nI replaced the battery with the after-market battery she provided and then attempted to boot up the device, but to no avail. I investigated further but was unable to find a solution. Pam then arrived to pick up her device, and she was, understandably, very upset to find it not working. She wanted it in working order right then and there, and while I understand her sentiments, I can only do so much so quickly. I needed more time to troubleshoot and determine the problem and possible solution, but she would not allow it. I was even willing to reimburse her with a fair value for her device.\n\nI have been in business for more than 10 years now. I work hard every day, and I like to think that I am very good at what I do. I manage hundreds of computers monthly, and I repair and fix many devices daily (thousands of devices yearly). I can remove a device's back/screen in a few minutes with simply a bit of heat and some playing cards, and I have never had any issues. I would never damage a device intentionally. I treat all repairs as if they were my own. That being said, mistakes can (and do) happen as there are many risks involved with these repairs, but I do my best to make things right. To me, it's not just about collecting payment for the services I provide\u2014although that is necessary for me to stay in business and provide for my family. It's about building long-term relationships with my clients, and I deeply enjoy helping and providing knowledge to my clients.\n\nThis is the first complaint I have received with the BBB, and I would truly like to resolve the issue, and have the opportunity to change your outlook on me and your experience with my business. CH PC Repair is my business\u2014it has my name in it, a fact that I am proud of and would never change.\n\nSincerely,\nChad Harbin\nCH PC Repair"}, "gmap_id": "0x88623f52db6fed93:0x398f7a17a9216be3"}

I broke the screen badly the first time and the wonderful people at phone Probs worked diligently to fix it and make it like brand new again.\nAfter leaving phone Probs(extremely satisfied), I went to the Apple store to buy a phone case for my iPhone 7 Plus. The tech accidentally broke the screen on it and told me it was because the people who replaced my phone screen(He was implying Phone Probs) didn\u2019t instal it right. I was mad, as anyone would be, and I was very expressive in telling phone Probs they owed me a new screen for installing a faulty one. Now, I am a very very VERY  verbal person, and even after I fed them my 2 cents, 25 cents, and a few swear words in between, Drew and his wonderful father still stood by my side and tried to assist me. While they didn\u2019t replace it for free, they showed me how it couldn\u2019t have just broke and the Apple guy probably broke it and didn\u2019t own up to it, they helped me replace the screen and I am forever satisfied with this business again.\nThey are good people with hearts of gold. And they put up with a lot. And I meant ALOT. So next time you need a phone repair, laptop repair, or even computer, go see these guys at Phone Probs. They will do everything they can to help you be satisfied and keep coming back.\nI went from having an iPhone so badly bent and cracked that you couldn\u2019t even use it right to one that looks dang near new! Thank you Phone Probs!\n\n-Google Verified Review", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1509251979628, "text": "We are sorry to hear this and we strive to do quality work.
