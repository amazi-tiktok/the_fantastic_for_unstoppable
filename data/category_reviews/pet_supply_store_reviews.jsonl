Again, we are very sorry this happened during Chopper\u2019s visit to Lucky Dog back in January. It is never a good day when a pup goes home with a boo boo. We strive to be as gentle and safe with the pets in our care as we can, but unfortunately, sometimes these things do happen and it breaks our hearts. You did fail to mention, though, that your Schnauzer is a puppy, was in for his first ever haircut and had barely been handled prior coming here. This, of course, does not excuse the incident, but it does give context to the situation. Schnauzers get a very short blade on their heads and Chopper was in the process of having his head shaved when he jerked in reaction to a sound in the salon causing his groomer to lightly graze the edge of the top of his ear. Our Salon Manager handled Chopper\u2019s service and her incident rate was zero for the last year until this happened for which she was upfront and honest with you about and you told us you understood and even re-booked your next appointment. It was an incredibly minor nick as her reflexes are quick and it did not bleed. Again, we are very sorry that this happened to Chopper. We take things like this very seriously as it hurts us to see it happen, too. No groomer ever wants to accidentally injure a dog while in their care, but again, unfortunately, it is a trade risk when working with wiggly animals, especially puppies, and surgically sharpened equipment. Again, we deeply apologize and hope that you\u2019ll reconsider letting us take care of Chopper in the future. Additionally, I urge you to compare our reviews to those of the salon you recommended. You\u2019ll find they too have incidents happen and yours is our first complaint since we\u2019ve been open. Thanks again for your feedback. \u2764\ufe0f"}, "gmap_id": "0x8889159a6a1efbd1:0x684b11aa61d529a9"}

The owner of this facility and the manager were told on multiple occasions by employees and were aware of the following: Fire extinguishers (they only have 2) being extremely out of date, last checked back in 2015\u2014 also no evacuation plan, or safety drills, air vent maintenance doesn\u2019t take place\u2014 vents/filters not properly maintained can easily catch fire, this company works with LIVE animals, the safety of your dogs are not being considered as you can tell from the images.... everything is layered with years of dog dander and hair.\nWhen the heater gets turned on the smell of burning hair lasts for days and the company uses wax melts up front to mask the smells. They also stuff the vents they don\u2019t clean with smell good beads to mask the smell.\nEven daycare dogs are kenneled. Employees hang around upfront until around 9 when they decide to start putting dogs in daycare\u2014- this means if you\u2019re paying for a full day or even a half day of doggie daycare starting in the morning your furbabies are missing out on 2+ hours of socialization. This facility doesn\u2019t properly clean the daycare room. And weeks worth of hair is noticeable near the drains in the daycare play areas, this is extremely unsafe for your animals/the employees. The smell in this building that\u2019s separate from the building your drop off your dog is horrific. Dogs are left unsupervised in daycare, and the daycare supervision in maintained outside of the daycare rooms- so instead of dogs getting that one-on-one attention they are only monitored when barking has increased. Because of that, rooms aren\u2019t cleaned right away causing burns on paw pads from dogs playing around in urine. Most dogs have to be ran through Grooming to be spot cleaned before leaving. Bored dogs have started eating the walls of this establishment because of the lack of social interaction they receive. This facility illegally mentioned to employees that they can not pay overtime to them when they have worked 40+ hrs. Because of this, I believe the care of the animals that go there are being affected.\nDuring the recent snow storm an employee managed to chase a already nervous dog around the front lobby of this establishment causing him to run out of the front door. This dog was missing for a week and found with his hip shattered, and he had ate an entire toe off of himself.. this establishment paid his vet bill which included the cost of utilization. Clearly the proper training of employees is not being conducted. This facility also does not clean kennels often and when they do they use a dirty mop to wipe out the kennels. This is probably a factor to the outbreak of kennel cough they are currently battling.\nMany times employees just feed  dogs breakfast without even bothering to clean the kennel first or move the dog to a clean kennel.. that means that they were eating breakfast in their own filth and kenneled with it until daycare started up. In It\u2019s hard enough trusting someone, let along finding out an establishment you\u2019re paying LOTS of money to is neglecting your animal. This establishment recently caused the death of a small 4 lb dog, and they are trying to cover it up. By deleting comments and blocking any negativity they receive. I refuse to be silent.

I always thought she enjoyed it as she seemed excited to pull up and be dropped off. At around a year old, I started noticing a lot of staff turnover at the facility. Although I should have taken heed, I did not and my dog continued to attend day care regularly. I began noticing that my dog was very timid of the staff. In particular, she was called by one of the managers/trainers and immediately backed up, tail between her legs, and laid down in a submissive position behind me. This time I took note and my dog never returned to the facility. I still have pre-paid day care days that will go unused. When I inquired about my dog\u2019s reaction, it was explained to me by staff that my dog was regularly kept separate in a kennel in the back during the day. AND, that her \u201ctraining\u201d involved being taken into the yard, on a leash, while other dogs were allowed to approach her and she was given commands to obey. THIS RUINED MY DOG. She has dog aggression issues to this day, largely due to her extreme anxiety which I believe was engrained into her at a developmental stage while at JHH.

Oliver had a scratched cornea from playing a little hard and required surgery. I was stressed about what to do. I thought I could not take him to daycare while he recovered for surgery. He required extensive medications and needed to watched more closely in the cone of shame. The JHH team took care of Oliver post-op just as well as I would have at home. I never have to worry about my best friend while I am at work/class all day. I know he is being loved and played with as he is at home. I could not be more thankful for such incredible care of Oliver during his time of extra need. As a nurse, I am always caring for everyone else. I have been incredibly thankful to have someone help me out and give me peace of mind. Never bring your baby somewhere else! Sarah and her team are incredible. JHH is the best home away from home you can bring you furry friend to.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4WS7O5ToitlaW1kn5jGIWJEntUSyvkh2RrBux=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bbf43e944c7:0xc6636238acb27662"}

Unfortunately, I failed to inform Classy Pup, and missed my appointments.\n\nI called this morning, Monday April 13th, and I apologized and tried to explain the predicament I was placed in on Saturday. Whomever I spoke with was extremely rude, and would not let me finish speaking without overpowering and overwhelming the conversation. She at some point mentioned I\u2019m required to pre pay for both dogs (mind you I\u2019ve never used their service and don\u2019t know how I feel about prepaying), as well as for the appointments I missed? Because I didn\u2019t give them a 24 hour notice? My mother fell ill the evening before the appointments were scheduled, it would be impossible to give a 24 hours notice for this.\n\nIt was all very bizarre, and confusing. I\u2019ve used the same groomer for five years, and she recently went out of business and moved states; I\u2019m certain I can find another groomer to take care of my dogs\u2019 needs, but it\u2019s shameful Classy Pup is so tone deaf and belligerent.

You spoke with me the owner.  As I remember our conversation it was several days after your appointment you called to make another one.  No mention of your mothers illness and a very lighthearted  attitude about your missed appointment.  That is a huge deal to a small business, being that we had a hole of 2.5 blocked off hours in our schedule due to your dogs not coming in. Businesses cannot operate that way! And it was an appointment blocked off for 2 dogs... not one.   Our business model requires a prepayment deposit to be make after 2 missed appointments, that will be credited to the following appointment. Two dogs no showing is 2 appointments missed and lost revenue for us. We are not always able to fill those appointments last minute, as was the case. This is only our way of insuring that we will not have an empty slot in the future, not a  harsh personal attack as you infer.\nRegards, Lisa"}, "gmap_id": "0x888922759e8b6b6b:0xb958c1f8ea411005"}

The business is located in the downstairs of a building which you access from behind the building. There is no sign indicating this at the front of the building. When I arrived I parked up front and opened the front door to find an abandoned filthy building. I quickly closed the door and ran back to my car. I almost left then, but decided to drive around behind the building. That is when I saw the downstairs door. The upstairs door should be locked with a sign instructing you to go around back. When you get inside everything looks dated, but that's not the problem. I dropped my dog off at 1030. I was told that she would be done around 2 possibly 3 but that I would receive a call 30 minutes before she was ready. I was also told that she would be taken out of the kennel to walk and for a potty break (although there's no grass for this that I saw). At 1:30 I called to check and was told that it would definitely be 3 but that she would call 30 minutes before she was done and she sounded aggravated that I called. At 230 my husband and I decided to leave to pick up some lunch before picking the dog up, and at 309 I still hadn't heard from her. At that point my dog had been there almost 5 hours so I just headed straight there. I got there and she was still working on my dog but only for about 5-10 more minutes after I got there even though I hadn't received a call that she was 30 minutes from being done. Almost as soon as my dog was on the floor she peed which leads me to believe she was never walked or taken out to potty. She was shaved WAY shorter than I asked for her to be. I asked for a simple trim and instead she was shaved with a #5 blade. The lady argued with me and told me that I told her to cut her short, which I did not do.
