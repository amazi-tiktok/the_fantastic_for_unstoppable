Over that time we have made many purchases at both locations. In every case the people who help us have been amazing. they put the Southern in Southern Hospitality. Today we made a special trip to the Wood Salvage facility to purchase some beautiful bead board they had just salvaged from a home in Cullman. Most people go to their main store. But, if you have never need to the Wood salvage store - I highly recommend it.  Heath greeted us warmly and welcomed us to the store. Heath then patiently helped my wife select just the right boards for her project (headboard). He also offered some sage advice as he and my wife discussed different paint techniques.  Some of the boards were a little long to fit in bed of truck for ride back to Florida. No problem.  \u201cHeath individually cut the longer ones to fit in bed of truck while making sure my wife\u2019s project had adequately sized boards. He is also a genuinely nice person.
