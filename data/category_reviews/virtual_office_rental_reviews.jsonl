We broke the lease on our apartment and packed up all our belongings. The day of closing they called us and said they couldn't approve us till September. My wife is a disabled veteran and now 4 months pregnant. Because of the incompetence and blatant dishonesty of mortgage right we were homeless for the 4rth of July. We recently found out from our new loan company that (M.R) never even started the V.A. application process. They knew from day 1 that they wouldn't approve us but still lied to us for a whole month taking our appraisal, and Ernest money. The treatment we received was out right despicable the agents at their South Carolina office. Made us loose a substantial amount of money 1000.00 for the U-haul alone. They will be hearing from our attorney about that.\nWe will be reporting them to the B.B.B and we are currently in the process of getting this company black listed from the V.A.
