I brought my girlfriend here to partake in splatter painting as one of our anniversary activities. The reservation process was quick and effortless on their website. You walk in and have your temp taken, you're given a squirt of sanitizer for your hands and then you sign your waiver if you did not already complete this step online. After completing the waiver a super friendly employee directed us to a table that had been set up with a cute anniversary sign, decorations, chocolate, champagne and our blank canvas. We were then able to add designs with tape that would be peeled off post splatter painting while enjoying our glass of champagne. Once we finished our champagne, part 2 of the fun began. We were taken to the splatter paint room where we put on our protective wear over our clothes, shoe protectors and goggles. While an employee went over the basics, we were given a bluetooth speaker to play music,  they exited, turned off the lights, we blasted our music and the anniversary paint party began! You reserve the room for an hour so you can splatter till you can't splatter anymore. Once finished, one of the owners came in to grab our masterpiece to place on the table to have the tape peeled off and allow it to dry a little. We took off all protective gear, wiped what little paint got on our faces off and decided to sit at their cute bar station to have a couple margaritas and a beer. They have a decent selection of snacks and drinks. The strawberry margaritas were sooooo good. You can easily kill some time while your paint is trying to dry. My girlfriend and I got the pleasure of meeting and speaking to the owners who happen to be husband and wife. They were nothing short of a delight! Wonderful personalities, warm and welcoming. They informed us about their various craft classes that another group was doing. This particular group was making candles and they let us know what a great and fun experience they had. My girlfriend and I will certainly be back to try one of the crafts out. If you're looking for something fun and different,  come here. The owners deserve all of Bham's business! Can't wait to return. Thank you all for such an amazing experience!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888917b632a9ec61:0x6a33f26353436292"}

We went to Shula\u2019s on Valentine\u2019s day. I made reservations 5 days before which gave me the options of 3 time slots. I took the earlier time. When I arrived, (5 minutes late and we called to say so) we had to wait an additional 15-20 to have our table which gave me the impression that they were busy. There was nobody in the PLACE and we had to wait! Olive Garden, Outback does this too: They make you wait and the place is only half full! They purposely make it seem as if they are busy when in fact out of 16 tables in the back room, only 3 were occupied. There were 2 black couples and us.\nThe black female waitress didn\u2019t have \u201cher game on\u201d as she expressed to the couple behind me. For $150.00 + you better have your S\u2014t together!  We ordered different wines and she never identified to us which wines they were. She just placed them in front of us and proceeded to take our order. She incorrectly took our order by not remembering. Did not write it down either. I ordered the 14 oz. rib eye grilled Pittsburg style, med-rare. She returned to our table telling me that they gave me the next size steak for the same price of the 14 oz. because she did not remember the order. We\u2019ll  guess that was OK. When it came it was not P-Burg style. I asked for sour cream for the mashed potatoes and she did not bring that as well. I noticed the lack of friendliness to me and my GF compared to her report w/ the other American-African couples. She just did not care,\nWhen I commented to her about the experience, I tried to do so in a kindly fashion. She never listened to my advice. Her response was \u201cyou don\u2019t have to tip me\u201d. Well I still tipped , but only 10% for the service.

We were seated at a super small table and we ordered bruschetta as an appetizer, my wife ordered the house meatballs, and I ordered their chicken alfredo spaghetti. When the \"Bruschetta\" arrived, our table was now \"full\" with the plate containing the \"toast\" with tomatoes masquerading as\"bruschetta\", and our two dining plates.  Normally, bruschetta is served on some type of grilled French, or \"specialty\" bread. Nope, ours was served on 3 pieces of \"toast\", cut diagonally, and fresh out of the bread wrapper.  Only the first piece was edible because the reason you don't use fresh bread is because it becomes soggy very quickly which is exactly what happened with the following 5 pieces of \"toast\". Oh, they tried to help it out by charing the bread pretty good, but it didn't keep the center of each slice from literally folding over and dumping the bruschetta all over the plate, table AND my clothes as I tried to eat it. The overly toasted crusts were best used to dip my wife's meatball sauce while she wasn't looking.\n\nSoon, my chicken alfredo spaghetti arrived, and it looked nice, creamy, no place to put it however on our uselessly small table so I had to give up my dining plate and just eat my remaining bruschetta straight off of the serving platter...  AND...  WAIT A MINUTE... that's not spaghetti, it's penne pasta. We summoned our waiter, and he apologized but said that he was pretty sure that the chicken alfredo was always served over penne pasta. After requesting the menu again, I pointed out the word \"spaghetti\" in the description of their \"Chicken Alfredo Spaghetti\" and he quickly disappeared. Soon, a woman, whom did not introduce herself, appears at our table and says \"So, you're not a penne kind of guy huh?\". I replied, \"No, I'm not.\"  She then tells me that they are \"out of spaghetti\" and that she'll \"get them to make me anything else on the menu\". What she's really telling me is WoW, you do know the difference between spaghetti and penne pasta, AND noticed that we just substituted what you ordered with whatever we had...\n\nMy wife was about half through with her house meatballs by this time so I told that I was fine and didn't wish to order anything else. And she hopped right up and disappeared as quickly as my appetite had, never to be seen again.  I left slightly ahead of my wife and when our server told me \"Hope to see you again soon...\", I just replied, \"You won't\" as I made my way to the street.\n\nI really don't understand how anyone can find this sort of treatment \"acceptable\". I don't, and they've lost me, my recommendation to my friends and family, coworkers, business customers and clients as a place to get a good meal and have a nice time.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPknd14kfbI_V-pGEeKBWEiBeRUH6MvosxcKf9C=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3i1JY8rXB3PBUrxT7XTT7rsJS_D-aFIyanub9=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMw5HMPJzRLH7SHNL6gSfvklrHFWSIUUMGwMd4z=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bb5a07760dd:0x9e5262ceb80f18a3"}

My boyfriend and I had to sit in the rocking chairs off to the side. I didn't mind our seating arrangement cause the chairs were very comfortable. However,after going to the restroom and returning, my chair leaned backwards into the hookah causing the coal to fall into my lap and my boot. Luckily, I was able to remove the coal quickly enough from my lap, but it had embedded deeply enough into my boot that I could not get to it quickly enough. The flames have caused second degree burns on my foot and my ankle. I am not bashing the company. I always have a grand time when I go,but I do feel that as a place with open fires and hazardous equipment the owner/manager should have a first aid kit for accidents such as mine. When i asked the server for some ointment she said they didn't have any. They were kind enough to give me a bag of ice at least. However, I just feel that the situation could've been handled better. After the incident happened and the ice was given my server continued her duties and I had to end my night early to get the proper medical supplies for the burns on my foot. IF YOU INTEND ON GOING HERE BE WARNED NOT TO SIT IN THE ROCKING CHAIRS WHILE SMOKING A HOOKAH OR TELL YOUR SERVER TO SET THE HOOKAH FURTHER AWAY FROM THE CHAIRS. my overall experience and respect for this place has plummeted. Accidents do happen, but with the proper customer service somethings could be looked over.
