We prefer to take care of issues as they arise and never allow them to accumulate or become unkempt housing conditions. Believe me it costs us less to fix things as they become an issue and there is a great expense upon turnover to  bring one back from resident neglect. Had maintenance needs been reported both parties would have had a better experience during tenancy as well as had a better taste in each of our mouths at the end of residency.\n\nI hope you have found happiness in your housing, since.

This place has been through 3 different owners.The first set of owners, who pioneered the existence of this trailer park, were the Odom family, and they brought our community together by having an open door,  a laundry mat/storm shelter, and holiday parties each year. They treated us like family and made us feel welcomed. Thank you to the Odom family and their staff: Mrs. Brown, Jessie, Reginald, and Miss Mary Anne. The 2nd set of owners lived out of state and closed down the office. They started coming to open the office just a few days out of the month, but we had already lost that sense of family community and were not able to get to know them like the first owners. We started becoming concerned about the park because of neglect. And, before we knew it, they sold and we were under new management. Bridget is the new community manager, and she makes us feel welcomed too. I am so thankful that the new owners have started investing into this park and have built a new picnic pavilion and playground for the kids. They have plans to tear down the old tennis court and build a basketball court. I know that when you place a little money to focus on the kids then it will draw families and make our park a great success. This is a family-friendly park and a place where we try to get to know our neighbors.

Three of the 4 kitchen drawers were covered in green, fuzzy mold both inside & out. The carpets were not steam cleaned & left us with black bottomed socks. The cupboards were not clean. Ants swarmed inside the home & inside our vehicles several times. We found mud tunnels under the kitchen sink as if the ants had incorporated the place in to their massive ant hill colony. There's roaches of all sizes, some as big as you'd see in a zoo & they fly. We could hear dripping between the roof & the ceiling even when it wasn't raining & rain poured inside the living room window when it was raining. The dryer drum didn't turn so they replaced it with another dryer. The one they brought was so filthy on the inside that it took 2-3 hours to scrub it clean before it could be used. Previous repairs were not done properly but instead done with crummy looking shortcuts. Management had told us that 2 places were available & that this one needed the least amount of work. The fact that any of this was acceptable to rent to anyone indicates that management desperately needs to be replaced with management that has a much higher level of standards.

Our monthly bills are never delivered on time and they get mad at us for not paying the specific amount, and if they do deliver it they just throw it on the porch, SOMETIMES they'll tape it to our door. But if they do it'll be a few days late.\nThe repairs call for breaking the road, and the road repairs can take up to months to be fixed.

Now if you're renting a trailer you're obviously going to have to pay more than I did and also I'm sure the prices has went up considering they were bought out so the same people that own the part when I live there or not there anymore there are not near as many speed bumps as there are in the park I Live Now basically the park I Live Now has coming in and going out 40 speed bumps you have to go over and Cahaba mobile home real estate does not have near that many as in any trailer park the best advice I can give you is just to stay to yourself or if you're lucky you will are could meet a few good neighbors the park I am in now it's mostly at least  spent 80% of the Hispanics community.

One of the workers was in a  bedroom fixing something and as soon as he was told about the crack, he stopped what he was doing to check on it.

Feel free to call me directly And let me know if there\u2019s anything else I can do to help be of service. My number is 310-745-3108. I hope that helps. Let me know if you have any other questions."}, "gmap_id": "0x888e86c658480b21:0xbdfb3cc7887ad60c"}

What Mrs knight forgot to mention was after she moved in on September 2018 she lost her job and did not pay her rent from November 2018-January 2019 and still owes a balance of $1,250. We agreed to not file a eviction if she voluntarily vacated. Once Mrs Knight moved out she abandoned her personal belongings without communication at our cost to have to store the items in the unit and then clean it out after 14 days. We tried calling, texting and emailing Mrs Knight without response and we have record of that. After 14 days we cleared out the unit, which is our only solution in this circumstance as per the rules by alabama state law. As far as her bed bug complaint.. there were no bed bugs when Mrs Knight moved into the home and we never received any communication that there were until now.

Everyone tries to look out for one another, so in a way we have our own neighborhood watch program. We are in unincorporated Jefferson County  and Jefferson County Sheriffs Department will respond if there happens to be s problem. Forestdale is the responding Paramedic/Fire Department and have been very helpful in several emergency situations that have come up in the past few years.\nThere are quite a few new families moving in with children of all ages, so this is a very family friendly environment. We are zoned for Gardendale High School (EXCELLENT SCHOOL SYSTEM) and Brookville Elementary Schools.  If you happen to be looking for Christian or Private schooling, Sumiton Christian School starts enrollment in Kindergarten and goes all the way through high school and is about 15-20 minutes away and  there is also Forestdale Baptist School that also begins enrolling in kindergarten and goes to the sixth grade and is about 7- 10 minutes away.\nOverall, this is a diverse community of friendly people.\nI suggest stopping by the office around the first of each month or calling the park manager to schedule a time to walk through and get a feel for the community.  I describe it as living in the country with all of the city's conveniences.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889029aaf18a54f:0xeecf77042c6b6624"}

I fell in love with that particular block of Montgomery Alabama.  Everything in my life changed, I got divorced December 7th, fired from my job of 6 1/2 years exactly one week later.  I'd initially wanted to buy a mobile home and they didn't have a lot for one that long.  When I bought my camper and was informed I couldn't stay where I had taken it, I called again, just in case.  That's my hood!  I love I got to choose and they were willing to accomodate me!  I have no intention of leaving any time soon and it's just so good to come \"Home\", I've never had one of those before!   There are no words to describe how nice my neighbors are, how I have things precious to me sitting in my yard and no one has come along to bother them.  I am getting to live where I want to live and it's affordable!  Camper living is a whole other market.  I have a lovely yard, I can fence, my neighbors are awesome and one of my very favorite people at the job I work lives on the same street and she rides to work with me every day!  What a blessing!  Never mind bad reviews!  No one ever erected a statue for a critic.  I love where I am and I'm at Sunshine Village!!!!!!  I'm also a local artist, painter, in fact, have a huge collection I'd love to sell.  I decided to be a farmer, so I'm growing food, I teach English, paint classes, throw birthday and sip parties, I give rides, pick up orders and install and teach others about gardens.  All of these doors of opportunities opened up to me, because I wanted to live and moved to Sunshine Village!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c297ebfe40177:0x2f3374f84a973833"}

The management is terrible as they can't seem to keep a manager on site. During the five years I lived there, they hired and fired several managers. You can be cited, and threatened like I was if you are lucky, for the most insignificant things, also things not included in your rental agreement if they are not to the managers liking. I was threatened to be evicted if I didn't repaint the trim on my home because it looked \"wet\" they said. This home had been sitting there for years with the same paint, nobody said anything until I moved in. A friend of mine was threatened to be evicted if she didn't remove a box from her yard that management claimed was a dog house. It was a box her son used for parkour but management did not accept that as a valid response. You are only allowed two parking spots. Don't you dare park anywhere else because the minute you do someone will tell on you. It doesn't matter if its parking spaces in front of an empty lot, you will get in trouble. Also, you can expect there to be favorites as in any community. You will notice that in the lease agreement that trampolines and swingsets and small pools are not allowed, yet you will notice your neighbor has one they don't get in trouble but if you happen to have that item in your own yard, you will receive a written warning. There is an inground pool here but don't expect it to be clean and don't expect the pool monitor (if they even show up or have one on duty) to actually monitor anything at all. The last year I lived here the pool monitor brought her \"special cup\" and drank the whole time she was on duty. Other years there was only a monitor present for a few hours a day. If your neighbors are loud or unruly you might as well call the police because management won't do anything about it. Especially since there isn't any several months out of the year. At the time I sold my home there were at least 8 other residents who did the same because of the increases in rent and the poor management. During the years I lived there, at least once every two months there was a road block set up at the entrance. I am not exaggerating by any means, there were times that it was a few weeks apart instead of months apart. There's only one way in and out of the park, so the residents were constantly being subjected to being harassed by police just to get into the park and to their residence. All in all, this place was terrible to be as strict and overpriced as it is.

I was told that I had been denied the first time I applied but I immediately received a call back stating I had been approved with a $780 deposit I was thrilled to know I had finally had a place to call home I came into the office paid my $780 deposit on 08/08/2020 Amanda never told me how much more I would have to finish paying since I thought I\u2019d be moving in 08/22/2020 I thought it would be prorated 1st months rent . I called several times to find out the remainder and I was given the run around eventually I was told that the \u201cmarketing manager\u201d didn\u2019t base my approval on a $780 deposit which I had already paid but instead they wanted me to pay $1,085 plus 2 months rent $1,560 for a trailer . I immediately told Amanda I couldn\u2019t afford to pay that amount what had changed from what she told us ? If I knew that we would have never paid the $780 initially. I was told by Amanda to come into the office fill out a form and we would reviver our deposit back I filled out a form 08/13/2020 since then it is now 09/09/2020 and I have still not received my money back from the property ! I have to call everyday I have still been giving not enough answers on when I should get my money back . It saddens me to think the world could be so cruel when it comes down to money . We didn\u2019t hesitate to pay our deposit so we\u2019re unsure of why it\u2019s been over a month and we haven\u2019t received it yet. I planned to use that money for my next place before I\u2019m homeless and the property doesn\u2019t seem to care about giving people money back at an appropriate time especially when I\u2019m not even living at there property", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888e0519796fddb:0xf99ffab220266176"}
