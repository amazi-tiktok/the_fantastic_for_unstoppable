I drive from Daphne to visit his shop near the University of South AL and his booth at the Flea Market in Mobile. I do this because Scott, the proprietor, is not only knowledgeable but also genuinely friendly and accommodating! I have been a customer of his for many years and have purchased an Xbox 360, Xbox 1, Nintendo 64, Wii, and, more recently, the hard to find Nintendo Switch. Besides selling consoles dating back to the \u201980s (Nintendo, Sega, Etc.) Scott has a vast selection of games and accessories for all the consoles. Plus, he has repaired my phone screen more times than I can count. Scott provides returning customers with great discounts and bundle deals. He has also offered me store credit or trades that I\u2019m comfortable with; Unlike the unsatisfying offers, other establishments offer that will leave one feeling remorseful. Game-N-Trade also has a selection of comics and figurines, but I don\u2019t know much about those. So, cheers to Scott and Game-N-Trade for making my family and me delighted customers. I\u2019m confident once you visit his unique establishment and see the quality merchandise at exceptional prices, you\u2019ll understand why he has so many satisfied, returning customers.

So, I ran a battery testing app on it, and the replacement they installed performed WORSE than the original battery that was being replaced (the original was over 2 years old!)\n\nSo I brought it back to tell the owner, and he had the nerve to put a second garbage battery in my phone. Luckily, I looked at the battery as he was putting it in, and I saw that this \"NEW\" battery had the serial number literally covered up, with a black marker. I asked him why it was like that, and he stuttered and basically said nothing.\n\nI got my money back and ordered a do-it-yourself kit from amazon, and what do ya know, the battery works great and performs really well on my testing app. These guys are scam artists and they get away with it because most people would never think to act that way.\n\nBe very careful here, or go somewhere else.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1537291494172, "text": "Dear Zachary.

The man went on stating he didn\u2019t break her speaker but the person prior to him who fixed her phone damaged her speaker and camera. Now prior to him fixing my daughters phone, my son fixed her screen 8months ago and everything worked fine. I relayed this information to him in hopes of him reopening her phone to find the problem. He again stated, he will not. It will cost another $49.99. I asked for the manager. He replied he\u2019s the owner. I said so your not gonna do anything about not fixing my daughters phone correctly. He said no. Unless you pay $49.99, there\u2019s nothing else I can do. I said sir, do you know you just crushed a 15 year old lil girls heart who tried to do the right thing on her own?

I tell them that this problem occurred due to the repair work they performed.  The technician tells me that they could not verify the phone was working 100% prior to them working on it so there is nothing they can do to help.  They suggested I do a software update...I do it and after the update my antenna is still messed up.  I understand they couldn\u2019t test it because it was dead and it wouldn\u2019t take a charge.

I couldn't use half my screen! I work 2 blocks away and have been very careful with my phone (have had a bent-ish screen for months!) so I really don't think this happened in my pocket. I called him out on it as soon as I saw the screen and he said \"Look, you can't even use the screen now\". He proceeded to talk about other things with my phone and didn't address the problem of him breaking my screen. He priced a screen and battery for me, but I declined and walked out because he broke my screen and absolutely refused to acknowledge it. I went back to the office, called this place and asked to speak to the manager. He asked what was wrong and I told him about the staff breaking my screen. He reveals that the guy I'm speaking with on the phone is the one who \"helped\" me in the store, and said that he is the manager and owned the store. I calmly explained to him what he did and how I watched him do it right in front of my face. He REFUSED to take responsibility and tried offering a $10 discount for both screen and battery instead. I said no thanks, and to have a nice day before hanging up. I am SO upset - I ended up just buying a new phone since it was about the same cost of what he would charge for a screen and battery.

I broke the LCD screen of my Samsung Galaxy 6 and brought it in to be repaired. They asked for my phone number (I clarified that they wanted the number of the phone I was leaving with them), and told me to come back in a few hours. A few hours later, I come back and they haven't done anything yet. They said they'd have to replace the frame of my phone (because it would break when they removed it) as well but they didn't have a matching gold one in stock and needed my permission to use a white frame instead. The guy said \"we called you but couldn't get in touch\"...well yeah, you called the phone in your hand. So whatever, I come back a few hours later and it's still not done and I have to wait another half hour. I finally get it back and the frame is extended a few millimeters from the front of my phone- hard to describe but made it more difficult to press the home button and felt very fragile. A few months later, the frame is starting to peel off and I hear a crackling noise every time I press the screen. I took it to a different phone repair place back home, where I was told the first repair was incredibly sloppy. The guy there told me the first repair hadn't even glued the frame back on and it was a miracle it hadn't fallen off yet. For less than $50 (and in under an hour), he glued it on correctly and my phone looks new (aside from the mismatched front). I'm giving 2 stars because I understand things like the mismatched frame isn't their fault, and I knew it was going to be pricey, but overall it was not a good experience at all.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1573606687003, "text": "Please contact us and let us know how we can improve.

I say just give me my phone and a refund I'll take it elsewhere. I had already spent money on another phone that I brought home and doesn't work but I wasn't going to say anything about it.so then he says we can't do that ! I asked why and his answer was store policy ! It's my phone I own it ,it's my money ,I have had no service plus at the time it was 13 days far from the original 2 or 3 I was told .then he couldn't find my phone so I waited approximately 30 mins and the white guy comes out and says and you could see he was stalling.and said so what are you going to do?I said I'm waiting on my phone and my money.the Arab guy comes back hollering at the back find that phone .said I wasn't listening and I wasn't getting anything and proceeds to pull a sticker off my phone.I said I want my phone my money and leave that sticker on it .he said he didn't have to.took the sticker off and my phone to the back.at this point I was outraged,grabbed his moniter layer it over a said give me my damn phone and he called the police,police said it was a litagation issue when I talked to them and the thievery was not a 911 police matter .also if you look at the mama's of the 5 stars on this page you will find common ground in 85% of the names ! Today is day 19 one extra day from the last time I spoke with the liars at the phone clinic, I'll be returning to check in on things today with a real phone tech.and offer them one last chance to let them make it right,today ! The business is out of my way and would have never even went there had I not called ahead of time and was told the normal wait was a hour  !

Seems upstanding establishment.\n\nSon threw a friend in a pool and so we brought a second phone in. He said issues showed phone screen needed replacement and likely battery as well. After leaving phone with tech, he said replaced screen was in good shape, and that he didn't think i should pay for battery replacement. Wrote me a script for battery replacement at cost should we have any issues. Again, a wide opportunity to charge much more, yet he opted to be far more than fair.\n\nI'll never take another phone anywhere other than Ming's.

We feel that anything less than a 5 star rating means that we did not do our job to your 100% satisfaction.\n\nBased on what you wrote about the ear speaker, it's possible that the plastic film is still left on the screen or a small plastic film on the ear speaker mesh is still on. Those are installed during manufacturing to prevent scratches and has to be removed for full functionality. Please check and make sure there isn't anything blocking the ear speaker itself, if so please remove it. If that is not the problem, please bring it by and we will take care of the problem for you. Don't worry, we will do everything in our power to make sure you are 100% satisfied with your visit.\n\nThank you very much,\nMing"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4cd6e4d39e05:0xe5df27fa39089580"}

When you called a month ago, I explained to you that the charging port that controls the charging portion of the phone is part of the motherboard and not something that can be damaged during screen repair as we transfer over the whole motherboard. If it was damaged, it would not have been able to charge at all. I recommended trying a different charger to see if it was a charger issue and if not, bring it by and we would help take a look at it for you. When I didn\u2019t hear back from you, I assumed the problem was resolved.\n\nCharging issues like that are usually caused by charger going bad, broken solder joint on the charging port (caused by accidental bend of charger while plugged in), or sometimes if the battery is going out. So I think it is very unfair to us to give us such a bad review without giving us a chance to look at it and try to resolve the issue with you. Being a small local business, reviews like that can hurt us in a big way.\n\nSo if you can please give us a chance to properly diagnose your phone and resolve this issue, I would really really appreciate it.

Drove 45 miles to their store was told it'd be $300.00 just for parts.  Found another place that fixed it for $85.00 in 45 minutes. I hate being lied to to get business.\nEdit for reply:\nMy wife called Tuesday 1/5/21 and told whoever answered the phone, after telling them my issue (power button on my Samsung Galaxy S10 plus fell off). She was told that it wouldn't be a problem and no appointment needed that it'd be $79.00. As I mentioned before I live 45 miles away, I had to leave work early to make sure I had ample time to get there and to get service.\nYes, you are correct,  there was not a record or service ticket made because the guy there looked at my phone said that I'd have to leave it and that the parts would be $300.00 because the board would have to be changed out that the button was all one unit. I value my time and money as much as everyone else and I left without your service. Yes, I do feel like the initial phone call was a bait and switch just to get someone in the store. You know that $19.99 oil change costs $500 because you need tires,wipers, injector cleaning and \"blinker fluid\". It's just strange that my wife was told one thing and I was told another. I called another shop  told them exactly what was wrong, they said same thing. No problem, no appointment needed.  Took phone, they looked at it and the fixed it for the amount quoted.\nFunny thing that one shop said one thing and the other one did it.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1610116073880, "text": "Jason, I cannot find a repair ticket or record of your name, are you sure you have the right place? If so, I would like to reach out to you to find out what happened, as we do not give bogus pricing to obtain business. Mistakes do happen and if this indeed did happen, I'd love the chance to make it right!\n\nWe have a proven track record of being transparent throughout our entire repair process and we pride ourselves on having some of the best pricing in the industry. I especially appreciate this review because it gives me a chance to explain our repair process.\n\nBefore I start, i'd like to point out one thing, there is a giant discrepancy between $80.00 and $300.00. The only phone parts that cost this much are some of the Genuine Samsung Display Assemblies. If another shop was able to resolve this for $85.00, it was a small part repair, like a charging port or proxy sensor, for example. (If parts were needed.) My point is, our prices would have been comparable.\n\nWhen a customer calls in to obtain a price on a particular repair we do our best to go over the details of the problem or issue they are experiencing. If we are confident we know the solution to the issue at hand, we then will give you a price or at least a ballpark figure, so they know what to expect. If we are unsure what the solution is to the issue, we will ask you to bring the device in to be diagnosed, before giving you a price on the repair.\n\nThe Process.\n\n1. Once you come into our office, we go over the details of the issue you are experiencing with your device. We will then go over repair solutions or inform you that it will need further diagnostics to obtain the solution to the issue.\n\n2. We then obtain all your contact information and create you a ticket. We may at this time give you a price on the repair. Below are a couple normal situations.\n\n*Lets go over a couple examples, an iPhone 8, the screen is damaged, everything else on the device is working as intended (we verify this,) we give you a price on the display assembly replacement and an ETA for expected completion.\n\n*Now, lets say its a Gaming Computer, it is randomly turning off or blue screening. We will not know what the issue is without diagnosing all the hardware. In this situation, we will inform you that we will need to perform additional diagnostics to know what it will take to repair this device.\n\n3. Once we have obtained the device, we then will start the diagnostics or repair in the order that it came in. We have other repairs in front of new repairs. Your device will go into the queue and will be worked on when its ticket is next. There are two exceptions to this. Most phone screen repairs, if we have the parts on hand (which we do for all iPhones and some Samsungs,) are completed in an hour or less. (Time will vary depending on the particular repair.) The other exception is, we offer a rush service, this service is paid at the time of when you drop off the device. This is paid to have the device worked on immediately, otherwise tickets are worked on in the order they are received.\n\n4. Once the repair or diagnosis is completed, we then will email, text, and/or call you, to go over any final or further details.\n\n5. Pick up your device and pay for the repairs. Once a repair is completed you can come by and pick up your device at your convenience. We also offer payment options, you can pay in person with cash or card, or you can pay your invoice through our online portal.\n\n**One quick notes, due to COVID-19, we are not allowing our customers to wait on repairs in the lobby. They must either drop them off, wait in the their car, or outside of the building.\n\nJason, thank you for allowing us to go over this process with you and potential customers that may be reading this. Feel free to reach out to me, Clint Silver, owner at ProTek. I would love to know what happened and would love the opportunity to make it right. Thank you and as always, thanks for choosing ProTek!"}, "gmap_id": "0x886268c27f02ac7b:0xf37cf7fc81bd790a"}

I debated leaving this review because I know how harmful bad reviews can be to a small business. Unfortunately, my experience with ProTek was so disappointing I felt obligated to share.\nWhen replacing my screen ProTek compromised the integrity of my water resistant IPhone XS causing it to be hyper sensitive to moisture. This resulted in my phone being corroded by light water exposure only 3days after the iPhone repair. ProTek then refused to refund me the 200$ for the faulty screen replacement which essentially destroyed my 1000$ phone. Let me be clear that my IPhone had been exposed to water on previous occasions to the screen replacement with no issues. ProTek even assured me that there was no water damage prior to the screen replacement. I had expected to have a better experience with ProTek because I had confidence in their customer reviews. Sadly, I have to say I was dissatisfied with their services. At the very least I hope others will take my experience with ProTek into consideration and proceed with caution in regards to ProTek\u2019s remarkable ineptitude with apple products.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1589823914117, "text": "I am very disappointed by this review, i'll explain why. Unfortunately for phones, we are in the warmer months and people like to be on the water and when you're on the water, these type of things will happen. I want to start off by saying that we repair and/or recover data from thousands of water damage devices. When you first brought the iPhone in for a screen replacement it was because you left the iPhone in the rain and it ruined the screen. (We informed the customer that the screen was the only thing damaged by the rain.) We replaced the screen and put a new screen seal on it, (as we do with all repairs.) The phone then came back with standing water inside the device, this amount of water is concurrent with other phones we see that have been submerged into water. The customer asked for a warranty on the screen, unfortunately we cannot warranty water or physical damage. (Simply putting a new screen on this iPhone would not resolve the issue, given the current condition.) In a case like this, with standing water inside the device, we would need to let the water dry (we have tools to speed this process up.) After the water has dried, it will leave corrosion behind, which will need to be cleaned. We would then remove the logic board from the iPhone housing, clean it with our Sonic Cleaner, and then test the device for further component damage. We then would replace the components needed to repair the device. More than likely we could have saved this customers phone, had the customer let us complete the water damage assessment on this device.\n\nPlease remember that iPhone's are not water proof, they are water resistant, and each iPhone has its own water resistance rating. We have seen water damage happen in pretty much every way, from being in your pocket and sweating, to being on the bathroom counter while taking a shower, and to drops in the ocean. Each iPhone handles each exposure differently, because in each exposure, the conditions are different. If you are going to be around water, buy a water proof bag, put your phone into the bag and use it from the outside the bag, only to remove it if you need to make a phone call. This will drastically minimize the chance of water damage. I hope this reply has answered any questions as to how we handle water damaged phones here at ProTek. If you have any questions, concerns, or just want some friendly advice, feel free to contact us at your convenience!"}, "gmap_id": "0x886268c27f02ac7b:0xf37cf7fc81bd790a"}

The tech was very professional and knowledgeable.  The problem was diagnosed quickly and he carefully explained all the options I had to consider.  In the end, I decided to purchase a refurbished laptop from them and transfer the data. The price on the refurbished laptop was fair and I am glad to be back up and running. I would recommend them to anyone.\nThank you ProTek. \ud83d\udc4d", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1619712616158, "text": "Thank you for the rating and review Mimi Shady Walnut!

I can tell just by the fit/finish, packaging, font, etc that these are definitely not a real Apple product, or even a refurbished unit.\n\nFrom what your customer told me, you reassured her that they were a legitimate product, and refused to offer her a refund, only store credit until she threatened to get mall management and the police involved.\n\nShame on you for preying on elderly and unknowing customers trying to get Christmas gifts for their families. She told me she spent the last $90 of her fixed income to get these for her daughter as a late Christmas gift.\n\nYou are selling items under false pretenses and not disclosing the authenticity of the products. Makes me wonder how many other people you have ripped off with this same scam. This is some shady business practices and unfortunately it can tarnish the customer\u2019s trust in cellular/mobile vendors and repair companies alike.\n\nPictured is the \u201cApple AirPods\u201d you sold her and the last picture is a stock image of the legitimate product from Google from a trusted device review source.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889292125aff38e7:0x6260c591fe0e3f11"}

A week or so passed and they called and said the part was in. I took my tablet in for repair they said they may not get to it that day because they were busy... understandable. Well I came back late the next day and they said they still haven't got to it and they would leave a note to do it first thing the next day. Well the next afternoon I called and they still didn't have it ready. So a few more days passed and they called and said they had broken the screen and had to order a whole new screen. Told us we had to wait for the tech to get paid because he had to pay for the new replacement parts. It took more than 1 month to get the new parts and for them to finally call us and say it's ready. We get to the store and ask to pick up the tablet and it is in horrible condition the back panel wasn't even put back on properly and had spots where it was raised up enough I could see the internals on the tablet. We refused to take it that time because it was not repaired. We also learned the the money we origanally paid them to fix it was refunded to the tech who had broken the tablet. The employee/tech refused to try to repair the tablet saying \"I'm not going to try to press that together and break that tablet.\" She was referring the the back panel I mentioned was raised up in places. We told her to contact the manager and she pulled out her cell phone called the manager and said \"These people are refusing to take the tablet and I'm so mad I'm about to just walk out\" the manager told her to tell us she would take a look at it tomorrow. A few days passed they called again and said it was ready so we went to get it and it was better condition but still it is very scuffed up on the trim all the way around the screen and the back is still slightly raised up in a few places. We took it anyway out of pure frustration with the employees and the manager. This place is a joke DO NOT take anything here to be fixed or you will regret it. This is the first time I've ever written a review but this place was so bad I felt like I needed to put it out there that this place is not a professional establishment and they treat their customers like garbage after you hand them your money.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1459787711858, "text": "Hello Ryan  I\u2019m sorry to hear about your bad experience.

Two days ago I took my iPod 5 in to get the screen replaced on it. The home button still worked on it prior to me dropping it off. Once I got my iPod Touch back with the screen repaired my home button no longer worked. Casey, the owner, claimed it to be a result of the damage that occurred to it prior and I had come to found out that it actually was a result of her improperly removing the button. She tore the conductive ribbon strip from the home button that lets it depress and click the dome switch underneath. She claimed that it was not her fault did not offer any kind of apology and told me it was unfixable.

If I could give less than 1 star, I would.  We took an iPad 3 to iFix on December 20th to have a broken screen replaced.  We called later that evening and went to pick it up after they said it was complete.  We tested the iPad while at the store in front of Tyler, an iFix employee, and the power button wouldn't work, the magnetic closure to put the iPad to sleep wouldn't work, and you couldn't lock/unlock the iPad.  They also scratched the body of the iPad around the edges when they replaced the screen.  Tyler made a note of the issues and agreed we could bring the iPad back for repair after the Christmas holiday.  While we had it, the screen detached from the iPad body.\n\nWe took it back to iFix on or about January 9th.  We had to swipe (erase all content) off the iPad for them to repair it, so we had to buy a new one to replace this one in the interim.  We have received NO communication from anyone with iFix since that time unless we've called for a status.  We have called numerous times to speak with the manager, David and Tyler the original employee dealing with us on this.  Each time it's the same story...they're working on it and since that time, David is no longer with them.  I emailed all of the contacts on the Corporate iFix website and never received a response.  The employee we were dealing with, Tyler, can't tell us anything and he said the district manager was now handling our case.\n\nAmber Wells, the District Manager with iFix, and they would not agree to refund the $196.19 we paid for the screen replacement and she said they can't repair it.  I filed a Better Business Bureau complaint in March and iFix never responded to it.  The leasing manager, Rhonda Clark, at Wiregrass Commons Mall has attempted to get this resolved with the owner but has not been successful.  Apparently there are other customers who have complained to the mall management because iFix won't stand behind their work, lack of work, or whatever you wish to call their shoddy attempt at service.\n\nAt the very minimum, they should have refunded what I paid for the repair.  Unfortunately now, I have no confidence that the iPad will ever work the same even if someone else replaces the screen.  PLEASE don't make the mistake of taking any devices to this store.\n\nAs of September 24, 2014 they STILL have my iPad.
