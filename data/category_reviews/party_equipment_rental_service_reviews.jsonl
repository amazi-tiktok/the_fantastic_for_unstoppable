Ended up calling Jump To It Inc and asking why it was removed and brought up some negative reviews which we read on Google. First they told me there were some issues and they would call me back, never did. I called them again Monday the following week and they stated they had issues with the slide we rented and it was being repaired. The person whom I spoke with stated it \"should be\" good for our party but if I see another I like they will swap it out. So I go on their site and searched and had to pretend like I was going to reserve just to see what was available. This whole experience left me uneasy so I went with another company and cancelled the rental and they gave me a refund minus 30 dollars which is a surcharge and that's fine.\n\nFast forward to the day of the party and the delivery guy shows up to setup the slide. I explain to him we cancelled the order and he was nice and ended up leaving. Keep in mind above the party was 12 - 3, he shows up at 3.

I didn't want just a slide or just a bounce house, and I didn't want to spend $150 more dollars for a different combination unit, I thought that was unfair and wanted to cancel my reservation. As soon as I told them I wanted to cancel The customer service went from great to fair (and by the end of my experience, poor).They called again and said they would give me a different combination unit that cost more and they would discount the amount so it was priced equal to what I had reserved. We ended up changing the date of the event partly because of this issue and our event was rescheduled to the last weekend in July. On the invoice I received the day before the event it showed a combination unit, that was priced more than the original and that they discounted the price so I didn't owe more. I was happy, it was what I wanted; a bounce house and slide together. When they show up on Saturday they bring a completely different unit. It was ONLY a slide. This is not what I wanted.

The 2nd time was for a school carnival.  We asked them to be there 2 hours before the carnival and they were late, they finished setting up right as the carnival started and left.   Right after they left a volunteer called me to the area and told me the inflatable wasn't staying inflated.  Turns out they didn't attach enough blowers (they had some of the sections knotted off). I called them and they couldn't come right back so the inflatable was down for about an hour of our 3 hour FUNDRAISER carnival.  As an \"I am sorry\" they offered a 50% discount on the next rental.   We decided to take them up on their offer and rented 2 inflatables for our Halloween Trunk or Treat.  Again, I asked them to be there at a certain time to leave plenty of time for set up and they were late again.  They pulled up 5 minutes before the event time and we had to block off our trunk or treat area and delay the start because their trucks were in the area of where the kids had to go.  They set up and left.  About 10 minutes into the carnival I got a call from a volunteer that there were 2 kids hurt on the inflatable because it wasn't staying inflated in the middle.  I inspected and it was not properly working.  I called Corey and he said he couldn't come back so we had to shut the inflatable down.  I communicated with him after the event about how unhappy we were and he informed me he would be sending a refund (I have this in a text message from him).  When I never got the refund he then said he would rather give us a discount on a future rental. I told him that we will never be renting from him again and we wanted the refund he told us he would be giving.  This business has ruined part of TWO fundraisers for a local elementary school and shows no remorse for the kids that got hurt.

Everything was delivered and picked up in accordance with the contract.\n\nRegrettably, I was very disappointed in the lack of professional guidance and foresight that the company provided concerning the setup for my event on 1/20/19 at Vulcan Park and Museum. First and foremost, the tent was not placed the way we discussed previously. After the initial discussion and sending a detailed floorplan to Top Notch, I arrived to find the tent's short side positioned parallel to the Vulcan statue. Due to this error and Top Notch\u2019s worker's unwillingness to help change it, a domino effect of massive changes that would ultimately have me working to change the entire floor plan two hours prior to the beginning of my own event \u2013 including moving tables, chairs, and other equipment around. The worker did not help with the changes in the floorplan. I even asked the worker if he could get some more sidewall for the other tent. He told me he would and never did.\n\nTo compound the poor set up experience, the tent would not stay warm after being guaranteed that the heaters \"would keep the tent very warm and we did not need any more heaters.\" I think that may have been the case if 1) both heaters worked the entire time and 2) the bottom of the tent would have been secured so the wind would not make them flap. A company that claims to have set up hundreds of events did not even ensure basic set up was accomplished. Due to the temperature inside the tent, the band refused to play. We had to wait nearly an hour before a repairperson arrived to fix the heater. Around 7:00 PM, the band resumed playing.\n\nI have not ever had an experience so horrible and on the day of my wedding reception makes this exponentially worse. As I know mistakes happen, I feel much of these could have been avoided had I been given the correct guidance and Top Notch did their job of securing the tent properly (as well as supplying working heaters). Being unfamiliar with event planning in general and the previous events held at Vulcan, I feel that Top Notch should have provided any additional information to clients to make sure the event would run as smoothly as possible. In addition, I would like to point out I have exhausted every action I could prior to posting this review. I always try to work out differences in a private setting as opposed to in a public forum. Unfortunately, Top Notch was not interested in working things out and felt they were completely absolved from any blame.

I called 6 times trying to get the salesperson to give me an ETA. This proved to be around 4pm. The event started at 5pm. They sent one guy with part of my order. Because there was only 1 guy- my children unloaded and set up the tables with the table cloths- 18 to be exact! This guy only had the railing for the 2 tents. About 30 minutes later- another guy showed up with a helper. They had to find a faucet to load the water barrels to hold the tents down....After all of this... they had NONE of my CHAIRS! After a call to the salesperson- she had the audacity to say- \"You didn't order chairs\"!!!!!!!!! Thank goodness one of the catering people knew the Vice Principal of this school. Between my children, the lady and my husband- we took our own vehicle to pick up over 100 chairs and set them up ourselves.

I spent an incredible amount of time planning each of the tiniest details for our wedding and sacrificed a lot of extras to make it happen financially.\n\nWhen I arrived to the venue the day of the wedding, I realized that Pre Events had delivered the wrong tables. I spent the first thirty minutes of my time there crying because I had spent so much time planning every detail and these tables looked absolutely nothing like the ones I had ordered. Unfortunately despite the efforts of my MOH and wedding planner, there was no time to have the tables swapped out. It was a hard pill to swallow but I married the man of my dreams that day and tried to let it go with promises that the company would do something to make it up to us.\n\nI have never been talked to the way I was talked to by the VP of this company, Mike. He said the mix up was our fault. BRIDES BEWARE. When you go to their landing page for tables, there are no names. You will only find the item name and detail if you click on each individual photo. Mike said the miscommunication happened when I chose the \u201cfarm table\u201d available in the Auburn location but their sales rep in Birmingham thought I wanted the \u201cfarm table\u201d in the Birmingham location. With Auburn being only a drive away, and also not even knowing about the other \u201cfarm table\u201d I just assumed that the delivery fees included getting me the tables from Auburn.\n\nNot once did their sales rep mention that they had two tables by the same name. Not once did she try to clarify. And to have my wedding day tarnished, TO BE TOLD THAT IT WAS MY FAULT, was completely disappointing to say the least.\n\nWe spent around $6000 total with this company. And if I could do it all again I would\u2019ve given every cent to a company that cares about its customers.\n\nTrying to let go of the fact that a big business wins again and this will never be made right.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891ec16cf24d91:0x44584351917a1f47"}

The pick-up/drop-off process was easy. They are all super friendly. The inflatables were in good conditions and very easy to set up (less easy to expertly fold back up into the minivan, but we knew what we were getting into ;) ). My kids love having them for the whole weekend and the price was perfect and as advertised with no hidden fees at checkout. I absolutely recommend them!\n-------\nWe were beyond satisfied with their service. We rented a bounce house for our kids' birthdays over a weekend to make up for their big party being cancelled. The kids were thrilled!!! Their service was excellent. Their staff is very friendly and helpful. The inflatable was clean and high quality. While shopping around for rentals, we found a lot of companies to have hidden fees that show up at checkout (set up and delivery, mostly) which doubled the cost in many cases. Here you will need two able bodied adults on your end to set up and break down for transportation back, but that is clear from their website and you save a lot of money. We will definitely be using them in the future for any future parties!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1592927224969, "text": "Thank you. Mrs.Corder-Grier for the five star review.
