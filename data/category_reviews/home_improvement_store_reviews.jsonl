The store looks great and it's great to have a good hardware store so close. Also, the personnel were knowledgeable which usually is why I prefer stores like this over Big box retailers.\n\nSo I've had a day to consider my experience at this store. I was excited to have a reason to go to the new Ace store not too far from me. It didn't go well. And for perspective, I almost never strongly complain. But, to start, I'm exceptionally busy and need a place that is easy for transactions and returns. So, being busy, I went to the shed and found out I didn't have the key for the pad lock. I ran to Ace and picked up a small bolt cutter. Coming home, I tried twice on the lock and realized it was too small.\n\nReturning to the store, I tried to return the item within 30 minutes of purchase (with receipt) to buy a large Bolt cutter. This is when I found out about the 'no return' for used items policy. OK, I can accept that. I won't be able to shop there. But I accept that. The problem? From my perspective, the owner was rude. 'No, we won't take that back. It's used' he said. IMO, 'I'm sorry, we're an independent franchise and we can't afford to take back used items' would have been a much better response.\n\nOne other story. Last year, I bought a push mower at Lowes. I tried it and it wasn't sufficient. I took it back and got a more powerful mower. They took it back no questions asked. Had I bought it at this Ace? Nope, no returns on used items. I could be wrong but I also assume you can't  bring back defectives items (it's under warranty so deal with the manufacturer?) I could be wrong there. But again, with all that's on my plate, I need easy returns. With all that said, I wish this store well. We need you here.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626731237dbdcf:0x8034c16da2ee5c73"}

They were the only one of the five companies that realized there was not a stud behind the tile where the door was to be installed and actually recommended a solution that ended up saving us money (though they also made sure I knew they were capable of going with the more expensive solution if we decided to go that route).\n\nUsing the information that they provided, I was able to go back and get a slightly cheaper quote from one of the other companies. Despite that, I went with Madison Glass because I felt I could trust Wade and Kevin to do the job right. I'm glad I did.\n\nWe had a small hiccup with the manufacturer on the first replacement window and shower door that came in, but Wade and Kevin set us up for the mean time and made sure to prioritize getting back out as soon as the replacement glass came in.\n\nThe shower looks great, the service was excellent, they let us know what to expect and then kept us informed throughout the process, and we ended up spending less than what we expected.

I would NEVER refer them to anyone nor EVER use them again.  They are the absolute worst in customer service.  The salesperson is the face of the company and that\u2019s about as good as it gets.   It is difficult to contact them by phone and when you do no one is ever around who has any answers.  The receptionist or answering service must always get back to you, and usually never the same day.  I don\u2019t know the criteria for Window World being ranked as the #1 replacement company in America, but it can\u2019t be based on any contributions from Window World of Dothan, AL, at least not for doors and shutters.\n\nWe contracted with Window World of Dothan, AL on 1 Oct 2019 for 10 sets of outdoor shutters and a front door.  The install should have only taken a day. The install began on 16 Nov in the late afternoon and still has not been completed as of today, 9 Jan 2020.  The individual sent to install the shutters and door obviously didn\u2019t care about the job because the quality of the installs were substandard.  We tried to give him space and let him do his job, but that was a mistake because when we looked closer at the tall shutters they were installed with only 4 pegs instead of 6 (industry standard) and did not place the pegs uniformly (symmetrically) into the mortar, some directly into the brick.  When asked if 4 pegs was a Window World standard, he said it didn't matter.  We also asked if he filled the old holes and he stated \"some\",  which we knew meant \"none\". His defense was to say there were lots of holes in our house.\n\nThe installer completed the haphazard shutter install and departed because it started to drizzle and he didn't want the caulking to get wet. He was supposed to return the next day (Friday) to install the door.  He sent a text on Friday to say he was still on a job in GA and wouldn't arrive until the afternoon. We responded that we didn't like afternoon appointments because he would be rushing the door install the same way he rushed the shutter install and make more mistakes.  He agreed to return the following day in the morning.  Meanwhile, my wife attempted to call Window World, Dothan several times to ask about the standards for shutter installation but no one ever called her back.\n\nAs he was installing the door on Saturday, we let him know the door was not square in the frame.  His ongoing response was to tell us that our house was the reason the door wasn't straight. Once the install was complete we continued to let him know we were not satisfied with the way the door looked in the frame.  As he prepared to install the storm door, he realized the frame had to be shimmed and stated he would return on Sunday to finish the job.  When he returned at 9am we told him that the thresh hold needed to be adjusted more because we could see car lights under the door and feel the cold air. He appeared a little agitated. He became more agitated when my wife asked \"hypothetically\" what would happen if we wanted to discuss the possibility of getting another door. He then said he could fix the door.  My wife asked him if that was the case why he hadn't fixed it in the first place.  He proceeded to tell my wife that she complained about the shutters and every little thing about the door. He then stopped what he was doing and left the storm door uninstalled.  He told her that day was his last day at Window World so he didn't care if we complained.\n\nMy wife called Window World the following Monday  and asked to speak to the owner.  Instead of being contacted by the owner, the salesman was sent for damage control.  He stated he would have the shutters reordered and expedited.  Another installer was sent to correct the door install.  He made some additional adjustments that helped but was still not the quality of install we expected.  It is currently 9 Jan 2020 and we have not heard from Window World about the shutters or the fact that we are extremely DISSATISFIED customers.  Their lack of care, concern, and communication speaks volumes about the organization.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1578694241397, "text": "Mr. Gatlin, we appreciate the time spent sharing this information with us.

My 1st initial delivery date changed three time before it was actually attempted to be delivered on March 3rd. On March 3rd the shipment came on a long bed truck with a pallet dolly. My shipment is a pallet of 33 boxes of porcelain tile., plus 7 additional boxes they put on the same pallet. The right side of the pallet was coming apart due to the immense weight of the tile . The driver could not move the pallet down the truck. He was not going to be able to pull it up the small slope on my driveway. What on earth were they even thinking?They needed a fork lift. I called Home Depot and they got the Transport company on the line while I was on hold. I ended up being told the transport company needed to take care of this and they would contact me in 24 to 48 hours. Which they never did. I had to call them. On 3/5 Friday I called central transport and they told me the shipment would be delivered on Monday between 11 and 12. They never showed. I checked the shipment tracking and found that they changed it to Tuesday 3/9! I got no call, text, or phone call.So Tuesday 3/9 I message them to find out eta. They said the drivers hadn't left yet and to keep checking they will update me. That never happened. So I wait and wait and I get a call from Home Depot letting me know the tile has arrived at THE STORE. I was never told anything about this.They will be delivering the tile on Monday 3/15....", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb240162a2a6b:0xb64868f9b73224ba"}

They were more of a delivery company, not an installation professional. They could not install my gas range. They damaged my microwave. So, really, they weren't even a good delivery company. Home Depot just subs out delivery to the cheapest company....and you can see the quality when your damaged items arrive!\nAnd I pray for you if you have ANY problems with your delivery or installation!!!\nCount on a couple of things: 1) You will spend hours on the phone getting to talk to the right person. Once you think that you have the right person, they will tell you they have to check on something and they will have to call you back. OR, the right person is \"on lunch\" and they will call you back. After giving them ample time for \"lunch\" (3 hours) when you call them back, you will be told that they were \"off today\" but they will return your call in the morning.\nBasically, it's a game of ping-pong and it takes days to get simple questions answered because, obviously, no one who works there wants to actually do anything.\nI can't believe I dropped over $7K in there and they can't even answer a simple question!!!!\nBuyer beware!!!

Don\u2019t waste your time checking out up front, if you\u2019re preparing for a project, go through the pro-desk area.

Most recent was a dishwasher. The man in the back who sold us the dishwasher seemed like he would rather be anywhere BUT work. Honestly, we would have walked right out if it wasn't for the fact that I had some rewards to use at Lowes. He gave no information and in fact, told me I should \"search online and compare dishwashers\" because he wasn't an expert and didn't have a say on any of them. Then we asked about delivery. He had no info - not even on the process and we explained we had a bad experience before. Instead of sticking up for or explaining to us that maybe it was a fluke, he went on to talk about the \"warehouse\" and how many complaints they get on them. Not very reassuring.

We went in to return a work desk that he had purchased yesterday, only to come home and find out that pieces are broken and missing. When we arrived at the return desk we were greeted angrily by a lady named Shelia (her tag said CSA Front Desk). She was in the process of helping another gentleman with a wheelbarrow at the time we arrived so I shrugged her attitude off as frustration to begin with. By the time she got to us she took the receipt from my husband, asked angrily what was wrong to which he informed her that the desk portion (the main part of the item) was broken down the middle and pieces were missing. She rolled her eyes, mumbled a few things, then started to walk away and as she was walking into another room yelled back at us \"you know it's a clearance item right?!\"  She then came back out of that room, struggled to get the lid off the box and then continued to tell us in a displeasing tone that our kobalt work desk was on clearance. I then stated \"so does clearance mean that pieces are broken? If so, lowes should not be selling clearance items\". She then argued with me that clearance items are usually returns with missing pieces and I restated that the main portion of the item is completely broken in half. I don't care if it's clearance or not, it was not marked down nearly enough to compensate for a complete useless, damaged piece. She then slammed a refund receipt down and asked my husband to sign. She never asked if we wanted to swap it with a usable piece. She never asked anything, actually. During this entire transaction she was rude and everything anyone in customer service should not be. She was also complaining and cussing under her breath about no one answering the phone around there during our entire few minutes with her. When we were leaving there were 2 more men waiting patiently behind us and just staring in disbelief at what they witnessed and would unfortunately encounter. I told one man good luck as we walked off and he said it looked like he needed it. Needless to say, if lowes in fultondale is going to hire individuals of her caliber, we will not step foot back in that store and may in fact just take our business to Home Depot.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889048d83ba7ea7:0x35de940e38e1b1d2"}

Two days before we were supposed to get the cabinets in we received an email from the man we was working with stating that he was sorry, the order was incorrect and said he was leaving that he couldn't help us any longer. Well 3 cabinets were missing, and was measured incorrectly...... AGAIN. Don is the assistant manager over there and is terrible. We met with him and got another person to come measure... again and said we had to wait another 30days before it could be here and another 1-2weeks to install. Well the installer said when they got here he couldn't finish the trim because something was not finished. Don has told us from the start that we would sit down and discuss what needs to be done to make this right. I have called lowes 20 times and got Don at least 10 and said he would call me back.

I had the DISpleasure with an associate there today named Christina. I am still recovering/reconstructing my home after hurricane sally. I had bought a gallon of paint back in January that had leaked from the bottom all over my garage floor. I am just getting around to returning to the store to exchange it. Christina not only told me the associate selling me the paint in January sold me the wrong kind but then proceeded to argue with me and not give credit on the exchange. I\u2019m told leaking cans happen (of which the other associate offered) but this apparently very unhappy (never smiled, devoid of social skills) person, Christina, would not credit a longtime customer for a faulty can of paint.
