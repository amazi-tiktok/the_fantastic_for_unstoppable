My family visited there almost 4 years ago and we have been coming back ever since. Walking around their grounds you can tangibly feel the presence of Our Lady & Her spouse the Holy Spirit. Getting to see the witness of the community members over the past 4 years has deepened my faith, has led to a deeper conversion within my family, and has led to a personal indescribable love for Jesus, His Mother Mary, and His Church. The thing that really stood out to me was the love that the community members showed each other and showed my family. I have a fairly rambunctious group of kiddos and their energy only brought loving smiles. Smiles during the Rosary, during the Chaplet of Divine Mercy, and all of their interactions with them. They are a beautiful community focused on introducing the world to Our Lady of Medjugorje to bring as many souls to Jesus as they possibly can.\n\nIf you get a chance to visit, take the time to:  1) Pray the Rosary in the Field of Apparitions where Our Lady of Medjugorje has appeared prior to apparition time (rosary starts at 11:00am in the summer // 10:00am in the spring/fall). 2) Pray the Stations of the Cross on a hike to the Cross on top of Penitentiary Mountain. 3) Hike the mountain across the valley from the Cross to the Grotto La Pluie. 4) Pray the Chaplet of Divine Mercy at 3:00pm.\n\nLastly, satan hates this place because of the community's love of Our Lady & their work of bringing more people to Jesus through His Mother.  People's negative reactions to this beautiful community can only be explained through that perspective.\n\nJohn 15:18-21: 18 \u201cIf the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you.[a]  19 If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.  20 Remember the word that I said to you, \u2018A servant[b] is not greater than his master.\u2019 If they persecuted me, they will persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also.  21 But all this they will do to you on my account, because they do not know him who sent me\".\n\nMatthew 7:16-18: 16 \"You will know them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles? 17 So, every sound tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears evil fruit.  18 A sound tree cannot bear evil fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit\".\n\nThrough Mary to Jesus,\nMike", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88896acde5666be3:0x963bf93c3a056567"}
