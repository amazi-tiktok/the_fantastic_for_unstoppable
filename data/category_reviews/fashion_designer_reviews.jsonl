Well fast forward to now, all events have been canceled. She is a senior, so no need for the dress. Now I'm not a dummy, I know getting the entire deposit back is a long shot, but I figured that I would at least get half, because after all I have not purchased the dress, just made a deposit, and the dress is still at the store..right?... WRONG!  Not only am I informed of the policy of no refund and all sales being final, but I am told I can either purchase the dress, or use the store credit..that expires in 6 month!!!! I'm livid..this pandemic is beyond my control. I understand that it's a business, but how does a deposit to reserve.a dress qualify as a sale, when I do not have possession of the dress?
