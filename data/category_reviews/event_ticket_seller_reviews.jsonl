I was a little surprised they could never give an approximate time for when the balloons would launch, as I paid for tethered rides. I suppose it is by design as by not telling anyone, they force you to be there all day waiting and spending money.\n\nFast forward to the weekend of the event in November. I check the FB page the morning of to see if there are any updates, and sure enough, the event was moved out into mid-December! Never mind that no notice was given. I called and was told everyone was sent an email, but I never saw it and could not find any record of having received it.\n\nOk, fine. We wait for December. We fast forward again to last weekend.

No thank you.\n\nAgain no notice of the event location having been moved. I am annoyed that I threw my money away on this. Since they clearly state no refunds for any reason, this was a total loss.\n\nIf I were the suspicious sort, I might imagine they had poor event management issues and by not offering refunds, actually made more money off of the folks that don't want to add another 45-50 minutes to the round trip.\n\nI am sure those that accepted all the event changes and made the trip no doubt had a wonderful time.
