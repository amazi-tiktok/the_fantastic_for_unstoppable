Socialized with friends for a while and saw two missed calls a few minutes later at 6:53. No voicemails but I figured it had to be Domino\u2019s so I called back. Waited for 10 minutes and no one picked up. App said pizza was being delivered. Called back at 7:26 to see where food was. Finally got someone on the phone. The gentleman said he tried calling twice to tell me there were no delivery drivers available. But he could\u2019ve left a voicemail for that! Why did I have to try and call him back for that information? At this point we\u2019re all hungry and now the guests are upset.\n\nSo a few things here:\n1. The app shouldn\u2019t show my food is being delivered when it hasn\u2019t even been made.\n2. I shouldn\u2019t have been able to order delivery if the location doesn\u2019t offer it.\n3. The employee should have left a voicemail with the information and not wasted my time trying to call back for it.\n\nSo be careful using this location. The communication is very poor. Call ahead of time to see if they can deliver. Don\u2019t use the app.\n\nEDIT: Bumping up a star since the manager called me to explain the situation and obviously wants to make things right. I may give this location another try since it seems I caught them in a perfect storm of \"things going wrong\", and being a former restaurant worker myself, I can sympathize.\n\nMy order was flagged for review since it was associated to an address that has been linked to multiple phone numbers. This is a national Domino's corporate policy to keep tabs on potential sketchy orders.\n\nDomino's corporate always expects their franchisees to have delivery drivers, and never anticipates a scenario where a given store has no delivery drivers show up for work. So don't expect the app design to improve, and I can't fault this location for that.\n\nDomino's typically doesn't leave voicemails as they prefer to talk about potential order problems in person, and in my case, try to present an offer for me to pick up the pizza myself. Even so, we'll agree to disagree as the voicemail could have said \"We have no delivery drivers for tonight. Please call us back by X time if you still want the order and can arrange to have it picked up.\"", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1627330944209, "text": "Our team appreciates your review and feedback.

When I called to inquire about the charge a couple days later the store manager was EXTREMELY RUDE, and then told me he couldn\u2019t do anything and I should probably just call my bank and say it was a fraudulent charge.

I ordered a pizza last night and it was canceled due to no delivery driver. They called from a personal cell phone to tell me this instead of the Dominos\u2019 number, which resulted in me not answering since it was an Iowa number. That much was understandable since I know people are having a hard time finding workers. After I called to check on my pizza, she said I needed to place my order again online since she couldn\u2019t apply my coupon over the phone. She told me they now had a driver, and it would be delivered. I order my pizza again and the tracker says it has been delivered. 30 minutes later- still no pizza. I was left on hold for 20 minutes or so and called back several times with no answer. I love dominos, but I hate to say I won\u2019t be ordering from this store anymore.

So I call another location in Tuscaloosa and the guy that answered the phone there was so nice and told me that we were too far away but he was gonna check the other stores to see which delivery range we were in and he came back and said we were in range for delivery from this location. So I call back and was told again I was not in range, very confused at this point bc I\u2019m sure they use the same system but anyways didn\u2019t wanna argue so I just order and do pickup and when I get there I had to wait at the counter for over 5 mins just for someone to speak to me. Then in the middle of her ringing me up she proceeds to leave the counter to give another customer their order for free I might add. So I\u2019m furious at this point and I ask if the pizza comes with ranch and she says no and doesn\u2019t ask if I need any or anything so I ask her to get me 2 cups of ranch and she acted like it was a problem I needed ranch.

The pizza had no olives at all on it. I called her back and informed her that I did not order extra toppings, only substituted two of the toppings and that there were no olives on the pizza.

However, slowly the quality has declined. We order from there a lot and usually go pick up our order. They leave out sauces or extras that you order a lot. This really isn't much of an issue because I just ask them when I get there.\n\nHowever, the consistency of quality of the food hasn't been good since around June. We order bread bites a lot from there and sometimes they are drenched in oil to the point that they ooze out a lot with every bite (not good) and others it is bone dry with not even sauce to dip them in (also not good). Sometimes the bites are REALLY undercooked and sometimes they are just right. I understand it is different employees making the pizza, but sometimes the stuff is good and other times I don't even eat it because it is inedible. Ordering now is a 50/50 gamble on whether I will actually be eating what they give me. The pizza is often the same (undercooked or just right).\n\nAlso one time they gave us a cheesy bread instead of bread bites and then when we called about it they basically called us liars. We just wanted what we ordered and we order from there A LOT.\n\nRecently we have cut back on ordering from there because of the consistency issues.

They were refusing to refund money to those of us that were tired of waiting. The excuse was noone in the store was allowed to refund money and we would have to wait until the next day for the manager to deal with it.

Pizza Hut, like many of the other major players seems to be doing away with their eat-in restaurants meaning you either have to carry it out or get it delivered so if that's going to be your main business you shouldn't be charging people extra for it making customers think the extra fee goes to the drivers because it doesn't.\n\nIf you're going to charge a fee for delivery then pass it along to your drivers and don't just add it to your bottom line.  I do like Pizza Hut pizzas but there are other places, in our area that I do like better.

There will be no \"next time\" BOTTOM DOLLAR ON THAT. Horrible experiences at this locations but tonight's interaction burns bridges. Granted, there was inclement weather tonight so some delay and difficulties were expected. However, from what I experienced tonight, Domino's Pizza off of Mobile Hwy would have been better closed. No matter, I ordered from the app and request delivery. I finalized the order on the app but I later received a call from the store, saying they didn't have delivery drivers (again, expected difficulties) and I need to pick up my food. What they didn't tell me is that they voided my app order, placing a hold on my debit card (upcoming 'last straw'), and I would need to bring my debit card to re-order. So, when I arrived at the store, lo and behold. They told me that I needed my card. Thus, I had to drive back through Tropical Storm Sally in a partially wrecked car, just to get my debit card. (Now, given my past dealings with this store, I should have know better but I am a naive person person at times.) I get back to the store, just to find out that because of the order I made on the app, Domino's Pizza tried to charge me twice for the same order. One for delivery and the other for carryout. I snapped. So what? I need to have at least 40 dollars in my bank account to order pizza. I am sorry; your tax dollars don't pay teachers enough for that. I find it really funny that Domino's Pizza can jump into your bank account so fast when you order but, refunding and correcting orders, they feint as bumbling idiots. I do not just hold the store at fault but the entire corporation. They have no regard for customer service; Domino's Pizza only cares about profits and their shareholders. I wouldn't drop or invest a dime into Domino's Pizza, with all the dried and burnt pizzas I have ordered over the years. Hell, Pizza Hut has a hotline for situations like this, but you invest your time in 'Pizza Insurance' and 'HotSpots'. How about fairly selling pizza when trying to double dip into people's bank accounts? How about optimizing your systems so errors like this can fixed quicker? Just go under, already.

Although the pizza tracker showed it at quality check phase (the last phase before delivery), I get a dead air call no one said anything. So I called back and get an answer from a rude Adrian screaming and cutting me off because I questioned him about waiting 30minutes to call me to tell me they don't deliver in my area after dark. In which I just received a delivery from them about a week or 2 at this hour ago so I guess it's a new policy, So why was I able to place an order and why was I charged and again 30MINUTES before you call knowing you have an online tracker indicating the steps of my delivery??????? Don't waste your time dealing with these people. It's a hit or miss on the quality of your service or if you'll get your food at all.

Even ordered online and it shows plain as day. And u guys never do anything about it. What am i gonna ask for, the driver to drive all the way there and back just to give me ranch? No thats crazy and its not their fault. Last time yall said i could drive and come get some. Im not doing that either, i can go get a whole bottle for the price of 2 little suffl\u00e8 cups from yall. But i dont mind paying it for the convience except i almost never get what i pay for. I never take it out on the drivers and dont even complain cause its not their fault and i understand its just ranch. Its just getting old. I pay 21 something for one pizza and 2 ranches just for me, i give the driver 30 bucks and let them keep the change cause im in the server industry. How hard is it to ask for a little bit of ranch (that i PAY for) i mean come on. I hate leaving reviews like this but i swear ive proly paid 50 bucks just in ranch that i havent gotton.

He offered to drive back to the store and get it but his voice said he really didn't want to and I didn't want to waste gas so I told him not to. I had already said how much change I wanted back but I wish I had waited until I found out he had forgotten my drink, wouldn't have given him a $4 tip had I known he forgot the drink. Also the chicken alfredo's pasta was too al dente, ended up being chewy and my fiance barely wanted to eat it after working 12 hours. Both pastas were luke warm and were straight up cold by the time we got half way through eating. Chicken bites were so tiny it was more like crumbs, won't be getting those ever again, definitely not worth $6. Was not happy with this experience, and I'm probably not going to get delivery from this location again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0e13fd30db99:0xe30e83a629ebe7aa"}

I do not recommend this Little Caesar location.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8861ef2baee35fd5:0x5e7bb302810cdd25"}
