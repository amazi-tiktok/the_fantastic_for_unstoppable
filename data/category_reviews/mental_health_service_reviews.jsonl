He takes chiropractor care to levels no one has ever heard of in this town. Let's be real for a moment, almost every who's had pain at some point in their life has gone to a chiropractor for help. The standard way of thinking is that if you could just get that elbow to pop back or to have a hip or shoulder reset then all your pain would go away. But it never works, you might find some mild relief but it's usually short lived by a couple of hours to maybe days and then you wake up and say, you slept wrong and it's out again.\n\nWell the team at Invision chiropractic care will teach you how to do address the underlying problems so you can fix it yourself in the long run. Yes you will get adjusted, yes it will probably hurt (Dr. Aplin has a different approach to adjusting that I've ever seen) but I'm a walking, breathing, significantly less pain and overall stress less person than when I walked into his office 4 months ago.\n\nI'll be honest, I have a long history of surgeries to pains and only walked in to this office cause I didn't want to have another surgery and my dear friend suggested Dr. Aplin. I went when I truly didn't believe he was helping. I went when the pain spread to a neighboring body part. I went even though my TOC doc said I needed surgery to fix my problem. 4 months and I never missed an appointment. I can say today that I don't need surgery, my pain is gone and the results of becoming less stressed and worry free was worth more to me than the pain getting better.\n\nBrainTap. Google it. Dr. Aplin introduced me to it and has changed my life because of it. I feel like I have the answer to a life long question that I know so many of us ask \"How do I feel better?\" yes that's generic but let's be honest, everyone is stressing about something these days. But after 4 months of using the BrainTap and doing my homework from Dr. Aplin, I do feel better, lighter able to take on what the world throws at me. It just works!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1581024097197, "text": "Lorren - you're a ROCKSTAR!

I have a phone appointment almost every month with Dr Dryer and am overall unsatisfied with my care. She strictly goes by a symptom check list to just prescribe, and guess,  what is going on with me, there is no personal relationship. Every time I talk to her it's as if I have never been treated by her before. This leads to many problems such as her being adamant to prescribe medications for me even if I have taken them unsuccessfully in the past. I understand she is most likely burnt out so I feel for her. But this is my livelihood I'm talking about here. I need someone who will investigate further into my mental illness in order to get an accurate diagnosis and have an effective treatment plan. Our phone conversations are rushed and can sometimes be over in less than 5 mins. I find this very unprofessional and personally disrespectful.\n\nI also spent a few weeks in their Residential Crisis Unit on Beth manor Drive. When I say it was literal hell, I mean it. The techs were very unproffesional and I'm pretty sure one of them brought a gun into the unit. At the time I was very likely to outbursts because I was in crisis but they never liked giving me emergency medication causing my Chao to ice crises to become worse leading to an even greater outburst. I felt out of control and they were incapable of doing their jobs to help comfort me. They would often talk about murder and how they know how to get away with it of they had to. I had the feeling that most of the staff were in some type of gang and it's very possible they were criminals. I'm saying this based on exposure to their words and actions.  Thecook, David(worst of them all) is a literal sociopath. Cold, cool, and cunning yet extremely vile and subtly manipulative. On his left hand he has his flesh carved down some ways down his fingers and his bones poke out in sharpened tips, I'm certain he uses it as a weapon. It was the most disgusting body mutilation I have ever come across. I am also positive that he was putting toilet water in our food and we were served some kind of mystery meat routinely, always looked different. But I didn't know what it was, they said it was chicken but was clearly not. I think it was roadkill or most likely human flesh. They were,after all, a part of a demonic cult of cannibals that prey on the weak and vulnerable. David once threatened to kill me! How could you do that to someone with a debilitating mental illness, in crisis, trying to get help? ,They need to close this place down. Plain and simple.\nThe standing psychiatrist here is horrible as well. She quickly gets defensive and is unusually aggressive. Its like she is mad at us patients for no particular reason.\nThe facility is unbelievably small and cramp. This led to an extreme feeling of claustrophobia I experienced the entire time I was there. The place was also very dirty. The walls were caked in God knows what and one window was covered in shot or spit and they never even acknowledged it! To them we were the vulnerable people that were less than them and therefore they treated us inhumanely. I felt like a piece of trash.\n\nMy post sounds crazy and that's because it is. But very real. I really want this place shut down after my experience there.  Which by the way, resulted in me escaping out of a window. I was literally convinced they were going to take me to a remote location where they would tie me down and slowly carve out my flesh to feed off of. But they would have kept me alive for a very long time, occasionally feeding me my own flesh while they slowly tortured me. I have PTSD from this place fr fr..\nI refused to go back to Beth Manor so they took me to another crisis center.  I get it I'm crazy. But there are dark forces in this world that mostly go unnoticed by the common man. I happened to experience some of the darkest most evil place in the world for some reason.

This place is enough to drive someone who has no mental health issues insane!\n\nMy husband was released from Crossbridge 3 months ago & just now had his first physician appointment. When released from Crossbridge he was released under this offices care & was told to follow his mental health regimen to get better. His first doctors appointment no one called him & when he called to find out what happened he was told that the doctor called out for the day & they forgot to call & tell the patients so they set his appointment out another month. The next appointment he didn\u2019t realize his phone was on silent, called the clinic right back to let them know & instead of letting him speak to a doctor that day they set it off another month. His appointment today the doctor (Dr. Dryer) tells him she can\u2019t change any of his medications because his anxiety medication isn\u2019t working neither is his depression medication. He also asked to get his craving medications for alcohol refilled & she told him she couldn\u2019t do it because she didn\u2019t know what medication it was that he was on. This place is absolutely insane! He calls back to the office to let them know the medication stays on hold for 30 minutes for the receptionist to answer & transfer him to a voicemail that has a full mailbox and he couldn\u2019t even leave a message!! This place should be shut down! They do no good in helping people with mental health issues but further hindering them. My husband has relapsed several times since being released from Crossbridge & cries out for help so much but can\u2019t seem to get any. Absolutely DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE WHATSOEVER!

I can truly say, it saved my life, taught me so many life skills and helped mend a very broken family. I have read the reviews that some have left bashing this program. I am honestly in shock that some people would make up so many lies. Not only was I a resident there, I worked there several years ago after I received my college degree. Take it from me, someone who has seen both sides of this program, it WORKS. And the staff truly and genuinely care. That is really rare and hard to find these days. I\u2019ve seen staff put in so much work and so many hours just for the benefit of the children. Elk river is not a luxury resort. But let\u2019s be honest, troubled teenagers and children don\u2019t need a luxury resort. They need a place that will teach them structure, discipline, accountability, hard work, and then and only then will they see the positive and rewarding outcome. If you want a place to teach them these things and want them to get better and act responsibly, this is the place. If you want your child to be pampered and go off learn nothing and get nothing out of it, keep them at home with you or send them somewhere else. I\u2019ve read some reviews that say that their child was starved, I just had to laugh. That is bogus. I gained 30 pounds when I was there because of how much I ate. And I NEEDED to gain that weight. If some people need to lose weight, then the program and staff will cater to that as well. Each resident there has their own treatment plan, a lot of thought and time goes into developing and determining the best plan for each child. I can say this and know that it\u2019s true because once again, I was a resident there and later on an employee. The best part about the treatment plan is that the parents are extremely involved. Parents don\u2019t get to call ALL the shots, because obviously that doesn\u2019t work. But they do have their own input for their child. I can\u2019t say enough wonderful things about this place. I am writing this because I know how much it helped me. I have nothing to gain from writing this, I no longer work there. I just felt the need to share after reading some of these reviews that are just completely untrue and made up. As a parent myself, if my child was expressing negative behavior and needed a place to go for help, there is no doubt that I would 100% send him to Elk River. It is 2021, kids are smart. Kids are manipulative and unfortunately sometimes lie to their parents so that they can come home from treatment. And after reading some of these reviews, there is no doubt in my mind that this has taken place with some of the parents and children who have chosen to bash this place online. It\u2019s bogus. Elk River staff, I love you guys and appreciate all of your hard work! I love the program and most importantly I believe in the program with everything in me. I will be forever grateful for this place. If I hadn\u2019t gone and gotten help, I wouldn\u2019t be the successful and happy adult that I am today. So, thank you.

This program did nothing for my mental health or drug addiction problems. There was little to no actual therapy other than occasional group sessions, and residents rarely received one on one therapy with counselors. However, that is not the reason for my low rating. While nothing about my time there was tolerable or helpful, my major problem with this facility is the way residents were treated there. We were not allowed to speak to anyone, including the staff, without nonverbally asking for permission, and if we were given permission, it had to be \"treatment related\". We were not allowed to converse with other residents or get to know them personally. While I was there, mushrooms and mold grew in the showers. The \"domes\" we slept in had several holes and were placed on top of a rotting wooden platform that I watched an employee fall through, and we slept there even when there was dangerous weather. At one point, the water we drank and bathed with was brown. Even though we spent most of our time inside, we were only given sunscreen two times that I can recall, regardless of the fact that it was the middle of summer.  If the staff decided the rules were not being sufficiently followed, there was use of solitary confinement (which they called separation). The only form of communication we had with the outside world was through letters to our parents, but they were censored, and they frequently refused to send letters they didn't agree with. My last complaint is that I personally watched employees cause intentional physical harm to patients, and even heard them brag about it. The people in charge of the facility knew about these incidents and did absolutely nothing to stop them from happening again. I could go into much more detail, but this experience is one I would prefer to just not think about.

Due to our respect for your privacy, we will not discuss a client\u2019s mental health in a public arena. However, our Clinical Director invites you to call at 866-906-8336 for an opportunity to discuss your concerns. We are always surprised when a negative review appears from a client who worked hard to graduate the program, seemed to be doing very well, and even submits a satisfaction survey at discharge ranking the services at Elk River Treatment Program as good or great in every category. We have examples from clients who state that they would recommend the program and claim \u201cthis program saved my life,\u201d then years later appear extremely disgruntled in a public forum.\n\nDuring the course of our program, we often discuss the importance of accountability, integrity, and responsibility. In keeping with the philosophy that we teach and role model, we want to clarify some of your comments. Regarding the website: we work diligently to keep our website up-to-date but sometimes things get overlooked. Upon review of your comments, we checked and the website is current. We agree that we have excellent staff - some have moved on to advance their careers elsewhere and others have continued the mission of Elk River Treatment Program to provide for our clients an environment of respect, acceptance, skill development, and challenge.\n\nAs for clothing, we can only assume you are ridiculing clothing items purchased at Walmart. We disagree with your opinion. We do not issue an abundance of clothing and gear. Clients are responsible for caring for their clothing including the laundry of it. This can present a challenge for someone who hasn\u2019t had those responsibilities in the past. The sleeping gear is certified to accommodate weather below 30 degrees although it rarely gets that cold in Alabama. We have an inclement weather shelter that is provided should the temperature drop too low, get too high or if storms are predicted.\n\nAs many clients attend treatment due to unsafe behaviors that place them or someone else in harm\u2019s way, we are very serious about safety, which includes monitoring supervision. We also want structured communication to take place where a positive peer culture model can be implemented that teaches active listening and conflict resolution in a safe space. This accountability for yourself and holding others accountable in the positive peer culture is one of the most challenging skills that residents learn. If a resident is issued \u201crain boots,\u201d it means that they were at risk for running away, and as a safety precaution the boots help deter someone from running, as it is more difficult to run in rain boots as compared to hiking boots. Similarly, if a resident is at risk for running away or harming themselves, they do have to stand next to staff within arm\u2019s length. We hope that you will consider contacting us to discuss your grievances. We take all reviews seriously."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626caeb6cf22e5:0xb2de456bea1e1b61"}

I got in trouble for passing notes and talking in the tipi, and I was sent to \"level 3\" which consisted of never going inside in the middle of winter, and they put my food in the FRIDGE before they fed it to me (again- it was FREEZING outside). One of my meals was just a hot dog- not even a bun- and some other side dish. I was also made to sleep outside the tipi IN THE RAIN. Prisoners get treated better. I needed mental help, yet we only had one group therapy session a week, and there was barely any time to talk. I'm surprised nobody has sued them yet. This is not helpful. at all. don't send your kid here. I came out more depressed and anxious than I went in, and all my family problems just got worse. I can only hope this review saves one child from having to endure this boot camp disguised as treatment. If my own parents tried to punish me the way these people did, they'd be in jail. it's ridiculous. A lot of people don't believe the kids that come out of there when we say how horrible it is, but I am drug free and happy now- no thanks to them. Also, don't be fooled by the pictures! You only get to use the horse therapy a few times during courseweek (at the very end), and they never once let us rock climb. There wasn't much wholesome activity going on- just a lot of chopping wood so the nightstaff had a nice fire to sit by while we were freezing in the tipi...", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1610484409087, "text": "If a negative comment is disclosed about our residential treatment program, our first action is to retrieve the client's file and verify the admission/participation at Elk River Treatment Program.

Additionally, there are unscrupulous individuals who profit from writing negative reviews so verifying the legitimacy of a review is important to us. We take all comments very seriously. If you were indeed a client at Elk River Treatment Program, you would have completed a survey after discharge that would give us an opportunity to address any negative experience that you had while placed in the care of Elk River Treatment Program. There are several post-discharge reviews with parents/guardians/probation officers. It is impossible to address the accusations that you made in this review without knowing your identity or when you were a patient in the program.

Doctor Crystal was extremely forgetful, phone staff was rude and almost never returned my calls. Doctor Crystal made excuses for rude staff, they're hard to get ahold of because they won't answer the phone, had issues trying to refill prescriptions. They couldn't find my consent form to release medical records so they said they'd fax a new form for me to sign and they never did. Waited 45 minutes for an appointment with Dr. Bennett before they told me someone should have told me I was supposed to be in a different waiting room. Had testing set up with Dr. Bennet's office and they cancelled the day before. Found out they lied about why it was cancelled. Told me they accepted Medicaid and had no copay but after two appointments they called and told me I needed a referral from my primary care Doctor in order for Medicaid to pay which they NEVER mentioned before and said I owe over $200. Felt like doctor Crystal didn't listen and overall felt like they didn't care whatsoever.

However, two huge issues. 1.) she seemed to be working on an almost assembly line sort of protocol and took a very short time to listen to my concerns and prescribed medications that gave me multiple concerns due to potential side effects I wanted to avoid 2.) the lady with whom they scheduled my appointment also did not have her insurance credentials in order so I ended up paying 155.00 out of pocket. I have excellent insurance and I would have had zero copay if she could\u2019ve accepted my insurance. I paid because they assured me that by the time my follow up appointment was scheduled they would have the situation remedied. I called before I went to the next appointment and was advised she still didn\u2019t have credentials for united healthcare so the visit would cost 90.0. I canceled the appointment and will have to find another doctor. This has also left me dealing with the side effects of those medications without any support in handling that. All around, I do not advise going here. The building is not handicap accessible which makes it more difficult for me as I don\u2019t do that well with stairs sometimes, they don\u2019t seem to have their business in order, they don\u2019t seem to take the time to truly understand your issue and act appropriately, and I was left with a strong impression that they simply didn\u2019t care much. If anything they should have said come into your appointment and we will not charge you and will handle the insurance after the fact. I do not understand why they think it is acceptable to force a patient to pay their outrageous prices for twenty minutes of their time when it\u2019s their fault they\u2019re not getting paid through insurance. Perhaps they have resolved the issue, perhaps not, but definitely call and question absolutely everything they tell you because they seemed to have no problem surprising me not only once with a bill I shoudn\u2019t have had to pay, but they didn\u2019t even call me before the follow up to advise me I would again be required to pay out of pocket.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4c55c7ed58f3:0x2409d699885e9955"}

I was experiencing PTSD and extreme distress during my service and was admitted to this hospital\u2019s behavioral health unit twice within a year. Here\u2019s my story:\n\nThe first time I was admitted, it was voluntary...\nI was going through a lot on base, where I lived. My chain of command in the military allowed me to admit myself for a short period of time. They wanted me to get myself together and have me go back to continuing my service.\n\nThe neglect for patients here was disgusting to say the least. The staff allowed my chain of command to enter the unit without my password. They were the last people I wanted to see. I was sure that this was illegal and requested to speak to a supervisor, who told me it was my mistake for not turning them away. Being a soldier, I knew she did not understand that I could not do that and she clearly did not care about the law that her staff was breaking. This was not the only kind of neglect I witnessed/experienced. The geriatrics room was so sad. The older patients are sat down in chairs all day and night, in front of a tv. One of the older men was taken into a private room with a female tech. When they came out, he had a bloody mark on his forehead. Some of us patients noticed but felt that nobody would do anything about it. Another older gentleman in the geriatrics room died while I was there. Nobody knew the cause but he was wrapped up in a sheet and placed into a giant gray bin and wheeled away in front of all of the other patients!\n\nDuring this first stay at this hospital, there was a day where a group of student nurses were visiting to observe the staff and patients. They were observing a therapy group where the therapist was breaking HIPAA laws and verbally exposing each patient\u2019s diagnosis in front of all of the other patients, as well as the student nurses.\n\nThe second time I was admitted, I was court ordered. My command knew I was in distress and did not know what to do with me. I was sent to this hospital a second time and knew that it would not be a long stay. I was met by two giant men, telling me I have been court ordered to the psychiatric unit. I knew that something wasn\u2019t right and that the court order was not justified. This time, they admitted me to the third-floor. There were beds available on the second floor but had decided that I would be better off on the third floor. Anyone who has been to this unit, knows that the third floor is for patients with severe mental health issues... this time, there was a poster on the wall with all of the patient rights (that wasn\u2019t there before)... I read all of my rates and noticed that it said that I could request a patient advocate and a lawyer. When I approached the glass window at the desk, I requested Mary Anne, A wonderful recreational therapist that I remembered from my first stay- as well as a lawyer!... I was met with a nasty attitude and told to sit down because I was court ordered. At this point, I was panicking and angry so I threw a fit in order to get the attention of whoever was above this woman telling me to take a seat. When I got the supervisors attention, I requested that lawyer and therapist. The lawyer asked me if I had been \u201cBaker Acted\u201d but I had no idea what that meant. He pulled up my information on a computer and informed me that I had not been \u201cbaker acted\u201d and could leave anytime I wanted. I was out of there within a few hours!\n\nWhat a horrifying experience this was. The neglect and abuse here is disgusting and I would never EVER recommend anyone admit themselves to this hospital!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88928d9733f9a99d:0xdd43af3d45a5a602"}

Perhaps my previous doctors were influenced by the labels and words used to describe some of my symptoms which caused them to think I didnt need this form of treatment.. I dont know but there are medicines that will help you that you may never have heard of like me.\n\nIt actually makes my brain WORK the right way Versus just numbing it, and covering over the problem .\n\nI am now in a position that I am safely tapering off the medication that I dont truly need to be on(faster than I thought I could) and put that \"mistake\" in the past and I am focused on my life and my future for the first time in years.\n\nNever give up hope! Dont settle for bad help or mediocre treatment that just helps you \"get by\" each day as long as you have your \"meds\"\n\nIf you not thriving or on a path too it dont settle like I did for way too long.\n\nDont assume you know the only things that will work for you and be TOTALLY honest with the Dr so he can help you .\n\nIm even getting back into old hobbies and my next new career goals and even back into My Faith in God.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling please take this as a message of hope that its never too late and never hopeless.\n\nGod Bless and Thank you to Dr. Islam and Thanks to President Trump or whoever in the Government made this Tele-Medicine / new video conferencing option available.
