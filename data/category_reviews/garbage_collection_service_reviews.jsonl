There's a reason that certain companies in this area have been around for literally 5 decades, and it was done by building a clientele through RELIABLE, FAIR PRICING slowly instead of lying to people about services / going door to door price gouging other companies until they raise the prices after those companies go out of business.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fb390038f77:0xfdf085053b546d73"}

I was called and told I would have to find somewhere else to live, and be out in 60 or so days. I was working on a seemingly impossible deadline and when I called Bin There Dump That, The woman that answered the phone was incredibly helpful, understanding and kind. She said they could have it delivered as soon as I wanted, she gave me the rates which I thought were very reasonable and said if anything changed just to give her a call and let her know. The bin was delivered on time, very clean and ready to use. The guy who delivered it was very helpful in showing me how everything worked and letting me know the details of what to do. When it came to the last day, I made a phone call and ask if there was a possibility that I could have it one extra day and they accommodated with no problems. I can\u2019t say enough about the staff. Everyone that I have dealt with that has anything to do with Bin There Dump That, has been above my expectations, very accommodating and extremely professional.

Their employees are inexperienced, clumsy, and unable to handle simple problems. If you have an issue, you will be directed to some call center down in Tampa, FL, who are absolutely incompetent as well. The Call Center can, and will only, call the local franchise owner to express your complaint. This franchise owner, never reaches out to his customers, despite the fact that my wife and I both got his cell phone number and left numerous messages.\n\nNow on to what actually happened.\n\nMy wife's parents recently moved and we needed to move her piano out of their house, so we hired College Hunks to move the piano. We expressly told them that it was to move a piano and that was the only thing that needed to be moved.\n\nThe scheduled day approaches. They said they would be there at 4:30. When 5:30 eventually rolled around, so did they. ((Strike One))\n\nThey then moved the piano out of the house and down the first step for a total of about 15 feet. Then for some inexplicable reason, could not move it any further. Not only that, but it was ONLY THEN that they realized that they had no way of getting the piano up on their truck. So they came to a job knowing that they were going to move a piano without the proper equipment and without enough people.\n\nThen comes the worst part of all. Instead of moving the Piano back inside where they originally moved it from. THEY LEFT IT OUTSIDE!\n\nThey Left the damn piano and said that they would be back tomorrow!\n\nWait, it gets better.....\n\nThe next day rolls around and again they say they will be there between 3:30 and 4:30. Well, 5:30 comes and goes and still no word from these stooges. That is when my wife and I started calling that call center and reaching out to the Franchise Owner and even the guy driving the truck.\n\nThey said they were running late and would be there at 6:30. We then asked them if they had a different truck or additional equipment. They told us what they were bringing and IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAD THE DAY BEFORE.\n\n7:00 PM comes along and still no word. We call that Call Center again, and this time they tell us that they had to reschedule and that they would be there the following day, which would have left this piano OUTSIDE for TWO Days!\n\nI finally had enough of these inept morons and called up someone who also owned a moving service. He was able to get out to the house the following morning and move the thing in less than an hour.\n\nTo sum up:\n\nThis company absolutely sucks. Incompetent Employees + Incompetent Ownership and Service. They left my wife's piano OUTSIDE for TWO Days before we finally had enough of their nonsense and hired another company.\n\nI will never use College Hunks again, nor will anyone that I know.\n\nAfter I am done with this review, I will actually be looking into filing a claim against these morons for the scratches that they also put on the piano during their re-enactment of a Monty Python Sketch.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjMMa7LkPZKbI4_q-0AA5lPjSfFBVVIL6CoI2f=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8oJEZPtCRlBvWJ52jF5l2hUQNTZ3NRB06feEh=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCW8NgNglF_OtX0HNlGIbtt_Ssdg7udlz9XPMz=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891ec334a7d1c7:0xd295fc628abd4f5c"}

The actual movers are inexperienced and I had to coach them through the process of getting the couch through a doorway.  The first day of the move they kept me waiting six hours before they got there and the second day they were four hours late.  Management is of no help, neither are the owners.  The guys who did the move were friendly, but sometimes that is not enough.  I hired this company to pack the apartment and move it downstairs in the same building, I ended up having to pack and move almost everything by myself.  The only thing the movers ended up moving where the pieces that were too large for me to do by myself.  In fact, I had to hire a random Uber driver to help move things so I can get out an hour early to make my flight which the owner and manager is new prior to the move, but did not care.  They talk a good game, but cannot walk the walk.  Be wary of all these excellent reviews, if you look on Yelp you will see true reviews.

My advice is to be sure they have cans to sell you before paying for service, and if not, ask to be contacted when they do. Otherwise you may wait months as I did. Expect a delay before service begins, and if you have any issues with your can.

Perhaps because of that my experience has not been as expected. Went through a period where the only way to get the garbage picked up was to call the office and insist. The people answering the phone are always nice to deal with but they do not seem to have the power to get the service done when the drivers fail to pick up. As an example, last week, they missed the Wednesday pick up. I figured it was because of the Veteran's Day so did not call until they failed to pick up again on Thursday. Called again on Friday. They promised a \"work order\" for Monday. Well, today is Tuesday and no pick up yet. Since tomorrow is the regular pick up, I'll again get the bin to the curb before sundown tonight. That is to be ready in case the pick up is before the normal 11AM or so. Have been reimbursed for no pickups and that is OK. But we need to have more dependable service. The normal reason for skipped pickups is that a \"new driver  missed us\". So maybe is bad training and not bad service. Works out the same from our point of view. Once the service gets OK, it stays OK for a while, maybe months. Sorry about the review but you asked during a time when my garbage has not been picked up for a week. Last period of time when this happened, had to call Better Business bureau to get it to resume. There, I've vented. Get back on reliable weekly pick up and I'll come back and give you a better review. No need to lose your contract. I am sure many people depend on you for their jobs and for disposal services.
