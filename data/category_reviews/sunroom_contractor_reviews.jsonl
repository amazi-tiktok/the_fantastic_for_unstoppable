We had called right after the sale to change the window color and spoke with the sales rep, who sold us the windows, as well as called the office to ensure the change had been made. We reinterred the change when we signed the paper for the 2nd measurement to ensure the color was corrected. When the installers showed up, one of our 4 windows was measured incorrectly and in addition the windows were not the right color. The installers remeasured (this is the 3rd measurement since sale) and stated someone would call us.  This was on a Thursday.... no call.  So we attempted to call on Monday and spoke with someone who stated they would put a note in and someone would call us back....... No Call.  So we called again on Wednesday......Same spill..... NO CALL!.... I have yet called again and was given the same speech and that they are unable to get any of the project managers on the phone, so they will send them a message to call back.  I find this to be a little ridiculous at this point.  The company has taken half of my money for the instillation and I have no idea if the windows are being remade or anything at this point.

Our instillation day was last week.   We had called right after the sale to change the window color and spoke with the sales rep, who sold us the windows, as well as called the office to ensure the change had been made. We reinterred the change when we signed the paper for the 2nd measurement to ensure the color was corrected. When the installers showed up, one of our 4 windows was measured incorrectly and in addition the windows were not the right color. The installers remeasured (this is the 3rd measurement since sale) and stated someone would call us.  This was on a Thursday.... no call.  So we attempted to call on Monday and spoke with someone who stated they would put a note in and someone would call us back....... No Call.  So we called again on Wednesday......Same spill..... NO CALL!.... I have yet called again and was given the same speech and that they are unable to get any of the project managers on the phone, so they will send them a message to call back.  I find this to be a little ridiculous at this point.  The company has taken half of my money for the instillation and I have no idea if the windows are being remade or anything at this point.  I have no answers and I am not even sure if I can get a refund at this point because you can not get anyone on the phone typically.   I personally would advise anyone looking for windows at this point to check out a different company.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1626283933658, "text": "Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

I'm incredibly disappointed. Our order was managed poorly - the left hand doesn't seem to know what the right hand is doing - and we're still waiting 6 months later for 3 doors to be installed. From this experience, it's hard to say whether I'd recommend Champion again. I like the product a lot, but I'm very disappointed with the progress of this project.\n\nWe were so pleased with Champion before, that we decided to hire them for 4 new doors around our house. January, they came and measured the doors and told us they would be installing the end of Feb or beginning of March (can't remember exactly). They show up and one of the doors is just right, one door is the *wrong* door, and the other two were not measured or manufactured properly. Ok, mistakes happen, I get it. So they tell me they'll order new doors and get back in a month. It's a busy time or something, right? They tell me the doors won't be ready until May. May rolls around, nothing. I start calling in June and nobody knows what I'm talking about, I have to tell the representative what my problem is and she tells me she'll have to contact the local office, gives me her number, and tells me to call her the following week. I call her the following week and she doesn't answer. I call the HQ and the rep has to take all my information again because my record isn't clear to her. I call the local office, nobody answers. I call HQ again, nobody answers. I finally get a call in JULY that *one* door is ready to be installed. \"One door,\" I ask, \"we are waiting for 3 doors.\" The rep is confused. All he has in his records is one door. I'm contacted by another rep the same day who says she got in contact with the local office, who weren't able to tell her whether the door had even been ordered and, again, I had to remind the rep that we had ordered 2 other doors.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1580132983886, "text": "Champion appreciates the feedback in order to improve our customer service.

After weeks of trying to understand, a third person came out to remeasure, who was very nice and said that Mark missed measured by 20 feet on each side of our house, but that he was going to have the rep \u201ceat the difference\u201d. A week later, we still could not get answers but the loan company wanted a payment because Champion already took $5000 from our loan. Mark then called back and said they would knock it down $600 bucks, but it still went up $4400. We now have had to file a dispute and complaint with the loan company against Champion. We have called every number we can to talk to someone and keep leaving messages with people at Champion with no response. They have our money, but have done no work.

Suddenly, the windows were ready to be installed.\nThe day of the installation, the company sent two workers who told me they would be finished by 1. The workers showed up an hour after we were told they would. After our old windows were removed, I overheard them talking about how our windows weren\u2019t measured correctly. When I asked what was wrong, they assured me everything was fine. Later, the workers and their boss were screaming at each other over the phone about the correct way to install the windows, the result of which was another working coming to explain the correct way to install and why the windows maybe looked too small. At 4:45, I informed the workers that I had to be somewhere at 5 pm and was already going to be late. They left, and promised to return the next morning at 8 am to finish the installation. The next day my husband stayed home from his job to be there to let them in. At 9:15 they arrived and finished the installation.\n\nThe overall quality of the windows was fine, but I have never dealt with more unprofessional people in my life.

However after a few minutes looking in the attic and walking the roof, it was determined that during construction of my home some 25 years ago, a handful of framing nails used to secure the plywood roof deck had missed the rafter below, and after all these years had begun to back out of the plywood deck, pushing up the roof shingle just enough to let water pass underneath. The roofer walked the entire roof looking for nails that were backing out (not just in the area of the water stains below, but the whole roof), removing all that he found, sealing the hole and making sure the roof shingle lay flat. Two days after the repairs we had a lot of rain, and no water leaks inside the house.\n\nOnce again, Pickett Construction has made my wife and I very happy, and I will not hesitate to call them in the future.

I can't wait till we have the funds to set Picket Construction loose on our siding and deck and bathrooms....well, you get the picture!

I had a huge wish list that far exceeded the funds I had available and had to prioritize needs, essentilas and desirables. Josh assisted me in mximizing the budget with a detailed proposal that enabled me to do this. Josh did a great job with my wife letting her see and select the tile, flooring and paint, etc.\n\nDo you want to know if Pickett is versatile or can get the job done fast? Pickett did the following items in 17 days ... 350 feet of new privacy fence and gates, paint entire house exterior, re-roof covered deck, remove turbines and patch roof areas, repair rotted roof decking around chimney stack, re-flashed and re-roofed the area, installed new LED motion detecting security lights, installed new outdoor lighting over front door,replaced all windows with new double hung, double pane vinyl windows, installed new laminate/engineered word floors on the entire main level of the house, laid tile in both foyers, kitchen and den/study, replaced every interior door and all hardware, installed new ceiling fans in each bedroom and main foyer, removed wrought iron raining in foyer and replaced with wood and balusters, primed and painted all interior trim, scraped popcorn/acoustic ceiling from kitchen, repaired drywall issues in bedrooms and kitchen, textured and painted kitchen walls.\n\nAny \"extra\" I asked about was repsonded with a written proposal so that there could be no confusion or disaggrement.\n\nTo get these things done in the time frame of 17 days ... including holidays ... shows excellent planning and execution. I was kept informed as to what was scheduled for the day, who would be there and what to expect. They arranged for the construction dumpster delivery and pick up. Pickett did a nice job on the site clean up as well.\n\nPunch list items were few and far between and resolved promptly.\n\nThe only thing that would be close to a concern or a negative was the sub-contracting tile guy who was going through a diviorce while he did the job. He did not do a bad job but his distraction resulted in a couple of small punch list things that Josh had Tripp take care of. I was assured that they would not be using this tile guy in the future.\n\nWould I recommend Pickett Construction to you? Absolutely. Want to see pics of the renovation? I have them. Will I use them again in the future? Absolutely. As a matter of fact, my daughter used them on a foreclosure she purchased in Calera.

{"user_id": "108852040032783306603", "name": "Tim Calhoun", "time": 1396761930047, "rating": 4.0, "text": "Pricing:\nWe contracted with Pickett to complete some work on our house to prepare it for sale. We were looking for some typical wood rot to be replaced and exterior paint. We also requested an interior paint quote. I think the quote was a bit high for the exterior work, but not so bad that I didn't go with their services. The quote for the interior painting was outrageous, so we opted for another painter. The other painter's quote was nearly $3000 less than the quote from Pickett. We were also having some plywood put in the ceiling of the carport, because the builder used interior drywall in our neighborhood. Pickett gave us a \"complimentary upgrade\" to beadboard instead of plain plywood. This really added a nice touch to the carport ceiling, and was an appreciated upgrade. They only requested 1/2-down to start the work, which we felt was certainly reasonable. They also honored their coupon they regularly have (often in the Alabaster Newsletter, or ValPack). We printed ours from the ValPack website.\n\nWorkmanship:\nThe quality of the exterior work was pretty good. There were a few spots where the painting got a bit \"sloppy,\" but was overall good work. The beadboard in the carport made a great upgrade to our carport, and added a touch of \"class\" to an otherwise mundane area of the house. Unfortunately, due to our unusually cold winter, the holidays, and several bouts with rain, our work was regularly delayed. It took a bit longer than expected to complete, but didn't delay our schedule of listing the house. The little interaction I had with the crew was polite and courteous, though at times the project manager came across as mildly arrogant. Communicating with the PM via email was the best medium, although he sometimes took a bit longer than expected to return messages.\n\nPost Work Follow-up:\nAgain, the delays in returning messages made for a challenge in clearing our post-work \"punch list,\" but this was also around the holidays, so we conceded a bit.  Had there been more clear communication about workday expectations (e.g. workers will/will not be onsite today) this would have made for better overall feeling about the length of the job.\nDuring our home buyer's inspection, they found more wood rot that was inadvertently overlooked by the crew. While I don't expect the painters to look over every square inch of the house (heck, neither did I!), it ended up being a significant portion of the chimney that had rotted out the edge of our masonite siding. One would expect that at least part of that might have been discovered and either repaired or at least alerted me to the potential change in an estimate so it could be repaired. When we approached our PM about correcting it, he gave us a price quote. After paying over $6000 for the original work, this was certainly unexpected, especially with their \"1 year warranty.\" I spoke with Josh, the owner's son who is also in management with the company. He immediately started working with me to find a reasonable solution. I ended up having to pay a bit more, but we did come to an acceptable compromise on the final cost of the supplemental work. In the end, Josh personally stopped by the house to deliver the revised agreement and took pictures of the missed work. It turned out that the rot was more severe than even he expected. He opted to continue to honor that revised estimate and didn't charge anymore. Josh really worked hard to make a relatively displeasing situation wok out well in the end. Josh was absolutely committed to service and ensuring my end satisfaction. He even reached out after the supplemental work was completed to check in on my satisfaction, and knowing there was a bit of a sour taste, still wanted this Google Review. Josh knows what it takes to listen to customer concerns and immediately find a reasonable solution that works in the best interest of all parties. Had it not been for Josh's actions, my 4-star rating would have been a high 2-star, or low 3-star.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888928b42506b8af:0xcb8d4f70d1041df1"}

Kevin mentioned it would take 6-8 weeks (possibly as little as 3 weeks) but there was absolutely NO communication from Champion the whole 8 weeks. On week #6 half the bill was charged with interest with NO work being completed and no communication on when it would be completed/started. When this was addressed with Charlie (owner) it was ignored and not resolved. There was no mention of us being charged BEFORE work was completed. We called the Champion local office twice with no response. On the 3rd time we called corporate and Damon (installation manager) quickly returned my call.\nThe installation guys were 40 minutes late from appointment time, again with NO communication. I had to call to find out they needed to stop and get caulk on the way to my house. I would think they would have been prepared with the proper equipment prior to the customer's appointment time.\nThe installers were polite and professional, however I brought up some quality issues during the installation process that did not get properly taken care of until they said they were leaving causing them to stay longer and redo some of their work. (Gap in the J-molding, they wanted to caulk the gap, not fix it) Corporate called me wanted me to sign a form stating the job was done even though the installers were still here finishing the job.  When I mentioned the issues regarding some other problems (window & screen defects) Damon called me to come out to resolve the issues.\nBottom Line: Customer service and apologies goes a long way.

Perhaps it is because of the virus? Leaving messages or even setting up appointments to meet with a representative and that representative never showed is very disheartening.

Perhaps employ another phone service to answer your toll calls? \ud83e\udd14\n\nFINALLY...after months of calls...we got our Champion reps at our home.\n\nMatt and Charles came to us in East Limestone from the Huntsville office which is by the airport. Having already had sales presentations by two competitors, we knew what to expect in their presentation. They immediately realized we were most interested in quality and price for our new sunroom.\n\nMatt was thorough in showing us the construction of their unique products. He even had samples to demonstrate the sunroom's best attributes.\n\nWe were surprised at the price. Matt was precise and clear on it. One contract, too, one price. Never additional hidden fees. Perhaps we contacted them at the correct time since it is December after all. \ud83d\ude01 Good price for the quality...the sunroom we chose actually can be added to our home square footage.\n\nCharles invited us to come by their showroom. I suggest everyone do this! Seeing several sunrooms already set up truly helps in your decision process versus just seeing magazine quality sunrooms in their catalogs.\n\nCharles even brought us to the back of where products are custom made for every sunroom. These are not kits. We went for the 6in depth walls. Seeing the sun rooms in the office and showroom also convinced us to go ahead with additional products. Charles was not pushy at all. We made these decisions on our own.\n\nBoth Matt & Charles also gave us their personal cell phone numbers and we have called them several times. They have always been available -immediately-. We appreciate this courtesy! (Those 5 \u2b50's for them.)\n\nHaving read 1-\ud83c\udf1f reviews from a year ago...yikes! We decided to see for ourselves and really tested our sales team.

We spoke to Corey, the install manager, Rob McCauley, the regional manager, and even a national customer service manager - all who insisted the issues we experienced were not Champion's fault. Corey's temper when we involved Rob in communicating our concerns was completely unprofessional. Rob offered to give us a gift card for dinner as a compensation for the trouble we experienced (what a joke!). The national customer service manager threatened me and swore at me when I insisted Champion make the right the issues we experienced.\n\nThis company is full of dishonest, unprofessional, and unexperienced people charging high prices for a product of average quality.\n\nUPDATE IN RESPONSE TO CHAMPION'S RESPONSE: If nothing else, please take Champion's sarcastic response to my feedback as a token of their lack of professionalism.

We have a home that has 32 windows. These windows were from the original build back in 1999. Over time these windows failed, broke internal components, were loose, didn't stay up and let so much air in between them; it really hurt our HVAC bills. We decided to look at new windows. We went through the hoops and ringers with various window companies in the area and the big box stores. The price ranges were all over the place and the functions, options, features and price points were the driving factors in this big home reno purchase. We called Champion (CW going forward) and had our salesman Whit come out and give his sales pitch. He did a great pitch and was at our house for 4 plus hours. Going over every detail and question we had. He was not afraid to say \"I don't know, but I will find out\" and called ahead to ask with us on his speakerphone right in front of him. He never stepped out to his truck to ask; he just did it right in front of us. We wanted an answer and he went and got one. Good bad or indifferent there was no empty promises or sugar coated answers. We were explained all the finance options and the promo they were having during our consultation. We beat him up pretty good with our wants and needs for the windows. After that was done, Cory then came out a few days later and walked me through the measurement process; again answering my rhetorical questions and others I missed with Whit. He took meticulous measurements of ALL my windows and explained what my casements would be and how they would sit in the frame. I walked through the house with and he asked questions to me about each room as he measured and took detailed notes. We discussed the order that was first taken to verify everything was right...the first time. He explained the install and what was done with that process from top to bottom. As well as what to expect with financing options again. Making this as streamlined as possible. He explained our order, what timeline for delivery was and the timeline of the install process once the windows arrived from the factory. Once our windows arrived in Huntsville, we were given a few choices on the install. We picked the date that worked on our schedule and a timeframe that made sense for the install. Once again, were explained the who what when were and how on the install team. The install team was on time the first day with everything ready and planned out so they could hit the ground running. Jimmy Mashburn and Brandon Clark were the install team and they were incredible. I have OCD about fit and finish and so does this install team. Jimmy talked with my wife so she would get the understanding of the install and what she could expect. He didn't make her feel silly for asking and was very professional with each question. We, of course stayed out of the way, but if either side had a question about a window, my wife and or Jimmy/Brandon made sure both parties were on the same page. They took their time and set everything right the first time. We didn't care how long it took and they were very meticulous and detail driven on each window. They were not in any hurry to just set 'em and forget 'em. It was done right the first time. I'm no installer but I'm a homeowner that bought 32 windows so I was wanting to find something wrong or find a shortcut that I saw...NOPE! I couldn't find anything that I felt was incorrect or not done in a make sense manner. Everything was top notch work. All my old windows were removed and stacked out of the way. Drop cloths were placed inside on each opening to make sure the removal was as clean and clutter free. All of the windows were set correctly, openings were cleaned from past dirt and debris. Professional 100%!! I felt that my money was going to the right company for our home. These are big decisions to make when getting new windows and the value of the CW product met our families need. We are truly very happy with our windows and would recommend CW to anyone!! We are very happy we went with Champion!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1572873361192, "text": "Thanks so much for taking the time to leave this great review.

Because of my disability due to cancer and amputation surgery, I had to have my master bathroom remodeled to install a walk-in handicap-accessible bathtub as well as open up a wall so that I can get into the toilet with my wheelchair.  Also had cement ramps built up at the front and back doors.  Aside from the medically necessary remodel, I also had a screened-in back porch put up and it's so perfect for us and the cats love it!!!

At that time, we were in the process of selling our home and from the feedback we received, folks were wanting lighter cabinets which is why we spoke to them.   Fast forward a few months.  I rec'd a call from the company following up from our contact.  I scheduled an appt. but told the caller we have since moved but the home we own now was in need of a kitchen re-model.  The appt. came and went and no one showed.  Come to find out, rep went to our old address ( I gave new address during the phone call)  I called them to reschedule.  Rep showed up at our home and that was the end of the beginning.  He did not listen to us.  We did no want re-facing but he continued to measure existing cabinets which we did no intend to keep.  I asked to look at the books he brought in.  He asked rather snarkily, have you checked out our website???  Yes, but since you have books can I look?  At the  end of a very awkward meeting, he said they have a designer that could help with what we want.  We have not heard anything from this company 4 months later.  The end.
