Both times I received no contact from the artist  beforehand either apologizing for having to reschedule, calling or messaging me to reschedule or just to tell me that, for some reason or another, he can\u2019t make it.

This time, I decided to wait and see how long it would take him or the shop to contact me and now, hours later, I\u2019ve still received no contact from them of any type.

Twice is not and there will not be a third time.\n\nI was fully prepared to continue using Ink\u2019d Up as the place to go to whenever I decided on more tattoos in the future, as their artwork is on point, however the blatant lack of professionalism and lack of respect for their clients has put me off.

When I reached out to the owner, all she did was make excuses instead of apologizing for their lack of professionalism and accountability was out the window. I had to ask her more than once to stop contacting me, as she was uninterested in a resolution that included anything other than blame shifting. Finally I had to text, making it clear that I had it in writing that I wanted no further contact from her. I started not to write this review, but I changed my mind just because if you are truly looking for a permanent change to your body-such as a piercing or a tattoo- you need to find somewhere to go where integrity is number one. I can tell you from experience money is number one at this business. A simple \u201c I\u2019m sorry we messed up\u201d could have avoided this review. I truly hope the owner and employees realize that theft at their benefit and piercing intoxicated people, no matter how old, are NOT victimless crimes.

I had to change the placement but that was probably for the best. But other then that, it was nice. I was even thinking of setting up an appointment with Jay to get a large piece done on my leg. The tattoo came out great and my artist was Lane who is usually appointment only but he ended up seeing me and my fiance anyways as a walk in to help out. Though i have no complaints with my tattoo, I gave 3 stars because of a follow up conversation between Lane and my fiance. The night after we got our tattoos my fiance was growing more and more uncomfortable with the font on his tattoo. He loves his tattoo and thinks its beautiful work but he thought the font should be a little more rough and he wanted to try and think of a way to rough it up a little before going back to the parlor and seeing if Lane liked the idea. So he messaged night owl if they still had the stincel that they used for his tattoo. Instead of replying with a no or sending the picture, Lane seemed to have gotten personally offended by this and told my fiance to come to the parlor and face him like a man. This didn't sit well with me at all as my fiance was only trying to get help and he was treated disrespectfully. This is upsetting because my coworker has told me how kind and talented Lane is and me and my fiance were both excited to have him as our artist. Perhaps he was just having a bad night, but either way I am disappointed in the way he spoke to my fiance. I am thankful he went ahead and did pur tattoos even though he didn't have to but he went a bit far. We will probably not go back", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888860ba2cc2fe37:0xffa78b6a839fae29"}

Adam has done 2/3 of my tattoos and I followed them through three shop transitions (two in Sumiton, and Jasper). My last visit there I was treated very poorly. I was told to wait, so I did. I got there well within the operating hours. I wanted to do a custom piece, which I am aware takes a little more time. I was understanding about them having other work lined up ahead of me. I was told to wait for service and that they would be with me within a 2 hour time frame. I waited the time just to be told they couldn't start even drafting because of it being close to closing time. It literally took under 10 minutes for Expert Ink to do a draft for me. I even got a better price. If I would have been told earlier that they had too much of a workload to do anything for me tonight that would have been acceptable. I would have tried to make an appointment to come back. I understand the artists and everyone have busy lives, but it is completely unprofessional to drive away a repeat customer ESPECIALLY after having them to wait for so long. I also overhead them talking smack about me in the back. I will NEVER go here again. I'm telling all my friends to conduct their business elsewhere also.\n\nUPDATE: When I went to the studio,  Adam,  I was instructed that within a two hour time frame you would be available.  When that time frame was up,  you were working on another client.  I was told that even if I left and came back (so long as it was within the given timeframe, and it was) that I could hold my position in line.  I was ready, willing, and able to wait for you that night. It is the discourtesy in which I was treated that has left a sour taste in my mouth. I have no personal vendetta against you, because I wouldn't have been a repeat customer if I was dissatisfied with your work. You are a very skilled artist.  It is possible that this is a management issue.  You shouldn't advise clients that they will be seen within a certain timeframe and then proceed to take a walk-in over an appointment. It's also completely unacceptable that your apprentice was speaking disrespectfully about me,  especially within earshot.  I would have been willing to forgive the former if it hadn't been for the latter.  I was not getting irate with your staff.  I was agitated that I did as instructed and another person was taken in my place, but I would have still come back after that.  As I have stated,  I do understand how a business operates.  I was also upset that Cody wouldn't allow me the time to make up my mind without rushing me to leave. I was trying to figure out a time that I could possibly come back when your apprentice stepped out and proceeded to bad mouth me.  That is the sole reason I left and refuse to return.  You should work with staff that will not disrespect your repeat clients.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1495317758712, "text": "Hi Jessica, thank you for your review. This is Adam and I will be the one leaving this reply. I hate that you feel like you were treated poorly, but I also understand that we cant make everyone happy. You did come in around 7:30pm and i had just started on a very large tattoo that would take a few hours. You and your companion Cody were informed by our apprentice who happens to resemble James Franco, that it would be a minimum of two hours before i would be able to stop and consult with you about the tattoo that you wished to get.  You and Cody both left and returned at a later time in which i was still working on the same client. I never rush a clients tattoo no matter what is waiting on me, my full focus is with whatever client i am working with. When you returned, you and your companion became very irate that i wasn't ready for you at that time. As i was finishing up with my client we could hear you both arguing with the apprentice. I finished up with my client and you were told that we could set you up an appointment for the following day, due to the fact that it was now after 10:30pm. That is when you both told us that you would be leaving to go to another shop. I could hear the agitation in your voice and before i could come out there to talk to you personally you had left. I do my best to treat everyone that comes through the doors with the most professional courtesy that I am able to give them. I understand that I am not the cheapest artist around , nor do I claim to be. I do however strive to be the best i can possibly be and treat all my clients with a certain sense of class and respect, even though at some time that same demeanor is not reciprocated. If you would like to come back to the shop and talk with me personally i would be more than happy to accommodate you."}, "gmap_id": "0x888860ba2cc2fe37:0xffa78b6a839fae29"}

It really set the vibe for us. We made an appointment, arrived early, and she was able to start ahead of schedule.

She did an excellent job and for me it was virtually painless. I would 10000000% recommend Q for your children's piercings.

I contacted them through Facebook looking to set an appointment for two scoop tongue piercings. I sent them a picture of what I wanted and I was told they could do it. I had to pay a 20 dollar deposit to book my appointment and pay the remainder when I got to the shop. First, I had to pay the remainder before even receiving my service which I can understand but that wasn't on their website, Facebook page or anything. Secondly, when I went back to get my piercing, the lady pulled out the wrong kind of bar. I stated,\"that's too small. That's not what I want.\" I pulled my phone out to show her the pic I sent and she told me\" yea we don't have that bar for that piercing.\" She was very like nonchalant. We kept trying to make small talk and ask\nQuestions and she just seemed annoyed like she didn't wanna deal with us.  So I became upset, because whoever I was talking to on the Facebook page said y'all could do that piercing. Never said y'all didn't have the materials to do so. So she proceeds to show my thicker bars but still not what I initially went there to get. I'm telling her like noo, this not what I wanted.  She asks if I want anything else because they don't do refunds. So I came and paid 70 dollars under the assumption I would get what I wanted, they didn't have it and I couldn't get a refund. MINUS ONE STAR.  So I tell her I'll wait while my sister gets hers done first because I was upset. She got ready to do my sisters. The dots she placed on my sisters tongue were symmetrical  and even, BUT once she pierced her tongue we both instantly noticed it was more so to the left, way left, then the center of her tongue. My sister said she was fine with it. Cool. So I got back in the chair to get mines. I wasn't about to waste 70 bucks. ALSO I FEEL A CUSTOMER SHOULD NOT PAY FOR A SERVICE BEFORE THEY GET IT DONE ! Seeing as how there are no refunds, which I was told after the fact, and then lied about being able to do what I wanted. Anyways, I get in the chair. She is drawing the dots on my tongue and had to mark my tongue like 3-4 times because then we're not even. When she finally gets it even and placed in the middle. Let me say the ink taste terrible! She proceeds to pierce and I can feel as soon as the needle went in and was not near the middle of my tongue. IMMEDIATELY I notice my Piercing is to the left of my tongue also. So I'm irritated all over again. I kept trying to show her how it wasn't in the middle and she says\"it's just the way you holding your tongue.\" Lmao, this was horrible! So I continue to tell her it's not in the middle and she tells me we can take it out and redo it and I'm like fine. She then Says \"well not right now I have other appointments coming.\"\nLike NO you should finish with the appointment you already are in and I PAID ! So I leave and then I decided hell no. I'm getting this redone. I go back and she tells me to come back at 4. Two hours later. Cool.\nI come back. Have to wait like 30 min. She finally calls be back to redo it. I'm showing her how it's NOT in the middle. The second time hurt like HELL because my tongue was already starting to swell from the first go round. She gets it in a much better position this time. It's closer to middle but VERY slanted. I said thanks and it looks MUCH better then before because it honestly does and I left. My sister wanted hers done over but she saw how painful mines was and neither of us should not have even had to go thru that. It should've been right the first time AND we should've got what we originally came for. So now my tongue is 2x swollen and sore because it had to go thru the trauma  twice ! Her hands were also shakey and normally when people pierce something like a tongue, they stand in front of you. Instead she was on the side which might have been the reason for them being sideways. Like I stated. The place was very clean and had a cool vibe. I just had a bad experience.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886286825a6aa277:0xfa4f89d127fb3708"}

If I could give zero stars, I would. I decided to come to Royal Spade after seeing a Facebook post about Friday the 13th tattoo specials. The Facebook post stated that they would be doing small 2-4 inch simple tattoo designs from 1-10pm and it specifically said Walk-In only. I arrived at the shop around 6:30pm and paid for my tattoo. At that point, there were five other people in the waiting area. As I waited, several other people came into the shop. I waited for a couple of hours as the people that came in before me got their tattoos done. At around 9:45, the receptionist called back people that arrived after I did. I was a little confused, so I went to the desk and asked the receptionist if I was next in line. She told me that there was one couple ahead of me but that I would be next after that. She asked what my tattoo was, and I told her it was the symbol for the air element, which was only a triangle with a line through it. She told me that she would try to squeeze me in next before the couple because my tattoo was so simple. At around 10:30, the couple that was ahead of me was called back. A few minutes later, another couple that arrived after me was called back. I went to the front desk and told the receptionist that I thought I was next. It was at this point that one of the tattoo artists came up and told me that they could not keep tattooing all night and that they could not accept walk-ins all night. I pointed out that people who arrived after me were called back, and that I had been there since 6:30pm. That is when he informed me that everyone that was called back had been in earlier that day and were told to come back later. I was dumbfounded that I was not told this once; not when I came in nor during the four-hour duration I spent waiting. I was not informed about any possibility that I would not be able to get my tattoo tonight until after I had been waiting four hours, and then was told that I could not get my tattoo. It also makes no sense to me why people could leave and come back for a special that was advertised as Walk-In only.

I went back to show them the tattoo and the first thing that was asked was \u201cdid you get it here\u201d .... KNOWING that they had JUST seen me.!! Then I was directed to another artist there who DID NOT do my tattoos and wasn\u2019t even there the day i had got them and he clearly knew that something wasn\u2019t right because he asked \u201cwhat have you put on it.?!?\u201d And I replied \u201caquaphor\u201d because that\u2019s what they recommended and that\u2019s also what I used for my other previous tattoos. And then he tried to get smart saying how long he\u2019s been in \u201cthe chair\u201d and they couldn\u2019t do anything until it \u201chealed\u201d But the thing is when this heals they wouldn\u2019t be able to put ink on the spots that are MISSING SKIN and they KNOW IT. I was extremely polite until they tried to pass it off like they didn\u2019t see my skin and the colored FLESH that was showing because the artist dug wayyy too deep. I was even okay with the artist not making the tattoo the color i wanted because he claimed he \u201ccouldn\u2019t see well\u201d that night so i went with a whole nother tattoo look than i was going for.& I thought it still turned out nicely until things took a turn for the worst.  I know how tattoos are supposed to heal because I have them and have went to MULTIPLE ARTISTS so It\u2019s not me being \u201cpicky\u201d or rude . I at least wanted them to be more concerned but I couldn\u2019t get an apology, an offer to make things right, or even my money back. But I have contacted my lawyer and I will have to make the necessary steps.!! Like I said the man who did the tatt was  NICE as ever but he dug too deep and it left permanent damage on both tats and it could\u2019ve went differently had they at least acknowledged what was wrong. Truly sad the way things were handled/not handled.!! No one wants to have messed up skin especially in a place where it\u2019s visible to people. I trusted them with my skin and the art but got done horribly.. this is why I believe with some places you need to just pay half or pay after the work is done and even if you pay before hand, if something goes wrong because of THEM and you go to them in a polite manner even though this is your body so you have a reason to be alarm and HEATED ....then they should at least do everything in their power to make it right and pay you back and try to fix it. But like I said there\u2019s no fixing this and they knew it that\u2019s why I had to take legal action. Not trying to bash their business or anything because my first initial thought was \u201cthey\u2019re pretty nice people and it\u2019s a cool space\u201d when i first walked in to set the appointment but as far as my experience and things .... I definitely won\u2019t be going there again and the way they handled my situation.. I highly wouldn\u2019t recommend and that\u2019s just me.!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1593571746452, "text": "Looked through all paperwork\u2019s was not ever tattooed at my shop..."}, "gmap_id": "0x888bb172c55c3801:0x63d2bf04b66beb89"}

It seems to be originating at a local shop located on Greenbrier Dear Road and/or friends/family of that local shop have been making fake profiles in order to leave fake reviews, not just on us, but 3 other shops in the area as well. Now we know that not everyone is going to be happy, which we respect your opinion. These reviews help us as a business accommodate to the people.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb172c55c3801:0x63d2bf04b66beb89"}
