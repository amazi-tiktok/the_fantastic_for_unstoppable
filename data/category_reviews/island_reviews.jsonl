The island cannot budget money and they need to raise funds for repairing the only bridge on the island. The POA fees are way too low so they have budgeting problems, yet the island is too cheap to raise their fees, so they'll nickel and dime you for petty little nuisances.\n\nThere is also a coyote infestation on this island and they have been killing small pets of owners. I once had a coyote follow me as I was walking my dog. Hardly a place to relax.
