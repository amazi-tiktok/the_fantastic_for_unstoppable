Obviously we were frustrated as well and we spoke with you at length over the phone about this. The errors he made have been corrected.  You called again with concern that the carpet was not fastened correctly in one area and, though after inspecting we determined there wasn't a problem, we still agreed to have a contractor come and re-stretch it in an effort to resolve your concern.  We disagree that \"they destroyed all the door frames\".  Yes, there was some slight damage done to some of the door frames but they were far from being \"destroyed\".  Your salesman offered to repaint those areas himself but you declined.  We have gone as far as discounting your invoice three times in an effort to appease you.  We have a two year labor warranty and we stand behind it.  The quality of work performed by subsequent contractors to correct the errors of the first was excellent.  Hill's Carpet & Floor Coverings has been in business at our main location since 1986.

He advised me that he would email me the proposal and to call him when we were ready.\n\nI waited for the email but never received it. However, I still called a week later and let him know we were ready to schedule but that I still haven't received the proposal email. I didn't feel comfortable calling to pay my deposit over the phone without a proposal. He wasn't at the office when I called but was going to call once he got settled. When he finally called, I wasn't available but I still didn't get a proposal email.\n\nSo I waited before calling back. Then Clark called and left a msg asking if my consultation went well and if I was ready to schedule. At that time I was not because I wanted the proposal on paper with the amount I was quoted. Never heard back.\n\nSo I called again Monday, 10/12 and spoke with a gentleman about scheduling (yes I was still willing to use this company because the price I was quoted was the best). He got my name and address and tried to look up an invoice or proposal and guess what, there was none!! He asked who did my consultation and I told him Cullen. He said he would get him to call me. Days later, I'm still waiting on my call.\n\nThe other 2 companies I've contacted this week have been very responsive and gotten me proposals within the same day of the consultation.

We have a vanity cabinet in our master bath that is the WRONG COLOR and instead of fixing it themselves they dropped off a can of spray paint for us to fix it. The fact that they are willing to let a customer fix their mistake is beyond me.

My shipment is a pallet of 33 boxes of porcelain tile., plus 7 additional boxes they put on the same pallet. The right side of the pallet was coming apart due to the immense weight of the tile . The driver could not move the pallet down the truck. He was not going to be able to pull it up the small slope on my driveway. What on earth were they even thinking?They needed a fork lift. I called Home Depot and they got the Transport company on the line while I was on hold. I ended up being told the transport company needed to take care of this and they would contact me in 24 to 48 hours. Which they never did. I had to call them. On 3/5 Friday I called central transport and they told me the shipment would be delivered on Monday between 11 and 12. They never showed. I checked the shipment tracking and found that they changed it to Tuesday 3/9! I got no call, text, or phone call.So Tuesday 3/9 I message them to find out eta. They said the drivers hadn't left yet and to keep checking they will update me. That never happened.

First, the people who are selling the appliances do not know much about them. I was told that for installation of my microwave, I needed an outlet in the wall that it was being installed on. Great. I'm good. WRONG!!! The outlet had to be above the microwave.... Something that would have been nice to know, but they could not communicate that properly.\nThen, the delivery/installation people had no idea what they were doing. They were more of a delivery company, not an installation professional. They could not install my gas range. They damaged my microwave. So, really, they weren't even a good delivery company. Home Depot just subs out delivery to the cheapest company....and you can see the quality when your damaged items arrive!\nAnd I pray for you if you have ANY problems with your delivery or installation!!!\nCount on a couple of things: 1) You will spend hours on the phone getting to talk to the right person. Once you think that you have the right person, they will tell you they have to check on something and they will have to call you back. OR, the right person is \"on lunch\" and they will call you back. After giving them ample time for \"lunch\" (3 hours) when you call them back, you will be told that they were \"off today\" but they will return your call in the morning.\nBasically, it's a game of ping-pong and it takes days to get simple questions answered because, obviously, no one who works there wants to actually do anything.\nI can't believe I dropped over $7K in there and they can't even answer a simple question!!!!\nBuyer beware!!!
