There walls are astonishingly high I couldn't even make it to the top of any of them! They have 2 types of climbing walls the clip n' climb (which I'm sure you've heard of if you have been to any indoor rock climbing place before) and another one that I don't know the name of but its basically where a staff member holds a rope that you are hooked to and you climb up until your done and then he/she slowly scoots you down. Other than the walls they also have a bouldering zone that you can climb without your harness being hooked up. Now that might sound dangerous but it's not because the bolder is only 16 feet high and if you fall there is a soft mat that you land on. They dont only have climbing they have paddle boards you can rent and life jackets if you would rather do that. Oh and I forgot to tell you about the price I'm not sure what it is to paddle board but I know for 15$ a person (5 and under free) you can climb and boulder as long as you want to.

Online waiver was simple to fill out the night before. Easy to find the location.\n\nStaff working the front desk was very helpful. She did a great job taking the necessary COVID precautions, and gave me a brief but helpful tour of the facilities.\n\nThe routes here use a 1-5 \"dot\" grading scale, plus a smiley face for beginner routes. 1 dot is easy; > 4 dots, I'm not even sure Spider Man could do. + sign is in-between dot \"grades\". Simple enough, and similar to the color / ski slope systems I have seen elsewhere.\n\nMost routes seemed to be in the 2-3+ range. Normally I am a v3-v5 climber, depending on the route and gym. I was able to do every 2 I tried, and one 2+. These routes are tough!\n\nThe setting was done well, with a strong mix of holds and problem types. I wish I was good enough to do some of the harder ones! They looked really fun. But even their 2 dots had some challenge to them, and forced some flagging, hooks, dynos I wasn't expecting on initial read. The geometry was comparable to Walltopia, very curvy, lots of inversion, which definitely adds to the difficulty in many cases.\n\nThe Forge area looked amazing. Moon boards, spray walls, campus walls, it was truly a sight to behold. Biggest I've seen anywhere. Unfortunately I did not have time to train in this part of the gym but rest assured I will be firing up the moonboard app and failing miserably here next time I'm in Birmingham area.\n\nOverall, I'd say B2 is pretty top-notch.
