Tony (the owner) was very friendly at the time. The next week, we ran across a good deal on a used Brother machine from another local retailer in the area. S&R carries BabyLock which is made by Brother. I needed some accessories so I thought I would give S&R a chance. I called and asked Tony if he had the accessory that I was looking for. He said yes. When I asked the price, he asked where I wound up buying my machine. I told him that I'd found a used machine at a store down the street. His response was \"You need to call them\" and then HUNG UP THE PHONE.\n\nPeople buy accessories and notions much more often than machines, therefore I thought that a retailer would be happy to have that business; not S&R.\n\nI like supporting small businesses, especially when they have a service to offer (i.e. repairs, advice, etc.). There are other sewing machine centers in Huntsville that want your business no matter who you are, what you have, or where you got it. I will support them.\n\nOtherwise, I will buy online before I do business with S&R again.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1426095706731, "text": "We do our very best to give the highest level of customer service to each customer that comes in the door or calls on the phone. but the rest of this story is a little different than what was told.
