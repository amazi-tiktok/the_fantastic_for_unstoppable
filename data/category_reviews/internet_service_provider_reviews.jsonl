They offered me a \"speed upgrade\" from the 15Mbps we were initially given to 25 Mbps for the same price and sent a tech out to do some work and replace our modem. Instead of an upgrade we now consistently get less than 10Mbps and earlier today a speedtest showed around 1Mbps. I wouldn't even call this high speed out here and according to the currently accepted definition it isn't. 25Mbps is. Still no Spectrum but Hargray which isn't a huge company or rated too much better is 9 power poles away from our house and has scheduled to finish expanding towards our house but their minimum they offer is 100Mbps on an actual fiber optic line. I talked to a Windstream installer about it and he told me that he and other installers have talked to the people at Windstream in charge of expanding their network and upgrading it about upgrading our part of the street to fiber because it is literally on our street already and he said they laughed and said they don't any plans to ever upgrade any more in our area and are just going to leave the lines as they are and if they deteriorate and cause signal problems oh well not their problem. That's great business right there. Don't support your products until they fall apart and just tell your customers oh well sorry. This perfectly explains why Windstream had to file bankruptcy and their hemorrhaging customers more than any other provider. I wouldn't be surprised if they go completely out of business by years end.\nAbsolutely the worst internet provider that I have ever used in my life. We are stuck with them because they are the only provider other than going satellite internet which would be just as bad in our area. I know not only myself have complained but numerous other families have complained about their service and there's even lawyers out her handling arbitrations against them because they are so bad. They don't care to fix their infrastructure because they know we have no other options available to us because we're in such a rural area. I have heard recently though that our small City passed an ordinance that will force them to upgrade the infrastructure out here so maybe that will help. Either that or maybe Spectrum who is now roughly a mile away all the way around us will finally reach our house soon. I'm hoping for the latter so I can do away with horrible over priced Windstream.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b9b9d8c9a65:0xf6f9287187298599"}

The internet is down more often than it works, sometimes for minutes, sometimes for hours, and sometimes for days. Recently I was completely without internet for over a week. Usually it just goes back and forth between connecting and disconnecting, and most days I get less than 1/3 of the 100 Mbps speeds I pay for for the few minutes it is working. Since moving here less than two months ago, I have spoken with OneLink more than 15 times in an attempt to get any kind of resolution to this, and they have yet to do anything to fix it. If you have a choice, do not sign up for OneLink, try Cox or AT&T instead. I can attest to the fact that both of those providers actually care about customer service and provide fast reliable internet. All that OneLink provides is constant frustration.\n\nEdit: I appreciate the response, but as of today, September 18 2019, I am still only receiving an average download speed of 5 Mbps.

I called their customer support who said they would call me right back after speaking to their tech people... And they never did! Don't waste your time with these people.\n\nORIGINAL POST: Customer service is nice and friendly, but that's the only positive thing I can say. My internet speed has been at most 80% of what I pay for when nobody else is using it,  and normally hovers around 50%-60%, with an upload speed of 1mpbs... When it works. Most of the time it's out or so slow it may as well be out. The ping is so jittery that it makes gaming impossible as it will jump from 60ms to 2000ms or more, on a wired connection.\n\nSo far they say that the reason why it is not working is because the server is being replaced, but I was originally told it would be done I think a month ago when I they first installed their equipment. Now it was supposed to be done last night but they're still working on it almost 24 hours later... Since then my internet has been completely out, which is worse since it is the first week of school and now I can't do any classwork.\n\nThey say they will reimburse me on my next bill but nobody's said how much it will be yet. I'm honestly expecting something pathetic like 10 bucks... Personally I feel like I should have a full refund for the time that I have spent dealing with it so far.\n\nMy advice: if you have the option to use any other ISP, use them instead. Your internet will probably work and hopefully won't take a month to start working properly.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1568670122845, "text": "We agree that the service has been less than desirable at your apartment complex.

I was going to start the service on 9th January since it was Saturday. The lady who placed the order suggested to start on 8th January since 9th was Saturday and staff may not be available. This was not a new installation. All they had to do was flip the switch ON.\n\nTurns out the internet was not turned ON on 8th. I called customer service and no one would pick up. Finally was able to get to technical support. She said the order was not executed by the lady who placed the order. Long story short after spending 8 hours between Friday to Sunday night talking to at least 10 folks, I got my service turned ON Sunday night. I had work Monday morning. I was out of internet for almost 3 days.\n\nNow comes the billing. Received a bill for $103.48 on January 18th. Called customer service to understand why it was so high. Turns out they billed prorated for January and advance for February. That is fine. However, they billed at $59.99 a month instead of $39.99 a month for which I was signed up.\n\nI quit. I would not recommend them for any business. Specifically their customer service team is absolutely HORRIBLE! The tech support team is much better.\n\nNo surprise, their reviews speak.\n\nOld:\n\nI decided to move to point broadband internet after speed issues with AT&T. The actual internet service is good so far. No speed issues.\n\nAs far as installation is concerned, their staff was good and courteous.

No one likes mess when they leave.\n\nThey need to really work on their employees sitting at the Opelika office answering phone calls. I had billing issues and called the office. Got in touch with an agent and it was a total waste of time. She cannot understand billing questions nor can answer anything. She was rude and acted like she didn't care to address the issues. Then I went to the office in the evening thinking I will quit with them and move back to AT&T.\n\nBut when I met Lakirah Tatum and discussed the billing issues, she understood right away and was able to address them quickly.

We had difficulties and getting anyone to do anything about it was near impossible. Customer service was rude as was one of the Techs sent to the house. Issue finally resolved after many days, phone calls and techs in the home.\nFast forward to Sep 2020. Spectrum updating system and needed to pick up new box and self install by the 22nd. Went to the store only to find out boxes would not be in ghe store until the 22nd.\nCalled customer service, no problem, we\u2019ll send one out. Box arrived, no instructions nor remote. Hooked it up with assistance of customer service, had picture for 5 minutes then went black screen. She made a same day apt for me.\nTech arrived, gave us a remote, worked awhile and got one channel working. Said it could take a day for everything to come up. Ten minutes after he left it went black screen. Several calls later got another apt. 8:30 at night I called because it was 2 hours passed the apt time. Told it was still opend. Told him to show in the morning. They called me at 9:23 pm when I was sleeping and since I didn\u2019t answer the phone they cancelled work order.\nMade another apt and it was cancelled for some reason.\nGot connected with a supervisor in SC who got me a 5 pm apt. Tech showed up 10 to 5, said it probably needed rebooted, thst had been done numerous times. I told him he was supposed to bring a new box.\nDidn\u2019t have any, off to the store 10 minutes away to get one. After an hour I called and cancelled my service.\nI\u2019ve been thru way too much in my life to be treated like this.\nBottom line-\n-Customer Service is there to make you feel good. They can\u2019t do squat\n-Supervises are there to tell you stuff to appease you and get you off there back, basicly lie to you.\n-The techs that came in my home had no purpose being here.\nAs for me and my family, we choose books.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888d385b97c0906d:0xd92d2cc80054e9db"}

I told Chris about what happened, and he said that he would talk to his manager about the incident (I thought he was the manager?) and get back to me no later than Monday (05/18/2020) afternoon. I never received a call from anyone. Now, I\u2019m leaving this review. I guess this company doesn\u2019t care about their employees spitting on people\u2019s property\u2026..even during a pandemic. Hopefully the kids in the neighborhood that play in my yard sometimes didn\u2019t step in it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888921a5b29d5f2b:0xc8e830564201ad45"}

I I could rate lower than one Star I would.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888921a5b29d5f2b:0xc8e830564201ad45"}
