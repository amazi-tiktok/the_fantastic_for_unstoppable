Arrived at the showroom about 5 minutes early, walked inside with my daughter for my appointment and waited approximately 15 minutes, when a gentleman walked out and asked if we had been helped yet. After telling him we had not, he took us into the warehouse where the slabs were and also where Betty (the sales person supposed to be taking over my appointment) was chatting with a couple of other employees. We could hear them just on the other side of the door when we were waiting for her to come out and greet me for my appointment. They knew we were in the showroom, yet they continued chatting. Betty finally came over where the young man walked us to, showing us the slabs. After being in the store about 20 minutes at this point, they decide to do a temperature scan on us. It was hot in the warehouse and we had masks on. We both scanned 99 temps. They acted as if we had the plague. Betty behaved one the most rude way I\u2019ve ever witnessed, in any environment but especially a sales environment where a customer is hoping to do business with the company they\u2019re patronizing! Betty treated my daughter and I, first of all as if we had the plague and stayed probably 10 feet from us. Even once, when I turned to speak to her, she stepped back about 3 steps like I was about to attack her. Then she treated us as if she was doing us a favor by walking through he warehouse with us. She was not helpful AT ALL, and allowed two other people to take her away from assisting us! I held out as long as I could. It takes a lot to make me mad and I\u2019m always kind to everyone, but she was so disrespectful and rude! I would NEVER hire her to work in my company and I hope the owner/manager reads this review and thinks twice about maintaining her as an employee! Betty has no idea how much I had planned to spend on my countertops, tile work, sinks and faucets! But she will NEVER know now!! Because I\u2019ll find someone who DOES want my business and who respects myself and my daughter. You see, I own a successful business. But Betty has no idea of that. She treated me as if I were a homeless person who walked in off of the street with no money and no plans to purchase anything. Little did she know, I\u2019ll be doing all of my business with OHM!!  And I\u2019ll be sure to let everyone know how I was treated at Triton Stone in Huntsville, Alabama!!\nBy the way, I see that you guys ONLY respond to positive feedback!

We are grateful that Betty is able to continue to work for Triton Stone amid COVID. I am truly sorry that you felt disrespected in any way. As far as only responding to positive reviews, that is certainly not our intention. I prefer to speak with customers directly when they have had a negative experience, and more times than not, we are able to reach a solution.
