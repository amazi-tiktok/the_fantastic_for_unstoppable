The drive through was closed today so I entered the store (not wanted to go inside trying to keep my husband as well as I can) the cashier, when I asked,  told me the pharmacy  was closed I asked to speak with the manager. The shift manager  can out and I asked him why the pharmacy  was closed he said someone  in the pharmacy tested positive  for COVID-19.  I told him I must have my husband's  prescription because  he could end up in the hospital  without it. His answer  was that he didn't  know when the pharmacy  would open back up and they were having the store cleaned  tonight by a professional cleaning  co. So what is a person to do if they depend  on a medication that they have a prescription for and can't  get it from the co. they have trusted to fill that prescription? The shift manager at 4:10 PM Tuesday  answer  was to call the doctor and get a new prescription sent to another store. I guess he doesn't  realize how difficult  it is to get intouch  with a doctor and a doctor at that time of day. Wouldn't  you think that the owner of this pathetic excuse  for a pharmacy would have had an emergency  plan in plan? We have been dealing with this Virus  for many months and a company this large should have a disaster plan in plan for just this type  of scenario. Pathetic. Everyone of my friends  has had a horrible  experience  with this store. We are going to flood the social media sources and expose  this company for who they are. They care nothing about the people  that keep them in business it's  all about money to this owner. Would you not think that they would close the whole store if someone  tested positive for COVID-19 I mean do they think that the virus decides to stay in one area of the store. Do they think that people  don't  go in there and touch products  before they go to the pharmacy. Just an example the bottom  line is money not care. Even Sonic  hamburger restaurant in Leeds Al. closed completely when one of it's employees tested positive and they sell burgers. The Walgreens in Leeds Al. Is absolutely  the worst pharmacy  in Leeds. You would think if they cared they would have had a disaster plan in place and they could have contacted all patrons that have life sustaining medications of the situation and where they could pick up their medication. There are many other drug stores  in Leeds and the surrounding area. I encourage  everyone who has had a dangerous experience with this co.to stop using  them and contact the head office.

I have been a loyal Walgreens customer for at least 20 years, and have used Walgreens on the east coast, the west coast, and in between.  I\u2019ve never had any issues with any other Walgreens as I have at this store.\n\nTo begin with, I\u2019ve experienced phone wait times for up to an hour.  I just gave up on calling\u2026I go directly to the pharmacy and wait to speak to the pharmacist.  I take a lot of meds, and there are times I have to personally request the pharmacy to fill certain prescriptions, as Walgreens online won\u2019t allow me to electronically file certain scripts. Luckily I\u2019m not far from the pharmacy, and driving over is no big deal for me. If you need to talk to someone in the pharmacy, just save yourself the frustration of calling.\n\nI used to be a Job Coach, so I didn\u2019t just want to hate this pharmacy\u2026I wanted to understand what the problem was (is).  The problem is, they are always extremely busy, and maybe understaffed.  There have been times I have visited the store when there were at least 15 cars in line for the pharmacy; the line being wrapped around the building.  In addition there were also times where there were up to 10 people in line at the pharmacy.   I\u2019ve sat and watched the employees working, and they are all working like crazy.  Nobody is on their phones, no one is standing around talking\u2026they all seem to be working just as hard as they can.  In addition, I\u2019ve always been treated with the level of kindness and professionalism that made me a loyal Walgreens customer many years ago. When I\u2019ve been there I\u2019ve heard the phone ringing constantly.  But In the pharmacy employees\u2019 defense\u2026they are so overwhelmed with customers in the store, no one has time to answer the phones.\n\nWalgreens, if this pharmacy is understaffed, help them find some more employees!  There are a ton of people who depend upon this pharmacy for their medications.  Help this pharmacy to be better!\n\nSincerely, an extremely loyal Walgreens customer.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccea8b57332c1:0xcebb8fff287cdf42"}

One of the technicians here stole half of my prescriptions. Now, I'm from out of town and this was my first and last time using this Walgreens.

I thought, she must be tired because she didn't look too good. I paid for my medication and walked out of the pharmacy. I went back to my place and noticed half the prescription was missing! I thought that's strange half my medication is missing and I just left the pharmacy that's never happened before, so I assumed it was probably a mistake.  When I finally got in contact with the pharmacy, I explained what happened and a woman responded saying she needed to check their records. After a few seconds she comes back on the line to tell me their counts for the prescriptions were accurate and she couldn't do anything about it. I said, I will come up there with the prescription bottles to discuss this! Then she proceeds to tell me she's the Pharmacy's Manager. At this point, I was getting upset! I told her this pharmacy charged me FULL price for a months supply of prescriptions then only gave me half of it. I told her, I had to pay out of pocket for this and I want to be reimbursed.  She continued to say there's nothing she could do.  Well, that's just too bad, because for a \"Manager\" not to even attempt to investigate  problems when a customer is genuinely upset and telling the truth about a bad experience just baffles me. Why isn't this manager more concerned that a technician took someone elses medicine from the pharmacy's safe and then falsifed records to get away with it?! She's kept saying there's nothing she could do. Really?! Why don't you fire the employee, so this doesn't happen again.

I take one prescription a month which is a schedule three or four narcotic I believe. I go to my doctor and he writes my new prescription every 28 days. I take two a day which equals 56. I drive almost two hours to this doctor and live in a rural area that never has this medicine so I always stop at this Walgreens and every time they tell me they can\u2019t fill it until the next day or I have to wait two days even tho my doctor schedules my next appointment on the exact day my medicine runs out. For example I got my prescription filled there last month on 2/5/20. Went yesterday after my appointment to fill my script for this month which ran out yesterday. Waited in traffic and in line for over 20 minutes only for the cashier to tell me she can\u2019t fill it until tommorow. I didn\u2019t even waste my time explaining to her that I couldn\u2019t turn around and drive two more hours again the next day or that my medicine ran out yesterday so technically I could have gotten it filled two days early as per the narcotic laws. I\u2019m not sure if she dosent pay attention to the quantity and counts thirty days or she just dosent care to actually read the directions on the prescription. This is also a medicine that if I don\u2019t take it causes extreme withdrawals so I ended up having to drive 30 plus miles out of my way and wait two to three days for another pharmacy to fill it. Got home and called and asked them via the phone if I was eligible to get it filled yesterday and the lady said yes. Needless to say these people don\u2019t understand that some of these medicines are people\u2019s lifeline and they don\u2019t understand the danger and inconvenience of having to drive all around the country and risk your health all because they can\u2019t take twenty seconds to read a prescription look up last day it was filled and count 28 days. Drove 30 miles to another pharmacy keep in mind another WALGREENS pharmacy and they told me I could have gotten it filled Sunday. Done with Taylor road.

If this were to happen, the transactions for the day would be inaccurate, and I understood what a mess that would be for the accounting people, so I told her goodnight and left without buying anything. It was only a 10 minute drive to Hoover, and the Walgreens there is open 24/7 and never closes. They really need to get the system fixed asap so that more business isn't turned away from that store.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889243ad46231e7:0xd570c1bca35e8cbb"}

After ringing up I was informed that a prescription had raised from a $0 co-pay to $100. This came as a big shock and my mind was wheeling with trying to figure out how to afford that each month. The staff at the pharmacy informed me to call my insurance and make sure something was not incorrect and were very patient while I did so. This was all happening at the end of their shift. The new co-pay was the correct amount and luckily my family was able to help cover the cost. Fast forward to a few days later and I received a phone call from Walgreens patient care. The pharmacy staff had contacted them on my behalf to enroll me in to a co-pay assistance program through the medication manufacture. The new total monthly cost would be $20! They also applied the discount to the original refill and I was able to give my family back the money I had borrowed to cover the medication. I am truly thankful to the staff at the Fort Payne, AL location for all the help and kindness they showed an out-of-towner.

I have had just a few minor negative experiences during this time. Most of the time I was comfortable with the service. Today was a different story. I called about an hour before they closed to finalize 2 scrip. orders. I called at this time because I had tried several times in the past week and today to get thru to someone on the phone, but had too long of a hold time each time. I thought it might be less busy at 7pm. The woman who answered, who I believe was the pharmacist on duty, had a disrespectful tone a couple of times during the call. I mentally excused her then drove to pick up my orders almost immediately. When I arrived the assistant, who was one of the distasteful encounters I've witnessed in the past, was working the drive thru. I told her I needed the pills cut in the required dose which I'd gotten done many times before without problems. It usually doesn't take very long to do as well. I went to wait across the lot when I saw a multitude of cars arriving at the drive thru right before closing time. 15 or so minutes had elapsed and it was closing time by that time so I decided to drive back over to the window to pick up my meds. When I arrived the tech ignored me for about a minute or 2 and then she mouthed something to me without the microphone and immediately walked away out of my sight. I could not make out what she said, of course. I continued to wait patiently. Within that time the pharmacist walked over and in a scolding tone told me to tell her ahead of time I needed them cut. I informed her I did not because I was informed in the past not to do that because I must pay for them before they are cut. She then continued her scolding by telling me \"Well it's just so late.\" Omg...are you not still open for business when I arrived 15 to 20 minutes prior? And it doesn't take that long to cut them. And I would of done it sooner if I could of gotten someone on the telephone without a long hold time every time I called! That response was rude, unprofessional and unfair and I did nothing wrong. How dare her and that tech or whatever she is treat a good customer this way. I have always been fair and courteous to the staff. I have already found another pharmacy and will pull my business out of there tomorrow.

A week later my wife went in to pick them up.  They had done nothing and the prescription showed as completed.  They said they would order and the pills would be available in two days.  I went back 3 days later and they didn't have them and they hadn't been ordered.  People at the counter where trying to be helpful, but the Pharmacist clearly didn't care.  No, \"I'm sorry\", no engagement at all.  They finally told me they would order and to come back in two days.  I went back in 3 days later.  The pills are now in stock, but nobody had filled the remainder of my prescription and the system was still showing that it was completed.  The person working the counter was helpful and apologetic, but when the Pharmacist came back, she said \"we don't manufacture the pills, so it's not out fault\".  She obviously missed the training for customer service.  This was the fourth time I was told the prescription would be filled and it still wasn't done.  An apology, at a minimum, should have given, but I surely didn't expect to get attitude.  Completely unprofessional.  I told them not to fill my prescription and I left and will not return.

It's a pharmacy, first and foremost in the business to take care of a patient's needs by filling doctor prescribed medication for sick people. That alone should mean the employees will be kind, considerate, and have the patient's best interest at heart, which requires a certain level of customer service skills. I can honestly say, this is by far the WORST customer service experience I've ever had, in ANY industry! From the pharmacist herself to the tech working the counter, they are the rudest people I've encountered! My particular issue began with a refill which I called in back in August. Once I received a text that it was ready for pickup, I drove over to collect it, only to be told once I got there that the RX was not ready and the drug was not in stock. The tech argued with me about being notified that it was ready until I showed her the text message and then she had nothing to say. I was then told they would call me when the drug was back in stock and my RX had been filled. Three weeks went by and no word so I drove back over to check on it. This time, I spoke with the pharmacist who literally could not be bothered with my questions about when I might be able to get my prescription. She said it was ordered from the 'warehouse' and that they would call me when it came in but if I didn't want to wait, I could go somewhere else and get them to transfer the RX. I opted to wait. Huge mistake! Yesterday, while picking up 2 other prescriptions, I inquired about my refill on backorder. I explained everything that had taken place thus far to the tech and gave her my previous RX bottle for informational purposes. She checked on the computer and said 'this RX has already been filled.' And so I say to her, no, as I so painstakingly explained, it was never filled because you were out of the drug and could not fill it and I've been waiting for you guys to call me when it came in. Immediately she became combative! Then she tells me that, yes, they have the drug in now, BUT, I can't have it because 'oh look, this refill expired a few weeks ago.' Umm. No, it didn't 'expire,' it's been in your system awaiting the restock of the drug! She very rudely tells me that I'll have to go see my dr (and pay the $30 copay,) and obtain a new prescription. What? I'm in disbelief at this point. And when I asked if she heard any of what I had said to her previously, she began talking over me saying it's not their fault because they're all new and training and learning the rules and I'm out of luck! And that she would be happy if I took my prescriptions elsewhere! DONE! Not to worry! WALGREEN'S will never get my business again for anything!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886213531c24638b:0xa635a2eff497a769"}
