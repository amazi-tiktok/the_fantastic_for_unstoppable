As you all know, many businesses won't even take the time to contact a lost customer.  Marc not only reached out but followed up with us to confirm we were taken care of, even though we had to pull our truck.  He made no excuses and stated that the communication errors were taken seriously and will be addressed.  Ultimately our repair had to been completed elsewhere but Williams still followed up and showed accountability.  I would be comfortable continuing to use W.W. Williams as I have at various locations.  However, I would advise that you seek assistance from Management if communication is lacking.  I wish we had done so sooner.\n\nBe aware that every experience isn't the same.  We had a truck towed in to this location due to the good reviews and communication with the tech on our call.  We were told that our truck would be looked at first thing the following day.  Day 1, truck not looked at, we were told someone went home sick.  This was after we called to get an update.  We were told it would be looked at the following a.m.\nDay 2,  I we provided the potential location of the issue after speaking with our home mechanic.  We asked how pics could be sent to get things rolling.  We emailed a pic of the part and diagnostic which was from a recent repair of another unit with the same problem.  We followed back up after not hearing anything mid day.  The truck was not looked at by mid-day we were told this time 2 people were out.\nDay 3, Calls and face to face contact again resulted in no action, the truck was not looked at.\nDay 4, We went to location to try to nail down a realistic expectation of when the truck would be touched.  We were told they would try by late afternoon but could not say for sure, this came from advisement with the shop supervisor.\n\nThis has been the worst experience we have had with a WW Williams which we use often locally.  Our confidence in towing the truck was due to the quality of work and professionalism we experienced in the past.  This location has not met the standard exemplified by the WW Williams name.  Truitt has not followed up with us nor provided a realistic time table to address the misinformation provided prior to the town in.  We understand staff issues occur, especially in the current pandemic climate.  However, there is no excuse for not providing updates nor treating all customers with the same level of priority.  The business is open, there are technicians present, and trucks being worked on.  Yet, we have not been serviced nor updated with an expected diagnostic date.  The cost of being out of service has been extended due to the poor service standard.  Beware before taking your truck here.  Sitting and no communication is not a reasonable expectation and very costly in trucking.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1610485566188, "text": "Thank you so much for updating this and we do hope that we can do better for you in the future!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888e82757537d6dd:0x704f734fd94a65f7"}

AAA got us in touch with W. W. Williams. I described our problem over the phone to W. W. Williams. The front seal was leaking badly, our transmission was functioning normally as long as it had fluid in it, however was leaking too rapidly to drive. The mechanic on call nearly insisted that he come out and have a look at it on site, however I told him there was nothing that could be done on the side of the road. We decided we would spend the night on the side of the road and have it towed to W. W. Williams the next day.\n\nThe next day we had the RV towed to W. W. Williams. The mechanic on call insisted that we let him come out and put the RV inside the gates, even though we were not worried about it as it was a very industrial area. The mechanic came out and was nice and spent about 10 minutes installing the driveshaft since it had been removed by the towing company. We again explained and showed him the problem and he assured us that it would be no big deal for them to repair. The shop was very nice and appeared to be well equipped. The mechanic estimated 8-10 hours labor for the repair. He waited another 20 minutes for our ride home to arrive and we left.\n\nA few days later W. W. Williams called to say that they could not repair our RV. They said that since it was leaking from the front seal, they wouldn't have the tooling. They charged $600 to tell us this, which is very upsetting because I told them that was what the problem was from square one and several more times after that. They justified their price by a minimum 4 hour charge for the guy to meet us to put it behind the gate, and then a inspection fee on top of that to glance underneath the camper. Their seasoned mechanic should have been able to make that call right away, and charging for an inspection is ridiculous as this could and should have been done by the mechanic while we were paying for his 4hr service call, he had plenty of time for that as he was with us for an hour or less. The tooling is also a very lame excuse.\n\nThis company clearly took advantage of us, and figured they could make an easy profit without having to touch our RV. Life is expensive enough as it is, we don't need to gouge each other. I am really upset that I told them our problem from the very beginning and they still put us through all of this.\ncall right awaycl", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e82757537d6dd:0x704f734fd94a65f7"}
