A pair stood there for 10mins talking small talk and not moving along. I find that to be disrespectful and lack of empathy for others waiting. Eventually, they separated. I went to the renewal station and she checked me out. It could have went quicker but she got distracted by another station and that customers problem. I stood there for add'l 5mins, listening to why a customer was asking about a specific charge to her account. The lady sat in her chair listening to it. I was hot, sweaty, and just ready to get my sticker already. I opted for cash bc they charge a ridiculous % to use a credit/debit card. She had me my paperwork but bc of the glass and length of table in front, I couldn't make out what she said bc of the conversations taking place. I said am I done, when I grabbed my papers? She couldn't hear me either. She said your finished have a nice day. I said Thank you and out the door I went! It was now 4:15ish p.m. It used to not be that way....but obviously bc of COVID-19 things have changed! I'll keep going back every year to endure it. I went at the end of the month on the last day!
