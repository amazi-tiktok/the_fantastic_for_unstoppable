The people who worked on it before then totally botched the job, but Edco was able to come in and put in the labor involved to fix it. I recently got my cable changed over from CenturyLink to Mediacom--which is highly recommended on Ono Island--and the technician from Mediacom accidentally tripped a safety mechanism. Edco was able to easily walk me through the fix. Edco is not a cheap company, although I would challenge anyone to find a cheap elevator service company around here anyways.

Swerving side to side, running up on me and revving your engine will not get me to go any bit faster, especially if i'm already going 10 miles over the speed limit.
