I was transferred to a salesman. After I explained what I needed, he repeated three times: we have (name of product). No more, no less. I was not encouraged to ask any more questions about the product he named. He then advised me to check Google, and after I did that, to call back and tell them whether what they had was what I needed.\nI was driving, so I pulled over and Googled the product he mentioned. It looked good, so I called back. He was on the phone so I drove over to the business.\nA gentleman with a radio met me outside and was very cordial. He called the same salesman on the radio and, per my request, asked what the price was. I could clearly overhear the salesman on the other end.\nHe said \"we have to get these customers to start calling in.\" He stated the price, then asked for my name and I gave it. He asked if it would be cash and I relayed that it would be my debit card. He could not find my name in the system (I have done light business there in the past and last time my name was in the system.) He then told the gentleman on the radio that I was not in the system and would have to call in my order and credit card information, then I could come back and buy the single item that I needed.\nI left and found the product I needed at a steel supply in Montgomery.\nI'm not a huge commercial contractor, and I don't represent much money to these businesses. But I'm still a prospective customer. I have always had a great and pleasant experience at Alabama Steel, pre-Covid and during Covid. Today was .not typical but it sure made me feel that it didn't matter if I took my money elsewhere. Kudos to the outside sales guy, though.\nBut there is a silver lining: because of this negative experience,  I found an alternate steel business which displays professionalism, great customer skills and makes me feel valued, no matter how small my purchase may be.

The women in the office well if they moved up they spent a lot of time on their knees. All of the supervisors were from fyffe and think one of those space ships landed and thats who these supervisors are because they act like their from another planet. It you are planning on working there get ready to pucker up because thats how you move up especially the female managers. I was one of the workers that made it a great place to work with some of the other old hand as they called us worst head manager and safety  coordinator. I have ever met. And as for my shipping supervisor he.s about like a helicopter mom he had no confidence or balls. I.m actually putting it nicely if you want to work there you are going to get what you ask for. Try to get on in the shop much better quality of people than outside.had a couple of guys called their selfs preachers well if their preachers i would hate to know how they would act if they were just average joes they never .helped anyone but their selfs and also watch out for the back stabbers out on the yard thats all thats their hope to run into one of the soon.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8861d638dd22c29f:0x9bcdb391661e7bc2"}

I hear a lot of great opportunities with awesome benefits and great work ethics. He tells me almost daily about his day and what the accomplishments get done. I know he gets excited when there are orders that come in because he says he feels proud that he can be on a team that produces the joists. I myself have always been in sales along with Retail management as store manager and assistant to district manager, but I also owned my business as a wholesale distributor in the exhaust industry.
