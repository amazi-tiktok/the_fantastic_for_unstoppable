I'm not the type to complain (or write these reviews) so I let it go.  The next time I went to the unit they have placed one of their locks on it. Again after hours and no one can be contacted.

The property is full of spiders. One or two spiders is expected for an outside unit BUT 10+ spiders inside unit is unacceptable for a unit I've only had a couple of months. That shows lack of pest control or even Raid! I have spoken with several employees, multiple times, at this location about pest issue and requested for their DM  (Nathan) to call me which as yet to happen even though they noted in my file several times for him to call me. I've been complaining for weeks. They have also decided to increase the storage rental an extra $22 ( I've only had the unit 6 months and according to the fine print, they can increase every 6 months if they choose to). Employees have openly complained to me about management and company and how they hate working for Public Storage (I have the recordings). Unethical and poor company values. If i was not out of state on a job assignment, i would've moved my property months ago! The ONE star is for the employees who work onsite because they all were helpful even though they have no control or say over any issue. And I wonder if they are offered the people below me some type of incentive for a \"5 star\" review?!? More than likely. Save yourself and your property the stress/insects, and CHOOSE ANOTHER STORAGE COMPANY! ~~~Update~~~ Nathan, DM, finally decided to call me. Ironically. He informed me that they have Orkin pest control which comes monthly and that maybe the location of my unit is why I have a MAJOR spider issue. He refused to provide me w/ a date of last service from Orkin. According to him, it would be too much of an hassle to go through the paperwork to find invoice. Really?!? His advice is that i consider moving allllll my property to a different unit which isn't near trees. Really?!?! Sooooo, after some prompt investigation and people I know, I have a invoice showing where Orkin last serviced the property in Sept. 2015 and this review was written on July 2016....

My grandson graduated high school and was offered a full scholarship at Auburn University. As an average family we made the decision to rent my home and I would move in with my daughter and assist with getting him through college. So I packed up my most precious belongings and searched for a climate controlled unit for myself. The staff were most helpful and assisted me in getting an end unit so that I could get to my things easily if needed. Being a single woman and trusting your entire life being put into storage can be so stressful. However Ashley has been great, her kind words and helpful attitude have made me feel comfortable about leaving my life of independence and helping to write a new chapter in life for my grandson. I certainly hope that IStorage knows what a wonderful employee they have in Ashley. I would not hesitate to recommend this facility to anyone for their storage needs. I still have 2 more years to go before I can once again be independent and I can do that with no worries\nThank you so much Ashley !!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886286a6c9aad44f:0x78be7047b6726e8a"}

{"user_id": "108930652476130539230", "name": "Brian Anthony", "time": 1579974887314, "rating": 5.0, "text": "I didn't use Hank's in the conventional sense, But my insurance (progressive) sent a driver out to my home to pick up my deer damaged vehicle and take it to Birmingham for Progressive to look at.\nYour driver was Joey, And I haven't had a better experience with anyone during this period than he was. The tow truck the police called out to pick my truck were nice and quick, But when they asked where I wanted them to take it to, they seemed a little bit annoyed that I wanted it to go to my home, as I wanted to talk with my insurance agent first. I suppose they prefer taking them to their place or a body shop.\nWhen they unloaded my truck, a good bit of the plastic from the headlight and grill fell out on the tow truck, And the driver just brushed it off into my yard where my truck was sitting. I didn't think much of it, I'd just clean it up in the morning when I went out to take pictures to start working with my insurance.\nI talked to my insurance, They told me because it's a newer model truck,  That they would have someone from their salvage provider come pick it up, I believe it was 3 days later when I got a call from a lady from IIA or IAA, saying that she was about to be giving a driver the information to come pickup my truck and verified my address and the damages with me.\nNot too terrible long after I spoke with her and said ok to having another tow truck company come out, Joey actually called me when he was roughly 30 minutes away from my home to verify my address and that everything was ready to go. He showed up just as he said and came to the door and got me to explain why he was there, And actually gave me the rundown on the process of what would happen if progressive did or did not total my truck. I handed off my keys to him, He went and got  his truck from the street and backed it in to where he'd be able to load it up. Before he backed up into the location, he did ask me if I had septic in the area (I I didn't)  He said he always asks when he has to enter a yard,  Said he's never had a problem with accidentally finding a tank but really didn't want to have to make phone calls explaining a problem!  LOL!\nHe got down under my truck and did his work with some chains, Put it in neutral to wind it up his truck and chain it down. Now, this is where I became surprised,  He picked up every piece of plastic and debris that had come from my truck and put them in the bed. I never asked him to!\nI asked why he did and he said he wanted it to be just as if he and my injured truck were never there. I'm still amazed that there a people that have that mindset.\nWe talked for a few more minutes as he finished loading and chained my truck down, I asked where they were out of and he gave me a business card with everything on it. I'm in Chilton county, So it's not feasible for me to call a company that's an hour plus away,  But he told me that you have trucks all over the place at any given time, And to call if I needed help, That you might be right down the street!\nAs I said early on, I never thought that my best experience in this headache would have been the guy that picked up my truck and towed from my home to Progressive's auction yard. It ended up being totaled,  But I'm loving my new blue f150!\nThank you to Joey and Hank's!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1580148883770, "text": "That is so amazing to hear, Brian!

The explanation given by the customer service representative Nyrie was, \"We try to tell people not to leave food in their unit. It probably came from another unit.\" Today I went in to close out my account and was told that although I was closing my account out today December 5, 2017 I would be charged until the end of the month. Originally I was told that the amount would be prorated however was later told that they no longer prorate because their competitors do not prorate. I followed up with the district manager Jennifer Sanders and was told that unless I kept my personal lock on the unit they would rent the unit out to someone else although I was charged for the remainder of december, which I must say I find inappropriate.

The previous day on the 1st I spoke to the manager on-site.  She was very nice and very customer service friendly.  I spoke about vacating my space so I wouldn\u2019t be charged for another month.  It didn\u2019t seem like a problem, she mentioned coming to get her when I was  finished, and I even made mention that I may not be done that day.  I was told no problem.  I came to the office on the 2nd at 10:00 am, let her know I was out, it swept clean and empty.  I then at that time asked if the auto-debit would still go through on my account as has been done religiously for 2 years, she said yes but that the pro-rates refund amount would be returned in approximately 5-7 days.  Today is a week and a half later, I tried to contact the site, spoke with an extremely rude customer service rep (NOT the on-site staff for clarification), and after with the District Manager Jordan. I was informed that I would not be receiving any money back as the rent is month to month and nothing would be done-however when I moved in I was pro-rated for days then? That it was policy....I fully understand that, I deal with policy every day-I am also have a responsibility to act fairly and not hide beyond policy and take care of my customers.  When I asked specifically (and while in the office ON THE 1st) when I would receive the difference back-that would have been the time to be upfront, transparent and honest about the truth about the intent to not refund the remaining days on my unit.  If I would have not been told a refund was coming I would have stayed the month-and not called regarding my pro-rated refund.  If that wasn\u2019t what I was told why would I be calling? Bottom line here, I moved up the street to Extra Space Storage, rented the same size unit for $18/month.  I was paying Public Storage $89 after 3 increases over 6 mos.  for the same size unit.  At this day in age a simple apology for the miscommunication and an effort to reimburse me something would have been appreciated and seen as compromise, the lack of an attempt to make it right is unacceptable to me.  It\u2019s not the $89 at this point it\u2019s the principal of managing my expectations as a consumer.  Please go up the street to Extra Space Storage, who were very decent about not wanting to steal their customer by the way, business is business.  The pro-rated refund would have been easier at this point instead of a negative google review and friends that also rent there and now will know to relocate.  Hope it was worth it, I do plan to make further calls.  At this point I do want my money over the principal of standing up for myself and what is right.  By the way, I work for a large property management company in town and in 2 other states that I travel, we were using Public Storage on our marketing material for new move-ins to our apartments and giving them this location in just Birmingham.  That will be changing.  Hiding beyond policy is one thing, refusing to see your company miscommunicated and screwed up is another.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888922751385a587:0x11a09201c8c5123b"}

We had continued issues with billing and of course now that we informed them we had moved out, they said they couldn't do anything about the billing issues and hung up on us. Their excuse was the number of units they had made it confusing. ok, it's weird that you can't handle taking a payment that you have a contract stating once a month.

First off its our vehicle and I\u2019ll call all I need to about it especially when instructed to do so by my insurance company. I was belittled and talked to rudely. Our company will not use them again. We also requested our truck be dropped off at home 3 miles from the accident. He said oh no let me take it to my lot so the insurance company will come out faster. Which we let him do and it cost us $2800.00 because they didn\u2019t come out faster and it sat there from 6/26-8/21. I\u2019ll say the lady in the office was always nice when I spoke with her but Jason who I believe is the owner has no customer service skills.

That's where the good ends...  There are significant gaps in important information given online as well as from the employees.   You must bring a paper copy of insurance, it seems easy and somewhat a reasonable request, but they don't tell you till you arrive to sign...you have to either leave to print it or call your insurance company to fax it.  Also there is no agreed truck usage at this location, in fact there is no truck, there is a van at another location and its not free, you have to pay $20 for the commercial insurance...though the employee told me my personal vehicle insurance would work...paper copy.  Lastly, the size of the unit is 'nominal' meaning they are rounding UP to 10'x10' from the actual 9'x9.5'.

They advertise 24 hour camera monitoring but this is not the case. I was notified by the site manager Krystal on Jan 7 2020, asking why did I pay on a unit that was empty. I explained to her that I was at the unit on Dec 26 2019 storing additional items and paid the rent on Jan 2 2020. On the Jan 7th, I went to the unit and sure enough it was empty with no trace of my items in sight. The unit was clean and ready for someone to move in. My lock was missing and had been replaced with a blue lock by the storage facility's site manager. The police were contacted and after the investigation there was footage of me taking items on Dec 26th 2019 but no footage of my items being taken on or before Jan 7 2020. The items taken included a large 60 inch tv (older style), deep freezer and gas grill to name a few. These are heavy items that would take some time to remove and load up from a climate controlled unit in which you must enter a door to gain access to the unit. I am highly disappointed in how the site manager and owner Karmen treated me during the process.

Not just sign the paperwork and you are on your own. But she was there to handle all my problems when my problems happened and turned them into solutions, not problems at all.    She was friendly , thought full.  And said my wife looked like a Barbie doll.  So my wife gives her a great big thank you all so.  If you have to move and need a storage unit or a truck.  You can't go wrong with Life storage on Bessemer super highway !!!!!! Thanks Randy", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888e08cf7546007:0x293a20dfbf4554a1"}

The facility is clean, well lit, and seems safe enough that I wouldn't mind going by myself or in the evenings.  The onsite manager was very sweet and helpful.  She had our unit open and ready for us to help us find it which was great.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was that I had a few issues with the call-line.  They were having computer issues and it took quite a while to reserve the unit. We got disconnected multiple times and had to repeat information over and over because the computer kept shutting down.  They were very apologetic and always called back promptly. I'm sure this was an isolated issue and I thought they handled it well considering it was frustrating for them as well.

On both days I checked my account balance. It was $0.00.\nSix days later I received a text message advising me to pay my bill to avoid late fees. I logon the SAME day to make my payment and see that I've ALREADY been charged a late fee. In other words, they give you five days out of 30 during which to pay your bill without avoiding a late fee.\n\nOh, also, apparently there's a door in the back that always remains open and unlocked next to a fence that's about 3 feet high so all of their security systems either don't work when they should or do work when the shouldn't.\n- the exit gate that has worked 2 weeks out of 4 months I've been there\n- I've been given 4 gate codes which have been turned off without warning or notification\n- There's no CERTAIN number of days during which the property manager is required to remove the lockout on your storage unit if you don't pay your bill within those 5 days. It certainly ISN'T the SAME or NEXT day which would be the case if there were an attendant. But then if there were an attendant that back door probably wouldn't remain open and unlocked.\n\nThe first night I got there I will admit the customer service agent was pretty helpful getting me into the unit since neither the gate code I was given or the building code worked for me. They were able to get me inside after a couple calls and they were nice enough so kudos for that.\n\nI think this is the only company I've ever had to deal with that doesn't send you a bill before they send you a late charge. Red Dot conveniently reminds you of your monthly payment...the same day they charge you the late fee. I've never received an invoice or payment reminder prior to the late notice which I receive via text message and email.\n\nI've also received text messages telling me when the gate will be closed for holidays and stuff. The message I'm getting is they want you to know when you can't get to your stuff and they want you to know once they've charged you a late fee but don't want to notify you when your bill should be paid on time. No worries, I've set a reminder of my own so sorry, you'll have to do without the extra $10 you've been accustomed to receiving.\n\nThe exit gate has been broken for almost 2 months. For a while it would still open automatically when you drove up to it but it could still be pulled or pushed open from either side. Now there's just a big chain around it. They could probably have had it repaired for the amount they've charged me in late fees but they're probably too busy slapping red pad locks on units they've yet to send out a late notice on.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb4b797cd74c5:0x6014f12e5009bb8f"}

We were quoted a fair price for the storage unit. We were also told that if we presented proof of our homeowners insurance (which we did) that we would avoid paying their monthly warranty fee. Well, I was unable to pay my first bill online because their website wasn't cooperating. I called and had them email my account info to me again. Still didn't work. So I called and asked if I could pay over the phone without having to pay the customer service fee they usually assess for phone payments. The lady agreed, which was great, but guess what was also included on the bill...the warranty fee!  I really didn't notice until I received the invoice for the following month, and wouldn't you know it, there is that warranty fee again! So I called the iStorage location to get it cleared up. She removed the warranty fee from the upcoming bill, but refused to credit my account for the prior month's overpayment because I paid over the phone! The way I see it, that type of behavior is, at the very least, wildly unethical, and may even be criminal.\n\nEdit/Update: I just received a call from a nice lady from iStorage.  She apologized for the error and credited my account.  I'm still dissatisfied with the individuals at the Central Parkway location for their actions, but I'm relieved that someone from iStorage (corporate, I'm guessing) had enough integrity to make things right.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1490024205835, "text": "Hello, Mr. Ferguson, I hope we were able to resolve this issue to your satisfaction.

We are continuing to make improvements throughout the facility including asphalt, paint and building repairs to ensure that your experience at iStorage is the best possible. We look forward to serving you in the future. If there is anything more we can do to improve your experience please email us at info@istorage.com or give us a call toll free at 844-311-2342.

I confirmed my lease was ended twice with a public storage employee and that I did not need to do anything else, I was payed up, and they proceeded to pass off my \"bill\" for another month to a debt collector. Lower management was initially helpful and confirmed that I did indeed vacate long before they said I did, and he was going to fix the issue, but then he saw it had gone to collections and there was nothing he could do with that. So he gave me the contact information for management out of Birmingham, and they never returned my calls. She answered once and the call dropped or something? And I could never get her to answer again. My fiance and I used their advertised discounts on our first two months, and ended the lease before the outrageous increase on rent the third month. We couldn't afford their regular rates. What I do know is that the company did yet again refuse to correct their mistake when I refuted the charge with the debt collector. My next step will be to pursue legal action if I can. Hopefully I do have enough proof that I did reach out and end my lease. They have hurt my credit and charged me for a space that I cancelled. Their discounts in the beginning are nice, but they will absolutely charge you for whatever they decide to. When you cancel your lease, they might simply just have \"forgotten to write it down\" and then refuse to fix it. I wish I could press charges.

The guy there knows that i pay the bill.  I've never been called for a late bill and as I live in her house now to provide her care, i would know if she had been called. It's never been late.   Now they are calling and harrassing her for money because a LATE fee will be added on TOMORROW.  I tried to call Yesterday and NO ONE would answer.  I've paid it on the 5th of EVERY month since I've been paying the bills and I get a woman....(always been a very nice man in the past) who is a witch and says she is the manager.  I became angry with her and asked her what I needed to do to close agreement out as I was going to come get my things out of the unit.  She said my mother in law would have to come there to do it.  She KNOWS my mother in law is bed ridden and can't handle the account.  I even got my mother in olaw to tell her she could discuss the account with me...........she insists that SHE has to come by to sign off on the contract.  She advised my mother in law that she set her up on AUTO PAY.  I promise you I will have a new Debit card and I dare her to try to charge anything on this account.  They won't get one more dime out of me!!!\n\nSince I can't respond to the response I received on this.....I will say that My husband IS ON THE LEASE.  It is HIS belongings.
