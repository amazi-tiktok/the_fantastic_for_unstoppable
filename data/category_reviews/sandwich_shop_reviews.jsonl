I date a beautiful young black woman. We were there and one of our sandwich's did not come out right. Let me say we go to the Tuscaloosa Al location all the time and have never had an issue and love their staff. So we had a sandwhich we had gotten numerous times (she always gets the same thing) get messed up. My girlfriend took the sand which up to the General Manager. She stated it was missing a few things and the manager the opens the sandwich up and starts pointing out \"there some here\" \"ohh its here\".  She stated that she usually gets that at another location and it's different. He then takes her bag yells at a girl in the back and says, \"will you remake this\" turns his back and walks off without another word. The girl then goes to the back and they talk for a minute. Then her and another girl come out and remake it making remarks the whole time \"there's clearly mushrooms here\" \"well load it this time so their happy\"... All of this we can hear. I am trying to be courteous and not eat my sandwich so I can enjoy it with my girlfriend. She however is hearing all the remarks they are making about it and even is starting to feel racially profiled. We are a mixed couple. We get there are people out there not ready for that. Your in a service industry. We pay for what we want to eat how we want it. To top it all, the girl making it once she is done throws it.... THROWS IT on the counter then walks off to the back and leaves it there. Doesn't say the name or bring it to us. Just left the sandwhich there and walked to the back. We didn't see any of them again till another customer came in. We got no apology, no refund, or no little gift card(Tuscaloosa  gave us a tone just for waiting).

It's located inside of the Wavaho gas station, so you can buy more then what they sell at Subway, so you can get a candy bar or anything else to go with your meal instead of only chips. Don't get me wrong, though; I do enjoy their chips. I also love the avacado/guacamole season, which happens every summer. I LOVE their avacado and guacamole sandwhich toppings. You can choose any toppings you want, or just order something on the menu. I almost never order from the menu. I just choose exactly what I want my sub to be, which is what Subway's all about. I love this location because it's like right near my house, so it is really convenient for mybfamily and I to order take out. If you want to eat IN the place, they do have a single two-peeson table you can eat at. If you are passing by this nice building, you can stop by and get some Subway, as well as anything else they sell at a gas station/car oil place. Thank you for reading my review of this unique Subway location, and I hope that I could help you choose weather or not to visit it.

One of the other girls came down and jumped on the girl asking in a bullying tone \u201cwhat\u2019s this?\u201d I spoke up & answered and told the sweet girl to keep her head up and a smile on her face. Other two girls snickered, said something and laughed not in a happy laugh but condescending. I wish the poor sweet girl didn\u2019t have to split the tip with the two mean girls.

I asked about dressing and the one employee rudely ignored me and  gave me my total for my salad.

In addition to having just about anything you might find yourself needing while out on a stroll around downtown, or serving jury duty, etc., the staff is incredibly friendly and will (in my experience) go out of their way to ensure your good day.\nHowever, you will be paying convenience store prices for most of their selections: a cup of coffee will only leave you a little better off than a visit to Starbucks (without the carefully constructed flavor--ACoE's coffee has been particularly bitter in my experience, even with sugar and cream), and the food can get a little pricey as well. Packaged foods, on the other hand, seem to be a bit cheaper than, say, the store inside the courthouse but it's not really enough to keep me from driving the little extra distance to the Publix at Twickenham Square.\nThe cozy atmosphere and neat meeting space upstairs, though, may be enough to counter-balance the slightly higher prices and not-so-awesome coffee--and a warm Spring day sat outside with a cold cup of iced tea and a fresh-made sandwich can't quite be beat.\nSo all-in-all, if you don't mind spending a bit more and not getting Starbucks-quality coffee, you will get a cozy, unique atmosphere great for a refreshing time on your own or with friends.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b56a1fd3df7:0xd805f6cc220b76af"}

Their wraps are a little skinny, which is not a complaint from me,  but still 1' long, which is good for a solid meal.  Their ingredients were stunningly fresh, which I find hard to get from cheap fast food (especially lettuce and avocado), and my cold wrap order was served almost instantly.  The flavor combinations are actually pretty innovative given a total of only a few ingredients.\n\nNow, their wraps are not bursting with grease and flavor.  They're meant to be on the healthier side (it's impossible for a wrap, chips, and water to go beyond 1,000 calories, and they post all their calorie information on the menu).  As such, they taste lighter, which isn't necessarily bad, but a tuna, mango chutney, avocado wrap for $5?  Good grief.  I was more than happy with it.  I got a chicken, walnut, avocado, tomato, alfalfa, yogurt and curry sauce wrap to-go.  Again, the ingredients all tasted perfectly fresh.  Same price.  Neither wrap surpassed 700 calories.\n\nSimply perfect fast food for a guy on a diet.  I wish there were more places just like it.

After multiple incidents, I finally walked away without my order.  She had one person's order she was making when we arrived.  She asked us what we wanted and I told her we wanted 4 sandwiches so we'd wait for her to finish and check out the woman already there.  She complained that she was all alone and she didn't want to avoid taking off her gloves to save time.  So then when we tried to tell her our order, she kept asking what we wanted, and I kept repeating it every time she kept saying it wrong.   Then after several go arounds she said she'd fix the sandwiches but we needed to tell her what we want. I said I had and asked if she could hear me, and she said she couldn't because there was too much noise.  That was about the time another customer came in.  So I spoke louder and began repeating the order once again, and she interrupted me and told me to hold that thought.  And then proceeded to finish and wrap the sandwiches for the woman ahead of us very very very slowly.  At around this point in time, I looked and it was 4:06 pm.  We had pulled into the parking lot at about 3:51, and upon entering the store I briefly looked at produce then went into the restaurant.   She made several remarks through the course of this time she had started with our order at  about 416. She said she had problems just like me and that the customer wasnt always right and that she wasnt disrespecting me.  Yeah right.  I was in an amigo so these things she bent down and said then through the glass. Then asked me if I understood her.  I told her I didn't.   I heard her but I had no understanding of what she was trying to communicate.  Her response to that was \"see, now you know what I mean\". The woman behind me told the little girl with her not to say a word to this employee because she was frustrated because she was working alone.\n\nShe mixed up the sandwiches, and instead of 2 BMTs, there was 1 and 2 hams instead 1.  This is when I realized she had put pickles and mayo on the wrong sub.  My husband said he didnt want it with the mayo on it.  So i tried to tell her he wasnt going to pay for it and she told me she would  throw them out and had another customer, so I needed to decide what I wanted.\n\nI have never been treated so rudely and it wasn't just what she said , it was how she said it.  It was 4:23 when I finally gave up.  I walked over to a Walmart customer service person to see if I could talk to the subway manager but she and 2 others didnt seem to know anything about it.\n\nSo... at 4:26, we exited the store, and drove a few miles away to the Subway in town across from Dollar General.   There were 3 employees there, all of whom were very pleasant and the subs were bagged before I paid for them.  The time on the receipt was 4:45. This is the sub shop to do business with.\n\nSo if you want good and prompt service stay away from the Walmart Subway.   The employee who was rude had a name tag on.  I would never post it, but I\nWill check before I ever order there again to make sure I never have to deal with her foul personality again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888d470ad0c62c3b:0xfea59d59a020d498"}

I called the manager of this subway of which I experienced the bread not being done and she informed me that it was not a priority nor the first thing they do. If you do not have your bread done by time you open, simply change your hours. It is SO RUDE for customers to be under the impression that they can \"eat fresh\" when they can't even eat at all. While on the phone with this manager, I asked if all the subways did this. She replied with \"no.. wait I mean yes.\" I explained to her I went to another subway directly 10 minutes after I was told there was no white bread done but he seemed to have all of his stuff together. She informed me that it could have been left over bread from yesterday, but it was not.

I spoke to the barista about what happened and she let me know that she sat you right after I had left for the evening. We close early on Sundays so that staff can go home and be with their families for Sunday dinner, and the closing baristas are not supposed to seat guests after 5:45p. The employee who waited on you didn't want you to be disappointed by turning you (or either of the other two tables that showed up right before closing) away, so she sat you without letting you know the policy. Having experienced the stressful situation that followed, she now understands why we don't seat after 5:45p on Sundays. Your review helps to reinforce why the seating policy is in place, and I really appreciate you bringing your experience to my attention.\n\nAs for the cheese plate, I'm sorry it wasn't explained more fully. I do always present it with an explanation of what is being served, but the barista who waited on you had never presented a charcuterie before and was unsure of what to do. Again, I apologize for the confusion!\n\nI'd love to bring you back in sometime when I am on shift, so that I can extend you an apology in person and make sure you have an amazing experience.

I'm sorry to hear that you had a less than ideal experience. I hope you'll reach out to me and let me know what confused you about our restaurant and which meal left you hungry. We do try to keep our portion sizes to a reasonable caloric range that is both filling and healthy, but sometimes we miss the mark. My e-mail is Alice@TheWonderlandCafe.com if you'd like to reach out!\n\nTo address your other comments, yes!, you are correct that our restaurant is geared towards millennials. MIllenials are the generation born between 1980 and 1996, so those between the ages of 21 and 38. That is the generation that my husband and I belong to. There are many restaurants in town aimed at other generations, but as our generation heads towards our 40's you're likely to see many more Millennial-owned establishments springing up. As is the norm in our generation, we do aim to bring a fun, hip, and distinct vibe that you can't find elsewhere in town. If this isn't your thing, we totally understand! Not everyone is going to be feeling the vibe. ;)\n\nAs for the coffee, I will happily concede that if it's a standard cup of hot coffee that you're after, you're definitely better off going to an actual coffee shop, which we are not. I've been going to Carpe Diem and Satori for well over 15 years now, and agree that they're great! Wonderland is a brand new eclectic eatery and Bubble Cafe. We've only been open about a month and a half now! Bubble drinks are definitely a 'millennial thing' and very new to the Mobile Bay Area, but I fell in love with them when I travelled out of state for college in the early 2000's, and I'm thrilled to be able to offer this delicious treat to my home town.\n\nIf the Bubble Cafe part is what was confusing, I can understand that! We've done our best to break down the menu as clearly as possible, but being introduced to an entirely new-to-the-area food concept can put one a bit out of sorts, hence the idea of slipping into Wonderland. Some people find this fun, but I can understand that not everyone is about trying new things on a leap of faith. I hope that if you return, you'll ask your server for some samples and pointers. Bubble samples are always free to newcomers and are helpful if you want to learn about this unique beverage! If you're feeling less adventurous, all of our specialty drinks are pretty much calibrated for complete epicness, so they're an easy place to start- but they're likely not what you're looking for if you're just after a basic cup of joe."}, "gmap_id": "0x889bb393b79e14f9:0x4b36df30e0221a91"}

There is absolutely no mold in the walls. A few days before we took over the lease of the unit, we saw that there was bubbling in the paint on the walls. My husband peeled back the paint and we found a significant amount of mildew through the wall and down into the baseboard, caused by a leak at the neighboring business. We notified the landlord immediately that we could not take over the lease if the issue was not addressed. We took many pictures to document the situation, and sent them to the landlord. The following Monday, the contractor came in, fully sealed of the effected area in tapping with a fan to dry the wall, then removed the entire bottom half of the front west wall from the floor to six feet up. This removed the mildewed area, as well as the two feet above it. The inside of the wall was removed, and affected boards and insulation replaced, with mold block being sprayed in throughout the repair. New drywall was installed, primed, and repainted. I realize that the pictures I took for the landlord to show the original damage are circulating on Facebook, but please take two minutes to think about why they exist. Do you honestly believe that my husband and I ripped a wall partially down, documented the damage, and then paid to have a secretly damaged wall rebuilt? Doesn't it make way, way more sense that we took the pictures to document an issue that needed to be fixed in order to have the matter addressed and remedied by the landlord? Seriously, why else would we have taken so many pictures documenting the damage?\n\nAs far as you saying that I'm showing up at people's houses cursing and screaming, this is also completely falseYes, we have a past employee who was let go of last October and who continues to slandering the business the internet over. Her mother, who she lives with, lives down the street from me. Since this young woman cannot be reasoned with, and has continued to slander me, my family, my employees, and my cafe, I did in fact go over to speak with her mother, who is my neighbor, calmly and matter of factly explaining (mother to mother, neighbor to neighbor) that if her daughter does not stop posting untrue information attempting to ruin my business, I will be filing a lawsuit. I wanted to give her a chance to speak with her daughter about honestly and most definitely how not to react to being let go of by an employer.\n\nThe fact that you have written this  review, believing the absolutely bizarre things this young woman had said about me and my cafe, only further proves her guilt in what is fast approaching a lawsuit, should this harassment continue. Speaking the truth about a business is legal, spreading lies that damage a business's reputation and cause damage to the business is absolutely not.

When I first arrived the two staff members looked mortified that someone had walked into their restaurant so I waited outside. The owner later showed up with her toddler in tow.

The table that was sitting behind them were seriously confused and kept making comments about it. Her daughter even came up to my table and started trying to mess with my daughter who I had brought with me. I was super excited because this seemed like a great idea for a restaurant but it's poorly managed and poorly executed. Small children have no business running around a restaurant establishment and touching things and bothering customers. The menu is overpriced and they think it makes a qusadilla fancy by putting it on top of arugula...which is pointless. Also, it needs more seasoning.

After a few minutes, the meal went further south. Chip's steak had a distinct chemical taste to it, like it had been sprayed with oven cleaner. Sarah's had so much grit it was like they just picked it off the floor. Think that could be it? Nope. We began readying to leave at 11:30, only for Sarah and Chip to start puking, and me to have severe bowel discomfort. (I had one bite of her steak to test it, and I'm grateful for only that one.) They were sick until Sunday, vomiting and diarrhea. THIS was a $40 per plate place? THAT'S not even the end. Chip actually CALLED them to talk to the DM, and you know what the Manager told him?

I've been here for 6 months now.  The first few weeks, I came here to eat several times but each time it just kept getting worse.  Now, it's almost the last place I'll go and eat at.\nThere were times when I walk up to order, only one ordering, and it's like I'm not there.  They keep talking to each other, though they saw me walk up.  It's like they have to finish up on talking about their lives or other people and then they can help you.  it's my lunch break...I don't have time for you guys to finish.  I need my food so I can go back to work.\nAlso, when they cut up my steak, then cut up someone else's raw chicken, then go back to fixing up my steak...I'm pretty sure that's a health violation and dangerous.  They preach that you never cross contaminate but these folks do.  I just pray that the spatula they are using is super hot and kills the salmonella.\nAlso, if I get the special fries that come with ranch on it...I don't need 80% ranch, and 10% fries.  I like ranch on my fries but not drowning in ranch so much it comes out of the to go carrier box.  Then I have to toss them in the garbage.\nThe folks here need real management or a better supervisor.  Cause at the moment, I know myself and others where I work, will not go back.  Places like this need to get away with hooking friends and family up.  That's all I see on Ft Rucker and probably why most things go down hill.

Had I arrived on time my steak pita would have been cold and less desirable than normal.\n\nAnother time when I went to the place to order, the service was incredibly slow due to short staffing.  The lone employee was hustling and did a great job with my food but it took ~25 mins for me to get my order and I was first in line ahead of the rush.  Totally a staffing issue; the employee did the best they could.\n\nMy best result has been to order online with ASAP pickup time and then show up within 10 mins, despite the 15 or 20 min buffer the app gives.

He comes over to find out what the issue is and I explained to him how it's been forever since I ordered a cheese pizza and a bowl of pasta for my kids that are in the hotel Room starving to which he apologized and went to ask the waitress what was going on. She whispered to him that I was being belligerent and rude even though that is entirely untrue the patron at the bar can attest to that. The owner then turned to me and explain to me how the customer is not always right as if I had been causing a problem to which I explained to him the only issue I've created was when I asked where my order was at no time was I ever belligerent and he should talk to people around to find out the truth before just blindly believing his head waitress. In the end he felt he should give me my money back I got my pizza the fed achenia turned out to be linguine the chicken was so overcooked it was in edible. The pizza was great the service was total  Krapp. The airconditioner in the front of the store is leaking water so much that they had to empty a picture and it was all over the floor entire time.

Didn't ask for our name or number to call when it was ready.\n\nWe stood around for another 10 minutes waiting for her to come back so we could tell her to get our number to call us when it was ready. She told us it would be about 30 minutes and they would call.\n\nAlmost an hour later, we received no phone call and I had to call them to ask if it was ready, which they said it was.\n\nI walked back over from our hotel, paid for our pizza, only to find out when I opened the box (because they clearly didn't check it) that she had put the wrong order in for our pizza.\n\nAt that point we told them we just wanted a refund.\n\nWE RECEIVED NO APOLOGIES FROM YOUR INCOMPETENT AND UNTRAINED STAFF, JUST AN ATTITUDE.\n\nI don't care how good the pizza is, your service was awful.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fd7562089b5:0x177315578d833c37"}

After the pre-recorded message giving me the \"special\" and saying place my order when I am ready, I placed my order.  No response came and a couple minutes later a voice came over the speaker asking me if I was ready to place my order.  I again placed my order.  When I was done a voice came over and said they couldn't hear me because I was too far from the microphone.  I then leaned out of my window as far as I could and as loudly as I could placed my order.  I was again told they couldn't hear me. I said I have placed my order three times. The woman came on and said I didn't have to have an attitude with her and that I needed to be louder. I started to place the order again, but got no response.  I yelled, \"Can you hear me?\"  No response.  \"Hello?!\"  No response. Then in a normal tone say I will just pull up and order at the window.  To that I get a response of \"OK.\"   When I get to the window the cashier asks what I will have.  I start placing my order with her and a woman with a microphone comes around the corner and interrupts and tells me that it's not her fault she couldn't hear me.  At this point I tell her then must be something wrong with their equipment because a customer should not have to lean out of the window and scream their order and still not be heard.  She gave me a head bob and said there's no reason to be that way and walked away.  I then was able to place my order with the cashier.  I said to her that at some other fast food establishments the person taking the order gives you their name as you order to ensure better customer service.  She then replied in a snippy was. \"Nope, we don't give you our names here.\"  I said \"I would guess not, or it would make it to easy for customers to complain about poor service.\"   When I pulled forward the girl handing me our food was polite and all smiles.  I complimented her and told the manager behind her that it was nice to have a happy person at that window when the people taking the order were terribly rude. I don't know if the equipment was faulty or if the drive through person was just having a laugh at my expense watching me through the camera trying in vain to place my order.

I ordered the veggie calzone and added pepperoni. This is one of my favorite dishes there. When it came, the outside was cooked perfectly, but the pepperoni was raw and cold. Not room temperature, refrigerator cold. I told my server and she asked if I wanted it remade. I did. The second one came to the table in the same condition. At this point, I was done. I told her to just take it back and I would go. She brought the manager over,  who said yes it was cold, thier oven must not be working properly and took it off the bill and then presented me with a check for my soda.\nI have been in the service industry all my life and I have never seen a customer charged for a fountain drink when thier order was botched. I rarely complain in restaurants because I understand how demanding the job is and I tip well because I appreciate good service.  Charging me 2.69 for a soda I drank a quarter of after failing to cook my order twice seems cheap and passive agressive. I know that fountain drinks are considered a throwaway and if I had ordered an alcoholic drink I would not have thought twice about paying for it. This just seems like poor customer service and almost punitive. I am very unhappy with the Mellow for the first time.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1568920524445, "text": "Oh no!

Let me start by saying the food was great, as expected from eating at this chain in other locations. The food deserves 5 stars in my book and I'm very picky about pizza. Now for the bad. The restaurant was packed , understandably due to it just opening however, with over 50 tables you would think they would have more parking. We ended up parking in a dirt lot between it's parking lot and the place next to it. We spent between 2 and 2 and a half hours there a hour waiting for our pizza and 15 minutes eating. The remainder of the 45 minutes spent waiting for whatever we requested from our waitress who was slow and forgetful. She also brought my 3 yr old sons drink in a bar glass then proceeded to say she wasn't sure if it could be transferred to a to go cup but was willing to bring me a cup to pour it in. After 30 minutes of waiting and asking multiple times I gave up and asked a different waitress for a cup. She didn't take our menus till the end of the meal. She took our orders and we waited 15minutes  for them after already being their and seated for a minimum of 10minutes she brought out the appetizers and still had not brought any of us the water we asked for when we first sat down. This is not acceptable service in my book.

We went around dinner time and it was a little busy when we arrived. It slowly started to die out. We ordered drinks and some wings as appetizers. Then we placed an order for a medium House Special pizza. About 45 minutes in, we already finished out wings and my wife also finished her pint of beer; we were waiting on our pizza still. We asked our server if our pizza was ready and she went to check. She brought out a large pizza and placed it on the table. I looked at it and said, that's not our pizza. She took it back. My wife at this point was pretty frustrated because we were both pretty hungry. Almost 5 mins later she brings out our pizza. She explained that they put our pizza into a to-go box and got it mixed up with someone else's order. I can tell the pizza was probably sitting in the to-go box awhile because our pizza didn't taste fresh. At this point, we were not going to wait longer to get another fresh pizza. The food was good but they need to work on the kitchen and service of this restaurant. No one wants to wait almost an hour for pizza.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1526266393570, "text": "Jeff we are so sorry to hear about your most recent experience with us!

We do offer a unique assortment of pizza combinations, but do not fret, you do have the option to build your own pizza as well! Please be aware that we encourage creativity, and you are able to build a pizza HOWEVER you'd like! So if a pizza that we have already designed does not sound appetizing to you, we are perfectly ok with you building your own :) As of now a pizza buffet is not something that we offer, due to our standard of baking. Every order is made to order, and having them on a buffet would only make them less fresh, less up to our standards, and more soggy.

This McDonalds, on the other hand, deserves the reputation that stigmatizes fast food everywhere. We don't frequent McDonalds anymore because this one is so bad, but the kids beg to go anytime they see the golden arches. Tonight, since we were in a hurry, I swung by the drive-thru for what I thought would be a quick visit. There were only 3 cars in the lane in front of us when we arrived. This McDonalds has 2 lanes, supposedly for greater efficiency, and we thought it would move pretty quickly. It did not. To my surprise, when we approached the menu to order we were promptly greeted. I asked the cashier to hold for a moment while I finalized the kids' orders. When I began our order, I informed the cashier I wanted a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese Meal, large sized with a Diet Coke. Yes a Diet Coke. You can laugh. I find the humor in it also. The cashier rang up the meal as I ordered and no sooner than I had gotten it out of my mouth they rudely replied, \"is that all?\" In case you don't know me, that irritates me to my core. If that was all I wanted, I would have said so. The correct question that should be asked politely is, \"what else can I get for you today?\" We have a decent sized family (4 kids), and my wife is picky, so it can take some time to get everyone's orders placed. I know they have metrics to meet, similar to an average handle time for a call center, but like in the call center business, you give the appropriate amount of time to the customer, while being as efficient as possible, then focus on making the next interaction shorter to compensate. Before I could continue with the rest of the order, I had to correct the cashier because they rang up a medium sized meal. Once \"corrected\" I asked if they got the drink large as well. The cashier replied they did. I informed them the screen says otherwise and in order to correct it, they canceled the order and rang it up again. I continued to place the rest of our order, having to repeat myself multiple times because they could not seem to ring it up correctly and when they did not put \"add lettuce\" on the screen for the McChicken, I had to ask multiple times if they got it. The cashier rudely replied, \"it already comes with lettuce.\" Had they said that in the first place we could have saved some time. We finally got our order placed, repeated, and the total provided and we headed to the window. All the cars in the drive-thru merged together into the service line in what appeared to be the correct order for which we took our turns at the menu, but when we arrived at the payment window they tried to charge us for the wrong order. We paid for our order, then it was off to the service window for pick-up. The first thing they tried to hand me was, you guessed it, a Medium Diet Coke. I informed the attendant it was supposed to be large and they looked at me like I was trying to get something I didn't order (at least that was my perception). They pulled the drink back through the window, looked at the screen of their POS (Point of Sale) system, then exclaimed, \"Oh... I see what they did.\" They can have their look back as well since I definitely paid for a large, but I kept that remark to myself. They gave me the other drinks, then the food, and left me waiting for my Large Diet Coke. While waiting, and after they gave me the drink, I proceeded to check the labels, not the individual sandwiches. After all of the waiting and grief we had to deal with on their side, I just wanted to make sure the labels were at least correct. Then, the original cashier that took my order came and hung halfway out the window to ask me, \"Sir, can you please pull up so we can assist these other customers?\" To which, I promptly replied, \"Sure, just as soon as I make sure I received all of my food.\" I wasn't about to go through all of that again. We had received all of the food, and I drove away with the cashier still staring at me like a buffoon. How rude. That's all I can say.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889049231246b35:0x2e5bb33d98875544"}

I cannot rationalize this decision.\nWas it to prevent customers from buying water and nothing else? Doubtful. Water was not the only thing I ordered; Was it to offset the cost of the water and cup? Highly unlikely. Maybe $0.10 or $0.20 would more than cover it. Was it to prevent customers from using their water cups to steal fountain drinks? Maybe. If so, the restaurant should find a fix that doesn't lead to honest customers unknowingly paying a ridiculous price for something which is usually free at most places.\nAdditionally, the quality of the food was sub-par. The McChicken was overloaded with mayo, the burger was mediocre, and the cup of Coke tasted abnormal compared to experiences at other McDonald's.\nGiving 2 stars because I at least didn't get sick.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889049231246b35:0x2e5bb33d98875544"}

You can also expect your drink to be handed to you with some of it running down the sides of the cup and this is before you have received your food so you have no napkins to wipe it off with.\n\nFor me, visiting this place is more entertainment than for food needs.  It's comical how poorly operated it is yet also sad to see so much potential going to waste.  I wouldn't go here at all if it were not for the rest of my family liking their food.  In fact, half the time I stop there I get them food and then I go to Chic-fil-a to order mine.  At least there I can get exactly what I order that is not just thrown together and my drink is no running all over the cup.\n\nOne more thing about this place.  Forget ever getting any type of milkshake.  I've lived in this area since before this place was even built and since it opened their ice cream or milkshake machine has always been out of order.\n\nUPDATE: 1/11/2018\nAs usual these people can't get an order right to save their own lives.  I ordered two chicken biscuit combos and guess what was in the bag...just one.  Instead of listening they seemed to have gotten totally distracted by what type of chicken biscuit meal.\n\nI wish my family didn't like this place so I wouldn't have to deal with the nonsense here.  OR  perhaps the owner could take some action to ensure that it is run properly...somehow your competitor right there by you, Chic-fil-a, get's it done right.\n\nUPDATE: 10/2019\nNothing has improved.\n\nOrder still can't be taken or prepared properly.  If you're going in then there won't be any salt, pepper, or napkins available.  No creamer for coffee.  You literally have to ask for everything.  You have to ask a group of people who clearly don't want to be there for everything you need ie; ketchup packs or whatever and believe me they aren't interested in hearing your request.\n\nThe tables and seats are dirty and despite the kiosk, which those are good, you still have to go stand in line to get your cups because they won't bring the drinks with the food.  So, they put in a kiosk to reduce lines then force you back into the line...you can't make this kind of stuff up.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889049231246b35:0x2e5bb33d98875544"}

Told her 2 names now on bottom of list and 7 families waiting. She said the list must have been accidentally erased by another employee. We have been sitting there the whole time. She was the only employee at the hostess desk. She came and went back and forth, cleaning tables, and hanging out with waitresses talking and laughing. She didn\u2019t go around to see who all needed to be added back so lots of complaints. One guy ask her would it be much longer, if so, he needed to leave and go somewhere else. She said, \u201cbye\u201d. They did not have on name tags. She had short, one length, dark curly hair, blue eyes. The waitresses were standing around talking. People would leave and the table would be empty over 30 minutes before they\u2019d clean it and seat someone. Poor management and hostess with bad attitude. Also goofing off waitresses. Man with grey hair and beard making pizzas had mask wrapped around his neck, not covering nose or mouth, right over the pizza\u2019s. Bleach blonde guy flicking his hair everywhere and digging ear wax out his ear with gloves and looking at it did not change gloves and leaned up on pizza counter where pizzas were.

I\u2019d hate to seen it if it were full capacity. They will close soon. Grey haired, grey beard man came to table at the end and asked how was it?  He had no solution to the waiting list getting erased and act out out because I complained. I have a solution.

We have traveled all over the US and always eat at Mellows when we can find them. Lately every time we have gone here our order is not right and the pizza is just not great. Not once have we been compensated for the inconvenience of having to wait for them to fix their mistake. We are not looking for a hand-out just some average customer service would work, but but that is in short order these days.

I\u2019ve had the misfortune of frequenting this establishment 7 times since it opened up. And every single time was extremely negative. The first problem is every single time I\u2019ve went was during a week day around 2-3 in the afternoon and the place was nearly empty and we were seated and promptly forgotten about every single time I\u2019ve ever been there. I could possibly understand that if there was ever any more than 3-4 other couples in the establishment besides us but no the place has been absolutely almost empty every single time (of the 7) I\u2019ve been there. The last time was around a couple of years ago. I went with my cousins wife and we ordered some of that humus bread she ordered a small pizza I ordered a sandwich. Well the humus came a couple minutes later her pizza came but my sandwich never did so I wound up eating the humus. When we were ready to go (waiter was nowhere to be found as usual there in a empty restaurant) I stood up and said hey we decided we do not want the sandwich can we just get the check for the rest we need to go. Well they tried to rapidly make the sandwich and give it to me with me telling them I did not want it. I didn\u2019t want it because we were going several places and I didn\u2019t want the food rotting and stinking up my car. Then they shoved the unwanted sandwich at me basically forcing me to take it and the waiter proceeded to start saying don\u2019t blame him cause he isn\u2019t the cook. Now he said to this to me and I worked in the restaurant business for 15 years and I knew they were having the chit chat hour and possibly doing side work. I told him well you should have asked the cook why your entire order wasn\u2019t up. In a nutshell he actually started cussing me etc. Me and my my cousins wife left the childish pathetic situation threw the sandwich in the nearest garbage can and I\u2019ve never went back to that establishment again and never will. From the 7 incidents I\u2019ve had there frankly I\u2019m amazed they have any clientele at all. I should have written this a long time ago but I had a lot of things going on in life and just now got the opportunity when the subject was brought back up in a conversation last night. This is NOT a fake review before the owner wants to chime in and claim so I\u2019ll happily provide my receipts. If I could give this establishment negative stars I would. I do not recommend this establishment to anyone of any age group for any reason. Unfortunately this is the second negative review I\u2019ve felt obligated to give and I\u2019m upset with myself for not addressing the last incident back when it happened", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e856ea43b91d5:0x8137de843540196c"}

We ordered a pizza and their hummus.\n- First, the price of the pizza is ridiculous. A large was like $26. Ummm...what? For that price, I expect to be blown away. I wasn't.\n- Second, they were understaffed so we had to awkwardly stand there and wait while one guy did at least 4 jobs (poor guy).\n- Finally, the food. Very underwhelmed. Very meh.\nWe got a large meaty meat pizza (or whatever it's called). There was barely any meat on it and the meat that was on it was placed only in the center of the pizza. There was barely any sauce (i'm a sauce person) and the pizza tasted very bland. A frozen pizza would have been so much better. For that price, I could have gotten much more and much better pizza from any of the other pizza places.\nThe hummus was fine. It came in a plastic container with some veggies. It was only about 2 spoonfuls, but I didn't pay much for it so I didn't expect much.\n\nOverall, just a very underwhelming, disappointing, and meh experience.

I went to eat their with my family tonight and this is what happened. 1. Waitress took our order. She brung our drinks pretty fast. 10 minutes later she brung us plates and napkins and no silverware. 2. We ordered our food and it took us at least an hour before we got our appetizer. Then another 15 minutes for me to get a salad. Now the waitress did not bring me my salad the hostess did. Who also was very nice to bring me silverware. Ok then my son got his little cheese pizza and apples. That meal was perfect. My salad wasnt even great. I had the wrong lettuce. Ok 30 minutes later my daughter gets her pretzel dippers and they were almost as big as her and hard as all get out. You could have broken a glass with it. Ok about another 30-35 minutes past and my husband still has not gotten his calzone. It finally arrives and its cold. The waitress has not even checked on us since we got our drinks. The hostess again was nice enough to bring him silverware after we tried to get the attention of our server for about 10 minutes. They said they would take off my daughters meal bc it was an aweful meal and she didnt even get her apple slices then they still charge us for it.

So it takes about 10 minutes for the 2 cars in front of me to get their orders in and it thought \u201c This is fine, they probably just have some big/complicated orders.\u201d I thought wrong. I get to the window and the operator says \u201cone moment please.\u201d So it thought \u201cthat\u2019s fine, he\u2019s probably gotta take care of a simple task real quick.\u201d I thought wrong.

Crab and lobster bisque was better than some I  had in Florida. Staff and management very friendly and hospitable. We dined around 7:30pm on a Sunday and the atmosphere was cozy and relaxed. We picked up some of their chicken salad and lobster bisque soup from the to go market section. Nice feature especially if you need to grab something quick.

Friendly staff and very fast service from the time you order. We arrived at 11 right when they opened since it has been very busy but from the moment you go inside, the order counter is right in the doorway which doesn't allow much space to wait to place your order.\nThe soups are to die for and the salad was amazing. The pesto chicken sandwich was a bit much for my liking . It had too much pesto and almost no chicken.\nThe only main thing why I couldn't give it 5 stars was the fact that like every 2 minutes Andrew was coming by talking to us. I mean , ok, maybe we are more introverted than most but come on, we couldn't take a bite and here he was back again talking to us and trying to clear our plates. We joked about the next time we would go back we would get our food to go so we could enjoy it.\nThe kids got a pizza which OMG was sooooo good .

I didn't see anyone at EITHER cash register so as I went to take my mother to the restroom I came back up and asked where do I place my order order as there still wasn't anyone present at any register. I went to the front with one of the ladies. I asked her about her suggestions and I order d a sandwich based on it with a fruit cup for my mother. I ordered a veggie pizza with no artichokes, no olives, no goat cheese and no basil garnish with a large bottle of Acqua Panna spring water. Whwn was all said and done we BOTH went through the order THREE times but there were STILL a few discrepancies. I was never offered a bottle opened for a NONscrew top so as the lady looked at me struggling thinking why would they give nonscrew top without offering to open it? I walked up and a male came to me and asked me did I need help? The same lady who took my order then came by me and asked me did I need help and I told her this was not a screw off top and sarcastically said that was I supposed to open this with my teeth. She just walked away. The guy said sorry about that and opened it. Sat down and soon after the food was brought to us by the same girl and I noticed my mother was looking extra hard at the fruit cup. I asked her what was wrong and she didn't want it... I asked her was everything okay until I saw the hair on the fruit. Totally disgusted I took it up to he kitchen and told the same girl who seemed to dismiss that there was hair on the fruit and said would you like chips instead. I got my mother her chips (at least I know that we had a better chance of it being sanitary since it was in a bag). When I finally was about to eat my pizza that was clearly on the burnt side I noticed that there was an ingredient that I specifically asked NOT to have on my pizza that was still put on my pizza. Side note my mother said the turkey sandwich was not that bad. When I came in here there was one couple and one last sitting by herself. There is no reason why this place was not spotless, better service and customer care. Future reference if you want to have a successful business the following is crucial: good customer service, CLEANLINESS, attentiveness. I will not come back. Please check your food and proceed with caution.\n\nUPDATE: I spoke with CURT(IS) and explained the whole situation. He was extremely receptive and apologetic. He also offered to reimburse me but I refused stating that maybe he could provide a free meal to someone else.

Everything went smoothly until when I received my order, I realized that two things that I had purchased were missing from my bag. I was frustrated to say the least, so I called the restaurant to have the problem fixed.\n\nI won't go into every little detail about the mess of what happened afterwards with Waitr, but I did want to give a shout out to the manager from Newks, Kayla, that helped me throughout the whole process. She really went above and beyond. Not only did she refund the money for the desserts, she also got a waitr driver back out to her restaurant,  even stayed late after they closed waiting on the driver to pick them up, and also included in an extra half sandwich for my troubles. She promptly called me back every time she had an update, answered my call every time I called, and handled to situation in the most professional and savvy way. She was the only person that saved the day and saved this situation from being an absolute disaster. THANK YOU KAYLA!!!\n\nOn a side note - Waitr is the worst, most poorly managed food delivery service company, and really service company in general, that I have ever used. They were the real problem in this whole situation and were basically running around with their heads cut off.

Instead of pointing at the round table like the other server did when I asked a question she told me where I could find it and offered to bring it to me. Today the food was much better and out faster. But you really need to fix your servers attitudes and their conversations. One server smelt of marijuana and the to go area two ladies where complaining about customers all morning. I wanted to move away from that area. If you don't like your job quit!

Visited Newks for the first time on Sunday between 3 and 4 pm. It was empty. Took a while before we were helped. My wife and I both ordered a sandwich and soup. We noticed almost every table had trash and food. I don't mean that in a \"every table - but really like 2\", I mean well over a dozen at least.. The hostess said, \"sorry about the mess, I haven't gotten around to it\". We sat outside and it was a disaster. I mean, I've actually never seen something so bad. We were there for over an hour and the hostess never moved. She sat on her phone and never cleaned a single table. The iced tea was not good and I was concerned about sanitation honestly.. I don't think the dispenser has ever been cleaned and I felt like drinking it might make me sick. It tasted off. The chicken salad sandwich was disappointing and the bread was very tough to bite into. The lobster bisque that I was looking forward too must have come pre-made and frozen. All I could taste was cheese. Plastic utensils and 1 napkin each, but I let that pass because it may be a COVID restriction. We had to go and ask for the bill and when I said thank you to the 3 staff working, they just looked at me with dead expressions...\n\nI'm not sure if this is normal or if this is how things run when management isn't around and just young employees are there, but I was actually appalled. Mind you, the state of the restaurant didn't bother me at first - perhaps they were swamped before we got there, but over an hour went by, with us as THE ONLY people there, and they never busted a single table. I did not take a picture because I didn't want to scare people away, but wow... I mean, wow...

Also, that was lukewarm at best. There were no crispy straws on this sandwich nor was there cheese.\n\nThe chicken tenders were all very small and fairly soft.

The service was horrible. There was only one person taking orders. The line from the counter went all the way to the door. After I finally placed our order, I realized that people weren't receiving the food they ordered. People, both inside the store and in the drive-thru lines were coming back to the counter to get things that they ordered but didn't receive. Some people took their orders, got in the car and left and then had to come back because they didn't get their complete order. We waited more than a half an hour \"after\" I placed our order. At that point, I realized that they'd \"skipped\" our number and questioned the girl at the counter who told me it would be up \"soon.\"  I had only ordered two things a Southwest salad and a plain hamburger. I waited a few more minutes, while several more orders were filled, including one order that they filled twice, but my order still wasn't filled. At that point, I stopped the girl again and asked her for a refund. Just as I asked for my refund, another woman came in from the drive thru and said she'd been waiting outside forever for the rest of her order and she wanted a refund too. The girl looked at me, handed me a hamburger (she didn't even bother to put it in a bag) and said she'd refund my salad. I gave the cold hamburger back and told her I wanted a refund for \"all\" of my order. It took her a minute or two to read the receipt. She couldn't seem to tell the difference between the cash I'd given her and the amount of the bill, but I did eventually get my money back.\n\nMy husband's diabetic and controls his blood sugar level with food. We'd stopped there because it was time for him to eat and he truly needed that salad. I've never been to such a \"sorry\" McDonald's. No one who worked there seemed to care whether the orders were correct or not. They definitely didn't care how long it took to fill an order or how long you had to wait to place an order.

Explaining that a staff member should always be cleaning the Lobby and Restroom areas, and removing built up Grime that is on the Bathroom walls, Floors, and throughout the establishment.  The Play Area for the Children doesn't look like the surfaces have been cleaned with Lysol or anything since it was built.  It is really sad, as the food quality and presentation from the staff is generally very good, the staff are generally very friendly, but the management isn't doing it job on making sure the Lobby and Restrooms are kept clean.  Also of note when I did observe someone mopping the lobby, the water they were using was STINKING horribly due to dirt saturation.  Staff needs to be trained on proper cleaning etiquette.

The managers pass us by they more concerned with the drive thru time then serving the guest in the lobby but neither line was moving. I look in the kitchen and the crew is handling meat with their hands (had on gloves) from the tray to the bun as well as trying to make a breakfast sandwich with the same hand the beef was on. I don't know if that is cross contamination or not but  I wouldn't want burger grease on my breakfast sandwich. After close consideration I left and went to lawlers.

Then a young man (the same that had told me to pull over) approached my car and asked for my receipt. I gave it to him.  After waiting for quite a while longer I still had not received my order. The drinks and two sundaes I had received at the pick up window were now a melted mess as it was in the 90s this day. Finally I was tired of waiting so I cut off my car which I had kept running this whole time with my A/C because of the heat, to go inside. As I approached the building an employee stepped out to as me what my order was, I told her another employee had already been out to get my receipt. I went inside to the counter everyone was apologizing while they looked for my receipt. I told one of the employees that my two sundaes were a melted mess by now and she said they would replace them but I had to bring them in first. So I  go back outside to get them. When I got back to the counter there were two fresh sundaes waiting. They thanked me and acted as if that was all. I asked about the rest of my order,  again they had to search for the receipt. I had to wait several more minutes, while my second sundaes sat on the counter melting. Finally after many apologies I received my order and was again dismissed. I was sure to check my bag to make sure I had indeed gotten the correct items.  I had to ask for my receipt back as it was not in the bag. I went straight back to my car and recorded the time. It was 6:09pm ! Food was fresh and hot, fried were undercooked and soggy and my sundaes were melted. Bad experience.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888c4f80a81f68f:0x42157023af6427bf"}

The place is pretty easy to get to and is just off the interstate exit.  It's located inside the Love's Travel Stop.  Our visit here was on August 4, 2018.\n\nThe place was pretty busy when we came in, which was not a surprise since it was around the lunchtime hour.  My niece was with us, and she wanted McDonald's, so that's the reason for the lunch stop here.  When you first come inside, the place was pretty nice.  There were some tables in there.  With the rush, there were workers there clearing tables as quickly as possible to keep them available for others to use.  I was still a bit apprehensive after seeing other reviews from here, but alas we were here anyways.\n\nThe wait in line to order was quick though.  Our wait on this visit was about 2 minutes, which wasn't bad considering how busy they were.  I ended up ordering a Quarter Pounder With Cheese meal, with a special order on the burger with no pickles and extra onions.  After a few minutes, the order was ready for all of us.  Almost all of the orders were correct.  The only error was with my burger.  They did no pickles and no onions instead of extra onions.  I went back up and asked for extra onions due to the mistake and they got that for me very quickly.  After that, it was time to eat.  The burger, fries, and drink were actually quite good and hot, which I don't normally expect at a fast food place.  The others in the group said their order was correct and the food was good and hot as well.\n\nOverall, this was an okay McDonald's.  There does need to be some work at quality control to make sure orders come out correctly, but other than that, this visit fit the bill with no major issues.  If I am looking for a McDonald's and am in this area again, I'd still come back given the experience in this visit.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888c4f80a81f68f:0x42157023af6427bf"}

After exactly 10mins of waiting and watching vehicle after vehicle after vehicle get their orders and leave, I finally went I to the store with a manager. She refunded my money for the hash browns, witch was a very generous gesture. I watched my freshly cooked get pulled out of the grease, not be drained and put in the bag with the rest of my order, witch had been sitting there the entire time. The bag was torn, grease was literally dripping from it and my hash browns basically fell apart. On top of all of that, some of my order was left out. I pulled back around to the window and told the cashier that I had food left out and the hash browns were all broken apart and requested that my order be remade. U was asked if I just wanted a refund instead. When I said \"No\", the manager was called and instead of speaking to me like a valued customer, they basically interrogated me. I was asked, \"Did you not see your food being bagged?\" \"Did you not see the hash browns come up fresh?\" I gave the food back, witch SHOULD NOT be allowed with everything going on in the world, and asked that it be remade. I was again told to pull into a waiting spot. The customer service at this particular McDonald's is the worst I've ever encountered. The associates are rude and unprofessional. This is a reflection of leadership and management.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862869db4a0f6cb:0x6803c69e848fbc76"}

We got 3 pizzas and 3 subs, the food was hot and fresh.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzvOqH3zOOIozR_iDCDJgxi5Rll1-WsQMludKP=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6I8qOjhD3ckWDtXfMnaAPAIPYzK2crjalTGpG=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888917b1e2ba55b5:0xda4db0bf17a25073"}
