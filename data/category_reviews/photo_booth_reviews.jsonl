I can not say enough about how professional Platinum Events was through this entire process.  We had a high school dance.  From the beginning to the end, the experience was wonderful.  First was the immediate responses to all questions and communication.  The website was professionally and clearly laid out.  The \"ala carte\" choosing of the services they provide was so user friendly.  All communication was done by email so everything was clear for me.  I didn't rely on any  verbal committments, it was all recorded in emails.  The price...frankly I don't know.  I live by the motto you get what you pay for....I love capitalism.  And if I paid more than other services, I don't care....I got what I paid for....a wonderful experience.  Our services included a DJ, lights, sound system, and mirror photo booth.\nThe DJ set up was compact, high quality and the DJ screened the music for me...(i had enough on my plate).  Their website allowed my daughter to upload a spotify playlist easily and he screened it.  It also allowed a timeline that he respected and utilized..  The website has event planning section ......It was great.  I wish I was gifted at writing so I could paint a picture of what a wonderful experience but.....I had a wonderful experience and will recommend and utilize them a hundred times over!!!  We also utilized the Mirror Photo Booth...so fun.  Great props, assistance at it's side the entire time, easily usable, I am so glad I upgraded to this but I am sure the starter photo selection is great too but I am glad I upgraded to this one.  They designed a stamp for each of the photos customized to our event and they initiated that process and went with it without much of my involvement because I didn't have time.  The individuals who worked the event were dressed appropriately for the event, cordial, available, cooperative....I appreciated them handling EVERYTHING.  It made it worth every penny.\nMy ONLY suggestion would be to work with them on customizing your props for the event.  That was a shortcoming on my part not theirs.  Their props were great but looking back, I wish I had included some things that were directed toward this group of seniors.\nI can't thank them enough for working with us on providing these high school seniors a winter dance that had been cancelled by those around them twice who were more concerned about perceptions of participating in a \"super spreader event\".  They had a wonderful time, fantastic memories, and NO, we weren't a super spreader event.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889106de6b70cbb:0x61316f3dd30eb306"}

I think on Tuesday evening, I decided I wanted a photo booth and so the search began. During my search, I ran across Platinum Ent Dj's website. They offer a Mirror Booth rental. BEST THING EVER!!! What I loved about the website was that you could instantly find out if the booth was available for your event and how much it would cost. I also was very happy that this company was willing to travel to Huntsville, approximately 1.5hrs away from Birmingham, for my event.\n\nFrom the very beginning, Andre was courteous and professional.  This company definitely understands customer service and it shows! They provided an easy and convenient method to pay for the services online which I appreciated. They also showed up early to the event just to make sure everything was in its proper place.\n\nThe mirror booth was a real hit with my guests. Everyone absolutely loved it! Based on my experience, I highly recommend this company to anyone looking for quality service and a stress-free event. This company literally exceeded all my expectations.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889106de6b70cbb:0x61316f3dd30eb306"}
