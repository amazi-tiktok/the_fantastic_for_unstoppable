When I called River City Diesel, the staff was very nice and willing to work my unit in for repairs.  I had and EGR Valve next day aired to them and requested them to go ahead and begin work on the EGR VALVE and NOTHING ELSE.  Next day, I receive a phone call from the foreman stating that my truck was ready and that after installing the EGR Valve they found that the DPF was in zone four.  They took it upon themselves to remove the DPF and PRESSURE WASH it out with water and DAWN DISH SOAP!   At this point, I didn't know what to say or think.  My reply was, \"Why did I not receive a phone call stating that my DPF was in zone 4 and authorization to remove it and PRESSURE WASH it out with DAWN DISH SOAP!?\"  The foreman replied, \"Well Sir, it had to be done and didn't cost any extra, it was all part of the job.\"  Again, I was speechless.  What kind of repair shop would remove a DPF and pressure wash it out without getting approval from the customer?  I ask him if he at least installed new DPF gaskets, and his response was, \"No, I didn't have any but they will be O.K. because they are made of reusable material.\"  Again, I was speechless.  For those of you who know about cleaning and installing DPF filters, this was a BIG MISTAKE and could possibly damage the SCR Catalyst, put the truck at risk for fire and/or DOT shutdown.  After discussing my discontent with the foreman I paid the bill and deadheaded my truck back to Knoxville.  Luckily, he made it back with no issues.  I had my mechanics inspect the EGR Valve repair that they did, and found that a clamp was left loose and rubbed a hole in the rubber hose.  We then, removed the DPF filter and found that it had been pitted out (from PRESSURE WASHING) and the filter was flaking.  So far, I've had to replace the DPF, clean the DOC and replace 3 sensors.  I hope no other damage is done to this unit.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888598f3ddc064fb:0xf7b7a70fdb7a5756"}
