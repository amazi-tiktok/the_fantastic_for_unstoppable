They are a consignment shop, however, if you are wanting to have them purchase your items.. You'll want to make an appointment asap, as they are usually booked solid a few weeks out. If you're just wanting to shop however, check them out! The store appears small (as it's in a shopping center), however, it's much larger and will offer you hundreds of gently used items too glance through. They are currently (to my knowledge) selling women's, men's, and a small amount of children's clothing, shoes, and accessories. This place is fun, so plan on allowing yourself extra time so you can really look around!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889186db4324123:0x8a72fcba575a0da4"}
