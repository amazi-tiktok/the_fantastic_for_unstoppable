I was informed the entire job would take 3 days.  Equipment issue occurred, and work stopped.  Day 2 (6/19)  Remainder of fence taken down, then the next problem.  It was originally agreed existing posts would be extracted and new posts installed to avoid damages to sprinkler system.  Their removal system was not working, so I agreed to let them saw existing posts to ground level.   Day 3 (6/20) Remaining posts set and cross beams are up.  Work to begin installing pickets but no pickets available.  How can you have a job scheduled, know lumber needed,  and not have purchased in advance?  The company had received half payment for job.  Day 4 (6/22)  Pickets have been purchased,  Sprinkler system has been damaged and needs repaired.  Company paid repair.  The gentleman sawing the posts to the same height of the top of fence was not as tall as the 6\u2019 fence.  This resulted in posts being sawed off at an angle, and numerous adjacent boards were marred because of the chain saw.  In addition, boards were split, some boards sawed into, and others were installed without using a level.  I had 2 gates installed and neither were up to the standards that I expected.  Day 5 (6/23) Finally the finish line.  My wife noticed a couple of small things that needed attention.  The supervisor was not very receptive to her concerns and seemed agitated she would question the workmanship.  We felt they were rushing to get to the next job.  I could not stand over each employee to see that the work was being done properly.  This falls under responsibility of the job supervisor.   I raised these issues with the rep.   On June 25th, rep came out and inspected  issues in question and agreed our issues were not to their company standards.   On a text dated July 7th, I was assured these \u201ctouch ups\u201d would be taken care of and owner had approved necessary repairs.  Almost two weeks later, the crew came out to make  repairs.  They should have known materials needed for this appointment, but once again, the needed materials were not in their possession.  I told them \u201cno problem\u201d, get the lumber and come back in a couple of days.    I texted the rep after they had gone to inform him of the problem, and  was told it would be rescheduled in a few days.  After several texts to reschedule, I finally heard back on July 31st.  I was then informed the \u201ctouch ups\u201d were NOT warranted, and no further action from the company.  So, for 24 days I was misled regarding the repairs.\nWould I recommend Helena Fence and Deck?  NO.\n1.\tYou do not know if they will be on the job early enough to finish on time because they must get supplies for the day\u2019s work.  If the stores do not have the needed materials, then your job will be on hold until store is resupplied.\n2.\tYou would need to inspect all the work as it is being done, because  lack of follow-up to repair any issues that are discovered after they have gone.\n3.\tOne of the supervisors on job is not receptive to suggestions, therefore making it difficult to communicate while the work is being performed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888926dcf8bf1f31:0xc1ffcc421e2949be"}

I had to removed all the pavers and re-install them correctly. Currently our side gate flexes when you open and closes, they tried to repair the gate two times.

The appt. came and went and no one showed.  Come to find out, rep went to our old address ( I gave new address during the phone call)  I called them to reschedule.  Rep showed up at our home and that was the end of the beginning.  He did not listen to us.  We did no want re-facing but he continued to measure existing cabinets which we did no intend to keep.  I asked to look at the books he brought in.  He asked rather snarkily, have you checked out our website???  Yes, but since you have books can I look?
