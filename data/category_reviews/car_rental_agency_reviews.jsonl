Called to add an extra day and clerk said it would change my rate and make the reservation double.  I said no thank you.  Came in on the 13th and they said I had no reservation for 13-17 March that \"Travelocity\" had changed it to the 12-17 Mar and now today they had no car for me! I had an email with the confirmation for 13-17 March and nothing else from Travelocity or Hertz saying anything had been changed!! Clerk made me feel like I was crazy. He did call Enterprise at the Airport to see if they had cars and they did so  I left and rented from Enterprise.  When I chatted with \"Hertz Online Chat\" they told me clerk had changed the reservation when I called, possibly by accident when checking the rates?? but did not tell me or send a confirmation email. I have screen shots from my Hertz Online Chat.  I know human error exists but the clerk made me think I was crazy for showing up on the 13th. At least the online chat helped me understand there was a MISTAKE BY HERTZ not me or Travelocity.

It was a good thing I called the morning of my reservation to make sure they had the car I needed because they did not. I was to pick up a full size SUV at noon and by 3 pm I still did not have a car. Was told they had to go to another location to pick up a mini van because that was the only thing available. After I was told I could pick the car up at 2:30, putting me behind my schedule by 2 and a half hours already, I arrived at this location and was told that whoever went to pick up the car must have gotten lost on the way back because he was not back yet. Was asked to wait in the lobby which smelt like pure gasoline, and they would come get me as soon as he arrived. 30 minutes later still no one has come to get me and I walk back to the desk and ask if he has an update and he said No, that he might be out back. I then asked if he could check because I was 3 hours behind schedule already and still had a 4 hour drive ahead of me. He then ran to the \"Back\" and another guy, I'm assuming the person who got lost on the way back to the lot, came in about 10 minutes later and apologized and started the paperwork. The van was comfortable but not what I had requested a month in advance. And just FYI, I was also told by customer service that making a reservation does not guarantee you will get the vehicle you requested, just before she said she was transferring me and disconnected the line.\nThe day I was set to return the car, I received a phone call from someone at that location and was asked if I could return the vehicle earlier than requested because they had someone that needed that particular car and didn't have another in their fleet. First of all I would not call what they have a \"fleet\" of vehicles, it's more like 3 cars evidently. And second, NO! You didn't go out of your way for me to find the vehicle I had requested a month in advance. I called your customer service line after waiting for your to call me back for 4 hours and had them change it to a van and see if any locations had it. Then I called you and told you I had it changed and where it was located. But this is not the first time this has happened at this location. I gave you a second chance and you will not get a third.

I  made our reservation 25 days in advance & got confirmation stating we would get a Chrysler Pacifica or similar mini van. We get to the office only to find it closed with several customers waiting for it to open. Finally after 1 1/2 hrs, a Mr. Chestnut from corporate office in B'ham shows up.  As we start our process he tells us that he doesn't have a Minivan for us. Should have walked away right then, but we had already had our trip planned for 2 months. He then tells us that since we will be traveling through Nashville, that WE can stop @ the airport to see if they have a minivan.  WHAT?  His job is to call, Hertz had 25 days to do that. He then takes us out to a Toyota 4 runner. Crazy. I can't even step into a bathtub & he's telling me it won't be a problem for me to climb up. No compassion from this man.  My husband gets in, only to find the rear view mirror laying in the front seat. Mr. Chestnut said that a new windshield had been installed & the mirror fell off, but oh, you don't need a mirror for a trip over 700 miles. WHAT?  Then my husband starts the Toyota & the maintenance light comes on. Oh, Mr. Chestnut said the oil had just been changed & it would be okay. How does he know, he's from B'ham not Decatur.  Being extremely disappointed, but with no choice, I follow my husband back to Huntsville so we can get loaded up.\nMy husband said there is no way in hell he can drive to Michigan w/o rear view mirror, so I call Mr. Chestnut back to tell him my husband is going to glue the mirror back on. Nope, can't do that, my husband has to drive to SafeLite to have the mirror put on. Again, not our responsibility. We finally get loaded, I grab a step stool to aid with getting into this 4 Runner that is over a foot tall to get in, oh plus my 78 yr old Mother is also going on the trip, so everytime we stop, my husband has to get the stool out for me, then has to move it for my Mother just get us in & out.  While driving, my husband notices that every time he puts on the brakes, the vehicle pulls hard to the right.\nShouldn't be surprised, there are 3 different brands of tires. On left front is a reg SUV tire, right front is a full size truck tire. At least both rear tires are the same. I would NOT recommend this place at all. After we safety made it back home, and returned the 4 Runner, I received a survey from Hertz. I filled it out stating everything that I have said here & even complained about Mr. Chestnut, alot of good it did, as I received a standard reply & it was signed by Mr. Chestnut.  Don't you know that my complaint will never been seen by anyone else in the corporate office. I do have Mr. Chestnuts boss's number which I will be calling, plus Better Business Bureau and AAA with whom I went through to make this reservation.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886284f10955011f:0x8adee0c78dd67b5a"}

Both times waited over an hour and a half.  This past time, Tuesday June 30th, I had a truck reserved at 8:00 per the app.  When I arrived there were 3 customers waiting outside.  Several employees,  I'd say 4-5 were sitting inside a cubicle talking while 1 person was washing cars. Apparently they don't clean any vehicle until the customer is there waiting.  They would casually check people in as they come up.  An hour later, I was still waiting with about 20 other people.  A gentleman questioned them about this, and they told him it was always an hour minimum wait for a vehicle there.  He took pictures of the one person washing.  They did not like this and asked him not to, then 3 started washing.  I inquired several times about the remaining wait time, and was told each time I was next up.  I clearly was not because I reserved a truck and could see no trucks being cleaned.  Even though the Hertz app showed no trucks, I called Hertz (AT 9:45) in desperation due a meeting I had several hours away.  The nice lady had 1 truck just returned and said she could have it ready once she sent it to the airport Hertz to be detailed.  I explained my frustration with Enterprise, and she told me to come on and get it.  She went out and cleaned it herself and had it ready when I made the 10-15 minute drive to Hertz.

The problems came when it was time to pay. I owed $400 something but saw charges on my credit card for over $800. I called corporate and they told me some $200 in fees were just pre-approvals and would not actually be charged. The other extra fees were $195.81. The local person had no idea what they were for and told me to call back two days later to speak to the manager. I wasn't going to wait, I called corporate.\nThey charged us an extra hour saying we were late bringing the car back, and then $95 was because they supposedly had to clean out excessive dog hair. I told them that we were not late, and yes we have small dogs as pets, but they didn't go in the car at all, so there's no way there was \"excessive dog hair\" and we returned it clean. There were no spills, trash, crumbs, or finger prints. Corporate spoke to the local branch and agreed that we did nothing wrong and removed the charges.\nTHE NEXT DAY I see a new charge for $195.81 (the exact same amount to the penny). I emailed the person at corporate I'd been speaking with and they told me that the local branch said it was now a charge for fuel, that I didn't put gas in the car. Well I did... all throughout the trip and then right before I turned it in, I topped it off at the Murphy USA at Walmart by the airport. I provided a picture of my receipt and haven't heard back yet. The charges still stand on my credit card. How did you fit almost $200 in gas in the car? What is the next fraudulent charge you will come up with?

When returning the Avis rental we were 4 minutes past the 24hr period for the one day rental charge and therefore charged an additional day. After unsuccessful attempts to reason with the agent(Sherry) who was unwilling to apply logic and unwilling to compromise on charging us for the additional day. I was then told that not only was I being charged for two full days, but I couldn't keep the car any longer because she had closed the contract (as she made the final key strokes to close it).\n\nIn an attempt to avoid the additional day charges we had previously decided to skip lunch in an effort to get the car returned, but now with over 4 hrs to kill before our flight and nothing open at the Dothan airport I decided (since we had now paid for two days)we should keep the car for a few more hours to go into town to get lunch. This is where things get really irrational, not only we were informed that we couldn\u2019t use the car, but that I had to give her the keys or she would report the car stolen. Our flight that was 4 hrs in the future was the next flight out of the entire airport, there was not only nobody in line at Avis, but nobody else in sight in the airport. There was clearly no demand for this vehicle for the time I am talking about.\n\nI called Avis 800 customer service by phone and was told that this should not be a issue and that \u201cyes, of course you can keep the car, you paid for it\u201d. According to Sherry, she doesn\u2019t have to answer to Avis because her \u201cDaddy\u201d owns the franchise and demanded the keys.

I bought a used transmission from them, installed it and less than a week later the transmission is slipping heavily. No problem, returned the old one for a \"new\" one from them. Installed it and only made it around the block before it started slipping again. Frustrated I contact them for the third time about getting a WORKING transmission just to have them claim that something is wrong with the \"installer or computer in the car\".\nJust to note, both transmissions were sent to me with broken clutch lock up solenoids, shift control solenoids, as well as dirt in axle bearings behind the seals, muck behind all the solenoids as well. On the first trans he sent me I had to swap over everything, assuming he would send me another trans complete with everything the second go round I didn't bother taking all the solenoids off. When I received the new one, of course all the solenoids were broken. So after having to go source and replace all the solenoids I kept them after having to return the last transmission. Today I went into his car yard and actually found all my undamaged sensors in his junk transmission. He wouldn't let me have another transmission until I gave him his sensors out of the older one. He then claimed that he had only sold me one transmision.

Hertz sent for a tow truck to get the car, which was picked up at 9:48 on Thu 25 Oct.

All this after having been on the phone with Hertz 5 times that morning to get their car taken care of. I explained all this to the agents at MOB; they gave me the number of their manager, whom I called and left a voicemail for. I received no call back.

I rent from hertz all over the country and will say this was my worst experience. There customer service was atrocious.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb22075d6ba07:0x7da3af36f8a5bdb6"}

It's brakes were a bit grabby and the driver's side carpet behind the gas pedal was worn and torn. Otherwise . . . it was okay.\n\nThe rental agent told me that my credit card on file had been declined. So I used a debit card for the rental.

When I got to my hotel in Jackson, AL, I discovered that the travel agency had reserved a room for me in Jackson, MS.

Then, on Monday, I started receiving calls that the car wasn't returned. I called the number specified, only to be told that they would check into it and would send me an email within 48 hours.  Instead, all I received was an automated message each day stating that the car wasn't returned. I called again on 10/9 and spoke to Kathy, who told me that she would check into it. The next day I received another automated call.  I have never heard from Thrifty at all except for these automated calls.  It seems like, in a day of GPS on all rental cars, the car could be found and seen that it was obviously NOT in Colorado, where I live.  Instead of checking that, $60 was taken from my account each day until I was forced to cancel my card.  Thrifty owes me an apology, and at least $500 that was taken without my consent after the car was returned.

At pick up, not once, but twice did the employees give away the car they were planning to give me. I\u2019m not sure what the other was but there were around 5 of us waiting for close to an hour before we were able to leave with vehicles. From what I gathered from those around me, everyone had pre-booked a car. So it\u2019s not like our arrival was a surprise and they were having to rearrange. When I was called up to the counter to be sent out to the outside counter to get keys, the employee was way more excited to talk to her friends than to help me. Then I got outside to pick up the keys and they go wandering off to find it. Only to come back and tell me that they were getting a car pulled around for me as they had given it away. The employee tried to frame it as a positive thing as she had gotten me \u2018upgraded.\u2019 At this point, I was more than frustrated and just wanted to get out of the airport. I had hoped returning the car would be a better experience. Boy, was I mistaken.\nUpon returning the car to the airport, the signage is terrible. So I ended up in the wrong space. Like the return signs pointed at a chain link fence for the direction you should go to return the car. I finally found it. But no one was there. So I parked the car and went to go inside. I got sent to a few different people before someone was like \u2018no, you have to move the car here. We can\u2019t accept it over there.\u2019 I offered her the keys again and she told me that she couldn\u2019t accept them, even though I told her the car was by their signs and in the parking lot and this was a signage issue. This was the same employee who told me she had gotten me an \u2018upgrade.\u2019 Another one of the employees realized I was frustrated and goes \u2018come with me. I\u2019ll go get it.\u2019 So we walk off to the car. Well, turns out, I\u2019m not the only one that had this problem. They were able to leave the car behind and get on to their flight. I went to give her the keys and she goes \u2018no, I need you to follow me and I\u2019ll show you how to take it back.\u2019 She gets in the other car and leads me out of the parking deck, but not before she almost backs that car up onto the car I was driving. She leads me back in to the \u201cproper spot\u201d that is labeled hertz and in tiny letters underneath it has dollar and thrifty, while their big signs point off into the distance about returns. Once we get back to where they want the car, she doesn\u2019t get out. Just sits in the car and waits for someone else to walk up. She rolled her window down. And I asked if I should just leave the car on. And she mumbles something about someone else coming to check me out and give me a receipt. The employee who told me I would have to move the car shows up and checks me out.\nI would much rather pay any of the other car rental companies in the airport twice what I paid for the car as my experience was terrible. I will never use this company for a car rental and will encourage my friends and family to do the same.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891aa2942e44f3:0x3bc4ddd435b32387"}

They asked for the review, so I am complying, but I'm being honest!\n\nWe reserved a FULL size vehicle - a little over a week ahead of time - for a trip we needed to make.\n\nImagine our surprise when the Assistant Manager, Travis, took us out to a Chrysler 200! (STANDARD SIZE vehicle, which rents for $4/day less than a FULL SIZE car.) We knew the car looked small and we asked him if it was a full size car to which he replied, \u201cYes, it is.\u201d Back inside the office, we noticed the Chrysler 200 was showing right on the counter top as a STANDARD SIZE car. We asked Travis about it and he stated, \u201cIt goes back and forth. It was just moved up to a FULL SIZE car when the new ones came out.\u201d Okay, we didn\u2019t question him further. Then, we went out to get in the vehicle and see if it would be comfortable enough for our trip. When my husband got in the car, he immediately popped back out and said it wreaked of cigarette smoke! I said, \u201cI can\u2019t ride in that then. I am allergic to cigarette smoke\u201d. My husband knew this and that is why he was letting me know. Travis was going inside to get his helper to spray the car and see if it would help. His helper said he had already sprayed inside it. It was horrible! Travis then asked us, \u201cWhat can I do to make this okay for you?\u201d We told him we needed a different car and he stated he didn\u2019t have anything else to offer us. We kept talking and we asked him, again, \u201cIs this REALLY considered a FULL SIZE car?\u201d He FINALLY admitted it was a STANDARD SIZE vehicle. He then offered to bring our cost down to the standard size pricing (how nice of him, since that is what we were getting!) and he also said he would do a 10% discount plus take $30 off. We truly had no choice but to accept his offer. I told him I wanted to get it in writing of just how much we were to be refunded, once the car was returned. He told me the total we would be refunded and he put it in writing.\n\nWell, we were hoping we could use some of our Young Living Essential Oils to get rid of the cigarette smell, but it did not work. This car had been smoked in for so long, the smell was already set in! My husband and I were both sick the whole time we were gone due to having to ride in that horrible smell! I can not believe someone can call and make a RESERVATION for a car and NOT get the type car they reserved! What is the point in making a reservation, if you are still just going to have to take whatever they have to offer you? This is NOT good business and I doubt we will ever use Enterprise again! In hindsight, we should have told Travis to get on the phone and call one of their locations to get us a FULL SIZE, SMOKE FREE car to the Brewton office immediately.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1465590550152, "text": "Thank you for your review, Kathryn.

Just had the worst car rental experience of my life...anywhere and any car rental brand.

We had reserved car seats for our twins and it was an ordeal in itself. One seat\u2019s belt was stuck  and couldn\u2019t be attached until we wrestled with it and the other seat was set up for a really tiny baby. We had to take it off and rearrange the whole thing. So after waiting for the car a long time, we had to spend time fixing the seats before putting our crying kids into them. To make things absolutely worse...the car smells like smoke! We left the airport and had to stop right away for some air freshener. It\u2019s been only twenty minutes in this car, and we cannot wait to return it! It\u2019s going to be a very long four days before we can do that. Oh and of course, nobody went over the car to make sure there isn\u2019t any pre-existing damage. My husband took photos of the damage to show when we return. Absolutely no sense of urgency to help the customers.

I arrived on a Saturday night just before the counter was closing. Since I seemed to be the last person in line, I was curious as to whether they would have an intermediate car available (Which I had reserved). They didn't, but they gave me a courtesy upgrade. The two women at the counter (One was a Trainee) were very polite and friendly (I typically rent from Enterprise, Alamo's holding company, and I have always received excellent service so I was happy to see that this transferred over to Alamo). The lady who checked me in indicated that the vehicle was in the garage across the street, and due to the late hour, there was not an Alamo (or National) attendant on duty to check the car out with me. She requested that I preform the usual walk-around to check for obvious damage and to let the counter know if I saw anything. Given that this was a black car in a dark garage with cars parked on both sides and in-front, there's only so much a 50+ year old can see, but I didn't see anything obvious. I left and spent the next three days with my daughter looking at schools in Alabama and Tennessee.\n\nWhen I returned the car (in broad daylight), the young man checking the car in pointed out to me a scrape on the lower portion of the passenger side bumper. This I had not noticed. He indicated that I would need to go to the counter to have a \"damage report\" filled out. This made me angry. While I can certainly appreciate that many renters must not take good care of the cars they rent and car company's have a legitimate interest in protecting their property, I am not one of them. I treat other people's property better than I treat my own. I have never received so much as a j-walking ticket in my life. I certainly did not run over any curbs or damage their vehicle (Toyota Avalon, CA Plates, almost 30K miles on it). To make a long story short, after about 40 minutes at the counter or so, the paperwork was completed and I ran for my flight (which I almost missed). I should, in all fairness, again mention that the counter personnel were polite and professional at all times, with the Manager remarking that even she could have missed the scrape at night in the parking garage,\n\nAs I travel on business about 25 times per year (renting cars each time), I am very familiar with the \"walk-around.\" This is the first time, however, that I can recall not having an attendant     present during the initial damage check. Given a black, relatively high mileage rental car, in a dark garage (the typical yellow overhead bulbs), there was no way that I would have seen scratches on the lower bumper (or, probably, anywhere else on the car unless they were on the door panel, hood, roof, trunk, etc.). A dink, dent, or crack is usually obvious - scratches not so depending upon the car, scratch position, and lighting conditions. The next morning when I left my hotel in broad daylight, I did notice that the paint had many hairline scratches all over the car - as if someone had driven it down a heavily wooded dirt road where branches had scraped it. In any event, I never put a scratch on the car.\n\nI am waiting to see whether I receive a call from Alamo's Recovery Unit in O.K. I will explain to them exactly what I have just written and add that a customer cannot report what a customer did not see, especially in a dark garage without anyone to walk around with them. It is unconscionable to hold a customer responsible for a scratch or scratches that (1) he/she did not cause and (2) could not have seen or could have been easily missed given the site conditions. I will update my review (along with other reviews) depending upon Alamo's next steps - if any. Again, the service was very friendly, and I understand that they were just \"doing their jobs,\" but that doesn't change the fact that I was delayed 40 minutes, have to expect a call on damage that I did not cause, and am being held responsible for something that I could not see.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1446187633974, "text": "Hi there, John!

So I go to the parking garage booth where they will do paperwork, and am told I need to go back to the airport desk, I'm like really, you want me to walk all the way back to the airport and to the desk and start this all over, well yes, so thats what i did.  Got there, went through the same thing again,  and then got a new car, went out to the spot looking for a White car, since that was what I was told it was, only to find no car in the spot, and then a very nice guy driving the help van, noticed that I had been there for a good hour at this point, contacted the Alamo manager, who wasn't much help, but did finally get me a car and I was finally able to leave the airport after an hour and half.

Originally,  I did rented for 3 days, for ~$72 total, $17.xx/day but decided to rent it for 2 more days, or extend my rental, called alamo in huntsville, and was asked to pay almost $70 per day for a total of ~$210. Called in the 800 number, and was told, ~224 total, so over 70 per day, all this because weekly rate versus weekend, was told nothing can be done, but I checked the rental ageeement and found extra day should be ~$42, rental agreement , it doesn't has a clause if applied on weekend or weekly rates, I asked why the contract is not honored, was told can't honor the contract, but have to use the alamo system and the system give a different price.  However I was told that one of the 2 days can be ~$17.xx, which I decided to take it.  Called again 800 number and was able to rented it for 5 more hours for $21 , in that way I could return it on the 4 day.

I was told that my confirmation does nothing matter when it\u2019s a third party reservation. I asked if anyone canceled any reservations because I saw all the cars available outside and she said no, not at this time. She then did not offer any other assistance or information that could help me find another rental option. I was given poor customer service at the desk then I had to call the third party on my own to cancel my reservation and found out that they could not do anything on their end until they confirmed with Avis that I did not in fact pickup a car. Unfortunately due to this situation I am still left without resolution or a refund for money paid toward this reservation. I highly do not recommend using this rental location.

Secondly, they charged me double the amount I was told it would be. Staff is unhelpful at best, really rude at worst. I'd avoid renting from this location if possible.\n\nI had to sit and wait for nearly an hour the morning of my reservation (despite being the only customer there) because they required an obscure insurance documentation \u2014 rather than the standard proof of insurance card in my wallet that, for instance, you'd show a police officer at roadside. It made me an hour late to my destination.\n\nAfter I dropped the car off, I pulled up my receipt online a few weeks later and realized I'd been charged double what they'd told me on the phone. They have a 24-hour policy and will charge you for two days if you don't return the car within 24 hours.

Likewise, I told them when I'd return the car the morning I picked it up, and still no one said it would be a two-day charge. Lastly, when I dropped the vehicle off, no one told me I would be charged for two days.\n\nI called to discuss the two-day charge with the staff and was met with rigidity, interruptions and hostility -- absolutely no care or concern for the issues at hand and, obviously, absolutely no attempts to rectify what I perceived as an intentional misunderstanding meant to charge me for two days instead of for the single-day reservation.\n\nLastly, this is a privately owned location, so any concerns you have cannot be addressed by the broader Hertz company.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1583289040894, "text": "James, thank you for taking the time to leave us a review at Hertz Car Rental.

Now, with every establishment there will be issues.. We can't judge the inner working of an establishment unless we understand the people and the stresses they may endure.. Customer service is not just the company, Customer service is us as customers too...We must treat the staff like we want to be treated...Respectful.\nWith that being said, I, myself have had ups and downs with this location. After getting to know CHRISTIE NOLAND and the Branch Manager MARCUS, I totally understand their position, the company position, and my position as a very frequent customer.\nIf a vehicle is returned by a customer or Company that didn't abide by their lease agreement, I can't service my potential customer with an adequent vehicle. If my location doesn't have fleet of vehicles and present customer haven't returned or extend their rental agreement, I must continue to keep them happy, despite I may have to explain to my future customers the inconvenience of not having their rental ready; even if I reserved the vehicle.\nI believe through my experience with the Tuscaloosa Hertz location, they work extremely hard trying to accommodate from the pleasant to the most outrage customers.\nThat is why I rate them a 10, because they try their best to accommodate everyone even though, they may be limited with vehicles, staff, or support from their Corporate office.\nIn closing, I will say this... Enterprise is individually owned, with a car wash on site, but I know Hertz renders better Customer Service than them, especially here in Tuscaloosa.

I drove it like the safe careful driver I am, filled up the tank, returned it to the location. As I sat in the waiting room, the man inspecting the car says: \"ma'am are you aware a hubcap is missing?\" Of course I'm not aware...because I didn't hit anything. He calls the Toyota Dealership and they quote him $75 to replace it. And I guess I, as a paying customer, am expected to just accept my bad luck, pay it as if I'm made of money, and not say a damn thing. To me, a hubcap should not just pop off with normal driving and, if it does, it's because Enterprise staff have not been seeing to it that the car doesn't have loose parts. When we did the original walk around inspection, I was led to believe that we were looking for physical damage to the car - no more, no less.\n\nManager said I have two options: pay the $75 or file it on insurance. I said there is nothing else that can be done? He said they could call around other places for other estimates but they have a \"special relationship\" and that's probably the best price they could get...so basically no. At that point I was like \"screw it\" and I said we're done with this conversation - and he stormed off. Because I guess that's what managers are supposed to do when a customer is upset. That's what I was...a customer...not a blithering idiot driver that rags out someone else's car because I have no respect for the property of others. I was a customer...but I'm not anymore.\n\nI would advise anyone else renting a car with them to get down in the dirt and make sure the hubcaps are on securely. I didn't do that, Enterprise sure as hell never did (and never will for their customers) and a bill that should have been $52.50 was $134.84.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1526690950169, "text": "Ms. Ankersen, I would be happy to look into this for you.

The office on 3rd Ave in Birmingham, AL has great customer service and Angela is a very valuable asset to the company. My son in law and I picked up our vehicle on Friday 8/3. He rented a Toyota Corolla and I had a Jeep Compass and it was nice and roomy. The only downside of it was the \"A\" ( not sure what it was for, didn't check). When it's on, and you brake, it feels like the car cuts off and when you take your foot off the brake, it  feels like the car cranks up again,  so I was constantly turning it off. But back to the service I received,  the office was just opening and they were crowded.  Angela took her time with each customer and was very polite and at the same time assuring the other customers she will get with them shortly and thanking them for their patience. She was the only one working and she worked diligently with all the customers and kept a smile and great tone!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO59VEg2HU7NqytXlJXwrbnBNNkb-2V-yvskt8W=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bbf2190d019:0x8aac2ca071f15b4"}

This was the worst experience that I have ever had with a company ever. I didn't believe the horror stories until I experienced it myself. Used their truck rental to move to Colorado over the summer. made it 20 minutes out of Birmingham then the truck broke down, took them 4 hours to send someone out to get it fixed. once we got back on the road it broke down again 10 minutes later. After another 5 hours of waiting on the side of the road in 95 degree weather for them to send someone out to \"fix,\" another issue. Also they didn't bring any water we requested for us or my dog who was overheating. So after all that they barely got the truck to run, we got to drive to denver with a blinking check engine light, worst most anxiety inducing drive of my life. This also forced my gf to miss her job interview, thanks budget! Of course we asked for a refund for being placed in a dangerous and horrifying situation. Budget offered less than a 10% refund, a slap in the face after everything we went through. Do not rent with this company!! They will probably respond to this review with some bs response saying how they value their customer experience or something DONT LISTEN. This company will put you or your family in a dangerous situation, leave you and all of your stuff stranded for hours without help, and then not give the slightest bit of care or concern because their reputation is already horrible.
