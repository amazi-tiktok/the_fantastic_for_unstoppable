Now honestly Huntsville, I have met my share of rude people, but I cannot and I will not saying I'll make such a comment towards the two nice ladies who works at Easy Money which is located at 4820 University Drive. I don't understand why their ratings are only 2.7 which is ridiculous! From my personal experience Shenikka and DeDe are the most kind and humble hearted ladies I've met and we've been living here almost one year now. We all know that when you go into an office or business you expect people to become magicians but they work in customer service. And there are some very rude people that can come and expect whatever the situation is it should automatically be okay for them to adjust but it doesn't work that way! You have to be very kind to people if you want them to be kind to you. You have to be humble when you want someone to help you and you would get the same treatment in return. So don't be fooled by this low rating that you see on this Google app because it's not true. These ladies will work with you any kind of way they can and is done without prejudice. So when you go into this store you can ask for either of them and I guarantee you they will be nice, they will be kind, and they will be very understanding of your situation and if they can help you they will. But don't go into the office or any business with a bad attitude oh, because of you bring me a bad attitude you may get one in return depend on the situation. So be very nice and kind to them as you want them to be to you. Don't say something bad about someone just because you had a messed-up situation that could not be fixed so you want to get back at a person by giving them a bad review it doesn't work that way. Be nice and kind and you'll get the same results in return. laser doing a real good job I appreciate you and keep on doing what you doing because you doing good work for this community that's so need you. And if corporate does not appreciate you for the work that you do then maybe they should come and switch places with you to see the type of situation that you deal with everyday because I think you all are doing a hell of a job and from my standpoint from what I see with my own two eyes, keep doing what you doing because your proof in the pudding of good customer service and what it's about. If if corporate does not appreciate you just know that we do parrot God bless you keep up the good work and I'm praying for your safety there it is terrible crisis that we are now in but only temporarily.

They deserve nothing, I went to fill my taxes for the first time as a independent contractor not only did they not tell me I didn't make the threshold to even have to file. They filed my paper work anyway and charged it as the most important form and then took half of my money. 800 they took 400 its important beacuse when I went back to do an amended return that they told me they would do for free. I remember because they had to call corporate and ask what to do. They decided when I went back to charge me a full 175 for something they told me was free. I got upset and left days later when I was forced to retrieve the rest of the amended money I was promised beacuse of other circumstances I gave into my pride and filed not only am I still waiting on my money since January which is unfair. THEY ALSO amended almost a whole 2,000 back from me so yeah I was supposed to have around 2,800 the first time. NOT WORTH IT ALL OF THEM!!. And then when they mess up apparently it's free?????

Parker is the Accountant for my neighborhood's H.O.A. I was relatively new to the neighborhood just buying my home 2 years prior to investigating the H.O.A. I was unable to get any financial information from the only board member so I went to Mr.Parker.\nHis Secertary was so kind and very helpful and I appreciated that. She told me Mr. Parker was not in the office after returning from an office. I asked her some questions and she went back and forth to the same office with answers to the question's. I them saw a man comes from the office leaving and got on the elevator headed down. I know this today to be Mr.Parker, as she walked past the man was wearing a T-SHIRT advertising his business Bryan L. Parker Accounting. I later sent him emails requesting his presence at our Association meeting, I never received a reply.\nI realize that all of this blame doesn't lie solely at Mr.Parkers feet, it lies equally at his feet and that of our Association President's feet. I received contradictory answers for questions I asked. As a homeowner I and my neighbors pay a fee to Mr. Parker and as an employee he should have been able to answer everyone of my questions and he did not. It is my opinion and the opinion of many of my neighbors that Mr. Parker made no effort to assist us with any information at all at several different requests and times.

First of all, whoever was seen walking past, if you were told I was not in the office, was not me. We do not have t-shirts advertising our business so I would question if you were even at our office, since you have inaccurate information. Secondly, we are not employees of the HOA, we are contracted by the HOA board to handle certain accounting functions and provide the board with requested reports. Similar to any business, the reports are disseminated from the top (HOA) to those who need to know. Privacy laws are very strict and we try to adhere to them diligently. If you want more access to information of your HOA, I suggest you become a member of the board. As I understand it, several requests have been made for more board participation but thus far there have been no takers.

Will have ALL my information next time when I have to file next year when I prepare and I thank JH for their promptness and excellent service. Will definitely reccomend if someone asks where's a good tax service to get you taxes done!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2b0763e92705:0xa67a1204aecfcf51"}

Usually I get my taxes done at the base but this year a lot of base services are closed.  Every time I called the legal office all I get is we hope it will be open in February.   I couldn\u2019t wait that due to getting surgery soon so I noticed that a Jackson Hewitt was opening at Dalraida Commons. I always go there to shop at Publix and after looking  at some reviews for H&R Block that are not great I figured I would give this office a shot.\nI was very surprised at how nice the store was and how fast my taxes were done.   Although I was the first active duty member that Destiny took care of she was still thorough and asked a lot of questions.  Even the manager was very helpful and gave me 50 percent off my tax preparation!!  Attention Maxwell and Gunter don\u2019t bother with the base just save the time by seeing Destiny and the staff at this location.

Today 7/28/2020 at around 1:00pm I went in to make a payment and Carl Johnson had a customer and he was rude to the gentleman who was in making a payment also; when it was my turn I went up and advised him I need to make a payment. I also wanted to know why the amount was 100 instead of 80.. I advised Mr. Johnson I just called over the phone, and it had just advised me that it was 80 he rudely replied \u201c because it ain\u2019t got your reinstatement stuff on it that\u2019s 20 dollars\u201d . He proceeded to huff and puff due to me asking him a question so I then asked what was on my policy he ignored my question and went on to say \u201cyour policy ends this month and you just now asking what\u2019s on your policy?\u201d I then advised him it changed from 40 to 60 and needed to know why because I need something very basic... Mr. Johnson then stated LaQuinton messed up my policy by removing features that\u2019s needed and doesn\u2019t know why he did it because I have to have roadside asst. I advised I didn\u2019t need or want it I have it through my phone company he then said I can\u2019t remove it so you gotta pay it. The tone and approach was definitely off with him and I advised him it\u2019s a way to say everything being rude to loyal customers isn\u2019t the way I advised him I come up there every month and have never had any problems with anyone being rude until now and I will be seeking other places to get coverage at. I made the payment that definitely wasn\u2019t a issue I just had questions about my policy but him being rude and nice nasty just did it for me I won\u2019t be renewing in August..

Thought that the matter was resolved after they spoke with Lakesha Greer, but it wasn't. She didn't cancel the policy on that day and she didn't submit a request for my refund either. So, the agent in the office after going back in a 2nd time said she requested the full refund. And now i received a check for only a portion. I had to go back in the local office today. They said they couldn't do anything. I would have to call her boss. This has been exhausting and time consuming. It's been over a month and the issue is still unresolved all bc Lakesha Greer refused to do her job and take care the issue the same day or the next day.
