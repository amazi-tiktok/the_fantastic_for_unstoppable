I felt very much at home as I browsed through their collection of healing crystals, ritual candles & incense, inspirational/motivational art, spiritual & meditation tools, and all sorts of unique trinkets and decorations. The store is filled with interesting products from across the world. There is something here for everyone! The owners even showed me a few of their prized personal possessions which were kept in the back room, making me feel like V.I.P.  The store itself was well kept...which I can only imagine to be a constant struggle considering how many shelves and items must be dusted frequently to maintain the clean environment. Everything sparkles! If you have the chance, ask the owner about the musical vibrations produced by the bronze gong hanging behind the register -- it makes beautiful sounds which fill the space entirely, engulfing it's visitors in a sense of peace and tranquility. This store is just the kind of retail attraction our community needs in this area - Definitely recommend visiting A Coastal Zen as soon as possible!!! Bring more money than you think you will need because you will be surprised how many items will strike your fancy!

I was going came in town to visit for a month after traveling for 3 months straight.  He thought this would be a good idea for me to relax.  When I received the groupon via email,  I called to schedule an appointment (as suggested on the voucher) but I just got the voicemail.  I called a few times over the next couple days because I actually wanted to talk to a person.  But after no response, I followed the instructions from the voicemail, which was to go online to check availability.  Only to find out that the next available day was in September 2017 (4 months later).  I immediately tried to call groupon to get a refund, because I definitely didn't want to wait 4 months for a massage.  However, Groupon was not able to refund me because it was day 4 since he purchased the Groupon.  They have a policy of a 3 day return.  They were not understanding and didn't care to hear my story.  I decided to try calling LeAnne again, but of course there was no answer.  I left numerous messages and she finally called my back 3 days later.  When she called, my intent was to explain my story to her and advise her I would be there for the next month to see if she could squeeze me in anytime within the next few weeks.  She said rudely said she couldn't and advise me to tell my boyfriend to give the groupon to someone else to use.  I made a suggestion to her to possibly disable her Groupon option until she's caught up, because I'm sure I am not the only potential long term customer with the issue.  She proceeded to rudely yell and tell me that she's backed up because of Mother's day and she doesn't need anyone telling her how to run her business.  Ironically this is the same place I purchased a Groupon for my boyfriend (with a different person) and he had a great experience.  Which is why he decided to do the same for me.  At the end of the day I will never give this place my money again and I will tell everyone I can the same.  My boyfriend basically, gave away money.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1499299292810, "text": "I am sorry that this person feels this way. I do stay booked out anywhere from 10-14 weeks in general for new clients.  I called the person back as soon as she left a voicemail. I explained to her that if she calls and doesn't leave a voicemail that we don't know someone has called. The client wanted to know about how much money I make and I did tell her it was none of her business as it was also none of her business my relationship with Groupon which stands at 4.7 stars out of 5. I am sorry she feels this is rude, but I find it extremely rude for a stranger to try and tell me how to run my business. As a self employed person not having an opening 2-3 months out  means that I am employed, and that is a good thing. Groupon helps bring new clients in that I hope will become regular clients. I stay booked and I can't fit someone in because they are only going to be in town for a short time that just is what it is. That wouldn't be fair to all the people who wait the standard time for the great deal that Groupon is and I have done over 1500 Groupon massages in the last 3+ years. The person  begins the complaint by saying she was only going to be in town for a month and then talks about how she wouldn't be coming back. If she is only visiting for a short time it sounds like she wouldn't be coming back anyway. I find that most people who leave bad reviews it is because they couldn't bully their way into getting their way and try and get me breaking tmy best practices and rules. The fine print of the Groupn says by availability only. My schedule is online for the whole world to see. The lady wanted me to give her a refund and I told her no bc she didn't buy anything from me she bought a product from Groupon and I do not get all the money from the product. The woman then started asking how much I make  and that was when I told her it was none of her business which it wasn't. Being a therapist who is booked out means I am good at what I do. Groupon is to bring in new clients, not for your next day massage. I tried to help her and offer suggestions but she just wanted to be mad."}, "gmap_id": "0x888c297d793fa07b:0x75b689bc0f9acea4"}

I bought a Groupon deal for two hour long massages. The first one was great but the second one never happened because LeAnne decided to \"leave and go run errands\" because I was 10 minutes late. Even though I called the business and left a message saying I was on my way, LeAnne informed me it is her normal practice to immediately leave the building and run errands if a client is not on time. She then told me I should have called her cell phone (which is not listed on the website or business door) instead of the business number.\n\nI have never heard of such! If I have ever been late for a massage anywhere else, the therapist would simply subtract that time away from my appointment. I had taken off work to make this appointment, since this location doesn't offer hours that are convenient to people who work a 9-5 job. It's clear that customer service is not valued here so I will not spend my money at this place again.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1487023681813, "text": "I wish to state that this client was a repeat client. She had been told upon her first visit to Peaceful Solutions that the office phone was just used to collect voicemails and given a business card with the cell phone number on it. The day in question I waited on the client for 20 minutes including calling the number given. The client did not show up. When a client is 20, not 10 minutes late it is my policy to consider them a no show. This was the second of a 2 massage Groupon deal, and the client states she got a great massage the first time. To give me 1 star because I upheld the company policy of not giving away free massages when people do not follow instructions is her prerogative, but she is the one missing out on great massages, and as for our hours of operation, I am a massage therapist of 20 years experience so no I don't work late or on the weekend, I work 9-5 like most working people because I too have a family to take care of.
