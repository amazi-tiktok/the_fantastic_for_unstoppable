I contracted out 60 hours every week for caregiving and I took the other 128 hours myself.\n\nI contracted with BrightStar based on recommendations from friends, and I was not disappointed.   BrightStar provided qualified care givers, and if mom and/or did not relate well with a particular care giver, BrightStar would provide a different one.  We eventually evolved to a core set of 2 regular care givers, loved by my mom and I,  covering all 60 hours per week.  I don\u2019t know if other companies would be this flexible and supportive.  If a regular caregiver could not come, BrightStar would notify me and fill the gap, so that I could always count on a caregiver at my home at the planned schedule.  Knowing that a caregiver will be there, rain or shine, is a major consideration when determining if you want to hire a known private individual or a company with lots of caregivers.  Additionally, BrightStar schedulers, nurse, business office personnel were always a pleasure to work with and very supportive of mom and I during these trying time.  BrightStar may not be the cheapest, but you can count on them, so you just set your hours to what you can afford.  I highly recommend BrightStar, and if the need for caregiving arises for me in the future, I will be calling them.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862691000000001:0x6ce406a91cbe1e64"}

You get to pick your schedule but the pay is only 8 dollars which is below minimum wage. Im a retired Air Force cop, so the pay wasnt really an issue for me. I wanted the experience since I am majoring in Nursing and I wanted to get a start in the healthcare career field. During my time, the clients were all sweethearts and I enjoyed them. They were the best part of my day. It really hurt quitting because I just love the clients and that is why I stayed. Well, some improvements for the company is as follows: better training, pay for the training, and raise the pay. When I first got to my orientation I asked how many employees they have? I was told over 100, but looking at their open shifts this company turn over rate is high and they dont have enough employees that care. They would send out available shifts but on the app employees had to use for myself  it wouldn't  show that I had available open shifts. The time off that I requested was always for VA (veterans affairs) appointments so my call in's where emergency only. I was always on time with all clients and I gave every client the best treatment, companion care, and respect.\nI dislike the company policies with COVID.  I was schedule to go into the office to do some training. I schedule this on my own because I knew that youtube videos couldnt get me by. I needed hands on training. They lack training. When I confirmed with my boss the time to come in for training I was told by my boss that they are not allowing people to come to the office. She sounded really sick on the phone so I couldnt give you a honest reason why they told employees to stay away. If i had to guess covid. I had called into work last minute for a car issue which i got reprimanded and the second issue was because i needed to make sure a relative didnt have covid because i was around them. I got written up and they told me they would fire me if I called in again. Well. I had to call in again because of covid symptoms. I told the boss if covid symptoms is not a valid excuse for calling into work, then i cant work there. I care about the clients health and if it takes me quitting to protect them I had to. You should not send employees to work or threatened them with termination. Im a hard worker so its really sad to see great people like myself to quit. Lastly, is the driving. I would drive about an 1 hour to get to a clients house. Like i said before I loved the job and I know some caregivers dont do right. They dont clean or take care of the clients like they should. So I stayed because there is not enough good in this work place. All in all it was the company saying I have one more call in and they have to fire me. If im sick i cant be around the elderly. They are vulnerable. They need to rethink their procedures.\n\nNow i dont get unemployment, i cant qualify because i receive the Post 9/11 bill money for school. I cant receive unemployment because i am in school and veterans are not allowed to double dip. Meaning i cant get free money from the Post 9/11 bill and money from unemployment. Like i said before i work because I care.\n\nOn a positive these are quotes I picked up:\n\nThe price you pay for the job you have\n\nCold hands, warm heart, dirty sweetheart\n\nKeshia", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1603139866776, "text": "Keshia, we also enjoyed you working for Senior Helpers. We were very proud to have a veteran join our team. The Federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. We do pay our employees this for training pay ONLY but once you complete the hiring process and start working with our clients you receive the wage that was discussed during your interview. We do not have a single employee that is working for less than $8.50 an hour. I pulled your check stubs to make sure we did not make a mistake on your pay while you were employed with Senior Helpers and we did not, if you would like  confirmation on your check stubs we would be happy to provide that information to you please just give us a call at our Senior Helpers office (256)650-2982.\nWhen you started working with Senior Helpers we were shorter staffed due to the pandemic and caregivers quitting without notice or calling in for shifts last minute (without COVID-19 symptoms or being in contact with someone who had COVID-19).\nI am sorry you felt we lacked training. We have an entire room in our office dedicated to hands on training that you sat in during our orientation. This training room includes: a medical manikin, hospital bed, shower, shower chair, walker, wheel chair, cane, gait belt, slide board, Hoyer lift, a change of sheets to learn to change an occupied bed, \u2018depends\u2019 to practice changing and bathing clients, bed side commode to practice safely transferring clients and more are available to any caregiver who would like additional training to come and schedule a time to practice. We just ask you schedule your time in advance to ensure we have sanitized all materials and your supervisor is available to assist you.\nAs for our COVID-19 policy that you signed and received a copy of in orientation; we ask if you have been exposed or have any COVID-19 symptoms to call the office and we will send you to the nearest clinic to get tested immediately. Your supervisor actually responded to you when you called out with COVID-19 symptoms, \u201cOf course COVID is an acceptable excuse. And are you going to get tested today? If so just send me the paperwork and it will excuse you.\u201d You told us you were going to get tested but you were going to pass on coming back to work for Senior Helpers because you did not like the call-in policy. We respected your decision and removed you from the schedule and just asked as a courtesy for our clients to let us know your COVID-19 test results so we can update them if they need to be tested in the event you tested positive. You responded stating you do not have COVID-19 and have not been exposed therefore they do not need to be tested.\nDuring your interview you agreed to drive up to 30 miles to a client\u2019s home. The furthest you were asked to drive to a client was 25.7 miles and this was not your regular client.\nWe thought you were a great a caregiver to our clients in the short time you worked for Senior Helpers and you are right, you did truly care for your clients which we greatly appreciated. I am sorry you felt the need to quit from a misunderstanding you may have had with the attendance policy. We wish you nothing but the best in the future for your nursing career. And if you have any other concerns, we hope you will please call us at our office (256)650-2982 and we will be happy to address this with you."}, "gmap_id": "0x886212cefb240ae1:0xf5f9c3acb77b2f17"}
