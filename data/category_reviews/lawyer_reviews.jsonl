Remain silent when arrested ( always) and wait on the man to do his job . I know half dozen people that would be sitting out long prison sentences . M y brother faced 25 to life he did 2 years in the county jail waiting on the grand jury . Thanks to Mr. Bote my brother got time served and was set free . The 2 years in the county sucked but vs 25 to life it was nothing Richard also he gave us free advice that saved my family over 10 dollars on a properpty suit . He is by far the best attorney in this state . Sadly i know this through trial and error with other lawyers .", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b9063d4869b:0x9463caa5d9aaf877"}
