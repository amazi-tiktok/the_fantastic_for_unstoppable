It was amazing to hear him talk about the different waxes and the science behind it.\n\nThe workshop costs about the price of 3 of Bath and Body Works 3-wick candles - you get 2 candles that you made with your own hands (and you can personalize the strength of the scent or mix them together), you get the experience of creating the candle (in a cool atmosphere with complimentary beer/wine for 21+) AND for possibly the coolest part - you are supporting someone local who has a dream.\n\nHe mentioned several times how the growth of his business makes him feel alive and terrified everyday in the best way - and I personally feel very lucky to have been able to be apart of that support for him both through the purchase of my candles and their workshop.\n\nThey are launching a new brand soon called Bungalow Bungalow and I can't wait to see what they have in store.

However...the Jones Valley stop CSR's had been polite & answered questions...but wouldn't help gather my large quantity of items. I had to gather, lift, & carry them.\nFollowing Spine & Hip injections, this was strain to my back & painful. Afterwards, I struggled walking. The associate permitted me to use their plastic cart. After leaving, I was complaining to myself, as I crossed the street to my car. A lady, carrying Bath & Body bag, crossed as well. I commented about the associates at the store being lazy.\nAs that person went on. I loaded my things & was leaving the cart on the grass.  The lady in the parking area yelled & demanded I return the cart. I didn't fully understand. So, I asked again what she said. She made her demand on me about 3 times.\nI asked her if she worked there? She said yes.  I asked if she was a Manager? She said Yes!\nI tried to tell her about the laziness I was dealing with.\nShe became irritated with me. No peaceful problem solving was enacted.\nShe came hurriedly at me. I asked her to stop. I warned her, she was crossing the line.  She came anyways, within inches of me, calling me lazy, grabbed my cart without my permission, & proceeded to the store, being loud, calling me lazy repeatedly, & told me to never step foot in her store again!\nShe definitely broke the Covid rules, & came to close to me besides, causes me to feel uncomfortable.\nI requested the 911 service & filed a report.\nThe Manager, should have been more professional.  She ordered me to never come back & she don't have to worry.  I don't want to!!!\nAll I can say is remember when shopping at the Jones Valley location, to take help for you, because they are not much help.  And watch out for the Quick Tempered Manager.\nIt's 4 AM & my Spine & hip still hurt.  This  is a shame!\n\ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude22", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886212f8e5fc55d1:0x41fd5fd6c66ffcef"}
