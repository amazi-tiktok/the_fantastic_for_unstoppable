You can even call the business directly and their hold messages promise top quality craftsmenship. We told them the day we bought it that we were purchasing this to pay floor, put walls, heating and air, and create an apartment type space for my son. We were reassured and \u201csold\u201d on the quality promised and the guarantee of it they stood by with their warranty. Since buying the building for $10,000 cash 3 yrs ago, we have had two leaking doors everytime it rains for 3 straight yrs. we have utilized the warranty each time. After the 4th or 5th time of having them try and fix it (we were promised a FIX not an attempt at a fix) we said we wanted our money back. We cannot lay floor over wet floor to be ruined. The entire operation has been halted for three whole YEARS waiting on this promised fixed. We were told to give them one more chance by completely replacing the inward swinging doors with outward swinging doors. If they did not fix it, they promised they would discuss with me a possible refund or partial refund. Even a 50% refund would allow us to have a porch made. At this point however, a 50% refund keeps me connected to a crooked company. They replaced the doors and the next rain came and it was still leaking. We took pictures each time of course. So I called in about the promised conversation about a refund. I was transferred to a lady who took my number and would call me back, and I never heard from her. In the mean time they were sending out (same repair man each time) the repair man to \u201cfix\u201d it for the 5th ish time. So he did, well I just went out there and it\u2019s a soggy soaking wet mess again. This will be the SECOND time since what they called their \u201clast resort\u201d by replacing the doors. They basically told me if that didn\u2019t fix it nothing would. So I have a 10,000 box in my yard. Even the mattresses we placed out there are now ruined from the leaking doors and had to be thrown away. I\u2019m unable to use it. I called again today and they wanted to come \u201cfix\u201d it even tho they told me they had done everything they can. These floors in my opinion need to be replaced now by the doors if they\u2019re going to keep it leaking. I didn\u2019t pay for floors exposed to rain for 3 solid yrs. I asked again anout a refund and was told because the building is as old as it is, they can\u2019t do anything about it. Well, it\u2019s only as old as it is because they kept telling me they\u2019d fix it. I\u2019ve been kind and patient for 3 YRS! If they can\u2019t stand by their written warranty statement to fix and REPAIR (not bandaid) the issue of THEIR building THEY built, the I deserve a refund! When you buy a car and the engine blows each time it\u2019s replaced, you get another car under a warranty or a refund. It\u2019s called a lemon at some point. They\u2019re refuse to work with me.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889c9e2e7679e99:0xd3031e9ff6035b08"}

This is a good example of why \"you should never judge a book by its cover\". I told my wife just by looking at the buildings they have there they probably want a fortune but when we stopped by and actually took the time to go in and talk to the owners we found the EXACT opposite. Absolutely nice ,friendly people. And I doubt if you will find a shed or building anywhere around that's gonna be of such quality for so little money. If you are in the market for a shed, storage building or whatever I highly recommend suddenly structure's on highway 22!!!! These are some of the 2 sweetest, caring, people I ever met in my life!!
