Upon completion there were gaps in the flooring, my moldings were not put back, I requested they build my floors up to be an even transition between the tiles and wood flooring which they did not, the columns in my house were not accounted for when they did their measurements and the transitions between the floors were not properly laid so they continuously shifted and came loose. After two years of fighting to get these things fixed, it was finally somewhat decent. But the gaps between the flooring became an issue and soon started to separate and pull up. They came out and looked at the flooring in 2018 and agreed to lay new flooring for me, I picked out my new flooring bc the design I had previously ordered was no longer available. Apparently the new floor I picked was back ordered so it took months to come in, and once it did I was not notified, so I had to call and call to get my installation set up. Needless to say, there were more issues and as of right now, I still do not have the transition from my kitchen into my dining room bc the installer said that someone else would be handling that and when I called that person they laughed and said that was incorrect and now noone will answer my calls.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88927c2e3ef6ef9f:0x475f563410758375"}

Let me look at our schedule and I will get someone back out there to check it out ASAP\".\nThe company scheduled an appointment for Sunday March 3rd to look at the leak. A storm came through the area on the day they were scheduled and I understand it would not have been possible for them to come out.

The lady at the store (Jennifer) that we dealt with was very helpful in picking out the flooring that would work best for our unit. We were very pleased with that part of the process, but installation was a different story.  We realize that with putting down tile, there will be some level of dust involved (with the amount of the dust that was still in the unit a week later, it looked like the tile was actually cut inside the unit \u2013 which they vehemently denied), and a good cleaning required once they\u2019re finished.  The floor installer that they used on our unit made no attempt to cover any electronic equipment or furniture \u2013 there was so much dust in the unit that a week after the installation had been completed, and three full days after the deep clean company had been cleaning, it still looked like a construction zone.  There was so much dust floating around the unit that the A/C filter had to be changed out 3 times during the 2-week period following completion of the installation.  The quarter round that was installed (that we paid extra for) had gaps of several feet with no nail in it to secure it to the baseboard, as well as big cracks between the baseboard and quarter round \u2013 not a good look.\nSince we live several hours away, and since our rental management company deals with floor installations on a fairly regular basis, we asked the mgmt company to discuss the issues with Gene\u2019s, due to the additional cleaning (2 separate deep cleans) that were required, having to clean the coils on all the appliances, in addition to a few things that the installers broke that were in our unit. I also talked to Gene\u2019s to see if they would help to pay for a portion of the additional costs that were incurred as a result of the \u201cdamage\u201d that was done, but neither of us were successful.  I think the flooring looks good, but I was extremely disappointed in the dealings that we had with Gene\u2019s Flooring after the initial selection of the flooring.\nI would highly recommend finding a different flooring company, especially if you\u2019re having ceramic or porcelain tile installed!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0538b8c76e89:0xe9b58b7b792616d0"}

The carpet was installed as scheduled and went according to plan. Unfortunately, the laminate install was not as seamless. When Steven and his crew started laying the flooring Steven noticed that the laminate was milled wrong at the factory and was slightly bowed. Steven stopped the install immediately and showed my husband his concern. He advised that he could finish the install but it probably wouldn\u2019t last a year due to pressure points. Our other option was to have the flooring returned and try again. We chose the latter as we were putting our rental on the market and wanted the job done right. I was so thankful that Steven was open and honest. We weren\u2019t just another work order and he wanted the job done right. He knew this was a rental and that before the problems arose the house would no longer be our problem. He could have kept quiet, installed the flooring and moved on but he didn\u2019t.\n\nI also want to add that I was coordinating all of this from California and Keller was great at communicating. Joe and Tracy new my case and made it easy to schedule from afar.\n\nI highly recommend Keller Interiors. I have already recommended them to my realtor in the Madison County area to use with future clients.
