The store is filled with interesting products from across the world. There is something here for everyone! The owners even showed me a few of their prized personal possessions which were kept in the back room, making me feel like V.I.P.  The store itself was well kept...which I can only imagine to be a constant struggle considering how many shelves and items must be dusted frequently to maintain the clean environment. Everything sparkles! If you have the chance, ask the owner about the musical vibrations produced by the bronze gong hanging behind the register -- it makes beautiful sounds which fill the space entirely, engulfing it's visitors in a sense of peace and tranquility. This store is just the kind of retail attraction our community needs in this area - Definitely recommend visiting A Coastal Zen as soon as possible!!! Bring more money than you think you will need because you will be surprised how many items will strike your fancy!

My wife and I are not in Auburn so we chose this company to deliver an arrangement for Valentines Day for my mother-in-law in Opelika. We ordered a higher dollar item other than the lower priced special. Specifically for the reason of having more fruit and less chocolate as we were hoping for something a bit healthier because of health issues. They charged our credit card for the higher priced item we ordered but delivered the lower price special with added chocolate and it was a smaller item. In addition to the wrong item - they did not deliver it on Valentines Day. We called several times and they acted nice at first and promised to deliver the item the next day. Late in the day mom called and said it was never delivered. We called back and it was being delivered late in the day - a day late - and it was the wrong item, not the higher priced one we paid for.\n\nWe called again and one of the employees admitted they went to the wrong house on Valentines day so somebody got the higher priced item. My wife called again to at least get a refund for the overcharged amount or to have the right item delivered. We were promised the right item would be delivered. The next day, no delivery.\n\nAt this point, several days after Valentines Day my wife gave up so I started calling, was promised a refund or a deliver of the right item. There was no refund or proper delivery. I was then promised at least a call back from the owner, then another promise, another promised call back. I never heard back.\n\nMy mother in law never received the correct item and and we never got the refund. We finally tried to cancel payment with credit card and to get a refund but they disputed it - said that the item was delivered. Did not mention that it was the wrong item, and that it was late, missing Valentines Day. I'm sorry that they delivered the item, possibly twice, to the wrong house, and then the wrong item to the right address. That's three deliveries, three trips, three items. However, those mistakes are not our fault. All I know is that my mother in law never received what was ordered.\n\nI would not recommend this company to another person.\n\nI would probably have written a different review if the owner would have called me back as promised by the several employees.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2ce2392dbe3:0xba2152bd50d19c00"}

I feel that I should be able to pick out  a picture of the flowers and container that I would like to purchase, pay for it, and have it delivered. When I order an item, let's say a new chair,  I can see a photo of the  chair and know what I am paying for ,and when it arrives it should be the chair I ordered. I don't like paying for something that is NOT what I ordered. While I understand fresh flowers may need to be substituted the arrangement should resemble the photo. Flowers should be similar and the container should be exact.  A container should not be in a photo on the website if it is not \" in stock\". This is false advertising. Each individual florist probably doesn't have what is pictured on the Teleflora websites.\nI called the florist and expressed my concern and followed up with an email with pictures of what I ordered and what was delivered.  I ordered a beautiful sturdy white wicker basket with flowers and what I got was a cheap multicolored Easter egg basket. They substituted the basket and after I complained they were willing to offer me a credit of $2.50. What a joke!  I will not use this florist in the future for any reason and will never use a site that is managed by Teleflora. My thoughts are that the Teleflora company has way too many florist and they do not know what each flower shop has in stock. So when you order from a site like this one, you NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO GET. BEWARE. I wish I could put a photo on this commentary. I paid $45.73 for something that was NOT what I ordered.  Here is the response from the florist:\n\nThank you for your recent order. We pride ourselves on delivering the best, most fresh and most similar arrangements that we can for our customers and we have been doing so for over 38 year in the Shoals area! I am very glad you were pleased with the flowers that we provided for you and your mother.\n\nIn response to your recent request for a 50% refund here is our answer:\nThe basket chosen was unavailable and a similar value was substitute per our substitution policy.\nWe were also instructed to call and leave on the front porch if no one was available. Which we did. Our standard policy is to call and if there is no response, and no one is home, we leave a message as to where the flowers are. Since we were instructed, by you, to leave them, they were; only after a phone call was made. Had you not told us to leave the arrangement, and weather was not good for our arrangement, we would have left a message detailing where the arrangement could be picked up.\nAlso, you did not order from a 3rd party person. You placed your order on our website, which is managed and updated by Teleflora. They are our wire service and website managing team. They have thousands of florists that they service and we all obviously have different items in stock. They do a generic picture, and when a picture is chosen we try to fill the order as best we can with the flowers we have on hand at that particular time. Flowers are very seasonal and have a high turnover because of spoilage. Next time, a  call directly to the florist could save you a substitution since you would know immediately what they had available at that time.\n\nAs far as using another florist, they would offer the same substitution policy as us, so I don't know that you would've been happier.\n\nSince you were happy with the flowers provided in the arrangement and they were Pretty and Fresh I can NOT offer you a 1/2 refund of the product, being as though you were please with it. I will however refund you the \"basket\" charge since you were not pleased with the substitution chosen. I will be adding a refund of the Full container charge of $2.50 to your card. I hope this helps.\nThank you for your business.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d4eb6ed4ce74d:0xf4773df3daae3fbb"}

I have had a sorted history with this watch over the years with other jewelers in TN who have gouged me and taken upwards of six months to complete a job so now that I am a local here I wasn't sure what to expect from my local jeweler. Well these guys did a quick turnaround at a very reasonable price and not only replaced the stem but my  watch was so clean and polished that I did a double take because, at first, I thought they had given me a brand new watch by mistake. Nope, it is my watch and I could not have been happier.\n\nNow as for the business, they have a wonderful selection of what you expect. Rings, watches, bracelets, earrings, etc. but they also have beautiful local artist pieces that are absolute stunning from inexpensive ocean themed pieces to a gorgeous diamond piece we just saw that range in prices into the thousands. They also buy gold and make custom pieces of your own design right in house.\n\nWe're here to yesterday to get my watch band repaired and they did it in minutes at no charge! That brings me to just how friendly, professional and all around terrific that everyone here, that I've encountered, are.

She lives in the condo complex where we were renting for the week. So I asked her if she could recommend a nice place to eat and if she knew of a good jeweler. She right away told us of some places to eat, then she called her jeweler friend Glenn Manning and got me an appt with him. She told me that Manning Jewelers\u2019s has been in business for over 70 yrs. and how awesome everyone there is. And she was so right about that. And she showed me her beautiful ring that Glenn made for her.\nGlenn took my old wedding and turned it into the most beautiful wedding ring I\u2019ve ever seen. My husband and I were celebrating our 35th wedding anniversary in Gulf Shores. Because our trip to St Lucia was canceled due to Covid! And we had been planning to make some changes with my ring anyway, so this was the best time for us to do that. I believe God puts people in our life path for a reason. So meeting Pepper, then meeting Glenn was a huge blessing for us.\nMy husband was very impressed how Glenn designed my ring on his computer then made a resin ring to hold my stones so I could see how it would look and feel on my finger. I wanted to use my existing center stone as a side stone to represent our past 35 yrs of marriage, then added a new larger center stone for the present, and another side stone to match for the future. Then we decided to add a two sided ring guard using my existing ring guard diamonds. So not only did Glenn design a beautiful ring for me, he also saved us a lot of money. And he recommended a great company to insure my new ring with, which had a better price than our home owners insurance co.\nI was very nervous about having my new ring shipped to me once it was done, just a few short weeks later, but Glenn put my mind at ease letting me know it will be insured and it came over night at my convenience. The whole process was Awesome! As well as the entire staff at Manning Jewelers. So if your heading to Gulf Shores, Al, or just looking for an Amazing  jeweler in that area, be sure to look up Manning Jewelers in Foley, Al. They are worth the drive from anywhere.\nWe also bought a really nice \u201cflip flop\u201d neck less for our daughter while we were in Manning\u2019s  and she loves it. Plus Manning Jewelers\u2019s also has a beautiful pendant called Stray Love that Glenn designed himself and he donates 20% of each sale to their foundation to help save stray animals. Best company to work with for all your jewelry needs.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1598110336782, "text": "Wow! Thank you Dena!

Whenever a jeweler sizes a ring, they then have to follow up on their work by checking each individual stone and tightening it, which can become very labor intensive when you are dealing with rings that have a large number of tightly spaced stones down the shoulder and onto the shank.  When it's all said and done, our objective is to make sure that when you get your ring back, you can wear it with full confidence that everything will remain where it belongs, from the ring on your finger down to the smallest stone on the shank.\n\nAgain, thank you so much, and I hope that helps clarify our policies a bit for you!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888dd4d29378307f:0x3fa4cd5e97e0d99d"}

Jessica, the store Manager, was INCREDIBLE.  I had dreaded walking in and she immediately made us feel at home. The reason I am leaving a review is because not only was the man claiming a dispute with his credit company in there and behaving like an absolute juvenile, I fully believe the call she received from who I gathered (from eavesdropping tbh) was corporate was in regards to the man on here complaining about \"an order.\" First of all, I am a retail manager as well. If I gave a return on a machine we sent somewhere for maintenance I would lose my job.  The man acted like a baby, and my husband was irate that a grown man should behave that way. The manager, though, was nothing less than professional,  and dealt with it better than I would have for sure! Secondly,  when I listened to her phone conversation about pendant man,  Jessica said more than once but shouldn't we do something for him, they hadn't found out if they could yet (or something like that.) All I thought that day was wow, people are so rude, and it's not even their fault. I never thought I would recommend the Decatur store, but 100% I recommend to everyone! The staff is nice, I actually trust them for once, and the manager Jessica is clearly willing to go above and beyond to try to help you even when you act like a total jerk to her.

Two days later I called and again asked for Cristy by name. The girl came back to the phone and said Cristy did not call me back because Gary knew about my account, not her. She didn't take my call. We did not have a ring on the wedding date, we couldn't even talk to anybody who knew the status. I finally received the ring, well past the wedding date, about twice as long as Gary told me it would take. Gary repeatedly blamed the shop for not having or knowing about my ring. When I picked up the ring I told Gary they dropped the ball and I felt like they should adjust the price of the ring - or do something to make it right. Gary looked me in the eyes and told me \"I will go to bat for you\" in regards to making it right, he said he would contact me in a few days. After a month I called Gary back today to ask for his district managers number, in hopes of finally getting a resolution. Gary said to me, \"I thought we were done when you picked up your ring\".

I took my engagement ring in for its 6 month checkup and to go down a quarter of a size. They told me to come back in two weeks and it will be here. So two weeks later we go in to get it and it\u2019s been ruined when they went to go down a half a size. Had a huge gash in it, popped out two big diamonds and a diamond on the side. We were heartbroken, they also told us that it was a discontinued ring so they couldn\u2019t reorder another ring and to pick another ring. So I spent a couple days looking and just couldn\u2019t find any ring that I liked. So I ended up going to the Kay\u2019s in bridgestreet and instantly falling in love with one. Told them the situation and they were so shocked. They said they had never had a ring be sent off and be ruined at their store. They told me to tell Decatur which one I wanted and they could have it ordered. So my fianc\u00e9 called Decatur asking if they could have it in my size and ordered and the girl said absolutely you can, come tomorrow and we will have it all ready for you. Well we go the next day and the girls calling all these places just to come back to me to say we can\u2019t get your ring in a size for you so pick another ring. I was so upset. They ruined my ring, then told me the night before they could just to have me go all the way to the store to tell me no they can\u2019t pick another one. I was so angry I ended up leaving. I later in the week went back to the bridestreet and they were so shocked with Decatur\u2019s performance to us, they said we can absolutely get you the ring you want in the size you need and they were confused why Decatur told us we couldn\u2019t. They told us to go into Decatur, get our ring and walk out and call customer service. So we did and the store manager himself fixed us up at bridgestreet with the ring we wanted, plus the band, the size we wanted, and ensured us it would be in two weeks in time for engagement pictures. Yesterday my ring came in, it\u2019s absolutely perfect!! It just goes to show Decatur is very unprofessional, their workers are unskilled and the store manager not once came to handle the situation or talked to us about it even when we were two feet away from her.

I can understand being busy with other customers or not realizing someone had walked in but 2 separate employees had walked past me and didn\u2019t even acknowledge my presence. By the time an associate did assist me I was very bothered but they didn\u2019t seem to want to assist someone that was \u201cjust looking\u201d. The person seemed highly irritated once I told him I was just looking for a promise ring my boyfriend is buying for me. 10/10 do not recommend this store and will only be shopping at Zales or Jared\u2019s form now on.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889221402e1fc1d:0x2dea3497b2214921"}

April and Christie went above and beyond with their customer service to help me with my issue and ensure all my needs were met. I had to get my wedding ring cleaned and repaired as a diamond had fell out. I sent the pieces of jewelry off mid-March and was expecting them back around early-April. My jewelry ticket consisted of one diamond in my band to be replaced, the three separate pieces sautered together, and the final ring cleaned. Upon mid-April, I did not hear from the store on the status of my ring so my husband and I went to the store in person to get an update. Ms. April informed me that the ring was being held because they wanted to make sure that I was okay with how the ring would potentially come out and discuss any pitfalls. I was informed there would be a potential gap in the ring once the pieces were sautered together. Upon me giving the okay, the ring was supposedly sent to be fixed and I continued to wait patiently. During that time, Ms. April helped me find two other LeVian rings that were on sale and that were absolutely gorgeous and suitable to wear at my job. I decided that once my other rings came back, I would get the two new rings resized for my finger. Coming into the first week of May, I discovered my ring was still not back and at this point I was getting very flustered. Ms. Christie spoke with me and ensured that she would get my ring repaired and back to me quickly and had apologized for the long wait. She personally made sure to let the jeweler know to expedite the process. When my ring finally did arrive back, the middle stone of the main ring was still cloudy, there was black residue on the ring bands, the ring was resized even smaller than my finger, and the same diamond was missing when it was presented to me. At this point I was livid, upset, and refused to do any more business with Kay Jewelers. Despite my ordeal, Ms. April and Ms. Christie showed me the greatest empathy for my situation. I was given a comforting and sorrowful hug from Ms. April. Ms. Christie personally took my ring to the jeweler and stayed with it until it was complete so that I would have the ring that same day and not have to wait any longer then I already had. In addition, she ensured that the other two rings that I recently purchased was resized that say day and back on my hand. These ladies truly exemplify the highest standard for customer service. My frustration and anger was not toward these two ladies but toward the poor service I received from the people repairing my ring. Now I do not take my ring off. Each ring or necklace I get from Kay\u2019s is not just a piece of jewelry, but it is a story of my life. With these ladies understanding that, they will continue to earn my business from here on out.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889221402e1fc1d:0x2dea3497b2214921"}

About a month after receiving the ring, it became apparent to me that the main stone was loose (it was not only wiggly and I could feel it, but it was actually rattling audibly). From being loose there was dust/dirt trapped between the stone and the basket of the stone. Keep in mind I had not been wearing it daily so it was surprising it came loose after such a short period of time.\n\nI brought the ring to the foley Zales to have the sterling silver prongs tightened and the basket cleaned. The rep there said since it wasn\u2019t purchased with warranty I had to pay out of pocket for both the cleaning and repair. It would cost $90.00. (Almost as much as the gift itself, but I couldn\u2019t do anything about the fact it hadnt been purchased without a warranty and I wasn\u2019t going to call up the person who gave it to because that would be rude).\n\nWhen I picked up the ring I was ready to pay for services done, except the moment my hands touched it I knew it was still loose. I showed the representatives behind the counter and they swore up and down to me that it wasn\u2019t loose and it was my imagination. They wiggled it and one even got her pen ink on it trying to \u201cdisprove\u201d me.\n\nThey said they could send it back free of charge so I said ok. But I got a bad feeling and since it had become a sentimental gift I felt like I no longer trusted that store to handle it since I felt like they were lying to me about it not being loose. I asked them for it back and they said yes but they would have to charge me the $90.00. I didn\u2019t want to have a confrontation with them so I paid and figured maybe I should just get a second opinion because it very well could be my imagination.\n\nShe swipes my card and is packing it up and I said \u201cI hear it rattling, tell me you can\u2019t hear that! Call me crazy, It can\u2019t be my imagination!\u201d\n\nShe held it up to her ear and to my surprise said \u201cyes! I do hear it rattling. You\u2019re not crazy\u201d.\n\nIm dumbfounded!! Before I paid, she said it wasn\u2019t loose, lied to my face, then the moment I swiped my card, she acknowledged it was loose!!! I am appalled. I\u2019m just going to dispute the transaction with my bank now because there is no way I trust the people working there. And I\u2019m going to advise the person who purchased it for me to do the same. I won\u2019t be making any purchases from jewelry stores like this again. I learned the hard way, at least this time it was only $90 instead of $900", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0e3378b63149:0x38a08331cfe85986"}

Went to Kays about a week & a half ago to look and purchase an engagement ring with my fiance. Starting looking at rings in our budget and was only shown 1 ring which I loved (& the girl who showed us the ring got kinda in trouble for showing it to us) until they said they were having a diamond show & started showing me rings from those cases, apparently they only have a diamond show every so often and I was shown about 3 rings or so from those cases & ended up picking one of the 3 after being felt like those were the only ones in our budget and  I was pressured into it. We were able to get the ring sized that day & take it home.\n\nSkip to week or so later, I decided to just browse online at rings that were in our budget & that said available in store at my local store. Came across several beautiful rings that I was NEVER shown to begin with so I decided to call and speak with the manager who helped us & told her about how I had seen a few online that said they were available in store & in our budget, so I go to the store to see them in person to make sure I didn't pick the wrong ring.\nGot there & the manager who from the first visit was super helpful and nice, didn't speak to me once when I entered the store. I showed the girl who was helping me a few rings I seen online that said they were in store & the first ring she said \" oh we just sold that ring\" the 2nd and 3rd ring I showed her she Said \" I don't think we have it\" & I was like \"why would it say it was in store if It wasnt?\" She couldn't give me an answer. She did everything in her power to convince me to keep the ring I had but that pissed me off even more so I still ended up returning the ring which I know they aren't happy about, but I wasn't happy with being pretty much only shown options that benefited them. They didn't treat me the same as the first experience & u just don't do your customers that way. Regardless. I will do everything to make sure everyone is aware of how crooked this place is.\n\nAlso, after returning the ring (which was leased throigh progressive) we made an account online to see how the process of the refund was going, come to find out our total was double the price we were told it would be in store from the kay employees. The deposit we put down was suppose to be 79 dollars and would also be the amount of our monthy payment & after looking online we discovered they charged us 86 dollars for the deposit & that our payments would be 91.60 WEEKLY! We were told 79 dollars and some change monthly and then it shot up to 91.60 weekly! They never went over the contract or interest rate with us.\n\nAfter the return I asked the employee if everything on their end was done and all we were waiting on was the leasing company to do their part. Called the leasing company to find out that they were waiting on KAYS to send the invoice over to get the refund process done & taken care of.\n\nCalled Kays once again to speak with the unprofessional, rude heifer off a \"Manager\" to make sure they sent the invoice in and to try to get some answers as to why she never vocally disclosed with us while signing the lease that our total was actually double the price she told us, & she would not answer the question. All she would say was \"you made the return, what else do you need, blah blah..\" How they can get away with is beyond me, after asking her multiple times times she actually HUNG UP on us. I called bk & another girl asnwer the phone, I continued to try to get answers we as customers deserved & as I was speaking the girl started pressing buttons on the phone & then hung up on me, incredibly immature & unprofessional. I am mind blown at my experience. I made a complaint with corporate, with the better business Bureau and got intouch with the district manager with the help of another kays manager of a different location!\nKAYS IS A FREAKING JOKE, THEY LIE & NEVER FULLY DISCLOSE THE FULL TRUTH & PRICE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS IN ORDER TO MAKE THEIR SALES & COMMISSION!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a68210bdbea6d:0xd5e4dcdfa346b928"}

Yes, you could have got more flowers from Publix, but I don't sell Publix quality flowers. I only carry the freshest and finest.

If you like things done right, go to Shaia's. But the story continues, for the actual wedding day we had a tuxedo picked out that was being made in Italy. The factory had to shut down due to the virus and in the few weeks leading up to the wedding, I was facing quite the dilemma. Ben called me for a special appointment to come in and see what could be done from what was on hand at the store. Ben and Ken went far beyond the extra mile to make sure I was not only clothed for my wedding, but the tuxedo was classy, comfortable, and contained the right amount of original. I cannot recommend Shaia's any higher. There were even a few other minor disasters with needing a haircut and my brides' dress needing last minute alterations that we took to Ken because he just got things done. This is where you can truly see Ken's kindness. He helped us in a huge way during our time of need.

My husband I went to the Galleria location to get my size and we wanted to look at the one I had found. Unfortunately it was an \u201conline only\u201d item. The woman who got my size acted as if she was not only inconvenienced by us but as if she was better than us. So my husband ended up ordering the ring and gave it to me on Christmas Eve. When I took it out of the box and put it on I noticed one of the diamonds were missing. My husband immediately called their 1-800 customer service number and they directed us to take the ring to the nearest Zales and they would decide wether to have the ring repaired or replaced. Being Christmas Eve night the location was closed and closed the next day for Christmas. We went to the Galleria location on December 26th and when we explained the situation to an employee they went and got the manager. The manager then asked what we wanted done. I told them I wanted it fixed. Then they asked if I had the paper work for the diamond bond that came with it. I told them no that it should be fixed period considering it was a brand new ring. After about 30 minutes of talking to the manager she said she would take care of it and we wouldn\u2019t have to use the diamond bond and we wouldn\u2019t have to pay for anything. I even went ahead and bought the extended warranty on the metal and the sapphire. The manager said it should be ready by January 7th. When that day got here my husband called and it was not ready yet. Well my husband got a call yesterday, January 10th, that the ring was ready and that it was going to cost $110. When we got there to pick up the ring the woman that was working was the rude woman that waited on us before and the one that rang up my extended warranty. She told us it was going to be the $110. I told her we weren\u2019t paying a dime that the manager was supposed to be taking care of it. Apparently the manager was not there and had made no notes of anything!! I got extremely frustrated and upset. Eventually, after getting verbal and irrate, another employee came over and tried to calm me down. The woman ended up giving us the ring and not charging us. None of this should have ever happened. I will never buy another thing from Zales again!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889221402e1fc1d:0xdf5089bd7c120266"}

They werent nicely trying to tell her that it would be quick or that it would be okay. They just starred. Previously my husband asked if we could pay after the piercing had been done because we werent sure if our daughter would go through with it. We were told no we had to pay immediately. After a minute of trying to get my daughter to cooperate I asked if we could get a refund. We were told no, they do not do refunds.

A few have made it to being a fan favorite - Cherry Amaretto, Pumpkin Spice, Toasted Coconut, and Orange Cranberry. The regular size scones are a bit more moist, and have a stronger flavor.\n\nWe highly recommend them, and have not been disappointed with any of our orders!!

We were instantly concerned that the bad experience with \"edible\" was being repeated.\n\nI called and Melissa said she was sure that mom's order was on the truck as she \"remembered the name.\" As I was hanging up my wife's phone rang and it was my mother-in-law calling to say that she had just been delivered the... - actual quotes - \"most beautiful flower arrangement ever\" and \"the biggest - and fresh fruit basket she had ever seen!\".

I really just would have been fine if they were apologetic towards the situation and cared but instead in a monotone voice the response I was given was \"well sometimes we miss things, do you have the card so I can refund the money\". Outstanding response sir. Needless to say I told them my fianc\u00e9 would call them with the card information. When he called the owner answered and again was not very sympathetic to the situation. He decided a refund wouldn't matter since the surprise for her birthday was ruined anyways. She had the balloons delivered the next day that we paid for already and a box of 6 complementary strawberries sent with it. At the end of the day if someone in this business would have ACTED like they cared that their business took away from what should have been a special sweet 16th birthday delivery I wouldn't have such a bad taste in my mouth for this company.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889218882bfade3:0x9aead16373f89bf3"}

I bought my ring last Tuesday. They hurried it's sizing for me so it would be ready. That's ONE star. They told me it would be ready at 2pm. Wasn't. Then I was told 3pm. Wasn't. Then I was told 4pm. Wasn't. Then, at 5pm, I was told she left to pick up my ring, would be back in 15 minutes and I could go ahead and head up there. 30 minutes later I'm there. My ring isn't. An hour and 15 minutes later and she's not back with my ring. An hour and a half later, she's there with my ring. Isn't nice. Isn't happy. Isn't smiling. This is the MANAGER. She hands me my rings, doesn't ask if they fit ok, doesn't ask if I like them, doesn't ask if that would complete my purchase or if I need anything. Throws it in a box, hands it to me without saying a word and walks away! They talked bad about me because I'm already under the pressure of my wedding, getting my rings on time and I'm mad because they've told me lies all day long! Of course I'm going to be upset! I was lied to several times! What sucks for them?? I was preparing to buy a bracelet and a pair of earrings but instead, I walked out. When we got home we closed our credit account with them. TWO stars because my rings are absolutely beautiful. But, I will never go there again! She was sooo nice when she was selling me the rings but after she got her commission, she no longer cared if she upset me or not. She's the manager, yet her and her two employees sat there and talked about me while all three staring at me! So, two stars. For my beautiful rings and them helping me get my rings on time. What really sucks is I already left her a great review from when she wanted my money and sold me the rings. I'd love to speak to someone higher up, but they all seem to believe their employees, even if there are cameras. BTW, when I left, I went to Kay's and bought my earrings and bracelets from them!

This Zales location is where my husband, the man in uniform in the picture below, bought my wedding ring (#19868058) on October 2017. When first purchased from Zales, the ring had a morganite stone, which was beautiful, but I had my heart set on aquamarine. We also purchased the lifetime warranty on the ring, and later another warranty just on the aquamarine stone I picked out. To make a long story short (for character count) during our time at Zales we were lied to, given false information, struggled getting in touch with the store as well as returned calls, and were pressured to purchase an aquamarine stone at a price much higher than previously discussed. Overall, my husband and I were very displeased with the service we received at Zales. Anyway, after a painstaking process, I finally got my ring back around December-January with the new aquamarine stone. Being fed up with Zales, my husband and I decided to go to Kay to have our wedding bands made. We went the same day I got my ring back from Zales to begin the process of ordering our wedding bands through Kay. His wedding band was relatively simple and took only about a month or 2 until we were able to pick it up, however, mine had to be custom made to fit the oval of my wedding ring. I picked the french beaded design Kay had for my wedding band to be made and they put all the information into the computer system. Kay assured us the bands would be ready in time for our wedding and that they would give us a call when I was able to pick my engagement ring up and to review and approve a molding of my wedding band. About 2 months went by and we hadn't heard anything, but I needed my ring for our engagement party. I had it for about a week and was told Kay needed it back to make the wedding band. Finally at about April or May we received the call that I was able to pick up my engagement ring, but never had a molding to look at and approve. In late May, about 2 weeks before we were getting married, Kay called and said my wedding band was ready. Upon seeing my wedding band that we had waited 4-5 months for the first time, I burst out crying uncontrollably and couldn't even speak to the lady. They had made the band in the wrong design. I was told that I either had to use that band to be married with and then we could start the process all over again after our honeymoon or that I wouldn't have anything to be married with. After several discussions with corporate, we were able to get our money back in full for my wedding band. I felt so defeated... I only had my engagement ring about 2 months out of our 9 month engagement period and I had no wedding band to be married with. Luckily, we found a local, family owned store that was able to make my wedding band in 2 weeks. Lou's in fact overdid themselves and made my wedding band OVERNIGHT! I saw the molding one day and was able to pick up my wedding set the next day! They saved us. But back to my aquamarine wedding ring. On the 5th day of our cruise I lost my stone. As you can see in the pictures below, the prong completely broke off and the stone fell out. I searched the ship for 4 hours, sobbing the entire time and finally a little girl found the stone at the bottom of the pool! We took the ring back to Zales as soon as we got back to port and they soldered a new prong on in about 2 weeks or so. Not even a month later when we were in Savannah for my birthday, I was taking my wedding set off to clean it and the band completely snapped in half (picture bellow). I took my ring to a local Zales a few days later, but not until another area on the band broke, leaving my ring in 2 pieces. Since we had the complete warranty on the ring and stone and this was the second time the ring had broken I told Zales that I wanted my aquamarine stone put into a new setting. Well now I have my ring back. No new setting, just soldered in 3 separate places. Now I'm scared just to put the ring on my finger. Why are we treated like this when we've paid so much money?", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_G9nZMWGEKaykUu4_hJqkMuPOTGvyA-tVHezQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkZzymrZ58H7rgSUcx4aAYMPcnQuSVKUFkoJZt=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhIvb-S9YhwDKqyDwFWD3rOrPGXQ9TQd-v51p7=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da185689b79:0x50916a0e1ccfac2a"}

Bottom line, they did not get the arrangement delivered until 4:45pm and where they had to deliver it to was less than 3 miles from the Edible Arrangements shop.  I called and spoke to the manager and she didn't care at all about the problem and said there was no way they could have gotten it there by Noon.  I ordered it the day before. They open at 8am and you can't fix, arrange and deliver an arrangement by Noon and it is less than 3 miles from your place of business?  Something is wrong with your Business Plan then.  I called and complained to corporate  and they said they would have the owner call me from the Mobile, Alabama location but, I have not received a call yet.  I spent over $100.00 and the business delivered it when they wanted to not, when I wanted them to.  If I don't hear from the owner this week, I'm sending it to my attorney. I know it's just a $100.00 but, it's about the principle of the matter.  This business did not do what they said they would do and they have not even offered an apology, much less a refund.  Well, I expect a call and if I don't get one, it will most certainly cost them more than$100.00.  I don't want to have to do this but, it's time people are held accountable for their actions and it starts now for Edible Arrangements in Mobile,  Alabama.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d4074fa14bb:0x90ccbfe0582f1c5c"}

Nothing held back; Stacy is invested in her students having as much success as possible in the process. She was accommodating to my flight schedule and carry-on restrictions and worked with me on the things I could not bring on the plane. The class was fun and I got to meet and make new friends with a great bunch of clay folk. And, I made a crazy octopus bowl to boot!\n\nLater in the summer, I was able to take another class, Slip Trailing, on my way to a work seminar. This was a tremendous compliment to the octopus work, and will have applications in a lot of my other work. It adds a dimension (literally) that is not available through glaze or underglaze. She was detailed enough in the chemistry that I was hooked, but not so much that the class was lost. The demos and slip play go a super long way in understanding the intricasies of the process.\n\nNow to the area. Alabama is just lovely! The hot sticky weather that they were having was perfect for my cold northern blood. The flora in Alabama is completely different to mine, and I enjoyed driving around to take it all in. The Mills are an amazing space dedicated to the arts and I could have spent days wandering the booths. And!! Anyone visiting Stacy who is gluten free or paleo; I found the most delightful bakery and eatery. Their dedicated gluten free facility has some of the best stuff, and that includes BEFORE my diagnosis. Try the jalapeno cheddar scones at Mason Dixon Bakery, you\u2019ll never want to leave.\n\nSo seriously, if the opportunity comes to have class with Stacy and S.P.Morgan Studios, take it; you will have no regrets.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIe6G8pfkAKvVmaeVWdTqCVFZ-KmMOg_B6chwA=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOv4tW9XFJaxXLyvtizsXfGb3AaEk10zOiKZ9RQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5voVbbuE5ouJtKV0l6OBBXkc-PMB3pbehYnDF=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cbcca324b2d:0x6d862a64a6cb230d"}

I spent, roughly, $65 for a full set (acrylic) and pedicure. THREE DAYS LATER, one of my nails breaks off....then another...and then another. On my other hand, it was visible and evident that two more nails were cracking in the very place where my other three nails popped off (there are more nails broken in the below picture because I, easily and effortlessly, popped the rest off as I left the shop). So, on my first free day, Saturday, I returned and explained my dilemma to the employee, who did my nails, and she directed me to the owner. (Boy, does the owner need a customer-service professional development.)\nShe immediately begins to fuss about how my nails will not match the original color if I simply repair the three broken nails because they were \u201cold\u201d and that I should get a fill-in. When I explained that I do not need a fill-in as I was just there less than a week ago, she tells me that it\u2019s my fault the nails broke off because they were \u201ctoo long.\u201d (I do not wear my nails obnoxiously long and they were the same length I typically get at Royal Day Spa, my usual nail salon, which NEVER pop off, even weeks later when I need a major fill-in.) The owner quoted me a price and I, sadly, asked, \u201cThere\u2019s a full-price charge for this?\u201d She then began speaking quickly, again, and waving her hands as she was saying, \u201cYes!
