We\u2019ve also had to prepare for the new Alabama gas tax.\n\nAnother important factor is that we find it important to pay our drivers a liveable wage and in doing so retain our strict no-tipping policy. After much consideration we decided we would not use the added expense to our operations as an excuse to cut employee pay. Instead we decided to forge ahead knowing we have built a reputation of excellence with hope that our customers value our stance as a company.\n\nWe have set out from the very beginning to be servants of our community and to be a responsible, fair employer. Our vision was to model how to build a local business that is truly focused on employee well-being and excellence in service. And while it does cost more to operate in this fashion, we believe wholeheartedly it is crucial that we provide a safe, professional service to the Tuscaloosa and UA community and we do so by using top-notch staff. It is our sincere hope that UA students find themselves one day employed by a company who shares our values.\n\nWe are proud to say that we are still half the cost of ride-shares with the benefit of knowing that every driver on our team is a direct employee who has been thoroughly vetted and FBI-screened.\n\nThank you again for sharing your feedback with us!

If it is an emergency rely on Uber because they only respond as a courtesy unless you complain and then will put you in your place. Very rude about how their employees \u201cgo home\u201d.

Our outgoing voicemail message explains that we will return texts, calls and voicemails when we return to the office (which at 7:30pm would be the next business day). Our website also explains that we will attempt to assist with last minute reservations but that a customer would need to call our office for assistance. We are able to help with last minute requests quite often but our office does close at a normal hour and our employees do go home to their families.\n\nLike many service based businesses, we are a \u201cby reservation\u201d model. Texts that come in at 7:30pm aren\u2019t immediately noticed because our administrative employees are at home or attending to their life outside the office at this hour. If you have a reservation with us and your flight is delayed or there is any sort of emergency, we employ a 24/7 answering service who calls out to an on-call manager. However, if you do not have a reservation, text in to ask for one last minute, and take 30 minutes to respond to answer us when we attempted to assist you at 7:30pm (as a courtesy) we may find ourselves unable to assist you.\n\nWe understand that you were frustrated and trying to make very last minute arrangements. We get it. But our logs indicate that two different staff members interacted with you yesterday evening up until around 9:15pm. Sadly, your behavior towards them over text was rude, demanding, and downright disrespectful. We have a strict policy to protect the well-being of our staff. And while posting your texted responses to our well-meaning staff who attempted to respond to your concerns after-hours would be unprofessional on our part, we are confident that it would be more of a reflection of your character than any lack of service on our end.\n\nWe have wonderful employees  They DO indeed leave our office and go home to their lives. And as their employer, we respect their time at home with their families. It would be unreasonable for us to expect them to drop everything to make a reservation for the same night when you respond with the time you needed at 8:17pm. We would need to refer any potential customers who do not share our values about how we speak to and treat our staff to another provider. We apologize that we weren\u2019t able to assist you in a situation that clearly frustrated you. If you\u2019d like to email us at request@scuttleshuttle.com we will be happy to provide you a gift card to the ride-share service of your choosing.

I travel to the west coast on business at least once per month. My flights are horrendously early so I typically take the 3:00 am shuttle to BHM. Scuttle Shuttle offers several safe pickup locations around Tuscaloosa and I have never been left waiting around. Usually the driver is there before I even arrive for the pickup. I love that they text you when they are on the way to your location. Then once the driver arrives the real experience begins. These shuttle drivers are the most courteous and friendly people I\u2019ve ever come in contact with using a transportation service. They always greet me with a smile, open and close doors for me and load luggage. Once in the shuttle the driver always asks about my comfort. I\u2019ve noticed they are also very perceptive about if I\u2019m in a talkative mood and want conversation or if I\u2019m still sleepy and needing some quiet time to prepare for a day of travel.  This may seem like a small thing but at 3:00 am it is much appreciated.\n\nTravel to the airport is comfortable in the clean vans and I have always arrived on time. Now, while we\u2019ve never encountered traffic issues, I can see that could happen but rest assured this company will do all they can to get you to the airport on time. I arrive at the airport steps from entrance, having received my luggage from a friendly driver and I\u2019m ready to begin my day.\n\nOn two recent trips on United we experienced significant travel disruptions - like a cancelled flight, severely delayed flight and a diverted flight. On both occasions I missed my shuttle pickup time. Lauren, Cory and Alison from the Scuttle Shuttle office were so patient and kind while I was a nervous wreck trying to figure out how to get home. Cory arranged a new reservation for me within minutes of taking my call. To experience such great customer service after dealing with massive travel headaches all day guaranteed that I will continue to use Scuttle Shuttle for airport transportation.\n\nI could go on and on about this company. In short, I think it is quite rare to experience such consistently awesome service from a company nowadays.

I got a cab from the airport one evening , told the driver where we were going, and he acted like he didn't know where that was (he did), and as I was giving him directions, he intentionally took a wrong turn down 153, and then down I75N despite me asking repeatedly to turn around on Lee Hwy, and then got on Shallowford at Hamilton place, and drove all of the way back on Shallowford, all the while trying to act like he didn't understand what we were telling him.  Even when we were telling him to turn left or right, and would point and say, \"turn left here?\" and turn right at the same time.  He was 100% American, and English was his only language, he was just that shady.  The second time was two nights ago, three of us loaded our stuff into a cab, and when the driver found out where we were going, he said, \"it's $5 per person, which is $5, $5, and another $10.  It's $20.\"  I said, \"There are three of us, we are going two miles down a main highway with no traffic, and how does $5 times three make $20?\".  He was kind enough to say, \"It's $20, or you can get your stuff out\".  We took Uber instead, and always will from now on.

Mr. Fields (the owner) and his team are professional, pleasant, courteous, and safe drivers. They arrive on time, are up-to-date on any possible traffic delays with alternate routes ready, and know their client preferences (e.g., unique pick-up or drop-off locations; interior temperature; music, etc.). The team also are cognizant of any flight issues whether going to or leaving the airport. Several of my flights this past year have been delayed and I have been able to text/email/call to reschedule without further delay but in most cases, as soon as I knew of the schedule disruption, I received a text from the driver that they knew of the change already and would be there waiting for me as soon as I landed. Mr. Fields also is a wealth of assistance for transportation needs outside Alabama and has a network of colleagues with whom he can instantly connect you with. For example, when trying to get back to Alabama when a major airline had multiple disruptions and left thousands of travelers stranded in Atlanta, he was able to text within minutes of my request the names and numbers of several local companies who could get me back home. I appreciate this level of consistent service. Such proactive problem-solving and communication put me at ease knowing that my ride would be there \u2013 no matter how late the flight would arrive. I have made several last-minute requests (e.g., forgot to reserve a ride; had a game day request) over the year and they were able to accommodate them. The evening before each reservation, I receive an email confirming the pick-up time which is a helpful reminder and an opportunity to make any changes. I also receive a text or call from the driver a few minutes before each pick-up. That way, I know who to expect, if there will be any delays (never have been), or other changes in my reservation. Making a reservation with Prestige is easy to do with drop-down menus on my computer or phone. Also, the Prestige transportation fleet is clean and new with multiple options for any occasion. I have recommended Prestige to my colleagues and friends. Prestige offers an exemplary array of 24/7 services of which I will continue to use \u2013 in fact I already have multiple future reservations confirmed. Prestige, Mr. Fields, and his team are a true asset to those who need quality, safe, cost effective, and friendly transportation services.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88861ca840eba2e3:0x5be2b74d18997623"}

The owner BARRY is professional and goes above and beyond. He and his staff are professional, great communicators and on time and VERY RELIABLE. My first experience I called at 10 o'clock at night for a ride for my son and his friend from University of Alabama to Birmingham Airport. Not only did BARRY greet me so kindly, he made me feel so at ease that my son would make it to the airport the VERY NEXT MORNING ON TIME AND SAFE. He picked my son up on time, was waiting early and even texted me that he was in the car.. I have used several other services to get my son to the airport in the past but no more. I am loyal to BARRY AND PRESTIGE LIMO from here on out. I highly reccomended him today to another mother and she too was very impressed. Their pricing is great and for a mama who is 3,000 miles away in California I feel such ease knowing my son is in great hands. If you are a parent who needs a ride or a student I cannot reccomend this company more. You will not be sorry.. I promise.. this man is a Saint! I just hope when the word spreads we can still get a ride, that he won't be too booked. Fantastic BARRY sure knows how to be professional and treat a customer.\nThank you SO much!

Having never been there, I was not interested in having to drive between different locations and risk getting lost and being late to meetings.  I found Alabama Sedan on the internet, and reached out to them via email.  Michael called me shortly thereafter and when I explained the various car rides I would require, he was careful to check his calendar to make sure he could accommodate me.\nDuring the trip, Michael was very professional.  He always arrived early- including at the airport, at the hotel, and at the meeting locations.  He was always considerate to text me that he had arrived, but that there was no rush.  And most importantly, he did a great job planning the pickup times that would allow me to arrive at my destination in a timely manner.  There was one trip for which Michael was not available (and for which he had warned me in advance) and the person he arranged as backup was equally professional.\nI don\u2019t plan on returning to Birmingham in the near future, but if I do the first thing I will do is arrange to use Alabama Sedan again.

They text me updates for the half-hour before pickup, to ease any possible uncertainty, and text upon their arrival (which averages about 10 minutes early).  Michael and his drivers are friendly, courteous, kind, and helpful, and their vehicles are clean and luxurious.  I use them for ALL my business travel (at least one trip a month), as does my wife, and I have recommended them to numerous colleagues (whose experiences mirror our own).  I also use them for personal travel as well - even in instances where I could just drive to the airport and park - because the experience is so positive.  Over the last two years I have gotten to know Michael well, and he is an honest, dedicated, high-integrity local entrepreneur.  I encourage everyone who needs a lift to the airport - or transport around or out of town in the Birmingham area (e.g., dinner dates out, etc.) - to use his service.

He regularly drives around in his own personal silver crown vic and company cab while he is off the clock and poses like he is on the clock and charges extra money on your tab!!!! And when you call him out on his driving all he says is chill out and if you ask why his meter is running he says it does not work! And when you're a regular cab rider and know the total of what your ride will be before hand, and ask why you've been charged extra he gets rude and makes crazy excuses and when you tell him you cant pay that amount because you only brought the amount you normally pay silver cab to go that distance, he will tell you he will take sexual payments to make up the difference of what you supposedly owe him!!!! I was a loyal silver cab customer but three times of ending up in the vehicle with this guy has caused me to changes companies of what cab i get in because this guy is a dangerous predator and drug addict and i refuse to be made feel the way he made me feel again!!!!! So disrespected!!! So violated!!!  I felt extremely uncomfortable and unsafe!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1467221550207, "text": "Ms. Berkey,  I am deeply grieved to learn of this behavior happening in a Silver Cab.
