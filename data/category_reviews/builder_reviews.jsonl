However, their amazing display of professionalism and quality can't go unnoticed. From day one, Brad treated our shelter needs with utmost diligence. After we talked on the phone, he came to our house a few days later with several shelter designs, and plans for us to choose the best shelter and location in our garage. After a few weeks, his team came to our house and the custom shelter was perfectly installed. We couldn't be happier with results. BTW, they also have a military discount.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMs6M4_HPTixTyBsRr89yZzffIAEjIJ8M5xDz4Y=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2-3S1u95oDUGfXDgsoebX9GGAaa9Z_Vs1wZJ0=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886212f000000001:0xb8a161ba8bca8dd3"}
