I wanted him to quote a deck build and privacy fence. I was looking for options on building the deck and he was visibly frustrated that I just didn't have a set design for him to quote. As an engineer and a business owner I understood that, but thats often part of the process. Then he mentioned he would reuse the existing rotted ledger board on the house. I kept my mouth shut but I was definitely on guard after he said that. Next I wanted him to quote a wooden privacy fence around a pool. We came to an area that required a metal section of fence across my driveway.  He told me it wasn't an option to use anchor bolts on concrete for the posts.  As someone he has a fair amount of experience about anchoring I flat out told him it was if he did it correctly.  Once again he got very irate. Then he told me it would take $7000 to cover the 60' section of driveway.  I pointed out that the metal section across the driveway is the same width as the 20' wide pool I wanted to fence off - it does not require anywhere near 60' of fence to go across a 2-car wide driveway. He got mad again when I told him this - but, I mean it's just so obvious.  He stormed off, saying he and I weren't going to get along and I could find someone else. A frustrating waste of time and certainly did not inspire confidence in me that this contractor was competent. He may in fact be competent, but with people skills like that you might never know for sure.

They did a drainage project for me where I explicitly described the design I wanted and it incorporated solid PVC pipe.  On the day of the job, the workers showed up with corrugated pipe.  When I called the owner, he stated that PVC would be $800 more, so feeling like I didn't want to start over with another contractor, I told him to go ahead.  Then I found out that a portion of the water to be drained to the street running from the downspout  was going through perforated corrugated pipe (pipe with holes).  They assured me that the water would be moving and would not leak out into already saturated ground (yeah, right).  Then I came home to find that the grate to catch water coming off the sidewalk was about 1 and a half to 2 inches away from the sidewalk, requiring the water to run over dirt before entering the grate.  The owner tried to tell me that it would be no problem and the bare dirt would not erode despite water constantly running over it.  I insisted that concrete be put between the sidewalk and grate to keep the water from washing out the dirt.  When I came home, I found they had used a type of caulk between the grate and the sidewalk, and had done a messy job of it, I don't know if that much caulk will ever cure.  After two days it is still soft.  Additionally, where they cut through the curb, the re-concreting was extremely poorly done.  It looked like they didn't even use a trowel, much less a curbing tool.  It looked like they basically packed the concrete on with their fingers and left it.  Part of the contract called for doing a brick border along the sidewalk.  After I paid them for the portion of the contract for the drainage, they informed me that they were waking away from the contract and that I needed to find someone else to do the edging.  The pity is, the subcontractor they had lined up to do the masonry work actually sounded very competent.  Bottom line, this is a company that, in my opinion, cut corners at every opportunity, poorly designed the project, provided shoddy workmanship, and then walked away with nearly half of the contracted work unperformed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626519de7ef85b:0x4b6cae1b92594858"}

I contracted with them to do drainage work, a sprinkler system and landscape lighting.\n\nI was told this would take 3 weeks to complete, with each phase occurring on consecutive weeks. The project as a whole took almost 12 weeks to complete, and this was only because I hounded them with calls multiple times per week.\n\nThe drainage work was the first part, it seemed to be fine, though the French drain was not placed the complete length that was discussed originally. Also the fingers of river rich were put in to stop erosion, but almost no grass seed was put in afterwards, so nothing but weeds grew in between the river rock.\n\nThe second piece was the sprinkler system. This was put in during a day, but the ground was not backfilled properly and they needed to come back out to fix it. We were told that they would put down grass seed after the lighting job was completed. The lighting work was not completed for another 8 weeks, and there wasn\u2019t any seed put down afterwards. They were also supposed to aerate and oversees the lawn, but since they could not get their mower into our backyard, they told us they would come back with a smaller mower to pull the aerator later. This never happened.\n\nI had to call them 2-3 times a week for 8 weeks to get them to complete the lighting. Part of it was landscape lighting, the other portion was putting in a fan and spotlight in/on our screened patio. The wiring was placed so shallow, that it came out of the ground within a week and they had to come back to fix. The light and fan was supposed to be put in by an electrician, but was just put in by the owner and his friend. They put a cheap conduit over the electrical wire that didn\u2019t even cover the wire.  They sent an electrician out to fix the wiring, but he just rigged another kind of conduit on the bare wire to cover it up.  The uplighting for the trees was sold to us at $65 a light. I just found the lights online for $45 for a 4-pack of lights.\n\nWe just gave up with this company and figured we would just be stuck with this work. Over the last year, I kept burying and covering up the wire as it came out of the ground and have been trying to repair the grass in the area where they did sprinkler and drainage work. We are still fighting massive weeds from the lack of follow through on planting grass after their work was completed.\n\nI am writing this review today after I just finished replacing 3 lights that stopped working and half of the wiring that was put in for the landscape lights. Turns out they believe that wire nuts are not necessary and you only need to tape wires together with electrical tape before putting it in the ground.\n\nIf you are looking for a company to do landscaping work for you, stay very far away from this company.

I set up the original appointment via e-mail. I live 5 time zones away and coordinated the work for the week I was at my Mom's. Josh came by, gave me an estimate, and recommended removal of two trees. Both were close to the house, one was a 50-ft oak tree.  Josh was able to reschedule a day earlier than he originally projected.\n\nAbout 6 hours of work, and the tree felling operations went flawlessly dropping right between house and fence. The crew was professional, Josh was personally meticulous about cleaning and power blowing yard clean, especially around pool. Josh owns and runs this business and of course will be saturated with calls after severe weather events.  That's why I elected to have the work done on my schedule, not Mother Nature's. I had some questions after the work was completed and Josh provided timely responses and follow up to my questions. I'd hire him again.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1500561877704, "text": "Thanks Robert we really appreciate the review."}, "gmap_id": "0x88928d80488970bf:0x6ddff92dbeeb7004"}

We wanted to put in a curved edge patio and he came out and measured the land, staked out the space and figured out what would work best. Our schedules didn't align at first but we made it work once we figured out a workable timeline. He came back a few more times and we discussed color of the concrete, size, dimensions, drainage, and a bunch of other details. He was patient and hear do us out, and you could tell he was excited about the project.\n\nWhen the crew showed up they were fast, professional, and methodical. They know their craft. They worked from 6am to 7pm some days, going over the details, re-laying sod, cleaning up spills or little messes (nothing major just normal stuff from the construction), and generally just making the backyard look good again.\n\nAnd the finished product is exactly what we wanted! Josh kept telling us to trust him, he had a plan, he was going to pour some creativity into our project and we wouldn't be disappointed. And he was right! Our once ugly backyard patio space now looks like something out of a magazine! The form is beautiful, it makes our yard flow, and it is just a fantastic job. I HIGHLY recommend these guys.

They are an exceptional concrete contracting company that most definitely puts the customer first. They went way out of their way to ensure they had a satisfied customer with our project and believe me, we were not an easy customer to please. They had to continuously answer questions and listen to our concerns but did so with nothing but professionalism. They take pride in their work and have been very professional throughout the entire process!\n\nWe went with the stamped concrete design with colors to blend well with our brick. We were unsure of the colors and how they would look next to the brick on our house, but with their experience and knowledge they were able to give us what we wanted. The colors are as close to perfect as you can get!\n\nWe've never known anyone personally that had a stamped concrete patio or have ever viewed a stamped concrete patio of this design, other than in pictures, so fully understanding the process and the amount of work it takes to build a patio, such as this, was beyond our full comprehension. It takes a lot of work, skill and somewhat of an artistic eye along with exceptional pride to produce a nice product. Foxcrete did just that!\n\nThe patio is designed with the appeal of a paver patio, but without stones that will move. The brick lined edge comes down the side walls of the patio giving it a realistic appearance of brick pavers. The colors are a mixture of browns and tans, with the brick edge being a darker color than the inner area of the patio giving it a distinct framed look. We love this design and the colors!\n\nThank you, Josh and Foxcrete Construction Group, for doing such a fantastic job on this patio!

Also when the dug my yard up for work they left the ground open for two months. Our HOA charged me 50.00 a day it wasn't done. So I paid 8,000.00 to Mike Lewis and 2,800.00 to the HOA. Mike offered no discount and yelled, screamed and cursed at me when I approached him with the charges that I had incurred during his long delay of getting my yard done. Not to mention all the times I had to pay for carpet cleaning because dogs constantly brought mud and sand in from yard. Absolutely terrible experience.\n\nUpdate: My last two conversations with Mike were him cussing me out using the F bomb at me frequently. Our concrete is cracking terribly after less than a year and colouring is chipping out everywhere. I'm now going to have to have someone else repair and I guess try small claims court to get reimbursed from Mike. I have given him every opportunity to fix this issue and he just yells and makes me the bad guy because I said negative things about the work. I am the one out around $9,000.00 and I will be out even more after paying someone else to fix. Save yourself the hassle and hire someone else. If anyone else that has been screwed by this guy would like to discuss teaming up in court please let me know. People shouldn't be able to take your money and run the way he has. He GUARANTEED any issues I had would be fixed the day he was handed the money.\n\nNote for Mike: If you would fix my issues I will remove all negative comments from here.

After he was able to inspect the house, he met back with me and discussed his thoughts regarding our house.  He had his report emailed by the following day.   So to sum it up.  Within three days, we were able to get in touch with a expert who looked over our house, answered our questions, and sent us an emailed report.   Grant is the man and someone we would (and will) definitely recommend.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626a2e738087eb:0x38d226941a1e4b83"}

Well, you were not here to direct so none of that happened and nobody told me to call the office for anything. Attached, is where you try to blame the builder.  I hired you correct my original flooring issue well after the builder.  Your correction should have included ALL THE REPAIRS TO CORRECT my flooring issues whether it what the builder did or did not do RIGHT?

The work involved Foundation Support Piers under brick footings to fix cracks in brick veneer and Stable Lift Piers with 2x8 girders in the crawlspace to fix sagging floors.\n\nTony was referred to me by my real estate agent and he was absolutely fantastic. Tony came right on time when he said he would be there and his communications were prompt and professional. It was a pleasure to work with Tony during the proposal phase and the work itself. He is technically knowledgeable and dependable. I highly recommend him! He is the reason I contracted with Don Kennedy & Sons.\n\nThe foundation support piers did exactly what they were supposed to do. The stair step cracks in the brick closed right up as we had hoped. There was a little more impact to the yard and soil than I had expected, but not a major issue.\n\nThe Stable Lift Piers and 2x8 girders also did their job. They are not as elaborate of a solution as the adjustable \u201cSmart Jacks\u201d on top of poured concrete pads from AFS, but they do work and they are a little less expensive. I recommend that consumers understand what they are purchasing on major repairs like this and get someone to help if they don\u2019t. I did an internship with a home inspector, and I have structural improvements at my main residence, so I was able to spot some minor issues which Tony readily and proactively agreed to correct once I explained them on the phone. The laborers came right over, understood my concerns, and fixed them right away. Some additional materials were added at no expense/no questions. I think if Tony had been available to inspect before I did he would have corrected these on his own. My own inspection was prematurely hurried by the office manager \u2013 see below.\n\nAdministratively this business has some improvements to make. At 2:00 on Friday I was called by the administrative assistant that my work was complete and asking for immediate payment. I kindly asked for a chance to see the work first over the weekend and that I would pay on my way to work first thing Monday morning. I was told that they would have to ask the office mgr. This made sense and I agreed. Surprisingly, Jordan called me back promptly explaining that this was not acceptable per her manager and that I needed to leave my own job and arrange for payment with Jordan ASAP. I immediately left a voice mail for Tony. Thankfully he straightened it all out. I was never given an apology by the office manager.\n\nSo, I ran over first thing Saturday morning to inspect and observed the minor corrections needed to be made. The office mgr\u2019s insistence on paying right after they were done Friday seemed underhanded (and downright strange too), but Tony made it all right. The office manager needs to get better at being reasonable conducting business, treating people respectfully, and resolving business issues firsthand with customers. However, administrative assistant Jordan worked very hard to provide great, positive customer service. I remained with the laborers on Saturday to make sure everything was fixed to spec, and it was. The laborers worked hard and were very friendly.\n\nI\u2019d recommend to Don Kennedy and to their customers that a 7-10 business day payment period be part of the contract to allow the customer time to inspect repairs, Tony to inspect, and/or get a buddy to inspect after completion of the work. This will also take a lot of stress off the payment-hungry front office and the customer. I\u2019ve contracted lots of work over the years and I\u2019ve never been pressed for payment so urgently \u2013 despite a 50% down payment before starting the work.\n\nIn summary I do recommend Don Kennedy & Sons for residential structural repairs and especially if you work with Tony.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626a2e738087eb:0x38d226941a1e4b83"}

With genuine sincerity we would rate this company,  under the leadership of its owner, Mike Hayes, as \"Best in Class\". The group is made up of dedicated professionals and highly skilled individual driven by high quality service comittment.\nThe repair MDH was hired to do was one that had been previously attempted by another foundation repair company. This was our second time addressing the same problem. While the first company ensured us the fix we paid for was permanent. It was short number of years later that we began seeing signs indicating the repair was failing . We found ourselves back at square one.\nAt the time we did not know MDH Foundation. We did reach out to the only other company we knew of thru advertisement only, and while we had someone come out assess and quote us a price, we chose to hold off. Very impressive sales presentation they did but we were just not convinced on their proposed corrective plan.  Some time later we hear of MDH, and a lot of good things being said of the owner, Mike Hayes. Not only on their foundation repair work, but as a very highly respectable contractor too.  Earlier this year we met with a member of the MDH team, and an assessment was made. Then before the job plan was finalized, the owner, Mike, came out to thoroughly go over the plan. It was the first time we felt really comfortable about the corrective plan.  Mike has a great group of professionals and skill guys that communicate well together.

The irrigation system and the landscape was adequate but the waterfall/pond was totally unacceptable.  The job foreman, Stephen, had used flat rock (flagstone?) throughout the fall and there was no structure to it at all.  The stone was just laid flat and the water ran over it like it was concrete and it leaked terribly.  Several discussions with Stephen and nothing was done.  I then called his supervisor and someone named Brandon came out to look at it.  When he saw it he was surprised.  I asked him if he would have this in his backyard and he said no.  He tore apart the fall and pond and found several leaks where the liner had been glued together. I found out later that a pond that small should not have a seam and should be one piece.  I will admit, I liked the way the falls and pond looked.  Brandon added structure and the water flowed down the rocks like a waterfall.  I thought it was all over but within a week the water level was down considerably.  Brandon kept saying it was evaporation.  I went online and found a leak test so I did it.  I shut off the pump and covered the pond to prevent evaporation.  It still leaked.  Brandon conducted his own tests and determined that the water was flowing over the top of the liner in several places.  His remedy was to loosen all the fittings to presumably decrease the flow of water.  Now when you turn the pump off, the backflow valve was rendered useless and the water would leak out of the pipes and go into the overflow drain.  His solution to this problem was to tape the overflow drain shut so the water wouldn't go into the overflow.  Again, I referred to the internet and this is not a proper solution to the problems.  QCL has been to my house 25 or more times to fix the problem and I still have a leaking waterfall/pond.  QLC now says that I stepped on rocks and punctured the liner and broke a pipe.  They also said I waited  2 years before I complained about a problem.  I did not step on the rocks and puncture the liner and the only people to move rocks around to break a pipe was them and my first complaint was immediately following  the installation and has been  continuous since then.  QLC now says they cannot warranty a pond for 5 years.  The problem is, there has not been one season that I didn't have problems.  I suggested that I hire an independent contractor to remove the old pond and put in a new pond.  If the new contractor determined it was not a faulty installation, I would pay for all the repairs.  If, however, it was due to the installation, QCL would have to pay the cost of the installation or refund my payment of $6100.00.  They refused.  I know this was long, but I feel it is very important that you read and understand what happened.  The only thing I did wrong was I was too patient and gave them the benefit of the doubt and the chance to fix the problem.  I would not do business with Quality Creative Landscaping.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890c8edc23ffff:0xe7e182029877a72"}

{"user_id": "106281876022532132920", "name": "Betty Pierce", "time": 1624154500227, "rating": 5.0, "text": "Some years ago we needed some significant waterproofing and structural repairs done in our basement home. We contacted a few different companies to provide an Inspection and estimate. After some discussion we decided\nOn a company that was not on the higher side of the estimates. We felt like the fix would be pretty much the same no matter who we chose\nAnd saving money was in our interest at the time..One company we called was a fairly well known local company A.F.S. We were familiar with them because they began here in Decatur\nSo we would see trucks around town. FYI,  I wanted you to know, we should\u2019ve called AFS from the start. Today I\u2019m here some 7 odd years later, after spending thousands of dollars with the low price alternative and my\nSump pump and drainage system doesn\u2019t work, our walls are blistering and cracking up, down and horizontally, water is seeping thru the wall cracks and the concrete blocks are shifting and cracking our exterior brick and interior block walls. I have limited mobility and couldn\u2019t go check on these things easily and things kept getting worse. Considering what we received from the lower priced company, we decided to call AFS to provide their opinion on our basement situation. At this point , the only thing working or effective was a dehumidifier. It was time to seek experts advice. We had previously used AFS in a limited capacity for our cracked pool deck and they performed that repair just fine and although that repair is not inexpensive,\nIt was much less and more quickly usable than any other options we looked at. So from there we felt we could allow them a chance to tell us (what )was happening and (why )was it happening . When the day came for the inspection, David Flamm , the inspector called our home in advance and let us know his arrival time and asked if we could sit for a few questions before beginning the inspection. He felt we would have something of value to help  determine the cause of the damage. We felt he was sincere and listened to what we had to say and even wrote down the answers. We watched as he went room to room with his big light and something like a laser . He was very thorough, and  took  pictures as he moved around the house.\nOne thing he did,  that most never do, is David removed his boots before walking on my clean floors. Not a big thing but it got my attention.\nAfter the inspection inside , he explained what he would be doing outside and that my husband\nWas welcome to tag along if he wanted, so he did. He was rather impressed with David\u2019s knowledge and ability to explain the plan of repair. After our experience with another company (who did almost nothing) and David\u2019s attitude and attention to our concerns, we were very relieved that we called AFS. He took pictures and put them on his laptop for us to clearly see the issues, he asked our opinion and waited for our response. Never did he act pushy or lacked any uncertainty about what he would do to help us. He allowed us to view video software of the repairs needed, and even priced the project as he went thru the videos. Needless to say,  we were very comfortable with Dave and could feel he really knew what the problems required. Before we had to ask, David explained AFS Warranty, Service and maintenance program and how they return and maintain the eguipment so we didn't have to worry. This was very helpful considering my physical limitations and my husband is very busy with work. We felt very reassured after spending a couple of hours with David Flamm, we had called the right company. AFS must invest a lot of time into the people that work for them, it was so smooth . We had no trouble connecting the dots. David explained the project review process they go they prior to arriving to our home and how the foreman on the job has already seen the project and all of the pictures as David and the foreman discuss the ins and outs of it. It seems every concern we had initially was addressed before we had to express it. AFS, should be the first and only call you make for your home today.\nWe are glad we did.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1624291512896, "text": "Hello Betty!

They were very prompt and courteous.  We had a small problem that Nathan brought to my attention after he and his crew started the prep work in the area which resulted in them having to remove 2 additional (early 1930's) brick support columns and level the dirt foundation under them.  Had Nathan not brought the potential problem to my attention, even with the work they were doing, I might have had more collapse in that area in the future.  Now I won't have any concerns about that.  I was very impressed with how well these 3 men worked together and also independently while completing the job.  AFS has turned an old damp 1930's basement crawl space area into a bright, clean space my grandkids could play in at my house.  The crew cleanup in my yard was spot-on.  They even hauled off those brick columns for me.  I'm looking forward to the follow-up visit in about two months to see how much more lift they can get in my (had been) sagging floors.  There was some immediate improvement when they tightened all the floor jacks and after that new dehumidifier dries up my floor rafters for a few weeks we should see even more improvement.  No more squeaky, rattling floors!!\nThank you, AFS.\nPatricia", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1599576514922, "text": "Ms. Flory, wow, thank you for such a thorough and kind review!

It had to be stabilized or I was going to have to totally redo the carport.  I did not know who to contact but a friend had AFS do some foundation stabilization work for him. I asked him about AFS.  I had seen the TV ads but know that anyone can do a slick tv commercial.  It turns out, the friend was positively impressed with AFS on his project. So, I made an appointment for their rep to visit.  I was still a little skeptical.  The field rep arrived on time and looked at my issue.  He suggested their concrete stabilization product.  He described how it would work and be installed.  He was not at all pushy nor did he give me any slick sales pitch.  He knew about the product, how it was installed and what it could do.  I agreed to do the project with them and made a down payment on the project.  We scheduled the job and on the agreed upon day, the installation crew arrived.  They were a little later than initially planned BUT the office called to say they were running behind, so that was not an issue.  They were maybe 30 minutes later than planned. The installation guys checked over the carport and talked over their plans with me. Then they went straight to work. They were clean cut, totally nice people to have at my home with no smoking or foul language - just hard work! There was an obvious difference to the carport when they were through.  So, I really felt good about their work.  They also cleaned up any mess that they made (a little concrete dust) with the tools they brought to the job site. Prior to this experience, I did not know this company,  other than my from friends recommendation & a TV commercial.  After my experience I would not hesitate to recommend them.\nI give AFS an A+ & 5 stars!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1601305643990, "text": "Mr. Counts, thank you for such a thorough review and recommendation!

Over the last 2 years, it has flooded during the heavy rains in January and February.  I did some research to evaluate this issue and decided to go with a reputable, established, and known company.  I was not disappointed.  Mr. David Flamm arrived at my house promptly for my initial appointment.  He was professional and personable.  After a few minutes of discussion, he understood my concerns and started his investigation.  Once he completed his investigation, he sat down my wife and I and went over his findings. His presentation of what could be done was easy to understand and follow along using the video clips on his computer. All seemed logical, but me, being the ever skeptic, asked many questions about how the system would work and why it seemed the water was infiltrating my living spaces after 7 years of no water. He answered all of my questions and his explanations made sense.  After it was all said and done, we had the Aquastop Control groundwater seepage system with Aquastop basement air system,  EZflow  tubing with the triple pump action installed.\nDay of installation:\nThe team showed up on time for the install lead by Nick.  It had been raining a lot AGAIN and i had my makeshift sump-pump system running to dewater the area where it was building up.  The team laid down plastic tarp so as to not get my finished basement dirty and commenced to working.  It took them 2 days to complete.  What a job. When they laid in the pump system and started the pumps, the water buildup that i had my makeshift system in for, drained and did not come back.  EUREKA!!  Since this system has been in place, we continue to get the storms and flooding but my basement/crawlspace remain dry.  The system works as described and projected.  I cannot thank Dave and his team from AFS enough.  Their professionalism and concern to provide a solution to my problem was genuine and their work is top of the line. Dave's evaluation of my needs and his concern to present me with different options was genuine and without company profit in mind. I highly recommend this company and team for any issues you may have in basement or crawlspace area.

Due to hydrostatic pressure my walls were caving in slightly. I don\u2019t remember the terminology  AFS uses but they came in and put what looks like a tarp over the walls.  It\u2019s to prevent moisture and mold buildup. Life time warranty. It might be working but since my walls are covered up I am only guessing it is. After I removed everything from the walls in the basement, yes, everything, including taking out my bathroom, they jackhammered around the edge of the walls about a one foot trench. AFS then put in place , what I call a gutter. Rocks were placed around this gutter along with a moisture barrier and then concrete poured on top. Supposedly, they put holes into each concrete block on my wall and place  a pipe that goes from block to gutter. As you know, these blocks have cylinders inside where water can build up. The purpose is for water to drain from block(my wall)into the gutter then it\u2019s to flow to corner of house where there is a sump pump.\n\nShort story is that it\u2019s been two years and no water has touched the sump pump. As you know the last two years have been like northwest Washington where we are getting tons of rain. Now I\u2019m having moisture, called efflorescence, coming up where they jackhammered. AFS came by several times and put a sealer on floor. Never worked. Had another man come by and look at system to see if water was flowing properly; it was. I spoke to one of the managers and he stated there was nothing else they could do. I thought about legal action but statue of limitations had expired. $13k pretty much wasted and I\u2019m left still trying to fix the problem.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1579289402562, "text": "Mr. Simmons,\n\nWe are sorry for your  frustration.

We found this out after we notified them we had a quote from another company.  This should throw up major \u201cred flags\u201d to anyone reading this. Why not give you their best price up front? Now read the rest if you would like.\n\nStay away from AFS if you plan on getting multiple quotes.  I LOVED everything they told me and was completely impressed by their upfront professionalism.  The representative came out, did a thorough inspection and gave us a detailed layout of what needed to be done.  Where things went bad was when it was discovered that we also had another company come out, providing comparable services for a moderately better price.  As a decent human, I felt it important to contact the AFS rep to inform him of our appreciation but we were going to go with a competitor. At that point he became a high-pressured salesman and became somewhat belligerent.  To top things off, we had filed a coverable insurance claim regarding a busted drain pipe and the insurance company contacted this AFS rep and the rep told them the problem was due to an issue that is well-known not coverable by insurance.  Had I not called the rep to inform him, man-to-man, of our decision and simply \u201cghosted\u201d him (a cowardly way of handling things), we wouldn\u2019t be in the predicament.  Through this behavior and revengeful tactics, he reassured us that AFS is not the type of company we want to take care of our home.  My wife and I are teachers and work on a limited budget...we would be silly to not request more than one estimate for a job this size.  A company such as this should realize that.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1578440362389, "text": "Mr. Milam,\n\nWe appreciate your kind remarks regarding the professionalism of our inspector.  We do try to be extremely detailed and responsible with both our inspections and repair plans.  Obviously we are disappointed when a homeowner chooses to use another company, but always want folks to make a decision that they\u2019re comfortable with.\n\nIt sounds like there was some confusion regarding a possible insurance claim that you filed.  When asked by homeowners whether a crawlspace scenario is covered by insurance, our standard reply is that \u2018it depends on your policy, it\u2019s best to contract your insurance provider\u2019.  While we\u2019re not an insurance company, the trend that we have seen is that acute issues like a plumbing leak may be covered, whereas issues that develop over time, like ground water seepage are typically the homeowner\u2019s responsibility \u2013 similar to hail damage to a roof vs a roof just wearing out.\n\nThe inspection photos of your crawl space showed a pattern of mud lines on multiple walls of your crawlspace.  This is consistent with a ground water seepage challenge and why our repair plan called for drainage and a sump pump in your crawl space.  If asked what was found in our inspection, our policy is just to be candid.  We can\u2019t really speak to causality, but just to current conditions noted.\n\nHope this clears up any misunderstanding and we wish you the best with your repairs."}, "gmap_id": "0x88621663b63fdbf9:0xecb0ee1e38d7cfea"}

In spite of being very busy he always made us feel like we were important to him and made sure we knew exactly what was going on.  The repairs took two crews.  The first crew led by Luis G, working with Michael Moseley and Richard Warner installed the piers to stop the settling.  They did great work, never slowed down in spite of the rain that made a mess of everything, were always friendly and open to questions, and cleaned up the muddy mess better than I ever hoped for.  A great team of professionals.  The second team led by Gavin Dendy installed the SettleStop foam to raise the garage floor back up and stabilize it.  It was amazing to watch and they made it look effortless.  Gavin explained the process and made sure we understood and were satisfied before wrapping up and leaving.

When it rained the water would not drain properly in both of these locations.  AFS said that their injection program would fix both of these problems; in reality it was the start of making things much worse.  They drill a bunch of holes in the concrete and inject some material that is supposed to raise the concrete; unfortunately the whole concept is flawed.  They cannot control where this material goes as it is injected under the concrete and they are unable to correctly monitor the pressure as it goes in.  AS a result my walkway in back and my driveway ended up cracked and tilted in such a way that the problem was much worse; the water was now more directed towards my house.\nAFS tried to fix the driveway by cutting a 25 foot trench in my driveway and installing a drain; unfortunately this was also done incorrectly.  The slope of the drain did not allow the water to drain out, the drain was installed with large screws going into the drain pipe, which caught leaves creating a barrier.  Additionally, the cracks they created in the driveway and improper injection of the filler material caused my driveway to sag creating a lake that does not drain at all.\nAFS tried to fix the drainage problem made worse by their injection program in back by digging up part of the walkway and replacing the concrete; unfortunately, again they did not get it right.  They did not provide the proper slope to the new concrete and as a result the water make another lake immediately up against the side of my house.\nSo now I have worse drainage problems, my driveway looks like hell and as a result of the drainage problems the corner of my house at the garage is sagging.\nI would have been much better off if they had done nothing.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1558126613083, "text": "Hello Mr. Ballard, we can certainly understand your frustrations.

We knew we needed to get something done to stabilize our foundation since our home is built on clay soil with a high-water table. I googled and researched different companies and contacted AFS along with others to come out and give us an estimate.  AFS proved to be the most dependable and reliable; AFS actually showed up on the date and time they were scheduled.  Michael Rosewarne was our certified foundation repair specialist.  He was excellent.  I was very impressed with Michael's knowledge and ability to make me understand what was going on with our home.  He showed me pictures and drew a diagram of what we needed for repair; he was very thorough.  He is a super nice person and is an amazing communicator.  Even after the fact, I called him, and he was very gracious, patient, and kind to walk me through activating my account with Greensky.   Our foundation repair team arrived as scheduled calling along the way to let us know their ETA.  Matt Fernandes and his crew were fantastic, super friendly, honest, and very respectful.  Matt explained everything he and his team would be doing.  Matt showed me pictures of everything they had done.  They did a superb job working diligently until they got the job exactly as it should be.  They left everything neat and in order.  I think most of the cracks in our home are already closing.

But, well-coordinated for them doesn\u2019t necessarily mean well-coordinated for me and I felt they were partially responsible for that due to the lack of key information and poor initial inspection. I'd give 2.5 stars if I could\n\nWhen I signed up, I thought I signed up for a thorough crawlspace inspection. What my Inspector did was gather just enough information about my crawlspace to fit into his sales pitch. It\u2019s probably best to do your own crawlspace inspection before you even call them out, because you may have to perform repairs before their crew comes out. They DO NOT employ plumbers, carpenters or electricians to handle possible crawlspace issues. They just want to sell you their system and once you sign that contract you can\u2019t back out without paying a 15% restocking fee.\n\nAfter the Inspector performed his inspection at my place, I found and had to deal with several issues. In accordance with the contract I was responsible for making sure there was power available in the crawlspace for the dehumidifier. When I go into the crawlspace to take care of this I see a wet spot from 15 feet away and realize I have a water leak. A closer look revealed I had water damage. I point blank asked that Inspector if he saw anything that required immediate attention and he said \u201cNo\u201d. There\u2019s no way he should have missed this. The \u201cInspector\u201d did come out and look at it and he did put me in touch with a carpenter, whom I did use, and I was able to get a plumber out quickly. But, with the expense of these repairs I would have liked to have pushed out the AFS work just to let my pocket book recover and make paying for the AFS work a little less taxing. He seemed to balk at the suggestion.\n\nBack to the power I was installing. I asked specific questions about the dehumidifier they were going to install. Where did they need power? How long is the cord for the dehumidifier? What type of plug? Etc\u2026 What he didn\u2019t tell me was they needed 2 outlets for the job. I assumed 1 spot to plug in the dehumidifier would be sufficient, so I cleaned up an existing power connection for the sump pump in my crawlspace, making sure to leave them a spot to plug in the dehumidifier. When the crew came out on the first day they informed me they need a 2nd outlet for the pump that goes with the dehumidifier, so I\u2019m left scrambling that night to install another outlet.\n\nIt turned out I also had a strange issue with my AC ductwork that the AFS crew reported to me on the 1st day. I\u2019ll give the Inspector a break here and say he may or may not have discovered this if he had performed the type of inspection I expected. This turned into yet another unexpected expense on top of the carpenter and plumber. It would have been nice if the Inspector had caught all of this.

He gave us a very detailed report, then came out again on the weekend just to talk to my husband and show us short videos of how the products work. He was very professional, and you could tell he really cares about his customers. We hired AFS to do some work and needless to say, when you come home and see your yard/front porch torn up, you might start to panic. However, the onsite crew put my mind at ease and assured me once they put the top-of-the-line helical piers in, they would restore the concrete, landscaping, mulch, etc. exactly how it was before (or until I was 100% satisfied) at no extra cost. They lived up to their word, and what even impressed me more was that they finished the entire job in a single day. These guys are such honest and hard workers!

I needed work done on my house foundation and my son-in-law of Huntsville Heating and cooling, Christopher Hayden said that he had heard the company did good work.\nDavid Rathmann of AFS responded to my call and we discussed what needed to be done and he explained the ins and outs of how it could be done and then let me make the decision on what I thought I needed and he made suggestions along the way. So it was decided I would have the work done.\nOn the two days the pier crew arrived, the crew chief Javier greeted me and we discussed the work progress and what they were doing each day.  Javier was ready to explain anything I was unsure about, with a short discussion on my expectations he and his crew was ready to get started. I have been around crews, and know how hard it is to get everyone going but without hesitation the crew was assigned work and they really got started. Along the way as I watched each of the crew was ready to explain what they were doing and why. It was great to see a crew that was self starting and knew their job so it could be accomplished with little delay. The second day the crew members changed a bit, but still  Javier was the crew chief, and again they started work soon after they arrived without delay and some conversations occurred at times to make sure what they were doing was the right way, because the situation of this repair was a little unusual, but they adapted to keep the work on time and with a professional attitude.\nThe third day the poly crew chief,  Dendy and crew arrived on time and immediately Dendy greeted me and explained what they were here for and ask to be shown the work area.  We discussed what he was going to do and how it would be accomplished and without delay, they got started preparing for the job of the day. They were always willing to explain the procedure and the expected results, and also how they would attempt to prevent any unwanted results.\nI want to commend all the personnel for their excellent work and their professionalism and accepting my sometimes unneeded suggestions and allowing me to express myself.\nThank you AFS for having happy crews, apparently they like working for AFS and proudly say so with a strong sense of belonging to a company who apparently cares about their employees.\n\nRobert Hendrix\nA  Satisfied Customer.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1509053963738, "text": "Mr. Hendrix, we greatly appreciate your feedback, as well as your trust in AFS to complete your repair project!
