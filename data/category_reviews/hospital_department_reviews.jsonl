The place was disgusting. The floors and chairs were smeared in god knows what and their wasn't a hand sanitizer station visible in the place.  Upon intake my child was given a large dose of Tylenol (even though i had just given him some 2 hours before) the dose was 3.75 ml even though our sheet from pediatrician says weight gets 2.5ml. and he was given a dose of Benadryl and we were sent back to waiting room. After an hour or so we were taken to a room where the billing representative came immediately to collect my 100 copay and then an hour later we saw a resident who snottily corrected me when i called him a nurse. He asked some questions looked him over and left. I didn't see anyone again for hours. I was by myself, my child is an infant and i needed to use the bathroom. the only one was in the hall. The bed had no rails to leave my baby in, there was no nurse visible or that answered the call button to assist and the bathroom had no table to lay him on so i could use the bathroom. After a few hours the doctor comes in with a nurse and informs me that my child is allergic to tape (where they taped his eyes down for surgery that morning) and he has sensitive skin. And that they were going to give him a dose of Benadryl to help the swelling. I said NO you just gave him Benadryl on intake and a very large dose of Tylenol. They were like oh we did? Sorry.. I pointed out that the Benadryl did not help and his eye is looking progressively worse and that if he was allergic to tape wouldn't both eyes be like this?  They informed me they weren't going to do anything or run any tests and to follow-up with regular doctor tomorrow. They would however do a flu test to appease me. I know he doesn't have the flu and after 30 minutes i paged the nurse to ask if we can go home and have the flu results called to doctor the next morning? They said they will tell the nurse and send her in to talk to us. Never showed up. Flash forward another hour and 45 minutes. Flu negative and we can finally go home. Vitals and temp never checked since intake and no bloodwork drawn. Nothing. The next morning my child breaks out in the roseola rash. Thanks for nothing Children's.

I have had the worst experience in my Life! My son has been having Migraines for the last 8 years & he is 12 yrs old. When you have a child that suffers from this type of pain it hurts my Heart that Dr.Anna White would come & ask questions. Conversation: Dr. Anna White    Kameron what's hurting on you? Kameron replies my head is hurting really bad & my stomach. Dr. Anna White asked: How long has your head been hurting & Kameron replied off & on since last night but my stomach started today. Dr. Anna White then asked have he had any bowel movements & Kameron replied: he did earlier today & it was normal. Dr.Anna White asked if he has eaten anything today & Kameron advised he ate a couple hours ago. Dr. Anna White asked what did he eat? Kameron told her  he had Mash Potatoes, Pork Chop, & Corn( Let me add it was the smallest portion of food ever) but anyway Dr. Anna White then goes in to say this is a Non-Emergency Visit because if he tolerated a Meal it's not an Emergency! My response: it's an Emergency  to me because my Son never complains unless he is really sick & if he tells me he needs to go to the Dr. I'm going to bring him. Dr. Anna White then goes on to tell me that they are just counseling patients on Non-Emergency visits, I then cut her off in mid sentence & told her you don't have to help him we will leave because I felt she has had a long day & is now taking it out on us because she feels it's not an Emergency. My son has been at this ER dozens of times & we have never been treated this way. I don't want to ever in my Life step back into this ER as long as I'm breathing because I work in Healthcare as well & our Mission is to always make sure the patient is taken care of. Nurse was Great! Check-in Great! Wait was Ok! The Escort to the room was Great with a Smile! The Patient Coordinator was Great!

After a year I asked to alter my meds because I 'think' i had built up an immunity AND that's when all the confusion started. He stopped talking, even during an office visit....he would just type in his computer.....I was baffled...WHY? I figured it was for the med changes BUT that's what pain management does; Manage Pain by changing meds as needed........but in the last year he's transformed into a \"Mean Robot\"........absolutely NO compassion.....he writes words in \"His Computer\" comments I did NOT say...and I brought it to his attention 'right away'. He treats me with NO respect,does NOT ask any questions,does NOT examine me, it's obvious to me he just does NOT care. He's going on 84 years old and could be entering senile dementia. I understand Doctors,Nurses,Medical Staff get overwhelmed, especially at Cooper Green Mercy.......When you have labs,MRI's,CAT Scans,DEXA SCANS,past surgeries that are non operable and HAVE to be controlled by pain meds.........I know there is a lot of paperwork, especially for Medicaid patients but Doctors take a \"OATH\".........Dr Retan considers himself \"A MAN OF GOD!\"........One day every ONE has to answer to Our God and YOU will be standing before him. ****Treat People, Help People, Give people Respect no matter the LIFE they LIVE in....they NEED help.
