On Friday, September 8, I ended up at this business, experiencing some very scary pain which ended me up at UAB hospital. The lady who helped me offered me her own bed to rest while I waited a couple of hours for my husband to arrive. She took care of me as if I were a close relative and went out of her way to comfort and encourage me. The owners also allowed us to keep our vehicle there for the weekend, as we were unable to pick it up until sometime later that weekend. This type of compassion and unselfishness is a rare quality in today\u2019s world. I\u2019m very appreciative that I happened across your business, and I\u2019m so very grateful for how giving you were.\nI realize this is not a review of the vehicle services to offer, but I believe how you treated me is a very good reflection of the type of business you run....thank you so much for your compassion and hospitality! May the favor of the Lord rest upon you and your business!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889125fb8698f55:0x758eb3575878ad47"}
