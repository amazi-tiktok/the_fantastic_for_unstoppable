It's beautifully planned! Large spaces, nice concrete pads, great layout, wonderful staff, play area, clean ponds/swim area with well thought out and generous landscaping. Clearly a very large budget for this project. I would hands down give those aspects a five star review.\n\n(A little background, we made this reservation after needing to leave the gulf early due to a bad tropical storm and it was the only place that suited the two days between Florida and our KY stay as we made our way home to Northern IL with out three kids under 6.)\n\nAs we settled in on our first night, I could not get past the road noise. Big rigs, tuned trucks with loud tires, bad mufflers and drivers with a lead foot made for relentless noise. The kind that you have to raise your voice over or pause your conversations for. Very heavy traffic, even at 8pm. This is the biggest downfall. Their noise barrier will help in the future but it'll be the far future and won't be enough to drown out the constant drone. An entire row of sites is just beyond the road right of way.\n\nShade- there isn't any for the near future. Fast growing trees are in between each site, but they are young enough to make no difference.\n\nWater pressure is insane. Definitely need a water pressure regulator. If you don't have one, Johnson RV is down the road and it seems they keep those in stock.\n\nThe water park with inflatables looks grand! Awesome for older kids but listed, understandably so, for 6 and up. This is where the ball was dropped for kiddos under 6. Our kids so badly wanted to play out there but the beach didn't have enough shallows nor spectacular seeming activities as there are for bigger kids. We will be taking ours to the splash pad we found in town.\n\nWe also felt as if it was operated by a couple families. It is not. It is city owned. Which is not a bad aspect, just felt a tad misleading under the name Burrow-Hamilton Farm. It was purchased off an estate with the agreement that there would be public use of a portion of the land, or so I read in an article I found.\n\nWe would look elsewhere in the future for something more quaint but this treated us well enough to be north of a tropical storm in between reservations. I was on the fence between two and three stars, mostly because of the road noise and just how close we are to the actual road pavement.

Trash pickup also. Wifi works perfectly and there are spotless bathhouses and laundry (also brand new). The entire property is newly constructed and private, well-maintained and very clean. There are cameras all over so you can feel safe. Great water pressure, too. Very nice people running the place. There are quiet hours so it is very peaceful. Prices are reasonable and definitely worth all the extra amenities.\nBe aware that spots 11 & up are somewhat near a road, but it's not very busy and not so close by that it is bothersome at all.

When my employer sent me to Eufaula I was less than happy,  because it being a small town I thought the Campgrounds and RV parks were few and limited to amenities. After calling the owner on our drive up I was told the rv Park was open and to \u201c come on\u201d, I forgot to mention it would be close to 11p.m when we got there but when I arrived I found 3 after hours numbers to call and it was answered on the first ring. I was told to pick any spot I wanted and to come see them the next day. When we found our spot we backed our 40\u2019 fifth wheel in and was happy to see the spots were very level ! The next day after work I went to pay for our week here and met \u201cJoe\u201d the owner of the park , he was so kind and friendly and told us if there was anything we needed to let him know and he would do what he could to make it happen. So after a few days here I noticed the sewer hookup was above our sewer hose and sewer hose supports, after telling Joe within a week his son had came and fixed every sewer hookup at the park! I was originally only staying a week but after meeting Joe and his sons Chris and Wes and feeling so at home I have been here a month, &  hate that we have to leave for another job.\nIt\u2019s a brand new Rv Park with full hookups and really good WiFi that hasn\u2019t lagged or buffered once! If your traveling through Eufaula Al and need a place to stop this is a great place, and some of the best owners I\u2019ve ever had to deal with!

I was waiting so I would have a few to compare against. We have now stayed in 12(some more than once) since June 2019.\nFirst about us, my fianc\u00e9 is a pipe welder and we live in our RV full time traveling from job to job. We moved into the RV fulltime in June 2019.\nWe are currently in this campground and will be leaving Friday May 1st,2020. Moved camper here to work at GP plant that's less than 2 miles away. And just found out we need to move to Chickasaw for another job.\nLaundry is nice. Campground was just sold so we didn't meet the new owners. Previous owner is very sweet. I'm not sure what the new owners will do but currently there is no one here to pay. She runs a place of business a few miles down the road and comes in the afternoon to get payment after you setup.

As soon as I got there The owners made me feel very welcome. Gregg made sure I had a really good spot to set up my tent. After I got all settled in, I walked up the club house and was introduced to some of the other campers. No one was rude, or made me feel like i was a outsider. Everyone at the camp group visitor and owners alike made me feel like for the first time in my life I could be myself and have fun.\nThe weather was wonderful as well, even though the first day was rainy it was still very pleasant and the rain helped you sleep well. The sun  and the breezes made beginning and the pool just the place to go. If you didn't want to be by the pool you could sit ob the deck  and just chill out. I opted for beginning pool side and had a great time even though i got myself sun burned. NO amount of spf can help if you sit out in the sun to long. The pool its self was great. I had never been in  salt water pool and I loved it. It was just cool enough to help against the heat but warm enough to enjoy it  anytime day or night.\nThe location was awesome, i need to get some things from the little of Columbia  AL near buy and it was very nice . The people and shop owners were all very  friendly.  They told me about different things in the area and where honestly nice. I couldn't find a fake smile from a single one. I even heard a couple of good jokes from one of the ladies from the gas station i visited . It isn't far from the Florida state line and only a couple of hours from Panama city and the beach which was great fun even in the off time i was there. I got a couple of eye sore shirts and enjoyed the beach to some degree.\nBut there was a couple of a draw backs to my time there. One my cell phone didn't really work at the camp site (Thanks t-mobile I will be dropping you as soon as I can!). The supervisor cats really didn't seem to like dog guest  the much. (even thought I loved petting every one of them.)\nBut over all I loved this camp ground and i am working on my next trip to go down as soon as i can.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892ba13069992ed:0x9842cc537703d250"}

(We believe he changed password that day and never had it again.) The pond they have is full of poo and little life. Neighbors knocked on our door asking for food, money, rides etc. on the regular. Not a safe or happy place at all.  One of the biggest things I disliked about this place is it is a FLOOD PLAIN! That was a huge deal for me using a wheelchair unable to see the light of day for days at a time because the water was too high for my $36,000 powered chair. Oh and when you move in they trick you into letting them keep your security deposit, read the contract and don\u2019t sign until they take away that one condition. All in all this is the worst place in comparison to other RV parks. Don\u2019t pay for a patch of grass and bad neighbors that\u2019s all you\u2019ll ever get for $410 here. Someone report them please.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb54edbdce72b:0x897f8ae94b2aed16"}

The picture of the industrial building is wrong and I never saw any rats. That is NOT of the bellingrath rv park. The pictures I posted are the real deal.\nAlso this is a RV PARK. Not a resort or a campground. It is a nice place,  the people who live here are down to earth people.  They are friendly and the staff is helpful.  The owner Mr Dupre and his office manager Peggy were very good to us .  Chris and Bill who work at the park along with a few others.  Worked very hard moving rental campers around to make room for the influx of hurricane Irma evacuees . They also keep the park nice and clean. They have a very nice clean pool which my daughter and I took advantage of.  She's also played with all the children that were here. Needless to say she had a good time playing on the playground and with the other children. Laundry and bath house are clean. About 8 Dollars to wash 3 loads of clothes and dry them. Not bad.  Once again this is a RV park not a resort. People live here. They do have trailers to rent they are dateded.  They have full hookup cable lots of channels. Lots. Disney jr. Football anything you might want to watch.  They are making improvements. Covered concrete slab to park your fifth wheel or diesel pusher. Bus. Or camper. All in all this place was a great place to stay. People are friendly and helpful. My husband, daughter and I will stay here again if we are ever in the area. Also. This RV park is in the middle of everything . The uss Alabama is not far and dauphin park is close also the gulf coast. So listen people if you need a place to stay in a nice clean quiet place to stay for an night, week, month or year check this place out.

When you first go in the woman at the desk named jill will try to act really nice and friendly, but she is really not!!! We stayed there for a few days and we got such a weird feeling staying there that we decided to leave and we had already paid them up for a month. We went and told them we wanted to leave that we need our money back and she kept saying she would have to talk to the owner to come back the next day so we did and she kept saying she couldnt get ahold of him and she doesnt have the key to the safe. So she told us to come back the next morning and still she couldnt get ahold of the owner then she ended up getting ahold of him and she started telling my husband that they could give us our money back and that my husband had agreed on $350 and my husband said no i never agreed to that she said yes you did i have it on camera where you did my husband said well roll the tapes back then i wanna see it and of course she didnt do it ! Anyways somehow she still couldnt get the money because the owner couldnt come again to meet us til like the next week i think it was and my husband explained to her that we cant do that that we needed our money back so we could get back home that was a 10 hr drive and that we had no place to go and she said i will go ahead and let you stay a week for free i know the manager will get mad but im gonna do it! Well the manager ended up comin by our camper on a four wheeler and told us to be up there a little bit before the week was over and we would work something out and my husband said ok. Well we went to the office and still he wasnt there to meet us the woman called him texted him... He still wouldnt come to the office to meet so we could talk to him and finally told the woman to get the money out of the safe, but all she gave us was like $300 and said she would send us $50 in the mail and my husband and i told her no that isnt right you owe us like $580 then she said well he says thats what he owes u my husband said no it is more than that we figured it all up on a calculator right in front of her and she said ill tell u what i will give u the $300 now then send you the rest in the mail even if he dissagrees i will get it out of the safe myself and send it to you so we went ahead and agreed cause we were tired of arguing knowing that we are more than likely going to get ripped off but we were so ready to get home that we just did it. Anyways we get home and call her at the time she told us to and of course jill told us oh i wont be able to give u the $50( she owed us like $280 not $50) because we didnt clean the camper before we left which we did she said that is a $40 fee and we had forgot to give them the key before we left so that was a $10 fee and might i add she was laughing as she told my husband this! So my husband told her she would be hearing from our lawyer and hung up the phone. Oh and one more thing i want to add the second time my husband went to the office to try to get the money back he went by hiself and she went off on him when he asked about the money started hollering and screaming at him my husband said mam i am not raising my voice or nothing i am talking ti you calmly and you are being very rude i just want my money back! My husband ended up just walking out and came back to the camper where i was. And the woman acts like she is under the influence of some kind of speed she talks jerks around really fast! Just take this as a warning do not go here! We never got all of our money back we could take them to court, but would cost more money in the long run since we live 10 hrs away!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb54edbdce72b:0x897f8ae94b2aed16"}

That would have saved us a wasted 23 mile trip both ways. Waterloo is a beautiful place, but I would rather stay on the free TVA land than at this so-called campground. The campground is actually a trailer park with some spots for camping. We stay in many campgrounds, some better than others, but this is the first time we have driven through a campground and left. I could not even find the camp office to begin with and everybody at the trailer park was staring us down when we drove through.\n\nWhen I couldn't find the office, I called the owner back to tell her we had changed our minds. She did not answer her phone. I got a phone call later on from a different number and it was the owner. I let her know that her park was not what we expected and that we had changed our minds. She got an attitude with me and said, \"Thanks for letting me know. I waited for you for over an hour.\" I then informed her that I had tried to call and she didn't answer. I did not bother to mention that she wasted an hour of my time and the gas that I used to drive to her disappointment of a trailer park that she is trying to pass off as a campground. If you do decide to camp in Waterloo, I would suggest that you turn right on the road before you cross the bridge into town and stay on the TVA land.

Our property is 2 businesses, a small campground on the water with bathhouse, boat launch, fishing dock. The main portion are Lake lots that we lease yearly for vacation sites. It's not unusual for people to turn in the wrong drive; I keep meaning to get new signs but since my husband died in March I've been trying to juggle the whole thing alone. After we spoke, I did see that you had called the office number, which is supposed to be transferred to my cell phone. So I called you at 6:10 and we both missed each other. I apologize for my shortness, I have no excuse for that except that 14 hour days, 7 days a week sometimes gets me overwhelmed.   I'm usually pretty nice.  Our campground is usually not full in the fall, and the weather is perfect for camping.

The standard micro wave and dorm fridge are also included. There is enough space to really make it a roomy place. Each cabin also has added boot brush to help clean your boots from a hard days work.

What you failed to mention is that you get that $20 back when you return the key, so you're not out any money.\n\nSecondly, the sites are metered, and tenants are charged .16/kWh for power usage, and one is invoiced anything usage over the $50 allowance.  Anyone is welcomed to monitor their usage by taking note of the meter reading.  It's certainly unfair for a 22' unit to have to pay a higher rent to cover the usage of a 42' unit which has 2 or 3 air conditioner units, therefore, we keep all things even by giving each monthly guest a $50 allowance toward their power.  How they use it is up to the tenant.  You were also here during the summer months when temperatures were extremely high and often record-setting, so yes, you would more than likely have a higher power usage to keep the camper cool.\n\nThirdly, the site you were on is one of our smaller and cheaper sites.  We have larger sites as well.\n\nLastly, we are located next to a scrap yard, and they do move scrap around 6 days a week.  Their weekend noise is no different than during the week.  You must have just been off on the weekends to hear it.\n\nAnd yes, we're continuing to make improvements on the property, including the addition of 21 more sites so we may welcome more guests!"}, "gmap_id": "0x886285bb06e87b7f:0x94a3d5c4ffaec253"}

The young man who is currently serving as camp host was very pleasant and accommodating. However, upon our arrival, it wasn't very clear how to actually check-in. It was mid-afternoon on a Friday and the onsite General Store was closed. There was a sign on the door with a phone number so I called that and we were told to find a site and the camp host would arrive shortly. We stayed in the tent camping section for 3 nights, total cost was $66. Unfortunately the nearest outhouse was quite a walk from our site and we were only about halfway back into the camping area. I've been camping for 34 years and I don't think I have ever had to walk that far to use a bathroom. We had to drive to the bathhouse for showers because it's even farther than the outhouses and it's partway down a 25 mph road without sidewalks. While the bathhouse was pretty clean, the mini trash cans were not emptied the entire time we were there and with only one shower in each of the men/women's bathrooms, we often had to wait in lines with 2 or 3 people ahead of us. There's a great boat launch which was being utilized for a fishing tournament qualifying event the weekend we stayed so there was a ton of trucks/trailers coming and going and when we left in our car for a trip to town, we were blocked into the tent area by trucks lined up to pull their boats out of the water. There are signs posted not to block the road, and I realize how difficult it would be to enforce it, but I would recommend anyone planning to stay to check if similar events might be held and avoid the park at those times. Also, for some strange reason the tent area road was blocked off in several places by rope so we had to kind of forge our own way in some places which concerned me since I don't have a 4-wheel drive vehicle.  I think overall it's a really great campground, we felt isolated from other campers and our site was beautifully situated in the shade on a bluff above Tensaw River. The bugs were kind of bad but that was expected, we were prepared with bug spray. We also kept a smoky fire burning which helped.  I would love to see an outhouse placed in the middle of the tent area since the closest one was at the boat launch. I also recommend adding a map of the grounds to your website. We'd stay here again if there was an outhouse added to the tent area; otherwise, we probably won't come back which sucks because it's really beautiful. We really did enjoy ourselves, though.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1611860781770, "text": "Thank you !"}, "gmap_id": "0x889af4bcafb9bedf:0x6ae3d9a300153c16"}
