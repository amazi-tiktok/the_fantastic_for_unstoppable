Please stay far away if you want an honest assessment and accountability. I will explain the events and you can judge for yourself.  The experience started off quite well, Christian was quick to come out for a consult, where he made the assessment that flying squirrels were the cause of our attic sound.  He then proceeded to hand my husband a contract for $2400 without explaining charges.  My husband questioned the cost and he quickly removed the multi year warranty which lowered the price to $1400. He was then told it would be a week before any exclusion work would be done.  He agreed and waited. The company placed barriers on roof and a one way door to allow squirrels to leave on their own (work happened on a Tuesday).  So we waited some more.  The next Monday.  A week later we were still continuing to hear the SAME noise.  I called the company (twice) before someone named Greg came out to do a check.  He only checked the roof and not the interior of the attic where the sound was, said everything looked good and was working correctly.  We voiced our concerns and he said sometimes they take 3 weeks to leave but that there is a possibility that since the excrement looks similar it could be mice instead but if that was the case it would require a different company. He said they could set traps but would just wait until the follow up the following week. Mind you the amount you pay up front is not refundable AT ALL. so that Monday night once again we hear the noise (2 weeks into the process now and the sound is right above the master bedroom so two weeks with no sleep).  The next day I go to Home Depot and get traps myself.  Place the traps after work (about 7pm) and by 10 pm the have a heart had caught something! But to our surprise.  It was not a squirrel but a mouse.  We release it the next day and reset the trap as well as two old school back cracker style traps, the next morning we\u2019ve caught another.  Still no squirrels.  I call the company obviously irritated (once again takes two calls to get a call back). Greg calls back and is super defensive won\u2019t admit there is a chance that they did not assess the full situation correctly (house was built in the 70\u2019s so sure maybe there was a chance there was old poop up there from something else).  Once again extremely defensive, belittling, opposite of good customer service.  Says he is the boss there is no one above him to discuss my concerns with.  They are currently still supposed to come do a recheck and spray some sort of an enzyme mix to stop squirrels from coming back (that we\u2019ve already paid for at this point) but if Squirrels were not the problem what good is that?? I think even an admission that the initial assessment could have been wrong would have gone a long way but no.  they basically said there is no way to prove that squirrels didn\u2019t leave...even though the sound is still present so the situation is obviously not resolved oh and the icing on the cake, the company does not trap mice.  If your in the Vestavia, AL area please pick a different company if you don\u2019t know for sure the specific animal you have a problem with because this company will be honest upfront.  If Christian had told my husband..look here is what I think but there is a chance 50/50, 75/25 whatever you want to call it that this won\u2019t work to solve your problem because you may have a different problem or two problems...then we would be looking at a different review.  I\u2019m not unreasonable I just expect accountability.  I still have a phone call in to someone at a higher level at the company hoping for some answers  or resolution before taking further action but my hopes are not high.   Best thing I can do is to warn my fellow neighbors and friends.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1608460632653, "text": "Mrs. Wilger,\n\nWe appreciate your review although there needs to be some clarification.

I called back and they were unable to send anyone out to complete the task in a reasonable time frame, so I informed them to refund my money and I would handle the issue myself. I was informed that they could not issue a refund, so I asked to speak to a manager.\n\nThe following day, I spoke to Rick(VP of Ops) and was informed that I should have my refund in the next couple days. I checked a week later and still no refund. I then called Rick back and he apologized and told me that he would ensure the refund was made and would be in my account in the next few days.

He wanted to see what he could do to make up for the awful service that I received from the lawn care part of his business. I told him there really was nothing he could do as I am not one to write a review just to get a discount. He was very nice and offered to refund part of my money but I told him that he did not need to do that. He was concerned about my review being one star as it really hurts the other side of his business as they are tied together. I told him i understood and that I hated for that to happen so I have now raised it to a three-star rating. I cannot speak for his side of the business so it is unfair for me to give the entire business a one star because of the lawn care side.

Issue with them is that they actually don't care about anything except making sure you get a quote for about 4000 to 8000 dollars in water proofing nor will they give you a report with the details of the moisture readings.  My agent called Ecopest and Dustin came out to do an inspection.  He did moisture readings throughout the crawl space and recommended a series of steps to return the crawl space back to its usual condition.  He explained everything in simple terms and I learned a lot from him.  When the work that needs to be done isn't something they do he recommends highly capable people with the same integrity as those that work at Ecopest.

Everyone was friendly, but it was like pulling teeth to get anything done. And it was quite expensive for the very little and inconsistent service I received.\n\nMy first interaction was with a call center and that was pleasant. I was told I would get a call from the local team a day or so prior to our scheduled appointment. I didn't hear from anyone until the day of the appointment; the person who called was pleasant and asked for details on what was going on without actually coming to my property and looking for himself. He believed based on my description that he knew what was up, and said a tech would be out to set up a trap. He said the trap couldn't be baited because of the type of critter but that they had other methods. He explained they would check the trap every 24 hours. That all sounded good and humane. Everything went downhill from there.\n\nThe tech came out and set up a trap. With bait. ?? He also found what may have been the animal's den and there was no animal there, so it may have already moved on before we called the service. But we paid a lot for the service, so we wanted to follow through and make sure. The tech came to check the trap maybe one or two days, and then we never saw him again. A cat got stuck in the trap, and thankfully my husband was checking it regularly or the poor cat would have not made it in the summer heat with no water. We weren't told when they wouldn't be back to check it over a long weekend, and they didn't close the trap prior to that. At one point in this process I also was asked by the tech to close the trap because he couldn't come do it. He couldn't come do the job I paid for, so I had to do it. What?!\n\nWe had several hurricanes back to back and put the trap in our shed. I called and asked that they call when they came to set the trap back up and I would get it out of the locked shed. Never got a call. For over a month.\n\nI finally canceled service (no refunds) and asked two people - the local rep and the national/regional (?) call center to come get the traps (there were three and I explained that to both people). No one ever came to pick up the main trap, though they may have gotten one of the smaller ones. I called again, and again no one picked up the VERY LARGE METAL TRAP in my VERY OPEN AND VISIBLE BACK YARD, but the small rodent trap did disappear.\n\nWhat a gigantic waste of money, and a huge pain to constantly have to nag to try to get things done or taken care of. I do not recommend this company.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1611062134072, "text": "Hi Sarah, we are sorry to hear this was your experience at Trutech.

After checking our attic and seeing that the squirrel had not yet made an entrance into our house, they told us there was nothing they could do.  The guy didn\u2019t even have a ladder to check our gutters!\n\nSo we call Jim from Exclusive Wildlife & Pest Control.  He laughed when I told him the previous encounter with the Critter Capture company and then proceeded to get his ladder (that he brought himself!) and take a look at our gutters and ensure that the squirrel had not damaged our roof yet and also took the time to double check our attic. No damage was noted except for the fire pit cover we caught the squirrel tearing up the previous weekend.\n\nJim gave me two options on how to get rid of our furry new houseguest; we could capture him alive and release him elsewhere or set a trap similar to a rat trap that should kill him instantly. After much discussion my husband and I decided on the rat trap since the evenings here have been very cold and the poor squirrel may freeze to death in a live trap. Jim was so very patient as we weighed our options and was able to give me the pros and cons on both methods.\n\nAfter one failed attempt to trap him (the trap caught his tail instead of his neck) Jim text me throughout the evening to reassure me that he would get him the next day and that all would be OK. Jim returned promptly the next morning, set the trap again and was able to get the squirrel instantly. He disposed of everything and cleaned the nest out of the gutter.\n\nJim was so very pleasant to work with I will definitely be calling again if any other squirrel decides to make his home here!\nI would recommend Jim and Exclusive Wildlife to anyone who is looking for good, quality, and prompt service.\n\nThank you Jim!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBbVC-1NoRZZKkz46lqwpMR0kKMUXVSo0HNWyH=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpMImbqi6WT6TFmbGFntrWu9R1ePdVJL0QITRP=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1548888877159, "text": "Thank you Mike & Stephanie Freeman, it was my pleasure helping you rid your home of your unwelcomed guest and it was nice meeting you."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a1b2dea85547d:0x4c0bde02d4614206"}
