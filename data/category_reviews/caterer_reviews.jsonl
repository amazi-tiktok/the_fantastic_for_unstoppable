I tried placing an online order at 10 am this morning (trying to give them ample time), there was a glitch and my credit card kept getting declined. I called the store and asked to fax the order and pay when I get there, the girl said of course except she didn't even know the correct fax number. I'm ordering sandwiches for a lunch at my office, so there is a time constraint so I figured I can just print off my orders and hand them the list however when I got there the lady made me fill out their stupid bags for all of my orders, so I'm not sure the difference if I just faxed them my order for pickup, thus me not filling out all of the bags. After having to do all of this, I was highly annoyed. The manager told me an order like this (8 sandwiches) would typically take two hours, so if you're in a rush and there are 7 people ahead of you beware because apparently it will take two hours to make all 8 of those sandwiches. The manager/owner kept making up excuse after excuse followed by a lousy apology. When I left with all of my sandwiches, I told her I would make sure to give them a review, she said \"whatever\" followed by yet another lousy apology. I worked in the service industry for years and would never have been rude to a customer regardless of how they act, so her attitude was completely unacceptable.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889177a1f7cd5d3:0x5812cb23c6728c3"}

I wouldn\u2019t give them another penny of my business in my lifetime nor will my family.\n\nFrom the moment we arrived, the two ladies running the front were extremely rude, and acted as if they didn\u2019t want us there at all. Once we were seated, our drinks were slammed down on our table. 15 minutes passed before we saw them again to place our orders, of which we were given major attitudes.\n\nWe ordered a mango lassie, which was very gritty and was made from some sort of powder. The yogurt tasted rotten, and we told the server about it. She snatched it off our table, and rolled her eyes.\n\nWhile we were here, and the 15 minutes passed by, we saw two other tables get up and walk out without ordering because of the terrible customer service given to them by the \u201cmanager\u201d. Please roll back your cameras and watch people walking out after encountering the most rude servers/managers in Huntsville.\n\nThe rice was so dry, we asked for a different entree. Once we got the bill, she refused to take off the drink that cost $3.99 because we took one single sip out of it to find it wasn\u2019t good, and the yogurt was sour. She said \u201cyou took a sip so you\u2019re paying for it\u201d. I told her that was ridiculous, that it was rotten, and she rolled her eyes, snatched my debit card from my hand and charged it.\n\nI asked where the manager was, and she said \u201cI\u2019m the manager\u201d and laughed. I truly hope the owners read this review because I have been a very loyal customer to this location, and the chef despite the Ruchi drama. Now I\u2019ve decided to never come back here.

With that in mind, I decided to try the Lamb Tikka Masala. It was served in a metal bowl. There were a great deal of lamb in the mixture (see the photo). There was also a lot of it. I ate about half of the dish and got a take-out box for the remainder to enjoy it later.\n\nIt was a tomato cream sauce with spices harboring a different flavor than I am used to experiencing. It looked like a thick tomato bisque soup and had some tomato flavor but with different spices.\n\nI also had a Naan bread to accompany the dish. It was very much like the pita bread often served in Greek restaurants and had a similar flavor. There were four large slices of bread.\n\nOverall, the meal was very filling.\n\nMy dining companion ordered the Tandoori chicken. It is pieces of chicken with yogurt and spices and cooked in a clay oven. I had one of the chicken pieces and liked it very much. Again, a different spice than I am used to having but it tasted good.\n\nThe chicken was served on a plate that was sizzling when it came out. Obviously, it was very hot and an impressive presentation with the chicken sizzling rapidly.\n\nFor a drink, I ordered Masala Tea. Again, I had never had this tea and ordered it on a whim. It was very good. Strong black tea with milk and spices, probably cinammon and some other spices. It was robust and filling and served hot.\n\nThis restaurant is in the back of a shopping center and can be easy to miss. Until we got close, I did not see the sign although we were looking for it.\n\nThe meal was tasty and the prices were very reasonable. The servings were generous and many adults will have food left over to take home for another meal.\n\nFor those who have not tried Indian cuisine, this would be a good place to start.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6dsTnmwlDgq5lxG1NHW_vXiSY8narQmHiffWE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOT_MuHJ-Q5Tdy1zWssaxlpTxYznq_o_cLMc7dU=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1626811951087, "text": "Thanks Ralph for you good review.

I sometimes like to sit and grab a bite between classes. The food is bit bland, but I have never had any problems with my order. One day I did and was treated horribly for the complaint. I ordered the Camile club with no mayo. When I received my sandwich, it had mayo. So, I calmly went back up and explained that I didn't want mayo. I was told it could be fixed.\n\nWhile waiting on my sandwich, I noticed the staff watching me and speaking quietly, but I ignored it. 5 minutes later I was called back and when I went to check my sandwich again, I noticed the residue from mayo. It looked as if someone had wiped the mayo off and changed the bread. Again, calmly, I went back up (once again noticing the staff snickering) and asked to speak to the manager for a refund. Said-manager whose name I couldn't get, claimed she was there the whole time they \"remade\" my sandwich and it was fresh. I told her that couldn't be the case because it was now cold, it took her less time to make it than originally and I showed her a piece of lettuce that had mayo in it.\n\nShe then rudely asked me if I still had my receipt, which I did. I was given a refund, but I don't appreciate the way I was treated. If I'm paying for a meal, I expect it to made the way I requested it. I didn't ask them to make me a sandwich befitting God.

My wife and I are not in Auburn so we chose this company to deliver an arrangement for Valentines Day for my mother-in-law in Opelika. We ordered a higher dollar item other than the lower priced special. Specifically for the reason of having more fruit and less chocolate as we were hoping for something a bit healthier because of health issues. They charged our credit card for the higher priced item we ordered but delivered the lower price special with added chocolate and it was a smaller item. In addition to the wrong item - they did not deliver it on Valentines Day. We called several times and they acted nice at first and promised to deliver the item the next day. Late in the day mom called and said it was never delivered. We called back and it was being delivered late in the day - a day late - and it was the wrong item, not the higher priced one we paid for.\n\nWe called again and one of the employees admitted they went to the wrong house on Valentines day so somebody got the higher priced item. My wife called again to at least get a refund for the overcharged amount or to have the right item delivered. We were promised the right item would be delivered. The next day, no delivery.\n\nAt this point, several days after Valentines Day my wife gave up so I started calling, was promised a refund or a deliver of the right item. There was no refund or proper delivery. I was then promised at least a call back from the owner, then another promise, another promised call back. I never heard back.\n\nMy mother in law never received the correct item and and we never got the refund. We finally tried to cancel payment with credit card and to get a refund but they disputed it - said that the item was delivered. Did not mention that it was the wrong item, and that it was late, missing Valentines Day. I'm sorry that they delivered the item, possibly twice, to the wrong house, and then the wrong item to the right address. That's three deliveries, three trips, three items. However, those mistakes are not our fault.

So I ask him did they not put onions on the sandwiches anymore,  and he stated yes, so he grabbed a knife that had been hanging on the wall, so I thought he was going to clean it, it was already dirty, I said are you going to clean that, he stated to me, very nasty, its what I have used all day, I said, I don't care, don't use it on my food, he then he got mad and stated to the other employee who was standing there, finish this order and then I really wanted my money back, He stated he didn't want to fool with the register, so I ask for corporate number, and he stated I am corporate, I stated okay, but I am going to take this further than you, I took those sandwiches and fed them to my dog.

Fresh, juicy tomatoes burst with sweetness along with pungent garlic. The sweetness and acidity of the balsamic add another layer of flavor and fresh basil turns it up with herbaceous flair. Rating: 4.5/5\n\nBrie and Marmalade Bites starts with a phyllo cup filled with orange marmalade, brie, and herbs. It is a light bite and would be great as a passed hors d\u2019oeuvre for a wedding or corporate event. The creamy brie combined with the sweetness and citrus flavor of the marmalade pair perfectly together. Rating: 5/5\n\nCaesar Salad is made with fresh romaine lettuce tossed with house-made Caesar dressing with anchovy. I love Caesar salad but it is very hard to find a place that makes it correctly. If you do not like anchovies, do not order a Caesar salad. It is just not a Caesar salad without it. Chef David makes a great Caesar salad dressing, not too thin and not too thick. The perfect viscosity to cling to the lettuce. I love that Chef David makes a crostini seasoned with butter, salt, and pepper instead of chunky, clunky croutons. It\u2019s easier to eat and elevates the salad as well. Chef David, you need to bottle and sell that dressing! Rating: 5/5\n\nChicken Marsala is made with mushrooms, shallots, garlic, and parsley served over angel hair pasta. The chicken gently bathes in the sauce and really infuses the flavors into the chicken. It is tender and unlike any chicken marsala I\u2019ve ever had. But that sauce is like liquid gold. It clings to the angel hair pasta like silk sheets. You can\u2019t help but lick the plate afterwards. I could see this on a fine dining establishment\u2019s menu. It is so refined and delicious! Rating: 5/5\n\nChocolate Fondant (Americans refer to this as a chocolate lava cake or molten chocolate cake) is basically a bi-product of a flourless chocolate cake and a souffl\u00e9. Chef David served his with macerated strawberries and strawberry coulis. If you go to my Instagram, I have a video of the chocolate \u201clava\u201d flowing from the cake. I have tried many of these in my lifetime, but I think this was the best. I don\u2019t know if it was because I had right out of the oven but it was just amazing! The perfect ending to a perfect meal!

It's located inside of the Wavaho gas station, so you can buy more then what they sell at Subway, so you can get a candy bar or anything else to go with your meal instead of only chips. Don't get me wrong, though; I do enjoy their chips. I also love the avacado/guacamole season, which happens every summer. I LOVE their avacado and guacamole sandwhich toppings. You can choose any toppings you want, or just order something on the menu. I almost never order from the menu. I just choose exactly what I want my sub to be, which is what Subway's all about. I love this location because it's like right near my house, so it is really convenient for mybfamily and I to order take out. If you want to eat IN the place, they do have a single two-peeson table you can eat at. If you are passing by this nice building, you can stop by and get some Subway, as well as anything else they sell at a gas station/car oil place. Thank you for reading my review of this unique Subway location, and I hope that I could help you choose weather or not to visit it.

I was informed that I should try to get in contact with someone at the store (as if it's so easy) and my complaints would be passed on to the manager.

After multiple incidents, I finally walked away without my order.  She had one person's order she was making when we arrived.  She asked us what we wanted and I told her we wanted 4 sandwiches so we'd wait for her to finish and check out the woman already there.  She complained that she was all alone and she didn't want to avoid taking off her gloves to save time.  So then when we tried to tell her our order, she kept asking what we wanted, and I kept repeating it every time she kept saying it wrong.   Then after several go arounds she said she'd fix the sandwiches but we needed to tell her what we want. I said I had and asked if she could hear me, and she said she couldn't because there was too much noise.  That was about the time another customer came in.  So I spoke louder and began repeating the order once again, and she interrupted me and told me to hold that thought.  And then proceeded to finish and wrap the sandwiches for the woman ahead of us very very very slowly.  At around this point in time, I looked and it was 4:06 pm.  We had pulled into the parking lot at about 3:51, and upon entering the store I briefly looked at produce then went into the restaurant.   She made several remarks through the course of this time she had started with our order at  about 416. She said she had problems just like me and that the customer wasnt always right and that she wasnt disrespecting me.  Yeah right.  I was in an amigo so these things she bent down and said then through the glass. Then asked me if I understood her.  I told her I didn't.   I heard her but I had no understanding of what she was trying to communicate.  Her response to that was \"see, now you know what I mean\". The woman behind me told the little girl with her not to say a word to this employee because she was frustrated because she was working alone.\n\nShe mixed up the sandwiches, and instead of 2 BMTs, there was 1 and 2 hams instead 1.  This is when I realized she had put pickles and mayo on the wrong sub.  My husband said he didnt want it with the mayo on it.  So i tried to tell her he wasnt going to pay for it and she told me she would  throw them out and had another customer, so I needed to decide what I wanted.\n\nI have never been treated so rudely and it wasn't just what she said , it was how she said it.  It was 4:23 when I finally gave up.  I walked over to a Walmart customer service person to see if I could talk to the subway manager but she and 2 others didnt seem to know anything about it.\n\nSo... at 4:26, we exited the store, and drove a few miles away to the Subway in town across from Dollar General.

Plus the food my mother and stepfather got tasted bad and he wanted to bring it back. My point, you should at least INFORM YOUR CUSTOMERS SO THEY CAN MAKE THE BEST DECISION BASED ON THEIR MONEY. For 1 dollar more I could have had twice the sandwich. If i could give 0 stars i would. This is my first review on this subway and i never try to give bad reviews working in the food industry myself.

Yes, I could understand being open for 30 minutes and not having the bread done, but two hours is absolutely ridiculous. So, I travelled to another subway up the road to see if the situation was the same. The man in this store was very friendly as he already had his bread done. I called the manager of this subway of which I experienced the bread not being done and she informed me that it was not a priority nor the first thing they do. If you do not have your bread done by time you open, simply change your hours. It is SO RUDE for customers to be under the impression that they can \"eat fresh\" when they can't even eat at all. While on the phone with this manager, I asked if all the subways did this. She replied with \"no.. wait I mean yes.\" I explained to her I went to another subway directly 10 minutes after I was told there was no white bread done but he seemed to have all of his stuff together. She informed me that it could have been left over bread from yesterday, but it was not.

So I wanted to surprise him for Christmas with a pan of this fantastically rich dessert complete with whiskey sauce. I called the catering number the day before Christmas Eve and the most delightful, professional voice answered on the other end and talked to me like we were best friends for ages. Her name is Jennifer and she took my order, told me how to pick it up and let me at the door on Christmas Eve with instructions. All with a smile, and a ease that made me feel like if nothing else happened during the hectic holiday, Bright Star catering made me feel like the Christmas spirit was alive and well.\n\nPlanning events are stressful, whether it be a family gathering, a wedding or what have you. Do yourself a favor. Call Jennifer at Bright Star catering and let her ease your mind. Your guests will be well fed and you will be taken care of.

I live out of state and for my sisters 16th birthday we wanted to do something special for her so we decided to have an edible arrangement with balloons delivered to her high school. 72$ later they didn't deliver the balloons and when I called to get a refund for the balloons a man named Bryant answered the phone. I really just would have been fine if they were apologetic towards the situation and cared but instead in a monotone voice the response I was given was \"well sometimes we miss things, do you have the card so I can refund the money\". Outstanding response sir. Needless to say I told them my fianc\u00e9 would call them with the card information. When he called the owner answered and again was not very sympathetic to the situation. He decided a refund wouldn't matter since the surprise for her birthday was ruined anyways. She had the balloons delivered the next day that we paid for already and a box of 6 complementary strawberries sent with it. At the end of the day if someone in this business would have ACTED like they cared that their business took away from what should have been a special sweet 16th birthday delivery I wouldn't have such a bad taste in my mouth for this company.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889218882bfade3:0x9aead16373f89bf3"}

Good though with their famous lemonade I always bought in brookwood mall homewood Alabama as an employee of both end chain stores when I was in retail employment. Things are vastly different these days. I took my minimum wages way more seriously than majority and as a result the easiest to be the odd ball Not defying the odds that hard work pays. It leaves you struggling in poverty. But Im sure that's bitterness rubbing off on me. Got a good photo as my other favorite thing to do getting odd shots most get paid big bucks in print media. My phone controls the best of me but I got this from my destination mall and purpose on a gorgeous stressfilled easter weekend. In auburn Alabama where I worked in undergraduate school there at now gone jcpennys and got my earring piercing on top of my ear that took a year to heal because I kept hitting it with the phone receiver back in 1989 rather than continue commuting on weekends back to my hometown birmingham mall as manager of lingerie and top sales in accessories. When stockings used with garter belts came 3 to a box and my thighs slightly smaller but not much. Its control top reinforced toe now for sharp talon nails on eagle soarers. My joke of the city. And the river a few miles before this chick-fil-a restaurant. If you ordered a ice cream cake from now replaced Badkung Robbins in toomers corner I made it as the cake maker/ decorator for a quarter. Loved that job slicing tubs of ice cream and layering with cake then icing with melted cream inside the cooler before piping your favorite slogan on it. Lastly, was now gone a different cooler in environmental management for water samples which storied life experienced escaped discussion in the water sludge cleaning treatment process I endured to get mosquitos in my puddled location.

{"user_id": "105255837679235920479", "name": "Alyson Gulledge", "time": 1546482714021, "rating": 1.0, "text": "After having so many mistakes with my orders throughout the past few months at the Chick-Fil-A in Sylacauga, today really topped it off. After my order being messed up and one of my coworkers not getting lunch, I called and let them know the order was not included. This was around 11:30ish. The girl told me her general manager wasn\u2019t there and she would have to get approval from him to fix my order. And she tried telling me I would have to somehow prove that the order wasn\u2019t included, asked me to bring it all back up there when I had already distributed over 5 orders to my coworkers! Not even 20 minutes later Kayleen Turner called them and she says the general manager is there he is just busy, so they lied and she called them out on it and the girl had nothing to say but she offered to bring us the order. She didn\u2019t even want it anymore so she said no just to refund her money. I get a call HOURS later saying I would have to go in the store and get cash because they can\u2019t process it otherwise. Okay, cool. It was very inconvenient but sure. Shortly after they called me, they called Kayleen and she wasn\u2019t able to answer because she was in the middle of selling a car. So after, she called back and said \u201cHey I missed a call from y\u2019all, it was probably about the order for Alyson\u201d and the girl HUNG UP ON HER! So I went in and not once did the manager apologize, not once did she seem to care about the inconvenience, I even brought up the fact that her coworker lied to me on the phone and she said \u201cthe gm didn\u2019t get here until 11.\u201d I told her it was well after 11 that I called and she had nothing to say, did not apologize, just said \u201chave a good night.\u201d and quickly went on to help another customer. Y\u2019all after working in the food industry for so long, it baffles me how some fast food employees AND managers can be so unprofessional, especially when they work at the number one fast food restaurant in the country and are known for treating customers with kindness. I promise I never want to be THAT person, but there\u2019s only so far you can push me. I have never been one to try to lie and haggle to get free food out of any restaurant, and it pisses me off that THEY messed up my order, lied to me, treated me unprofessionally, but I am looked at by them as one of those customers that was there to cuss someone out over them leaving a chicken nugget out of my nugget meal. It is literally not hard at all to treat a customer the right way and I just can\u2019t comprehend how that is so hard for some people to understand. \ud83d\ude11", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1546486752558, "text": "Hi, Alyson.

Don't forget dessert.  The pecan pie and lemon pie are the best around. If you've got the time to wait, their steaks are excellent too.

To my enthusiasm n surprise, Country's BBQ. I grew up in Columbus, Ga and go back from time to time. And EVERY TIME I do go back 1st place I stop is Country's. I LOVE Columbus Country BBQ and longed for it. About 3pm when we first walked in, the Mgr told us \"to walk over there, grab a menu and seat where ever we wanted\". There was 2 other couples in dining area. The waitress was outstanding!! I don't remember her name, but she was super bubblely. But we were so disappointed with the food. I ordered my usual; pulled pork platter. Husband ordered his usual; 1/2 chicken. Well the pork was drowned in chutney n coleslaw juices, which totally ruined the taste mainly b/c I don't like chutney. I used a numerous amount of napkins to dry up the juice. Husband's chicken looked liked it was cooked the day before or real early that morning. The BBQ sauce was dried and skin was wrinkled up and some spots were burnt. It was very dry. Husband informed waitress and she was very helpful and offered another one, fresher or something else. He ordered another chicken. The 2nd chicken was a more moist but didn't compare to the taste of Country's in Columbus. If Jim is affiliated with this establishment, he would be ashamed. Also, the Mgr had fixed a plate for herself and sat and ate. Not once did she come over to ask about why we sent it back.  How convenient it would've been since we travel through Montgomery often and it's closer than Columbus for us. Needless to say, we won't be coming back or if by some chance we do, we will hope to remember and not order the same thing.......", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1448860779322, "text": "Dear Pamala,\n\nI am so sorry to hear about your recent experience at our Zelda Road location.

We picked up the order 10 minutes later and noticed there was only one person dining in Country's BBQ, 4 staff in the kitchen and one or two staff in the dining area. About 4 orders were picked up while we waited 10 more minutes (added item to order) for our order. After getting home I realized my 1/2 and 1/2 order of fried pickles and onions was far from being fried.  In fact it was very clear they had gone straight from the container to my take out container. Not cooked what-so-ever. I was soo disappointed. Was really looking forward to trying the side dishes. Now I travel a lot and have been to great BBQ places across the US and outside the US and this is definetly not one of them. Anyone who says Country's BBQ is great has not had good BBQ. Aside from the poorly prepared side dishes the BBQ (chicken and beef) was just okay, definetly not worth mentioning.

He appeared with crackers and asked if we wanted to feed them, and then told us all about them.

The raw oysters were rather large, but then again I live in Colorado so large might be the norm. I remarked that they were the largest I've seen, and Chris went on to tell us about the giant ones they get there and seemed very engaged in his job.\n\nThe gumbo was fantastic and the pineapple upside down cake was 'extra caramelly' according to our waiter, which was great.\n\nThe manager even came over to check on us at one point and we had a really nice conversation about the Bienville vs chargrilled.\n\nTop notch, one of our best meals in Orange Beach to be sure.

The decor and flow of the building is outstanding and I also understand that it just opened up so it IS gonna be packed and service will be slow as they try to  weed things out. Only been open maybe a week. We did wait for awhile for food but it was worth it. I'm sure the wait times will improve with the upcoming weeks. But yes parking was an issue having to park in the grassy dirt location next to the parking lot. Hopefully they can maybe purchase that lot and extend the parking lot. The food however was outstanding when we got it. Hot and tasty. Our server was attentive and everything was delivered properly\u200b and food came out perfectly.

Let me start by saying the food was great, as expected from eating at this chain in other locations. The food deserves 5 stars in my book and I'm very picky about pizza. Now for the bad. The restaurant was packed , understandably due to it just opening however, with over 50 tables you would think they would have more parking. We ended up parking in a dirt lot between it's parking lot and the place next to it. We spent between 2 and 2 and a half hours there a hour waiting for our pizza and 15 minutes eating. The remainder of the 45 minutes spent waiting for whatever we requested from our waitress who was slow and forgetful. She also brought my 3 yr old sons drink in a bar glass then proceeded to say she wasn't sure if it could be transferred to a to go cup but was willing to bring me a cup to pour it in. After 30 minutes of waiting and asking multiple times I gave up and asked a different waitress for a cup. She didn't take our menus till the end of the meal. She took our orders and we waited 15minutes  for them after already being their and seated for a minimum of 10minutes she brought out the appetizers and still had not brought any of us the water we asked for when we first sat down. This is not acceptable service in my book. I will be eating their again bc the food was so good however I will be requesting a different server if sat in her section.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1493270679443, "text": "Hey Kameron!

We asked our server if our pizza was ready and she went to check. She brought out a large pizza and placed it on the table. I looked at it and said, that's not our pizza. She took it back. My wife at this point was pretty frustrated because we were both pretty hungry. Almost 5 mins later she brings out our pizza. She explained that they put our pizza into a to-go box and got it mixed up with someone else's order. I can tell the pizza was probably sitting in the to-go box awhile because our pizza didn't taste fresh. At this point, we were not going to wait longer to get another fresh pizza.

My group of 5 got sat in a round booth. After 25 minutes of us just sitting there, server and after server walking by, I went up to the host stand and tried to nicely let her know we'd been here for almost a half hour and hadn't been greeted. She said she would get right on it, took 10 more minutes for anyone to get over to us. The girl who ended up being a server didn't even mention how long it taken her to get to our table (35 minutes at least) which is what I was really shocked by. Ended up being pretty rude too but whatever. The 2 stars are because I loved the food and drinks.

We do offer a unique assortment of pizza combinations, but do not fret, you do have the option to build your own pizza as well! Please be aware that we encourage creativity, and you are able to build a pizza HOWEVER you'd like! So if a pizza that we have already designed does not sound appetizing to you, we are perfectly ok with you building your own :) As of now a pizza buffet is not something that we offer, due to our standard of baking. Every order is made to order, and having them on a buffet would only make them less fresh, less up to our standards, and more soggy. Either way, this does not qualify your less than great experience with us and we truly apologize!

I ask the representative when was the soonest they could deliver the arrangement?  She told me they could deliver it around 12 Noon on Thursday, August 16, 2018.  I told her that would be great and to please get it there as close to Noon as possible.  She said they would.  I called Edible Arrangements at 12:30pm to see if my order had been delivered. The lady told me it was on the table being finished.  I told her it was supposed to be delivered at Noon and asked her when would it be delivered.  She told me by 2pm.  Bottom line, they did not get the arrangement delivered until 4:45pm and where they had to deliver it to was less than 3 miles from the Edible Arrangements shop.  I called and spoke to the manager and she didn't care at all about the problem and said there was no way they could have gotten it there by Noon.  I ordered it the day before. They open at 8am and you can't fix, arrange and deliver an arrangement by Noon and it is less than 3 miles from your place of business?  Something is wrong with your Business Plan then.  I called and complained to corporate  and they said they would have the owner call me from the Mobile, Alabama location but, I have not received a call yet.  I spent over $100.00 and the business delivered it when they wanted to not, when I wanted them to.  If I don't hear from the owner this week, I'm sending it to my attorney. I know it's just a $100.00 but, it's about the principle of the matter.  This business did not do what they said they would do and they have not even offered an apology, much less a refund.  Well, I expect a call and if I don't get one, it will most certainly cost them more than$100.00.

So shout out to Bailey (hopefully that's how it's spelled) for putting some love into my favorite pizza, The White Rabbit. Keep the oven hot for me because I will be back for another piece of pie!! Thank you Miss Cece for having such a wonderful staff.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e856ea43b91d5:0x8137de843540196c"}

People who had walked in the last ten minutes are seated. I listened to them sign in (no, they did not have reservations)They are seated within 10 minutes, 4 if them, 4 of us. I questioned it. She said our name was not on the list. I told her I watched her write it on there because it said \u201cand a booster seat\u201d.m and noticed she was left handed. Told her 2 names now on bottom of list and 7 families waiting. She said the list must have been accidentally erased by another employee. We have been sitting there the whole time. She was the only employee at the hostess desk. She came and went back and forth, cleaning tables, and hanging out with waitresses talking and laughing. She didn\u2019t go around to see who all needed to be added back so lots of complaints. One guy ask her would it be much longer, if so, he needed to leave and go somewhere else. She said, \u201cbye\u201d. They did not have on name tags. She had short, one length, dark curly hair, blue eyes. The waitresses were standing around talking. People would leave and the table would be empty over 30 minutes before they\u2019d clean it and seat someone. Poor management and hostess with bad attitude. Also goofing off waitresses. Man with grey hair and beard making pizzas had mask wrapped around his neck, not covering nose or mouth, right over the pizza\u2019s. Bleach blonde guy flicking his hair everywhere and digging ear wax out his ear with gloves and looking at it did not change gloves and leaned up on pizza counter where pizzas were. Bathroom beyond filthy. Took over an hour to get pizza. New waitress in training was the only one not goofing. They had a lot of employees and only half capacity. I\u2019d hate to seen it if it were full capacity. They will close soon. Grey haired, grey beard man came to table at the end and asked how was it?  He had no solution to the waiting list getting erased and act out out because I complained. I have a solution. Do away with the dry erase board and wet rag and try a paper and pen and hire a hostess that doesn\u2019t have an attitude problem, wear you mask correctly, and provide service.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e856ea43b91d5:0x8137de843540196c"}

I\u2019ve had the misfortune of frequenting this establishment 7 times since it opened up. And every single time was extremely negative. The first problem is every single time I\u2019ve went was during a week day around 2-3 in the afternoon and the place was nearly empty and we were seated and promptly forgotten about every single time I\u2019ve ever been there. I could possibly understand that if there was ever any more than 3-4 other couples in the establishment besides us but no the place has been absolutely almost empty every single time (of the 7) I\u2019ve been there. The last time was around a couple of years ago. I went with my cousins wife and we ordered some of that humus bread she ordered a small pizza I ordered a sandwich. Well the humus came a couple minutes later her pizza came but my sandwich never did so I wound up eating the humus. When we were ready to go (waiter was nowhere to be found as usual there in a empty restaurant) I stood up and said hey we decided we do not want the sandwich can we just get the check for the rest we need to go. Well they tried to rapidly make the sandwich and give it to me with me telling them I did not want it. I didn\u2019t want it because we were going several places and I didn\u2019t want the food rotting and stinking up my car. Then they shoved the unwanted sandwich at me basically forcing me to take it and the waiter proceeded to start saying don\u2019t blame him cause he isn\u2019t the cook. Now he said to this to me and I worked in the restaurant business for 15 years and I knew they were having the chit chat hour and possibly doing side work. I told him well you should have asked the cook why your entire order wasn\u2019t up. In a nutshell he actually started cussing me etc. Me and my my cousins wife left the childish pathetic situation threw the sandwich in the nearest garbage can and I\u2019ve never went back to that establishment again and never will. From the 7 incidents I\u2019ve had there frankly I\u2019m amazed they have any clientele at all. I should have written this a long time ago but I had a lot of things going on in life and just now got the opportunity when the subject was brought back up in a conversation last night. This is NOT a fake review before the owner wants to chime in and claim so I\u2019ll happily provide my receipts. If I could give this establishment negative stars I would. I do not recommend this establishment to anyone of any age group for any reason. Unfortunately this is the second negative review I\u2019ve felt obligated to give and I\u2019m upset with myself for not addressing the last incident back when it happened", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e856ea43b91d5:0x8137de843540196c"}

Ok 30 minutes later my daughter gets her pretzel dippers and they were almost as big as her and hard as all get out. You could have broken a glass with it. Ok about another 30-35 minutes past and my husband still has not gotten his calzone. It finally arrives and its cold. The waitress has not even checked on us since we got our drinks. The hostess again was nice enough to bring him silverware after we tried to get the attention of our server for about 10 minutes.

It's a shame because we were told this was the best BBQ in Alabama. I unfortunately am going to disagree with that claim.\n\nWe ordered take out for a party we were having. Several pounds of pulled pork and pulled chicken. The BBQ was ok, nothing spectacular. We did however have quite a few bones in both the chicken and pork which was alarming since we have young children who were also eating the food. I will say that the sauce itself was pretty good. So there was at least one positive.\n\nThe real disappointment with this establishment came to the bill. Total for our order was $150 which was split with another party. Rather than charging myself $75 and the other party $75, they charged me $150, then charged me again $75, then charged me again another $75. The other part was double charged as well. Upon complaining to Full Moon, I was told that I was not charged multiple times and that it was an issues with both my bank, and the other parties bank. It's now the next week and they are still in fact trying to charge my bank the additional charges, that is per my bank.\n\nWould you like to pay over $400 for only $150 of sub-par BBQ? Probably not.

I'm kinda open to new places and exploring as long as the food is great and the place is clean. Didn't take me too long to find it overall the place was nice and clean but it had a tourist trap vibe sadly most of the places in this area trying to compete for your almighty dollars. I'm more into comfort food cafeteria style food and awesome BBQ but none to be found that I knew about in this area so I decided for this place. Wish I could sample the food at places to decide what tasted awesome? I got a Brisket chicken platter. The food was not bad good portions self serve on drinks and BBQ sauces to me a little pricey but overall not bad but to me it kinda lacked a smoked flavor? I've eaten a lot of BBQ over the years and I know good BBQ. Overall, the place had a bunch of celebrity pictures on the wall with TV's in the corner kinda felt more like a sports bar than a BBQ place? The place was clean and probably not a bad place to take a friend or meet up with someone as it was convenient but depends what you are looking for and how picky you are in great BBQ.

With that said, I had an experience there that has me rethinking my BBQ choices. My family and I went to Full Moom last weekend to celebrate my son's birthday. We ordered the smokey wings like we always do, as well as ribs, greens, mac and cheese, and fried okra. The sides were tasty as always, the okra cooked a little too hard, but edible. The wings however were smoked, but very raw inside. I am not sure why because it took them an hour to bring out the wings in the first place. When we brought this to the attention of the staff, they apologized and said they are not smoking anymore wings so we would have to choose something else. We specifically came for the smoked wings, but we had already been there over an hour at this point and just wanted to consume a meal. They were suppose to replace two 10 piece orders, buy brought two six pieces. Once this what brought to their attention the server got upset and said you need to go up to the register with your concern and they will work out a refund. So not only did they have cook my food, short me my food. I waited in a 20 min line to get reimbursed for services not rendered. This was my first bad experience at full moon, but sometimes that is enough. I sent a message to the survey on the back of the receipt and not one person's follow-up up.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1570205301172, "text": "Hi Anthony, thank you for your feedback.

Having moved back to Atlanta a few years ago, I was super excited to go back on a recent family visit,  and enjoy my fave- the veggie burger and fries. My daughter and I specifically planned our journey to include stopping there when we hit town that Saturday night  2 weeks ago. Where do I begin?... There were like 5-6 people at the front desk, which was a little confusing in itself. They seemed to be way overstaffed. But they were  all as nice as they could be.  But nice cannot make up for mistake-upon-mistake. First,  I placed the order to include no condiments, and extra lettuce & tomatoes. I mentioned it again as several girls were discussing the order,  and even saw one go up to the window and verbally repeat that to the cooks. Also asked it be cooked well. Second, I had told them we'd be eating outside bc I had my puppy with me...a little bit later,  I asked for something to clean the table off with.  It took a long time for the order to arrive (it was only 2 simple items), but they brought it in sacks, not having remembered or registered the fact that we were eating outside. Which caused the fries to steam inside and get soggy.... they had to go back in and put the orders on plates. And when mine came out-zero lettuce or tomato, and not well-done.  There really was no excuse for any of that to happen: listening and paying attention to details, and follow through are key in customer service positions.  They were all SO friendly,  and nice,  it makes this difficult to submit.  But I feel management needs to know.  I don't think anyone in charge was there that night.  Just overall not my best experience at Chappy's...", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2c8177261065:0x2b7335e360592242"}

We picked up some of their chicken salad and lobster bisque soup from the to go market section. Nice feature especially if you need to grab something quick.

So we have been waiting for a long time to try this place out since we didn't want to drive to Auburn to try that one.\nFirst walk in it is very impressive and a very nice re do on the Atlanta Bread Co layout.  Friendly staff and very fast service from the time you order. We arrived at 11 right when they opened since it has been very busy but from the moment you go inside, the order counter is right in the doorway which doesn't allow much space to wait to place your order.\nThe soups are to die for and the salad was amazing. The pesto chicken sandwich was a bit much for my liking . It had too much pesto and almost no chicken.\nThe only main thing why I couldn't give it 5 stars was the fact that like every 2 minutes Andrew was coming by talking to us. I mean , ok, maybe we are more introverted than most but come on, we couldn't take a bite and here he was back again talking to us and trying to clear our plates. We joked about the next time we would go back we would get our food to go so we could enjoy it.\nThe kids got a pizza which OMG was sooooo good . Couldn't understand what the big deal was to just put pepperoni on half but no big deal really.\nWe def wanna go back and try other items on the menu for sure.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2kEC4nRdgMGkMMqtgI9cToLelVLxEGHAoACfG=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnakF6qmbMQ0_pX0dnOtLT2S5LW6oxN-EiAsHv=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhKLh1bzVOmv6gCHjZYGyL4Rg86I3srY8ghmWm=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyVxnpK1Y-i547IuE74of0dM6ZApLtrOPXkRWv=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhU4eCiGMx_L2FmOAkjDsK7vGVJLXioM_-B8AK=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9g9YyNiMwcQeKLAGQeCFdbXZGN1v24T41_Olz=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccb4ab17fdc0f:0x18a9f59cd403b696"}

I didn't see anyone at EITHER cash register so as I went to take my mother to the restroom I came back up and asked where do I place my order order as there still wasn't anyone present at any register. I went to the front with one of the ladies. I asked her about her suggestions and I order d a sandwich based on it with a fruit cup for my mother. I ordered a veggie pizza with no artichokes, no olives, no goat cheese and no basil garnish with a large bottle of Acqua Panna spring water. Whwn was all said and done we BOTH went through the order THREE times but there were STILL a few discrepancies. I was never offered a bottle opened for a NONscrew top so as the lady looked at me struggling thinking why would they give nonscrew top without offering to open it? I walked up and a male came to me and asked me did I need help? The same lady who took my order then came by me and asked me did I need help and I told her this was not a screw off top and sarcastically said that was I supposed to open this with my teeth. She just walked away. The guy said sorry about that and opened it. Sat down and soon after the food was brought to us by the same girl and I noticed my mother was looking extra hard at the fruit cup. I asked her what was wrong and she didn't want it... I asked her was everything okay until I saw the hair on the fruit. Totally disgusted I took it up to he kitchen and told the same girl who seemed to dismiss that there was hair on the fruit and said would you like chips instead. I got my mother her chips (at least I know that we had a better chance of it being sanitary since it was in a bag). When I finally was about to eat my pizza that was clearly on the burnt side I noticed that there was an ingredient that I specifically asked NOT to have on my pizza that was still put on my pizza. Side note my mother said the turkey sandwich was not that bad. When I came in here there was one couple and one last sitting by herself. There is no reason why this place was not spotless, better service and customer care. Future reference if you want to have a successful business the following is crucial: good customer service, CLEANLINESS, attentiveness. I will not come back. Please check your food and proceed with caution.\n\nUPDATE: I spoke with CURT(IS) and explained the whole situation. He was extremely receptive and apologetic. He also offered to reimburse me but I refused stating that maybe he could provide a free meal to someone else. Hopefully, he can get some of his staff retrained and to standard.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2Ln2Akx-QbBFo_6KsVnYcI7UhmkSkmJddUpLZ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccb4ab17fdc0f:0x18a9f59cd403b696"}

The tomato soup tasted as though it was rewarmed with lots of grease floating in it. The pizza was nothing like all of the other Newk's in the Atlanta areas.

I asked for a manager from the start, and got one after repeating myself for approximately 8 minutes. He too was young and offered a poor excuse for the food, particularly the soup. He said that it probably had been out too long.

Everything went smoothly until when I received my order, I realized that two things that I had purchased were missing from my bag. I was frustrated to say the least, so I called the restaurant to have the problem fixed.\n\nI won't go into every little detail about the mess of what happened afterwards with Waitr, but I did want to give a shout out to the manager from Newks, Kayla, that helped me throughout the whole process. She really went above and beyond. Not only did she refund the money for the desserts, she also got a waitr driver back out to her restaurant,  even stayed late after they closed waiting on the driver to pick them up, and also included in an extra half sandwich for my troubles. She promptly called me back every time she had an update, answered my call every time I called, and handled to situation in the most professional and savvy way. She was the only person that saved the day and saved this situation from being an absolute disaster. THANK YOU KAYLA!!!\n\nOn a side note - Waitr is the worst, most poorly managed food delivery service company, and really service company in general, that I have ever used. They were the real problem in this whole situation and were basically running around with their heads cut off. Not to mention, this same situation had happened to me before while using the waitr app, this one just happen to top them all and be worse than anytime before. but again KAYLA SAVED THE DAY!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccb4ab17fdc0f:0x18a9f59cd403b696"}

She was the nicest person I had spoken to at Newks. Sunday was much better. I was greeted very nicely at the door so much enthusiasm especially for the morning time. Some of the servers looked very rude and like they had attitudes when you ask for anything. I luckily got the dread head server again whom remembered me from friday. She greeted us with a smile which was very warming, she is very sweet. Welcomed me back and served my food. Instead of pointing at the round table like the other server did when I asked a question she told me where I could find it and offered to bring it to me. Today the food was much better and out faster. But you really need to fix your servers attitudes and their conversations. One server smelt of marijuana and the to go area two ladies where complaining about customers all morning. I wanted to move away from that area. If you don't like your job quit!

She got a supervisor or someone in charge to tell her my issue. She was very unprofessional telling me my soup was not free and I would have to pay for it! I then explained to her that I worked daily and can pay for my soup and I didn\u2019t ask for you all to give me the soup for free! I simply asked to fix another one. When she saw I was then frustrated, she tried to \u201cclean it up\u201d! No ma\u2019am! Too late! And to make matters worse, once I drove home, I opened my soup and realized I was given less than half of the soup; which by the way was $3.99! I called the manager Sam and he did not seem to care about my issue all he kept saying was uh huh ok. No, sir! Then, I had to ask him what he was going to do about this to make sure it didn\u2019t happen again and they needed to replace my soup!

Visited Newks for the first time on Sunday between 3 and 4 pm. It was empty. Took a while before we were helped. My wife and I both ordered a sandwich and soup. We noticed almost every table had trash and food. I don't mean that in a \"every table - but really like 2\", I mean well over a dozen at least.. The hostess said, \"sorry about the mess, I haven't gotten around to it\". We sat outside and it was a disaster. I mean, I've actually never seen something so bad. We were there for over an hour and the hostess never moved. She sat on her phone and never cleaned a single table. The iced tea was not good and I was concerned about sanitation honestly.. I don't think the dispenser has ever been cleaned and I felt like drinking it might make me sick. It tasted off. The chicken salad sandwich was disappointing and the bread was very tough to bite into. The lobster bisque that I was looking forward too must have come pre-made and frozen. All I could taste was cheese. Plastic utensils and 1 napkin each, but I let that pass because it may be a COVID restriction. We had to go and ask for the bill and when I said thank you to the 3 staff working, they just looked at me with dead expressions...\n\nI'm not sure if this is normal or if this is how things run when management isn't around and just young employees are there, but I was actually appalled. Mind you, the state of the restaurant didn't bother me at first - perhaps they were swamped before we got there, but over an hour went by, with us as THE ONLY people there, and they never busted a single table. I did not take a picture because I didn't want to scare people away, but wow... I mean, wow... I only ate half my sandwich because I felt so uncomfortable with the sanitary conditions.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x14fb33f224fbc609:0x716882af26aae80d"}

When I was giving my order for my whole family, anytime I added anything else this young man Taking my orders seemed to throw his hands around and roll his eyes as if it bothered him I was getting more than one thing. I noticed when I moved up one car length at a time through the drive-thru, i noticed he seem to be doing this with everyone, not just me. As I got up to the window he let me sit at the window for about five minutes with the line backed all the way up before he even had the drinks ready like usual or my order paid for just standing at the screen taking orders\u2026 but the line wasn\u2019t moving. While the food has always been good here for me, service is more important. It turns out this is the owner son, Nick, who is so bothered by taking orders to the drive-thru. After I sat at the window waiting for him to take my card to pay for my meal for about 5 to 6 minutes, Allena(I assume was her name, it was on my receipt the lady handed me)  finally came to the window, gave me my food, and helped clear out the drive-through line because it seemed like Nick wasn\u2019t doing anything. I could hear him cursing and see him throwing his hands around anytime more than one thing was added to an order if he were to say \u201cis there anything else?\u201d not to mention my meals were cheeseburgers with everything but pickles onion and tomato, and i got plain burgers with ONLY pickles onions and tomatoes..\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffbMaybe it seems like because he\u2019s the owner son he can act how he wants\u2026 That doesn\u2019t get you very good service reviews and I most likely will not be back to this location, Because while the food can be great, the service still means more.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1611713602314, "text": "Tamera,\n\nThank you for letting me know about your experience.

I had to drown my food in the sauce to enjoy it. The sides were mediocre at best. The okra was good. The one standout dish was the fried catfish. It was well seasoned and fried just right.

We pay for the food and start reviewing the receipt as we thought the bill was high, only to notice that they charged us for 2 extra pints at full price.  Pints are 6.95, quarts are 9.95 (may not be exact to the penny but it's close).  I get the three dollar up-charge as that's the difference between the two but why would I pay nearly $14 for 2 pints (2 pints = 1 quart) when I could pay the $10 and get the same thing.  We brought this to what appeared to be the manager on duty (he had a different color shirt than everyone else) and all he would assure us of is that he would speak with the cashier and acted as if we were crazy for questioning the charges for what we received.  He made no offer to correct but only saying \"what do you want me to do?\".  As a customer service manager you should know full and well what to do.  On this alone I won't be back.\n\nFor the product, the brisket was cut thin (who does that) which severely limited the flavor available from the bark.  Got chopped pork, this was insanely dry.  Only saving grace is they give you almost 2 quarts of sauce - it's certainly needed.
