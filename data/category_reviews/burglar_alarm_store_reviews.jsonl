He then said he'd go ahead and update our system for no charge, which he did. What was that about??  Offer to update the system for $100?  Would that be considered fleecing a client?

I've been out of pocket for weeks trying to handle mom's business, grieve, and still live so I haven't had a chance to reschedule. ADT proceeded to still charge me two months of service at my old location even though they knew I had cancelled the service at my old house. When I caught it, the call center manager told me that they still bill you 30 days after you cancel. I asked about the other month and she said \"oh we prorated that and took it out of your installation fee.\" So I prepaid $100 for an install that I didn't get.
