Since my initial visit to the McGee rd service facility back in December,  which did an excellent job, I have had 2 bad experiences.  1st bad experience was with my wife's car. She had the oil changed at the eastern blvd facility.  Approximately 1 week later her car's check engine light came on and the fault was for dirty oil. She had the oil checked at a local change facility and it was a quart low. They did another oil change, and I have the filter from that change and it is not as clean a filter as you think from 1 week previous. I had also gotten my oil changed in my truck a few days after she did at the eastern Blvd facility.  So I decided to take a look at my oil and filter. The filter on my truck had an install date written on it from the McGee Rd facility of 12/9/19. The date I first got Express to change it. They supposedly changed my oil and filter on 2/7/20 at McGee rd. I will also attach a pic of the filter . Needless to say this is a very bad way to run a business.  Engine damage from dirty oil is very significant possibility from these action.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO43eqZAxl6i36R5mIsoxQpWPbaVCPg79nGVXA2=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1582925050257, "text": "Hi there, Ernest.

He asked multiple times if it was ready, was told only 20 more mins, then 30...well 2 hours after the said time he left. We had plans at 11am, so those didn't happen WHICH could have been planned for-like loading up my kids (one being a newborn) in the car and picking him up. No apologies for the extra wait time and never honest about how long it was going to take.\nCome that following week, SURPRISE, there was an oil leak on the garage floor AND the check engine light was back on. So we took it back once again. He was told that it was just old oil coming out and it was fine and that some other piece needed to be replaced for the check engine light. Like why wasn't this fixed the first time!? Unless we got super unlucky and something went wrong within the 3/4 day time.\n\nWell now it's about 4 months later and there's still oil spots on the floor!\nSo we called today, I got a so-so person on the phone and was told to bring it back in, no \"oh my goodness! That's not what we like to hear..please bring it back in!\" It was just \"bring it back\".\n\n1st, can we make the comparison on the comment from Ashton Morgan below?? This was the SAME day, the SAME time and my husband remembers talking and waiting with Ashton.\nWe aren't very knowledgable on car repairs and we should've gotten a 2nd opinion(the Garage in Pelham is literally walking distance and everyone always has great things to say about them, but this was just for a cheap oil change-never again!) ..but we just had a baby and didn't have much spare time or sleep to decide these things with a clear mind.\n\nI just reccomend going somewhere else for piece of mind EVEN for an oil change, even if this was just a random bad day (which look at the rating-use your brains people! We didn't and now we're paying for it with our time and now a nasty driveway and garage floor) for the people working on cars, there has yet to be a verbal apology-and now if we get one it will just seem forced.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1463972408579, "text": "Dear Jennifer,\nMy name is Rick and I am the owner of Precision Tune Auto Care of Pelham.

Incredibly unprofessional response for the owner of a shop, he could have at least owned up to the mistake and I wouldn\u2019t have been as bothered by the lack of communication.

It was a very welcomed change from the experience I'd had at another local shop I'd been referred to (but later warned about from several other past customers) where I repeatedly had to endure rudeness from the know-it-all mechanic, immediate breakdowns from same issue I'd just paid to have repaired, & ignored voicemails asking to speak to the owner. Guthrie's owner followed-up the very next day to make sure everything was going well with the work on my car. I would much rather pay for a job well done the first time than a little less and keep breaking down, having my car towed, finding another way to work at the last minute to keep my job, and then constantly being talked down to in person & over the phone (while the owner justifies it as him \"being from New York\",... to which I reminded them both that he's now n ALABAMA, & that cocky attitude won't do here, especially with me!!... 3 different types of repairs... never fixed after being told they were!). So, yes, I am very happy to give Guthrie's a positive review, THANK YOU!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1603738847056, "text": "Bettie, thank you for your review.

They cannot do a simple tire patch on one of the tires that I brought from them? I would have waited on that to be done too. This is poor, and unacceptable customer service.

The vibration was not in the steering wheel but the chassis. It felt like a u-joint to me so I proceeded slowly at 25mph to try and locate help. I pulled into the A-1 Tire Sale & Service Goodyear dealer and asked if they could repair my vehicle and what I thought it was. They said they would look at it and see if the could. After some time the mechanic returned to get the Service Writer and they exited and soon she returned to let me know that what was wrong was both front wheel bearings were bad  and my idler arm and bracket were worn out. I asked how much to fix ans was quoted $446.00. I asked was u-joint bad ?\"no it OK \" I was told. I asked to see my vehicle and when I spun the wheels I herd no noise, when I checked for play by lifting up on tire I noticed none. Then moving tire side to side I felt no play in the Idler arm. Now mind you anything can break at ant time, but I had my vehicle in the shop last week for a tie rod end and front end alignment by men I have trusted for years. So I refused the repairs and for my vehicle to be taken off the lift. The mechanic then came over to where we were, I then asked him \"you didn't find anything wrong with the u-joint? NO was his answer. As he backed the vehicle off the lift a loud ping could be heard, like that you here when you have a bad u-joint. I then drove to another shop recommended by my son-in-law, and when their mechanic walked under the vehicle he could see the u-joint was bad with out touching it.\nU-joint was repaired and $70.00 later I was on the road with no vibration.    So before I let A-1 Tire do any work on my vehicle I would recommend you take it to a honest shop to determine what is really wrong.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892955dfe266a9d:0x660c350c5bf1fd5e"}

I think now that I was misled.\n\nI had three issues with my truck; fuel pump, flashing brake lights and nonworking A/C. I  wanted the mobile service, but the A/C problem required a shop visit.\nThey called me back in 2 days with written details of work performed at just about $800-including the veteran discount.\n\nShortly after leaving the shop, the A/C began to fail. The next day the brake light was on again.  I voiced my disappointment and was told that I should make an appointment to have them correct it. I admit to being taken aback at the requisite appointment making, but I had already paid for three items with only one completed.\n\nOn the next appointment, I was called to say that while they were testing my A/C, my radiator began to leak. Please note that there had been no issues prior-none, not overheating or leaks of any kind. I was sent a very bad photo of a radiator and a quote of $412 to replace it. I agree assuming that was the extent of the issues. 3 hours later they called to say that I had a compressor issue and the fix was $1,300. Had they told me that originally, I would have cut my losses and gone somewhere else, but it appears that there was a need to justify the effort with some work of some kind.\n\nI refused the A/C repair and when I arrived to pickup the truck, they made an overt attempt to make sure that they showed me a defective radiator that I had no interest in seeing. I instead wanted to the radiator installation. Even though they remarked that they chose clamps were original, they didn't replace them or the hoses.\n\n2 days later, the brake light is back on again.  I haven't felt this screwed in a very long time. I paid for their time and failed efforts, but my time is lost forever. But you don't have to feel like me.

When I picked it up drove toward Wal-Mart it immediately got hot so the looked at it again right before closing then i leave again same thing finally I park in publix to let it cool down. Again in the morning I take it back. Again they check it send me on my way 30 minutes later car hot again. I call and was pretty much brushed off and was told that they fixed what they thought was the problem. So as of right now I've been charged all this money car still running hot n they acting like it's cool I came in with 1 problem which has still not to be resolved.

When I arrived, I was looking at the vehicle from the outside in before being approached by a salesperson. When the lady finally came up to assist me, I asked if I could look inside of the vehicle - if she had the keys - because the truck was locked. She told me \"no\" but she could take me inside and give me the specs for the vehicle from the tablet. Ok, fine... thats good for the moment. We get in and she starts running numbers on what the payment would be and telling me what the truck had it in based on what was on her tablet... disregarding the fact I asked her multiple times to go outside and get it unlocked so that I could get inside of it and look. I know what I can afford, I already did the numbers before I got here. All I wanted to do was look at it and see if it fit my family's needs. She finally unlocked it but when I started touching the touch screen she yelled at me like I was a kid even though there was little damage I could do to the vehicle (not that it was my intentions but) since the vehicle was in demo mode. I was also not allowed to sit in the drivers seat. She had told me multiple times that the truck was out of my price range, knowing NOTHING about my finances because I had not yet disclosed that information in any form. Then she had the \"manager\" come out and he told me the same thing, that I couldnt afford this vehicle but they could put me in a cheaper vehicle. Long story short, they lost a purchase from a client who makes over $100k per year because \"I couldnt afford that vehicle\".

I took it to Basch Brothers in Cullman, because this is where the cart was originally purchased. I told them that I wanted to get the carburetor cleaned  and to look over the go cart for anything else it needed. They called me the next day and said it had no compression. I told them that's odd because when I purchased the cart, I checked the compression and it was at 90lbs. They said I don't know what to tell you but we are only get 60lbs. AT this point I understood they didn't want to work on it and I picked it up and took it to Dr. Joe's in Ensley. They found the carburetor was gumed up and the vacuum line. They return the go cart to me  the next day completely fixed.

Now let me tell a story.....\n\nMy wife\u2019s car was giving vibrations by my own accord and felt by the look of things, balancing would fix the issue. She was due new tires but I had a month or so before committing to new set. The tires had whooped out on the back two, but good tread even in the low spot and could not be balanced.  Still safe just rough riding by my account. Ordered tires, set up an appointment with a different tire shop on Saturday,  loaded up the new tires in her car. Saturday appointment was not booked (I can\u2019t get it done) so I figure I would set up an appointment with another local shop close to work for Tuesday.\n\nMonday...\n\nMy wife calls me at 9 am with a blowed out tire. She already late. And she already told me them tires got to be changed before today.\n\n(Disclaimer.:  Her car came with no spare and I had been inactively looking for one).\n\nSo I\u2019m deep in the dog house if you didn\u2019t read between the lines.\n\nShe gets a tow to Superior Auto Care and they get after it in due time. Not unreasonable for a spur of the moment and professionally put those new tires on I already had in the truck.(I double checked and correct torque and the exact psi to spec and not \u201cnormal\u201d like most shops I have dealt with)\n\nThe question I had all morning..... was it my misjudgment and my wife is mad forever or was it a nail that even new tires could not prevent?\n\nBy all evidence from Superior Auto Care, it was a screw.  True detectives they are and me and my wife had a great week.\n\nIt was just a flat not a blow out by the pictures. she had. Her safety even by my own misjudgment would not have been compromised. But I\u2019m glad it was a screws fault and not my misjudgment.\n\nGreat guys over there. Phillip was more than helpful. Couldn\u2019t ask for better service in this situation by my wife\u2019s accord.\n\nShe got to work late, held it over my head while I didn\u2019t know if it was my fault. I committed to a lot of things I would do this week I had been putting off not knowing it was not my fault.  But, I\u2019m sitting here a happy man. Walked the dog while having conversations with my wife. Deep stuff that could have went the other direction.

He also stated he thought it would be a bit cheaper, about $950, well that's great. No problem there! So the day we got home he called and said the car was finished and that he was able to do all the work for $860!!! He very well could have charged me the $1000 and I would have gladly payed. He instead did the honorable thing and charged me what it cost him! Also, very clean shop!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1553791759458, "text": "Thank you, John!

After discussing their \"fee,\" we never actually achieved full disclosure. We were told the vehicle was at a different dealership within our city and we could go there to finalize the deal. They said that they would call ahead and we should just go over there. Our credit had already been run multiple times, and we had received approval from the credit company. With this in mind, we went to the other dealership location. As we arrived at the other location, they hadn't been given all the details as we had been led to believe. So the process began again, running in circles of double talk and running our credit again... We left at closing time and expected a phone call the next day to complete the deal... That has yet to happen days later. I used to have great respect for Greenway Automotive. It appears that Greenway has only taken over these dealerships at face value, and the same crooks that were already in place are still running things just like they always have.

It was running fine, but I wanted to get it checked out before it could develop into something worse. It was throwing a catalytic converter code and the mechanics told me that they could get it fixed by replacing two engine valve cover gaskets. While they had it they also replaced two oxygen sensors and two spark plug coils. The grand total came out to $850 but I was satisfied to just get it fixed. The same day that I picked it up I was heading up to Auburn for a football game. I had been driving it for around 2 hours since I had given them my money when the engine made a loud pop, smoke poured out of the hood, and the truck shut off while I was driving down the interstate. I managed to pull off to the side of the road and come to a stop. After letting it cool for a while, I tried to restart the truck but it was completely shot. I always get my oil changed regularly, but I did check the dipstick and it had an appropriate amount of oil. I of course then called Riviera and explained what had happened, expecting them to arrange a  tow back to the shop since they had had it there less than 3 hours ago. Unfortunately, they told me that they could not possibly have done anything that would have caused that, and they would not cover the price of a tow or diagnosing of what had went wrong. This left me stranded on the interstate where I had to call and pay for a different towing company to give the truck a tow to a local mechanic as well as a rental car to get me to Auburn. The next day the mechanic gives me a call letting me know that the engine was completely shot and that the only options were to either scrap it or put a new used engine in for $3700. I called Riviera and told them the news and once again they told me that nothing they could have done would have caused that and that they could not help me. Since then, I have called trying to arrange a meeting with the owner/operator of Riviera to discuss what has happened and what our options will be moving forward. I have been told that I am unable to have a sit down meeting with him and whatever I need to say can be taken care of over the telephone. Basically, they have offered zero help or willingness to see what happened and if one of their guys caused it. I have gotten several second opinions from local mechanics as to what could have caused this and they have all said that it would be extremely rare for a 2005 engine to just blow up with absolutely no indication beforehand and with plenty of oil. They all also agreed that it would be the responsibility of Riviera to at least tow it back to the shop, pull out the engine, and determine what went wrong and if they had caused it. One told me about a similar situation that had happened at his shop, so he got it towed back, pulled out the engine, and found that one of his guys had dropped a wrench in the engine, causing the failure. So he took care of it and ordered a used engine for the customer and installed it at no charge since they had clearly made the mistake. I have had no other option, so I am currently in the process of taking the management at Riviera to court in hopes to get some compensation for the $850 service that I payed, the $3700 engine replacement, along with the rental car and towing charges that I have had to pay.\n\nThe bottom line is, pay the money to take your vehicle to a better quality mechanic shop that actually has a reputation they must live up to to avoid a situation like this!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1548081275748, "text": "Hi Tom, thank you for your review.

My tires are supposed to hold 35 pounds of pressure, so needless to say I had to do some air pressure adjustments.

Two days later my alternator goes out! Maybe a coincidence, but it seems like everyone I put my trust in the professionals, things start going wrong with my car. Don't trust mechanics, lawyers, maintenance individuals, had one of them tell me, \"if we fix it too well, we'll be out of a job, always have to leave something for another day.\" There's no real honest people in this area, not anymore. Bureaucrats have got their fingers into everything. Law suits are the \"American Way!\" So you can't really blame them to avoid taking responsibility for their actions. I know what my part costs, they were going to charge me nearly $500 in labor to loosen and tighten bout 6 bolts? A little extreme, they did an estimate but I never got to see it, I asked to see the defective part, but was given the excuse we would have to put it back on the lift. Since it wasn't on the lift, they had no plans to fix it!\n\nAllen from Phenix Firestone called, his only concern was why I was so critical of him. I thought that was clear, but this was the second time I took this vehicle there for the same issue, the first time I was told nothing was wrong with it. In any case in order to resolve the problem Allen stated, \"we're not working in your cars anymore!\" I guess I hurt his feelings?\n\nI used to love taking a vehicle to Phenix Firestone, always felt like they were looking out for me, always trusted them!

I took my car to Kia because my air wasn\u2019t working they kept my car for a day and a half. I got my car back the air was working fine. I didn\u2019t pay anything. About a week later I went back in for my follow up appointment because I was informed to bring the car back so they could check my Freon levels. I took the car back and the rep that car up to me informed me it would be 139.00 for a diagnostic reading. I got upset because if you charge to do a diagnostic reading why wasn\u2019t that service performed the first time. I ended up getting a phone call back from a guy named Jaizon, that apologized about my previous encounter with the pricing and he informed me I wasn\u2019t supposed to pay anything for the diagnostic fee.  I took my car back to the dealership and left it. A few hours later I get a phone call from a totally difference representative that tells me I\u2019m going to have to pay 280 dollars for them to figure out what\u2019s wrong with my car. I informed them to have my car ready for me to pick it up then five minutes later the same rep called me back and stated they would knock 100 dollars off of the 280 to make it 170 for the diagnostic fee. I\u2019ve gotten literally four prices for simply finding out what\u2019s wrong with my car. I\u2019ve wasted my time, and gas by making trips up there that was a complete waste of time! I\u2019ve gotten more lies and inaccuracy from this company than any other company in Huntsville thus far. And I\u2019ve only been in Huntsville about 2 years. They will NEVER have to worry about me bringing my car there again. That\u2019s for sure! Giving them one star is too much credit, I wish I could remove it too!!!

Here is what happened.  Called got a verbal quote of $139-189 per axle for a brake job with rotor's turned which is fair they are just below the dealer which was $200 per axle.  Went the next day to have services done to my car.  Before they began work they inspected it and determine I needed pads all the way and rotor's on the rear and a brake fluid exchange.  Estimate price was over $700.  I declined the brake fluid exchange and they offered some \"competitive\" discounts brought my total down to about $580.  Still more than it should be.  Asked for a printed estimate when I saw the estimate I knew something was up.  They had part numbers and prices on the estimate.  Quick Google search confirmed the part numbers and prices from a local part supply store that they would be getting the parts from.  They are marking up parts pricing 100+%.  Industry standard is between 10-25%.  Then they told me that the estimate was nearly at cost and if he went any lower he would lose his job.  Nothing but scam and scare tactics were used with me and I didn't take the bait.  Tried to email the address on the general managers card it wouldn't ever go through.  Called the corporate office gave them the info and the pictures I have attached here and they said a regional manager would get back with me still have not heard from that person either.

A new water pump was installed, but didn't last 100 miles. I returned the vehicle only to have the auto shop refuse to replace the water pump free of charge. I removed the water pump that weekend to find they cross threaded the new water pump and warped the unit. No wonder it did not function properly. After re-tapping a couple of screws and several hours out of my Saturday I replaced the new pump myself. Now I am out the price of another water pump, thanks a lot.\n\nMany people do not know this, but each repair job has an attached amount of time associated with it. So, if an auto center changes your brakes in 30 min but the book says it takes 1.5 hours, then the shop charges you for the extra hour as an extra rake. Now, I do not mind paying the extra as long as the quality matches. This shop may do quick work, but it is not at the quality I am paying for. Poor value given, and they would not make it right either. Basically the repair guy did not remove all the necessary components (like a radiator) to save some time and shoved the water pump in at an angle.\n\nI will never use them again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888c4e6e0b99431:0x62babd6da353f44f"}

They fixed both and stuck to fair estimate.\n\nI wouldn't do business with them now after my last experience.\n\nMonth 1 & 2\nOur car needed a new engine. The shop owner wanted to get an engine from his supplying junkyard. He missed one that became available. This process took about 2 weeks before we decided to find an engine ourselves which he was not happy with but agreed to. He said they could have it put in within a 3 day period. The engine company we bought from needed it done in 10 days for warranty purposes. Griffith used all of the 10 days to because other cars came in front of me while we had to wait on engine. They finally got it in and started but had to send to dealership because the car went into anti-theft mode and wouldn't start. We had to actually arrange the drop off to the dealership ourselves. I feel like we were running his business for him because he was almost never there. The employees even mentioned that problem in passing.\n\nMonth 3\nWe become worried after not hearing anything from dealership or Griffin for about 2.5ish weeks. I had to contact dealership for them to tell me that they told Griffin that the car needed a major fuse panel that could be $1200+. I called Griffin to tell him I approved the install because we really needed the car. It's month 3 folks!\n\nIs it Month 4? Getting close anyway.\nWe had to go ourselves to the dealership to confront them about not getting to our car. This should be Griffin's job. The dealership says that the part didn't fix the problem. Car still doesn't work. We decide to give up because the car needed another part for $2400 to \"maybe\" fix. We decide to just give up. Dealership is trying to get more money from us even though they didn't fix the problem. Griffin is trying to put that on us. We said we would pay for his time, but does this seem fair? Griffin himself might be a knowledgable mechanic, but he is a rookie business owner with no organization or management skills of his people.  He wasted a huge amount of our time (3+months), money ($6000+) and stressed my wife and I to no end. We are going to have to scrap our car with a new engine that doesn't run.\n\nThey do good oil changes and put a muffler on another car we brought, but he also made me pay for the part up front which shows bad business to me as well.\n\n* FINAL RESULT\npaid griffin $1400 because the car ended up not working out. He said he made no money and it would have been $2000 if it had worked + whatever it would be to charge AC. When we walked in to pay he didn't even recognize us. My wife and I talked to this guy several times in person and on phone. The waiting area had mice running around too FYI if you are scared of them. After that we went to the dealer shop that had our car and basically gave it to the tech working on it. he paid for the dealer work and gave us a little cash. When we went to clean the car out I noticed that the driver seat leather looked very dirty and worn. Griffin said he was sorry.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888c4e6e0b99431:0x62babd6da353f44f"}

I have sent my cars or truck to them at least 9 times (using both the overnight drop box and just bringing it in) and have only waited longer than a day once (and that was because the part got their late in the evening and I picked it up after work the next day)\n\nI have had multiple types of jobs: brakes pads for Altima and Silverado, rotors for Altima and Silverado,, brake drums for Silverado, oil change for Altima and Silverado, window regulator replacement on Silverado, oil leak repair on Altima, engine mounts on Altima, transfer case replacement Silverado 4x4, along with other normal maintenance type items", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888c4e6e0b99431:0x62babd6da353f44f"}

I used to be one of those people who ONLY got serviced at the dealership but this Express is so impressive. The employees are mainly younger guys but they are all polite, patient, and personable! The managers, Tim specifically, are also patient, and helpful both on the phone and in store and truly take time out of their day to talk to you about servicing, previous records, dates of service, and HONEST recommendations. You will NOT wait in line here like you will at the dealership, the longest time I've waited for the entire oil change to be done is 15 minutes here, and that included the \"wait\" to begin. Everyone here has a great attitude and a willingness to help!

I didn't know for sure exactly where or what was causing it, didn't want to spend my only free evening of the week with my wife and kid trying to figure it out, but also didn't want to leave a leak overnight so I took off work early to go get it fixed.  My vehicle needed an oil change as well anyway so I took it in and explained it was likely the filter or one of the lines that needed replaced.\n\nSure they changed my oil no problem, but the guy came around and said he wouldn't fix the leak, that it was a \"missing o-ring that they didn't carry in stock\" and I'd need to take it back to whoever put the existing filter on and have them do the repair.  Now, I replace my filters every 40,000 miles or so and I've moved a couple of times since then.  I have no idea where I was exactly when I replaced my filter last, because it's a small fix.  I got there at 4:30 pm, close of business at 6, so it wasn't like I pulled up at quitting time.  I had to take more time off work the next morning to disconnect everything myself and find it was simply a hairline crack in the filter.  The mechanic that I talked to didn't even verify anything, except what I already knew that yep there's a fuel leak there.  He just spewed some bs that he thought sounded good because he didn't feel like doing his job...

I don\u2019t know a whole lot about cars, but I know when my tire tread looks low and I\u2019ve got at least until the end of this year or the beginning of next before I\u2019ll need new tires.

I went in to get oil change and a get a quote on new master cylinder for my son's car. My son had a free oil change card that his mother gave him.  This his first oil change of his first car I bought him last year. He's had the card for over a year and it has no expiration date on it. The service tech \"manager\" said he didn't think the card was still good. Again, it had no expiration date on it. He said well it should've been signed by manager, though there's no place for it to be signed by a manager. The \"manage\" said well anyone could've just picked it up and put the date on it and brought it back.  I said I didn't do that nor did my son or his mother. I told him I didn't appreciate being accused of stealing a free oil change card. He said two other people did that yesterday. I said that is not my fault nor an excuse to accuse me of doing the same thing. He could not understand what he had done over a $34.95 oil change. He called the owner and the owner said the card fine, of course. He did not apologize for accusing me of stealing the free oil change card. He said he had to make sure it was ok or it would come out of his paycheck. Again, no reason to ever utter someone could have just picked one up and brought it in unsigned. All he had to say is he had to call his owner to see how to process the card not accuse me of possibly stealing it. With that lack of ability to understand the damage to the customer for your handling of this made me question giving someone like that the responsibility to work on the brakes on my son's car. So, I took my free oil change card from his fingertips and told the inexperienced \"manager\" that I'd take my business elsewhere. As I left he said the free oil change card was \"null and void\". He just had to be right. He would not listen to the customer who was getting ready to pay $559 for work plus and extra $36 for the full synthetic oil change. Hint empathy people. I only do business with people I like period and though I just met this guy he gave me reason not to like him in under 10 minutes. I had never been in a Meineke in my life until today and will never do so again. Thanks to this manager at the South Huntsville shop. I wonder if this is the intent of the Meineke representative who gave this card to my son's mother?", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1622217384048, "text": "Hi Tom, this should never be the impression we leave.

They were able to replace that at no cost to me. Secondly, screws were missing and clips weren't reinstalled. The manager assured me they would be replaced, and they were. Lastly the radiator was mounted improperly (very wobbly, almost hitting the engine). This was initially resolved with plastic zip ties and told by the manager that it was repaired and I was good to go. Obviously this was unacceptable at an initial service fee of $105/hr.

I thought I would try them again, I just called for a quote on breaks, I explained all I needed was break shoes, and would like a  quote.  The man I was talking to told me to bring it in.  Again I said I just need a quote, he told me he could not give me a quote with out bringing it in for inspection.  I will never use Meineke again, that is how they lure you in, you take your car/truck there for something and before you leave they scare you to death saying something else is life or death.

We went back into the shop to set up an appointment that ended up being for a whole week later which was excessively long for the possibility of my car getting flooded if it rained.

Nearly 2 hours later I finally get a call back from them saying they didn\u2019t have the part in stock, that they hadn\u2019t done any kind of research on what my options were before my appointment (which we agreed they would do), told me they couldn\u2019t get the seal as an individual part but would have to replace the whole sunroof instead, and that if I wanted that done it would be over $700 for it or if not that they would only charge $110 for running their \u201cdiagnostics\u201d. A fee for \u201cDiagnostics\u201d to look at my car for no more than a minute to tell my seal had dry-rotted and needed replacing, really?

Not to mention there wasn\u2019t a seat cover used despite their own disclosure sign saying they would be using them to slow the spread of coronavirus.

I don't have anything but good things to say about them! I've always had a great experience and they really value loyal customers. They've kept my car running in perfect condition and never made me feel like they were upselling anything or treating me like a woman who doesn't know anything (a rare quality in my experience with car service shops!). They always take time to explain to me what was done and why they did it. They clearly indicate the wear on each of the car components so that I have a record and can anticipate service that I might need in the future. I went to another Honda location once and they said I needed new brakes. They didn't give me any other reason than the service guy's opinion. I took my car to King Honda and told them that the other place had said I needed new brakes at my next visit. King Honda measured the wear and said it wasn't necessary based on the wear. I was very impressed by the fact that they went by the numbers rather than taking the chance to sell me some brakes that I didn't really need quite yet. Even after I moved away from Auburn, I still come back to get my car serviced here.

Something is really wrong here.\n\nI am writing to share my bad experience at \"king honda service dept\" so reader out there to save your time, energy and money else where you and the service you like other than king honda.\n\nOn my way out I stopped by the front sale office and share my experienced to mr. Randall / GM.  He seems to acknowledge my concerns and took down my contact info.\n\nI took my business to \"Express oil Change\" 3min away from king honda dealer and they really treating me like a real customer.  My fav guys are Michael and Zack.\n\nUPDATES...3/15/2017 @ 5:47p = 4-stars\n========\nI received a phone call from Mr. Dave King (the owner).  He first introduced himself and sincerely apologized to me of his service dept staffs behavior.  I have to give Mr. Dave King a lot of credit to reaching out to me as a upset customer and asked me to come back to his dealer to offer to do oil change if I havent done it (he actually said he would do it him self).  That enough to tell me that he genuinely care.  Instead he offered a certificate of free oil change on our next visit.\n\nI want to thanks Mr. Dave King and Mr Randall for their action and care to their customers.\n\nBecause of these efforts I have decided to move my rating from 1-star to 4-stars.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c132456a45:0x37bab76a5afd1067"}

It did not solve the problem, so they took everything apart and replaced my coil - saying we will not charge you for what you do not need - nor charge you for the additional labor.

They are very professional, kind, and pleasant to work with.\n\nI had a blow out, on Friday, September 7th on I-459 while driving South @ 5:45 pm. I hit SIRI on my phone and located the closest tire store to my location and I sure am glad she steered me towards Darrin Gilliam and his team. I slowly limped my way to the store and got out at 5:55pm on Friday afternoon and Mr. Gilliam asked how he could help me. I told him I needed a tire that I just had a blow out and was traveling to Hale County and needed to get home. He checked his inventory, but did not have the tire size I needed, but went well above and beyond to find one for me. He had two other guys and himself on phones calling all around to different stores trying to locate one and I was worried about them closing the doors at 6 pm, but he stated they do not close the doors until all customers are taken care of and would not leave me stranded.\n\nAfter locating a tire and having it brought there, Darrin Gilliam, Jasson Trammell and Matt Ramirez installed the tire and rim and helped me get back on the road. I have never ever been to ANY BUSINESS 5 minutes before closing time and especially on a Friday afternoon to receive great customer service like this. These gentleman stayed over with smiles on their faces just to make sure I was taken care of, regardless of the time.  While I was waiting, I did notice this location was very well organized and everyone there worked together as a team. This store definitely has their ducks in a row.\n\nThe management and workforce in this store is \"bar none\" the best I have ever seen. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t live close enough to do business with this store, but I will recommend anyone in this area to make this your \u201cgo to place\u201d for all of your automotive needs. I will check out the store in Tuscaloosa and see if their standards are as good as this store on 5036 Bond Blvd. Thanks again guys for all your professional and kind help on a short notice at quitting time on a late Friday afternoon.
