I would have given them a five if deceptive practices had not been used to get me to volunteer. The person that recruited me for this prestigious event name is Annie Ridgeway. She came to my church on family and friends day she sat in front of me she came about halfway through the service. When service ended I greeted her I asked her if she enjoyed the service and invited her back she then sat down and said that she needed me to be a greeter because I was so pleasant to her a function that included Mayor Randal Woodfin Mayor William Bell Mayor Bernard Kincaid and Mayor Richard Arrington. I asked her if she a minister she said no. She explained that she was not sure if I will be a server or a greeter but for me to wear African attire because all of the volunteers would be distinguished by wearing African attire. She told me that we would be feeding 300 people. Annie also stated that I should get there around 9 for setup. I get there and find out that there are no Mayor's attending. The tables were set up the day before the food was prepared the day before and there were enough chairs for approximately 75 to 100 people. She gave me a butcher knife told me to sit by the back door with another young lady we sit there for almost 15 minutes I don't remember what she gave the other girl to hold in her hands neither do I remember her name. When the food came there was only 2 gallons of tea and 1 gallon of lemonade more than half of the meat had no barbecue sauce and her response to that was most people like their ribs without sauce. And the lies just kept coming. I will post a photo to my Facebook page so you can run like hell when you see her. I was shocked on the program she label herself as and Evangelist. They had no no aluminum foil only what came with the ribs. If we were to serve 300 people or even 100 people that was only four bags of ice. My instructions was to put a tablespoon ice in each cup after we had used three bags of ice. Also there were less than 36 mini cupcakes to serve. And the kitchen was not clean enough for me. But hey I have OCD. one of the ladies stated that she had been doing this for 5 years and have never seen Annie before and wanted to know where did she come from and how did we meet. one of the volunteers came in expecting the news reporters to be there and there were none from neither TV network. The entertainment was great absolutely beautiful the  dancers the comedian Miss V and the host is Pat Davis. When I received one of the programs from one of the greeters I was shocked and this is only half the story.the info that  annie gave was very misleading and erroneous. There was so much confusion in the kitchen just unbelievably nerve-wracking  she made us miserable Annie went out her way to make each of us miserable. one lady in the kitchen said that she boiled 300 eggs.Annie's told us to put a half egg on each plate. We serve fried chicken wings hot wings ribs and Ham and we were told to give each person only one piece of meat. we were also told that none of the volunteers would eat so Annie said so don't let your guard down in church. when I arrived everyone was dressed in African attire not just the volunteers as she had stated. Annie stated that she is a member of a Church on the Southside. so please do a background check on people even at your church. Some people have mental issues and some people are just con artist. I hate to say it but I was bamboozled and so were several other volunteers. Remember Satan goes to church too.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891de561a08a51:0x1a51b2e6f63128f9"}

Nigel and Leilani run the store and are two of my favorite people. They get to know their customers very well and it makes the atmosphere feel like you're walking in to a good friends house to play the day away with some Smash Bros or Halo.\n\nLeilani makes the best tacos I have ever had in my life. If you get the chance, go to Taco Tuesday. You won't regret it. In fact all the food is delicious. An order of double fries or nachos goes perfect with a D&D session.\n\nNigel has the uncanny ability to bring fun wherever he goes. He's set up the cafe to accommodate nearly any genre of nerd from retro gamers to hardcore tournament competitors. He's also constantly working to improve his business and make sure everyone that walks in the door has a great time. He also runs a pretty dope YouTube channel called Nerd Torch TV.\n\nThe store is organized and managed extremely well. There are several rooms dedicated to different types of gaming. There is a room for tabletop games, another for rhythm games like Guitar Hero or DDR, and other rooms dedicated to console games. There's even a PC built for gaming. Multiplayer games are very popular and this is a great place to find people that love to play Smash. I don't think I've ever been to the cafe when there wasn't someone playing Smash or Mario Cart. There's a great community built up around the cafe as well. All of the cafe members are invited to a GroupMe chat where you can get updates on events or just chat and hang out. This year, they organized a secret santa for everyone.\n\nIf you love games, nerds, and having a good time then you won't be dissapointed if drop by NERDtorch Cafe.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1514529783552, "text": "Thanks so much for writing such a detailed description of NERDtorch Cafe!
