Therefore, I did some research on WAITR for the best deal and what I had a Taste. I ended up ordering from Wok Express.  I had the Luncheon Specials, that comes with an egg roll and fried rice. I also ordered a egg roll and the  6 angel crab.\n\nI ordered the Shrimp Lo Mein and the Shrimp Fried Rice Meal and they were sooooooooooo Good. I don\u2019t know about anyone else giving them a 1 rating. But, mine food experience was real good and I give them an overall 4.2 rating.   Let me tell you how!\n\nFirst, my fried rice was actually FRIED RICE!  It had eggs, carrots and green peas in it; plus the onions I requested to add along with it for no extra charge. I couldn\u2019t believe it! \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31 Why you asked? Because a lot of Chinese Restaurants don\u2019t do that anymore. They give you fried rice and nothing else, and it\u2019s sticky and gummy. But not Wok Express it was fresh and I had it for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. I didn\u2019t want one grain to be lost Okay! ( Now my noodles was a little overcook but still good)\n\nThere was 12 large pawn shrimp in both my Shrimp Lo Mien and Shrimp Fried Rice. (See Pictures) Plus, I request onions to be added to Both items and make  it SPICY and they DID JUST THAT! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nHowever, other Chinese Restaurants that I\u2019ve ordered from tell me that can\u2019t do it.They cancel my order or ask me to accept it which is plain  fried rice nothing in it. Also, with no onions and not spicy. (Take a look at the pictures). Look how large my egg rolls are. Yummy!  Yummy! In my Tummy on All of it.  My Angel Crab was crispy, fresh and good. \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31  (SEE PICTURES)\n\nI give my entire order a 4.2. I will say this;  I didn\u2019t like that they sent me 2 nice large thick plastic forks that were not packaged. But they are among many other restaurants who send me silverware loose and I throw it away and use mines. I don\u2019t know about you but with everything that\u2019s going on, I don\u2019t trust not having  my silverware in a sealed up package. But they did put my napkins in a bag to make sure they didn\u2019t get wet. (I Requested they did) \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nHowever, go make sure to get your Chinese there during Lunch time and save money. Next, if you order in make sure to check for a Free Delivery Promo Code to get your Free Delivery for WAITR.\n\nNew post; On Monday the 28, of December 2020, I order the Lunch General TSO\u2019s and it was good, I also, ordered my favorite Spicy Shrimp fried rice on the Lunch Menu and asked for the side fried rice to be spicy and placed in a separate container.\n\nBecause, I didn\u2019t want it mixed with my Shrimp fried rice but they didn\u2019t do it. Also, I only receive 9 shrimp in my meal and it\u2019s supposed to be 15 or 20 shrimps in my Shrimp Fried Rice. I\u2019m very disappointed especially after the good reviews that I\u2019ve given them.  I will always be fair and impartial but I\u2019m very disappointed in how their quality of food portions have went down on my favorite Spicy Shrimp fried rice.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlTbSQ9Gp43Kzw__JQaFlVqzZWHub--JKCyAcE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeNcBABrSWjDIRG5pUIaj9T7Tz0QO3WHPlx7Hf=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHwl1hjj8CRzUI4zJbh1aJIL3i41mw4frQO6AU=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPi8Z1Lszu3Am99t2lzZmyIRhVHhi0vIVncZjFI=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPK_wz3qQBDjRIs6ughWVz6IuyNdHLb19uVAqVr=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889175c961872eb:0xa39ef524b25ebc1d"}

They said they don't do fried rice with anything in it anymore. Seriously!?!? Not to mention, the delivery guy looked like a homeless person. He smelled really bad too, and this is the person bringing me my food?", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d7329cc073d:0x60b38f687fbc0396"}

It was failure after failure, and I have never before been subjected to such poor customer service.  That\u2019s the short version.\n\nThis is the full story. I ordered (and paid for) delivery from Asian Rim through Yelp Eat24 and, after waiting an hour and a half without getting any food or as much as a phone call, I called the restaurant directly to ask when I could expect my meal. I was informed by Colton that there was no order because they don\u2019t associate with Yelp Eat24 at all. Understandably, this freaked me out and lead me to believe I had been scammed. I then called Yelp Eat24 and demanded a refund after telling them what Colton had said. While they did quickly offer a me a refund (which \u2013side note-- I won\u2019t be getting for \u201cup to 5 business days\u201d), they were adamant that they did in fact work with Asian Rim and that their restaurant had actually already confirmed the order before I had called. I was still falsely placing my faith in Asian Rim at this time.\n\nAfter hanging up with Yelp Eat24, I hurriedly called my bank to inform them that I might have falsely been charged. All of this was quite time consuming and anxiety inducing. On a whim, I decided to call Asian Rim back again and relay to them the information I had been given by the representative at Yelp Eat24 for their own benefit. That\u2019s when Colton then informed me that they did actually work with Yelp Eat24 after all. He just hadn\u2019t known a third party, Backdoor, was also involved and it was their name coming up in his system. He unapologetically told me the food I had originally ordered would be at my house shortly.\n\nBut was it? No. So after even more time elapsed, I called Asian Rim a third time to ask what was going on. I was told by a different person that I should \u201cjust try calling Backdoor.\u201d I had to flat out demand to be told if the food had at least left Asian Rim yet. She finally said \u201cyeah.\u201d No apologies were given and I was rushed off the phone.\n\nThen I called Backdoor and was told that they did pick up the food from Asian Rim, but then realized the order had been cancelled. Aside from the refund Yelp Eat24 says they will give me, no other amends have even been attempted to be made.

When they first opened they were great. But lately it has not been good at all. The soup I order is always different now. One time it will be bland, next time so spicy it\u2019s not edible. Never consistent. I order soup omitting items. Yesterday tofu was included anyway, even though I ordered without. I ordered steamed dumplings and got home and they had not put any sauce in the box. I ordered a beef dish. The meat was not edible. Cheap, low quality. I hope they see my review and reevaluate things. I tried to explain to them, but the lady appeared to not understand, nor did she offer any explanation or compensation. I will wait a month or so and try one more time.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889197d07725fb1:0x10a035fd3761dfa3"}

It's about a mile from my house and craving egg drop soup I decided to run up before closing. It's located next to where the old Western used to be in Vestavia Hills. It's a small shop with about 8 tables close together filled with people having a nice chat between tables. I got our food to go this time but the portion sizes I saw were fair and steaming hot.\n\nI'm not sure if this is the China Bistro that was near Patton Creek or just a common name. I order Coconut shrimp, egg drop soup, pork egg foo young, crab ragoons( pricey but def tasted unique in a good way), and Mongolian beef. Overall the price was pretty standard. Everything was so hot I actually burned my mouth when I got home, ha. The food was super fresh and I was very impressed.\n\nThe Mongolian was my favorite, alot of places have a very sweet syrupy taste to their and I could taste the sear on the meat and the sauce was closer to a savory than a sweet. VERY freaking good. I felt the portion sizes for the coconut shrimp was a little small but frankly the shrimp was huge and delicious so you can be the judge. Egg foo young had a really rich brown sauce that I loved and the soup was classic Egg drop. Crab ragoons were def my favorite overall, that and the Mongolian beef.

Boy, big mistake. Apparently if you want something spicy, you have to ask for it. It being marked spicy on the menu means nothing. We also ordered Kung po Chicken  and shrimp, that is supposed to be very spicy hot , but again, nope, and it No shrimp  to be found. The last thing we ordered because we wanted to celebrate Valentines Day late was General Tso chicken, yes that is supposed to be very spicy too. Not only was it not spicy , it tasted exactly like the bland orange chicken. When I called to complain I was told that I didn\u2019t know what I was talking about. That her cooks know how to cook their food and if I wanted it spicy I was supposed to tell them. They charged me for the noodles which was ok because I expected that but when she asked if I wanted fried rice I said yes because I am not usually charged for that, Wrong. Not only is their food way over priced,but it isn\u2019t worth a reasonable price. The customer is never right there so don\u2019t bother to complain as she will just shout you down.

I went on a Saturday afternoon and was greeted by the hostess who had a mouth full of food and only said \"what you drink?\"\nI almost walked out after surveying the buffet but stayed against my better judgment. I was feeling lazy. The Diet Coke was so bad I asked for regular instead which wasn't much better, I used to work in the food industry and it was obvious the soda machine hadn't been calibrated in forever. The food was as mediocre as the service, it was luke warm and dried out. The flavors were just off, I think even freshly made it still would have been bad.  The atmosphere was weird too, no music, just a tv playing Fox news and the hostess' school age son running around playing like it was a daycare. And I ended up paying almost $9.

I\u2019m aware it is owned by a different individual than the one in Troy was but perhaps they should work on a few things. Nothing was labeled on the buffet bar, the potatoes were raw still and they do not keep the the buffet bars stocked well. My first experience was much worse so I thought to give it a second chance a few weeks later in case I just had bad luck that one time. The food today was OK...the waitress is really why I gave it three stars instead of just two. She did go out of her way to make sure our drinks were refilled. She didn\u2019t ever bring us our receipt and no fortune cookie. We waited around fifteen minutes but she sat in the corner with the other cashier/waitress talking and eating. So, we got up and paid at the counter then left. I don\u2019t know. The experience just wasn\u2019t grand by any means. The buffet is my biggest complaint though.

Who is that guy and why is he sitting at Jim's table? It was kind of funny, really.\n\nAs for the food, what can I tell you? This was most certainly not an imperial banquet for the Great Qing Emperor. There was some very passable 'double/black pepper' chicken; a decent attempt at beef & broccoli, and a few other entrees that didn't look as appetizing. The rice (fried) was okay, but the egg roll was the low point. It had a taste like they had rolled it immediately after cleaning the cutting board and not rinsing it off completely....kind of soapy. However, for some reason, it gave me some piece of mind.\n\nAll told, I have been to worse 'small town' Chinese buffets.

As the teenage girl brought out the bag with my order in it, I noticed she had her nose stuck off in it. When she saw the look on my face, she told me that it smelled sooooo good. I get into my car, and my four-year-old wants a piece. A few minutes later, I hear, \"Don't wike it, daddy\". This kid loves chicken on a stick. So, I grabbed the biggest piece and bit into it. The taste of tainted chicken filled my mouth and nostrils. Then it dawned on me as to why the girl had her nose in my bag. She wanted to see if I'd be able to tell, by the scent,  that the meat was tainted. THEY PURPOSELY SERVED ME TAINTED CHICKEN!!! NEVER AGAIN WILL THESE DISGUSTING PEOPLE SEE MY BUSINESS AGAIN.

When I arrived, shortly before closing time at 9, I was told that they were out of white rice. The owner just stared at me, as if I was just supposed to accept that , take my dinner, and go.  After an awkward pause, I asked if there were some other alternatives. The owner, I guess, asked if I would like fried rice, which I declined because I don't like fried rice. I asked if I could have lo mein instead. She proceeded to tell me that I would have to pay extra for lo mein, $1 to be exact. Now while the amount is nominal and it's certainly not a big deal, the overarching principle of customer service is a big deal. The professional thing to do would have been to call me back when they found out that they did not have the specific item that I ordered so I could have made an adjustment then. Instead, when I arrived around 9 to get my order, I was essentially punished for mistake that the restaurant made. And I won't even go into detail about the attitude that the owner got with me when I raised an issue with her about her treatment of the matter. Also, I should note that when I arrived at 9, my food was still not ready, and I had placed the order 45 minutes before. If you have no other options and cannot leave Livingston for Chinese food, then do what you will. But there are much better options in Meridian and Demopolis that are far more worth your time and your coin. I don't feel you should patronize places that don't put the customers first, especially when the food is mediocre to begin with.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88844ce846627ff9:0xaaf2fe3d58de2e44"}

I wish I could rate 10 stars because it deserves more then 5. We walked in and we're immediately greeted and seated in barely 1 min after walking in the door. We were given water and asked if we would like another beverage (we typically always just drink water anyways so we just stuck with that.) We were then asked if we would like some time looking over the menu. We took a few minutes and not long after we were ready to order the server was back and ready ( they had perfect timing the whole visit.) We ordered seasame chicken and orange chicken, our favorites it also came with some fried rice.) We waited maybe 10min at the most for our food. It was hot, fresh and delicious! My water never went over 1 min empty. We were checked on in a timely manner. When we finished eating the feast of a meal (honestly there was enough food for a family of 5, depending on how that much that family eats of course) we got 2 to go boxes which each was half filled with more fried rice! We still had about half a bowl left! We also received our bill, with two fortune cookies and two orange slices for dessert! Yum! <3 payment was quick and easy too.

Needless to say, I've been around the Chinese Food block a few times. When I was younger my families favorite spot was the China Express right off Victory Drive next to the Raceway. Then when I turned 17 we moved to the Harris County border, which is a good 40 minute drive to our beloved China Express. The search began...... when it comes to exterior and interior design, and amusement levels, Ched Lee's is hand down a place of it's own. Its beautiful, and feel really traditional with all their koi fishies. However, the amazing atmosphere does not reflect in their food. Chef Lee's is easily the most expensive chinese place in Colunbus, and yet somehow the food is easily not the best in town. Their lomain tastes and looks exactly like the microwave kind from Walmart. The egg rolls lack flavor. I dont really know how to explain it, the food just seems.... off. The fried rice is not truly fried rice. Someone called it \"northern chinese food\" which might make sense as to why my mother LOVES them. She grew up in NY.

I was so excited after reading how proud the owner of the place was of his food. I really wanted to try your cuisine. But when I got my food, there was no flavor. The sauce was thick and brown and looked good enough, but it was barely savory despite its looks. As for the ginger, it may have been a milder variety, but it wasn't spicy/flavorful at all and at first I thought I was eating bamboo. The green onions were fine. The squid was the tougher, more chewy kind I personally dislike. I have no idea what it's called but some dishes from other restaurants have it too (when I get Tom Yum) it's not just this place. I'm not holding the squid against them for this reason.\n\nI don't know if it's usually like this, but when we went we saw a lot of old people so maybe they hid away the spices until senior swim was over. Jokes aside, I'm disappointed we aren't able to experience the cooking that earned your restaurant awards and praises. I wonder if it's gone downhill or if we just came on a bad day.

It's probably the best game in town for Chinese food. There is a sense, especially at lunch, that you're getting something not quite authentic (sorry David Chang, I know you hate that word).\n\nIt's something gummy and sweet and targeted to Southern palates that probably wouldn't thrill at the \"real stuff\". Maybe once, maybe when Chef Lee's occupied that architecturally interesting building in South Columbus. But not anymore. Now it's the inoffensive place you go after church on Sundays, a place you can count on to produce the exact same shredded pork with garlic sauce you've been eating for fifteen years.\n\nSo, it's fine.

The sesame chicken was just chicken fingers drizzled in sauce, so I would personally not recommend it. The customer service is why I gave Chef Lee\u2019s a 1 star. The waitress was awesome, the manager though not so much. I am a petite girl, so I understand my age does not look 21. As obvious the waitress must check your ID to order an alcoholic drink, and that was no problem. The manager had came over though and started yelling in the room \u201cyou look sixteen years old\u201d. Then demanded to check my ID again. So of course I let her check me ID. As she is checking my ID she is repeatedly yelling \u201cyou look sixteen, no way\u201d. After she questioned me on about everything my ID had, she seemed upset and gave me my ID back with no apology. I felt all the attention in the room just locked on my table. As the manager walked away she continued to yell \u201cyou look sixteen\u201d and then go talk to her employees angrily as if I had gotten away with the best fake ID in the world. At the end of the dinner the manager decided to take it upon herself to yell at our waitress as well for not coming to grab the check, even though she was giving us excellent service.So further more, do I recommend going to Chef Lee\u2019s? No I do not.

We ordered sweet and sour chicken for the kids and when we received our order it had the chicken completely smothered in the sweet and sour sauce. When the kids barely ate any of it, the waiter said \"you should have listened to me when I told you that you should have had the sauce on the side\". That would have probably been great advice. The problem is she never gave that advice. It was wrong for me to assume that it was going to come on the side in the first place, but In fairness the order description does not suggest the chicken comes smothered. Overall I just thought the tone of the waiter was a bit rude.  The food tasted okay but wasn't anything better than you can get from a regular takeout restaurant. The prices are certainly higher.

Seeing a lot of reviews, a high rating and then the beautiful outside and inside atmosphere I was excited to try the food. The prices were only slightly higher than what I'm used to paying in a sit-down restaurant and the service was excellent. Unfortunately, we found the food bland or overly sweet with the fried appetizers having a heavy grease taste.\n\nMore detail for my fellow read-every-review people and the owner:\n\nWe felt that the egg rolls were large and fried well but tasted bland and were greasier than we're used to; the pot stickers tasted of grease and the dipping sauce tasted only of soy, not the pot sticker sauce we know and love; the won tons in the soup were very large and there were plenty of them but there was little filling and the broth was very, very bland; sweet and sour pork had nice chunks of pork that weren't overly battered but the sauce was almost too sweet to eat (my kids have never said this before); the lemon chicken came as a whole breast that is battered, fried and then sliced which looked great and the chicken was moist but the sauce was overly sweet without lemon flavor; the orange chicken had chicken in small pieces fried so hard we had trouble chewing it and the sauce was just sweet without any orange flavor; the kung pao shrimp looked great and had a generous amount of shrimp but had a bland sauce without any heat; lastly the mongolian beef was very tender but the sauce was again way too sweet. All of the meat was of great quality and the vegetables were fresh.\n\nI rarely leave a negative review. We don't consider ourselves to be picky eaters. We have enjoyed Chinese food all over the US and have tried 5 other Chinese restaurants in the area to date and have never been disappointed like this. I feel this must be out of the norm for Chef Lee's or they wouldn't be so successful. That said, we weren't happy with any of the food and that is out of the norm as well. Usually if one menu item is disappointing the others are fine and enjoyable. According to my experience and other one star reviews something is going occasionally but very wrong in the kitchen or the food is hit/miss and we had the bad luck of spending a lot of money there on such a night.\n\nSorry Chef Lee, I really, really wanted to love your place!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1529596913968, "text": "Sara, it's very disappointing we didn't live up to your expectations.

We went in and realized the restaurant was ran by Koreans and not Chinese as their advertisement would say.  I asked to order a half Peking Duck and inquired if it was true Peking style that came with the buns.  The old Korean lady said \"yah yah\" as she answered the phone and took another order at the same time.  I asked again about the buns and she said \"yes.\"  I paid for my order and waited.  When the food came out, I told my husband to look at the order and make sure the buns are in there.  The old lady then said \"no buns unless you order full duck.\"  I reminded her that I asked earlier and she said yes but then the answer swiftly became a no.  Also, the way the duck was prepared was definitely not Peking duck style.. It's like breaded duck scraps. Disappointed.\n\nMaybe sit down service might be different but definitely the Korean lady was not the greatest.

Speaking of which, it appears that you mistakenly ordered the Crispy Duck, which is very different from the Peking Duck and doesn't include the buns.

Not a game changer but I thought I would include it. My friend's chair had a thread from the carpet wrapped around the leg which caused the carpet to unravel. The water I ordered tasted off. It tasted like unfiltered tap water. I started eating my food and noticed that the food lacked seasoning. The wonton soup was also the same. I got an egg roll at the buffet and it tasted stale. It was definitely not fresh. The waitress came around only once to give us refills. We did not go back for seconds as we did not like the first plate. We waited for our check but our waitress was cutting green beans with scissors at the hostess stand.
