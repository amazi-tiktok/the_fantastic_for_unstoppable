I apologize if you feel that I was ever dishonest with you. However, I do feel that there is a misunderstanding. We do not bill insurance in any form and we were not charging your insurance. We don't even currently have a way to bill insurance as we are not set up for it. The drug test cups that are used in-house we buy ourselves- your insurance is not charged for this. The samples are sent off to an independent lab for confirmation. Once those samples leave our office, we no longer have anything to do with them. The lab is who will bill your insurance to cover their cost of the lab confirmation testing. The drug test confirmations are required for us to do in order to write medications for certain diagnoses. This doesn't have anything to do with our office, nor do we get any of that reimbursement from the labs, as it is a completely separate entity. The only thing we get from the lab are the results of that confirmation testing. The new patient paperwork has a page dedicated to the drug testing and explains all of the above in it- which all patients initial and sign this sheet. I do feel as if it is unfair to accuse me of this and wish you would have brought your concerns to me.  I hope that this has helped clear up the misunderstanding, and I hope that if you have any further concerns you bring them to me directly as I will be happy to help.

The staff is friendly and empathetic. I've witnessed and personally experienced each member of the team interacting with patients in a loving and hopeful manner. The road to recovery is arduous, and requires the proverbial village, but with a total treatment plan and genuinely connected medical team recovery is attainable. Of course you must also add to this equation a willing patient and family, and if you are looking into Suboxone then you already understand the recitivism rate in relation to treatment. The prices for Suboxone treatment are typical, but the true win is loving and caring people like Mr. Steakley and Mrs. Erin.

MONEY. That is all that is on the guys mind that runs the place. Be prepared to pay around 600$ for your first month's visits. Part of that goes to the counselor that you must see. She is 80 years old and will tell you the same things you have probably already heard. This place is cheap in every way. The office has the worst layout. During your wait, which is at least an hour, you will sit on an old stained uncomfortable chair right next to someone else. The place is tiny. He does not have air conditioning and only props the back door open. There are no magazines at all or anything else to occupy your hour wait. Only watch the guy behind the desk answer calls, collect and count money, and get folders ready for the docotor. Work which 2 or 3 people should be doing. No wonder my papers were lost multiple times that I had to re-do because of him. He tried charging me again a few times because he forgot he did because of his multitasking. Instead of paying someone to have things organized he saves the money and does it all himself. Office consists of himself, counselor, doctor, and a drug tester. The only bathroom has no running water at the sink and is filthy. You or anyone else can not wash their hands after being drug tested. When you finally make it in the doctors office, which is just a desk and a chair across from his, the doctor will give you the lowest amount possible prescription that you will pay an outrageous amount for to get. They offer no discount card and don't even mention it because they make more money. Which all the other places give you a discount card. This place only sees people on Tuesdays. So if you don't make it you are in trouble for a week basically. The place is very unorganized and unprofessional, but charge you as much as they can get off you. If this review doesn't sway you to another place, then you will see first hand when you go to there that I was being honest about everything I mentioned. Good luck in your search and I wish you the best.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1474908297670, "text": "I am sorry it seems you did not get what you wanted when you came here. However, nothing you posted is accurate. Let me point out below:\n\n1. Focus definitely doesn't charge anywhere near $600 and is actually one the cheapest clinics around.\n2. There is a counselor that is available to see if the patient wants to, but the patient is not forced to see her.\n3. The fact you complained about having to sit in a chair \"right next to someone else\" is ridiculous. Any waiting room has chairs right next to each other. However, Focus has two waiting areas, so if you don't like the front waiting area, the patient is more than welcome to wait in the back waiting area.\n4. There is air conditioning. Period. Always have, always will.\n5. There are magazines that sit on the front counter to the far left next to the wall. Right next to the coupons (we will get to that later).\n6. Focus is a small business. Two employees (one in the front, one in the back) plus a doctor is common and  was adequate. However, now Focus has added some new employees.\n7. There are two bathrooms; male and female. Both have always had running water. Focus does ask for patients to not flush or wash their hands until they bring the urine sample out, which is common anywhere for drug testing in order to try to keep people from bringing in or manipulating urine samples. They tell the patient to go back in and flush and wash hands immediately. Gross. This is probably the most ridiculous statement thus far.\n9. The doctors offices is a desk and a chair. What do other doctors offices look like? This is what any doctors office Ive ever been in has looked like. Were you expecting exam tables in an office that doesn't do exams? Focus isn't a \"doctors office\". They see patients for addiction and nothing else.\n10. As far as the doctor giving the patient \"the lowest amount possible\", this is up for individual discretion. Focus doctors try not to over prescribe medications, as all doctors should try to do. Each patient is given whatever amount the doctor thinks is necessary for that patient.\n11. Focus has always offered discount cards. There are cards on the front counter, to the far left (next to the magazines). There are also some behind the front desk that patients may ask for when they need one or that are offered to new patients. The part that says \"dont even mention it because they make money\" is ignorant. They aren't a pharmacy. Focus makes no money on anything outside of that initial payment you pay at the beginning of the appointment; no money off the prescription or medication; no money off counseling; nothing extra.\n12. Lastly, there aren't appointments only on Tuesday. Focus has doctors here Monday- Friday rotating between morning clinics, day time clinics, and night time clinics.\n\nI'm sorry that you had a bad experience, or that you didn't get what you wanted and you felt you had to post such a message, however, there are people at all clinics of every genre that wont be happy with something. Focus goes above and beyond to try to help each patient individually and will continue to do so."}, "gmap_id": "0x88891ec4422c10f1:0x98a1939500c9e209"}

Assisted me in my court cases and even today I stand strong and sober without my Gods love my will and their \u201cwhole-way house\u201d I would not be where I am today!

My community corrections officer an my mom an dad found this place for me. I was afraid an overwhelmed just like a few others, in the beginning! Not completely knowing what to expect an being away from everything and everyone I knew. That was key tho, an very soon into my journey I would find this out.

An 3rd it takes a higher power! Speaking for myself and only myself I found all of these things here at THE LOVELADY! God has always been a huge part of my life BUT I refound Him here. You see even tho He never left me I NOT ONLY LOST MYSELF IN MY ADDICTION I LOST HIM. An IN RECOVER YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HIGHER POWER!!! I choose for mine to be God! Mrs.Brenda, Mrs.Melinda, Ms.Brandi, an i definitely cant forget Pastor Lesley an Pastor Mullins! An so many more from admin to exit! I cant say enough good about them all. All of them have made it possible for females like me to learn how to live again. Of course there is some bad BUT all in all it was a great experience FOR ME! I was reading a post from a Ms.Silas an I completely disagree. The foodstamp stuff and the thrift store stuff is completely untrue! This program is Blessed, The Hand of God is on this place because they do so much good! There was a store where you could treat yourself an they do take foodstamps for your convenience. They do try an get you back out into the working world BUT IF YOU HAVE ISSUES THEN YOU CAN WORK WITHING THE FACILITY! Ms.Silas failed to tell you how you do schooling you can have your children here, they can go to school as well. So many good things an I will stand firm on this!!! THANK YOU LOVELADY CENTER!

I have always appreciated the way he and his staff takes care of his patients. So yesterday 2/24/2021, I had a problem, post visit with my prescriptions getting filled. Basically the pharmacy didn't have my prescription. So when I used the telephone to call back into the doctors office, I felt like I wasn't going to be able to be helped properly. Not because of unprofessional staff or them having a desire to not help me. But because its a doctors office during a pandemic on top of already taking care of patients.\nSo I went online and began reading reviews. One response I kept reading was \"did you try messaging us on social media or direct thru our website\"? So that was what I decided to do. Now it was after 6pm when I messaged and just a few hours later I got a response. You may think getting a response at 9pm seems bad, but let me tell you. When your in need of help, getting a response at 9pm let me know that Go medical is taking care of their patients.\nSo now here we are at 930am the following morning and my problem has been resolved. Thanks Go medical. I could not be more pleased with your quick help. A million thanks over!\nJohnny Butler", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1614191689286, "text": "Thank you."}, "gmap_id": "0x888a1b9bcf7334a1:0x6a391a8d81a1485"}

In the beginning I was heard, I was treated for my conditions, everything was going fine in my life other than one issue.(5\u2b50\ufe0f then) Until my last appointment, I didn\u2019t even see Dr.Go after being told that\u2019s who I would be seeing that day. I seen a Np that knows NOTHING about me or my conditions & who was rude and kept cutting me off, wouldn\u2019t even listen to what I had to say, She was hateful to me both times I was seen by her. She laughed at my concerns the first time. The second time she treated me like a liar and someone just fishing w/out allowing me to talk to inform her on what Dr. Go and I had discussed about MY issues and what actions we had taken so far. She admitted that she didn\u2019t know what my apt was even for. Dr. Go stopped one RX, that is REALLY dangerous to just quit prescribing to a patient \u201cCold Turkey.\u201d It states on the FDA website,& medical professionals that tapering IS necessary, I wasn\u2019t tapered at all. I wasn\u2019t I informed at my previous appointment with Dr. Go that I would no longer receive this RX. I didn\u2019t even get my own choice on which I believed my body/mind needed more to have quality of life. Along with the only testing/imaging that was ever ordered was ultrasound and CT which my disease won\u2019t show up on neither one of those as that has been proven by many other medical experts. Nothing further was even discussed to get an accurate diagnoses. Sent me for a CT with dye knowingly that I have a allergy to contrast dye and I had to be treated at the ER because of this and have my husband come 30 miles away to drive me b/c they didn\u2019t check my chart before ordering the scan. Dr. Go has always treated me w/respect and mostly listened to concerns. There was a few times I felt like he was only concerned about a symptom we\u2019ve already discussed when I had multiple concerns that was never addressed. I paid $70 copay to be seen every time besides once therefore I should see Dr. Go. He did help me for 6+ months, especially with my anxiety, etc, but now that my anxiety meds was removed w/o me even being informed my anxiety is @ it\u2019s worse since I lost my dad & two miscarriages this past year. If I was told last month, I could of tapered myself knowing that you need to safely be tapered from any barbiturate. So I felt reeled in at the start. I didn\u2019t break any rules or anything to cause this, either. My first apt I went I was told I would be seeing DR. Go, I didn\u2019t see him that day either. That day was with another NP, Dr. McDaniel, who I DO recommend if you go and have to see a NP. She truly did listen to my concerns and try her best to treat me in the best way allowed, I\u2019d solely give her a star alone, but again I was told by the front that day I\u2019d be seeing Dr. Go & didn't. Normally most DRs would have you come back in two/four weeks to monitor how the meds are working/if they need to be adjusted/changed, to check on how you\u2019re doing with them.  I was really disappointed in the care I received from the office my last visit. I\u2019ve been referring a lot of people to this office, but now I\u2019m unsure if that\u2019s the right thing to do. I truly hope this was just a mistake on the NP side & when I do go back I can see DR GO HIMSELF & discuss options or I will be looking for a different PCP to receive the help to accommodate me. I truly don\u2019t want to do that, but I don\u2019t want to continue to throw away $70 with nothing accomplished, really. MOST of the staff has good bedside manner,a few that could use more discipline as JOKING ab patients after they leave & their private health info is very unprofessional.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nUpdate: to the response, thank you for replying. I am not meaning my review to be hateful. I\u2019m adding a star since you took the time to look into this for me and replied. I have been satisfied the care I\u2019ve received prior to this day, that\u2019s why I said I didn\u2019t want to change PCP without seeing Dr. Go first to tell him how I am feeling about my last appointment.
