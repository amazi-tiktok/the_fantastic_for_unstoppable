I brought the car back in on Monday the 4th and told them the service engine light came on and something under the car was rattling. I was told by the owners son that he didnt know anything about standard shift cars and they would not be responsible for anything wrong with it. Almost 3 weeks later the car starts running hot. When my husband got to me to check it out he opened up the radiator to find that it is full of J.B block seal he runs over 80 gallons of water through the radiator trying to clean it out to no avail. We replaced the thermostat that was so coroded with block seal it was rusted up. I called and left a message with Pierce auto sales telling them that the car was running hot and because someone was trying to cover up a cracked block or blown head gasket and there was so much block seal in the radiator and engine that I didn't know if the car was going to make it home and that I really needed someone to call me back because I had no way to get it home. I never recieved a call back.It cost me $60 to rent a car dolly to drag it home. Now the car came with an outside warranty but because \"whoever\" filled the motor up with block seal to hide a major problem until they could find an idiot \"me\" to take the car off of there hands the warranty will not cover the car. So now I have a blown up car sitting in my yard that I drove less then a month and repo men knocking on my door because they want there car back and still after all this time I have yet to recieve a call from anyone at Pierce Auto Sales.  I recieved more help and sympathy from the repo man in 10 minutes then I have from Pierce in 2 months. I paid $1500 down for a car that didn't even last until the first payment was due. I dont bash people or businesses but i have tried every other way to get them to talk to me. I just want my money back so I can get a car that runs and won't leave me on the side of the road less then a month after purchase.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a56497104639d:0x842e60c3c94517bb"}

I advised her that no ma'am, I would speak to her about the issue once I finally arrived back, and ended the call...upon return to their marina, some 30-40 minutes later after being dead in the water,  they sent out a teenager, or barely 20 year old young man to interact with me...he asked if I had my decision...I advised that we wanted the gas comped, and an extra hour, or we wanted our money back...he offered me half price on gas, and the extra hour...I advised him that his offer was unacceptable, and we would be needing our money back...he then agreed to the free gas and extra hour. The second boat had a couple of safety concerns, but ran fine. The boats horn (a legal requirement) did not function,  and the door closest to the motor was missing...a child could very easily fall into the water if not paying attention.....all this being said, the young men working at the dock were nothing but courteous and helpful...the gentlemen who towed me in, again, very polite and helpful...but the customer facing folks inside the main shop were some of the rudest and most poorly trained people working in a customer service industry I've ever dealt with.

We drove almost 2000 miles to get to this dealership.  When we got there John the salesperson showed us the boat.  Wow, seeing the pictures which were carefully managed to avoid things he didn't want us to see we were very very disappointed.  There were large dents in the fencing (pontoon boat) and the picture provided of one spot on interior which was indicated the only interior damage avoided the fact that the helm chair had two large holes in both sides you could put your fist in where arm rests once were.  Sparing the rest of the details of the scene we told John we were not interested and when were were about to ask for our deposit back he said he had options for us.  One was of course new and the other was a 2016 Bennington.  Well, the used Bennington looked so much better than our disappointment we were interested in the Bennington,.  Having never had a Pontoon Boat before and knowing nothing about them really we thought and 2016 model has got to be okay, I mean what can you do in that short time, right?  The boat was not on a trailer at the time we saw it so the deal was he would load it on the trailer and make sure it was ready for our long trip home.  At the first rest stop on the interstate we stopped and I noticed water running out of the pontoons.  It ran and ran and on and on down the incline we were parked on.  I called John and asked him if I had bought a boat with bad pontoons.  John's response was, \"It has been in the water for a long time.\"   I thought, what is that suppose to mean?   It took about 45 minutes for the water to stop after I pulled the plugs out.  We continued on our journey and the next thing that came up was I noticed the hitch was making a lot of noise bouncing around.  I stopped and check to see what was going on and found out that the boat was back about 3 to 4 feet off the trailer.  I grabbed so tie downs I had in the truck and secured it best I could.  I tried moving the boat by hitting the brakes on a hill, nothing.  Because of the stress on the rear axle tires the weight blew one of the tires on the interstate which was fun.  I finally got some help with the boat moving it forward but realized that whomever John had load bout had not checked the bolts on that  hold the stop bunk in position and that they were loose allowing the boat to slide.\nWhen we finally returned home I contacted John and he said \" I don't know what you did to it because it was okay when you left here.\"  I told him that I didn't do anything but that he or someone he had working there had used the trailer for something that required moving the boat stop and neglected to tighten the bolts which caused the problem. His response was I would be happy to extend the warranty on the engine for another 6 months for your trouble.  We also asked not only about if the paper work had been completed on the engine warranty but I also asked about the boat warranty.  I was told that because John was out of town he would have to deal with that, interesting since the lady did everything else.  When John returned he passed the word that our 2016 boat did have a warranty and couldn't have one.  I had been online and found out that all Bennington boats have this incredible warranty which can be passed a long with the selling dealer's assistance.  John passed the word again that because this boat was sold new as a rental it could not have a warranty.  This was never mentioned to us at the critical moment ever or we would have really walked.  I have written several reviews and contacted the BBB and also the Alabama Attorney General's office.  The BBB said the Boat Mart has failed to answer them and they are trying again.  The Alabama Attorney General's office just sent us a letter which included John's response saying he never promised a warranty but he would happy to provide coverage if we take it into their dealership in Alabama 2000 miles away.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889fbf90b7743fd:0xf333c02278222ed6"}

I have a new 2018 21 ft boat that I purchased a slip($1,600) and trailer storage($200) for the year.    The boat was there about 6-8 weeks total.   To start with,  I called multiple times for a slip so they knew the size make and model of my boat.  After purchasing a slip it was the \u201cwrong one\u201d for my boat on day of arrival.  Luckily there was another slip that \u201cwould work.\u201d    This slip broke within a week.  We could not get the boat to come down out of the lift.  The lifts support had somewhat broken and was swaying/leaning putting a bind on the cables.   Had to cancel boating this day after standing around with guests for an hour so they could bring A-frames down another day to lift my boat out of the other lift to get it to another slip for a couple weeks.  Finally my slip was \u201cfixed\u201d.   Looked good at first but after a day out on the water we pulled in and the gears turned but the cables didn\u2019t move.  We called the office and someone came to assess after several minutes.  They hadn\u2019t put a pin through the gear into the pole to which the cable wraps.  We waiting for several more minutes while the guy went to find a bolt to fix the issue meanwhile we watched him go to the gas pumps and kinda \u201cwatch over\u201d people using the pump while taking his time getting us situated so we can get the boat up in the lift.   Because let me tell you it\u2019s a job holding the boat still in these slips to keep them from banging the metal deck( they have no rubber bumpers along the deck in slips). He finally got the bolt in and ran off quickly without saying a word even after expressing our appreciation.   Soon we realized something else was up.  The boat lifted but lifted sideways.  After several attempts to get it straight we saw that they never screwed  the poles guide down so when we were lifting the boat the pole walked(rolled) across the back beam causing the problem.  Mind you this lift was \u201cpatched\u201d together again as a fix.  They placed a 2x6 across one side to help with the leaning and scabbed the back ibeam where it had broke.   So again I called the office and was told to walk around and find someone to help.  So I found the manager near the dock and let him know what was going on.  He told me that he couldn\u2019t help because they had 5 other things going on right now and that I can\u2019t just come to him at 5 o\u2019clock and get help and that I should just move it to another slip(extra slip made for a wide pontoon boat that had rope pulling the cables closer together to supposedly fit a 21 foot boat).  I told him that we\u2019d had nothing but problems there and I asked if I could get my money back.  He chuckled a little and said there is no way as I signed a contract.   We immediately packed up our storage box along with the boat. It was about a 1.5 hr ordeal that day.  My boat will not be back there. To top it off,   My NEW boat has several bad scratches where the fire hose straps come up the sides of the boat.  These people were rude,  didn\u2019t want to help, and your boat will get damaged here.   So now I\u2019m out $1,800 as they refuse to give a refund.

They called the next thursday and said it was ready to pick up. Now, i was told that they replaced the seal on the drver side of trailer's oil bath hub, not the one that was heating up. Also, when the guy brought it out , both oil bath hubs were completely  full of oil, a big no no. Made it 4 miles back to gas station, same wheel hot as a firecracker. I then limped it up to scottsboro where I bought the boat and had it fixed . Both oil bath hubs had to be rebuilt, new seals, and the wheel was heating due to a stuck /bad hydraulic caliper! I went back to guntersville boat mart and spoke with the service manager where he basically called me a liar, and that they did replace the seal on one hub, and that the hubs were only half full of oil, so they couldnt do anything about the $165 bill they charged me for nothing. DON'T  TRUST THESE PEOPLE WITH YOUR BOAT !!!!!!! I called back to talk with the owner, he wasnt there,but she took my info for him to call back, as I explained to her how dissatisfied  I was, NO call back. I got ripped off here, and I guess thats ok with even the owner of GBM, so no, I would not do bussiness here.\nI have the proof on paper showing that nothing had been done to my hubs before getting them rebuilt by another boat mechanic, except that they did fill both hubs slap full of oil, which  that in itself will blow both seal due to the pressure. What a bunch of crooks. If it wouldnt cost me more than what I was charged, I would sue this place, and I'm still thinking about it, and have been advised by an attorney.

Micah was very professional and a great help. I was driving through for vacation and on the spur of the moment wanted to pick up a boat to fish within my current home in Arkansas, but also take with me on vacation to Gulf Shore and my home state Florida. I asked for the quickest turn around as possible knowing I would be leaving the next day. His team got me hooked up with financing through Tina, insurance, and a great price out the door the same day. Micah and his dad Drew took extreme care in ensuring I was happy with a demo ride before I signed and ensured all considerations to securing safely my boat for the 11 hour drive back home. You can tell they took great pride in what they did.

We bought a 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe(with around 29,000 miles and some warranty left on it) from them that had been wrecked...twice. Even though this was on the car fax, this information was not disclosed to us. We hear a noise in the rear of the vehicle, so we took it to a local Chevrolet dealership. We were told that the vehicle had been wrecked, not fixed completely, and unsafe for my children and myself to be traveling in. We were advised to contact the dealer first and give them the opportunity to make it right. Sport Center Imports wanted us to bring them the vehicle and let them have another Chevrolet dealer take a look at it. We were given a vehicle to drive and was under the impression that they were going to do everything they could to make it \"right\". We sought legal advise. We were advised not to accept the vehicle after they had their mechanics look at it, but give them two options... either find us one that was comparable, or buy it back from us. About a week later, one of the owners contacted us to let us know the Tahoe was fixed...it was just a coil spring that needed to be repaired.  Once we explained that we did NOT want this Tahoe, and this was not we had paid all this money for, we were told they would find us one comparable. So once again, we were under the impression they were going to make it right. When they found us another one, it had over 36,000 miles which meant no warranty....BUT we decided to go ahead and purchase it and put it all behind us (after having it looked at by our own mechanics). They agreed to pay the first one off (as a trade-in), and turn around and finance the second one. They did. However,  a couple weeks later, we got a call from the owner letting us know that a payment was late on the first Tahoe (that we traded back in to them BEFORE the first payment was due) and that he didn't want it to damage our credit. We needed to pay it and he would pay the rest of the Tahoe off. Once again, we had to threaten to get a lawyer. We had to contact the credit union to explain what was happening and that we didn't want our credit ruined. It has been a long, drawn out mess! Instead of doing the right thing to begin with, we had to continuously fight with these people to get anything done.  Now they have this very same Tahoe listed on their website.I am warning you...if you do not want a headache, I would look elsewhere.

Nick Morris was the first person to approach us and we were more than impressed with his easy, friendly demeanor and willingness to explore our wants in a new boat.  He spent time with us, but also gave us space to look around and gather thoughts.  That casual attitude of salesmanship is quite rare.  He knew tons of details about the Supra. Chad and the other guys were also so friendly & helpful with boat and purchase details. We understood immediately that we were buying a choice in a boat dealer and felt extremely comfortable that Skiers Marine was the number one choice.\n\nThis was a large purchase and we did not take it lightly, but the Supra quality coupled with Skiers Marine quality and reputation made this new boat purchase an easy decision.\n\nThank you for being at the boat show and all of the awesome incentives.

Kit Barnes was, by far, the best sales person that I have every worked with.  After 20 years of experience with I/Os and a desire to wake surf, we decided to look into purchasing an inboard/tow boat.  Our requirements were unique, in that we wanted a tow boat that was in the 25 foot length, had a large open bow area and yet could also provide a decent wave for surfing.  During my research, it seemed that a Mastercraft X55 was about the only boat that could potentially meet our needs.  I found a few X55\u2019s of interest on Boattrader, sent inquiries out, and Kit was the first to respond (within a day or two).  He later followed up with a phone call to better understand our situation and he even offered advice on different models and brands.  I was very impressed that he expressed interest in helping us find a boat that best matched our needs and really gave me a crash course on the different models of inboards.  The biggest thing is that he really worked with us on the X55, since I knew that we had to stay in a larger model to meet our family\u2019s requirements.  Kit was the only person that was willing to work with us to see if we could configure the X55 to produce a nice wake for surfing.  The test drive went great and with a few adjustments, Kit had the boat configured to make a nice wake for surfing.\n\nWe really appreciate the time that Kit spent with us in answering all of our questions and educating us on the Mastercraft X55.  We proceeded to purchase the boat and are also very happy with the ongoing support and service that Skier\u2019s Marine provides to us.

Skiers Marine provided us first class customer service and was by and far the most knowledgeable and down to earth. The owner, Rhett went above and beyond anything we would ask for in this process. For instance, he brought the boat from Birmingham to our friend's neighborhood on Lake Martin so that we could demo it. He spent a couple of hours with me, my wife, and my three little boys demonstrating the boat. Once we decided that we wanted the boat, the purchase process was straight forward and simple. We live in Northern Atlanta. I expected to take a day off of work to drive to Birmingham and pick up the boat. When the boat was prepared and detailed, Rhett called and let me know the day that HE could deliver it! Rhett drove to Atlanta, delivered the boat, and taught me how to put the boat in and out of the water. Yesterday, I arrived home to a package from Skiiers marine. I opened up the box and found two life jackets! Thank you Rhett and Skiiersmarine for taking care of us through this process.

I ordered a tube where i can fit my electrical fish rod tools but to my surprise, the product arrives with no end caps.  All while the product picture has end caps, which is basically false advertisement.  So let me get this straight, your customers are coming to your site to buy an empty tube with no end caps?  I can conveniently drive to home depot and get a random pipe for that.  Or even ask my neighbor.  How about putting it in capital letters on your site  that \"the tube doesn't come with end caps.\"  Then it would be up to the customer to read and do the proper product research.\n\nBut wait there's more.  So i was already super irritated at the lack of logic being used on this one but i refrained from writing a bad review.  Instead, I brushed it off, went on the website, and found I can just order these vynil end caps for $2, plus shipping.  Whatever! Right?  It happens!\n\nBut my disappointment didn't stop there.  I received the package, opened it and only one cap was inside.  Again, the product page is titled \"black vynil caps\" and the first picture is a picture of multiple caps.  So once again, misleading a returning customer that already gave you a second chance.  Where is the logic?  I am certain that you have run into this problem before.  Why is it not fixed.  You risk reputational damage for a few extra bucks.\n\nI just don't understand how your number one priority isn't to make life easier for your customers and delighting them at every step of the sales process....  I am stuck between throwing the tube out and looking elsewhere, or just ordering another stupid end cap and paying shipping FOR THE THIRD TIME", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1607389600380, "text": "Hi Ersi.

I WILL SUPPLY PHOTOS AND AUDIO OF OUR CONVERSATIONS( from when I picked it up) TO PROVE EVERYTHING STATED HERE IS TRUE! I found Trey(the owner) via Facebook, I always do my research. I saw these reviews, and decided to give him a call, it was a week before memorial day weekend. I can provide all call logs, I told him I have an RV that has a lighting issue that I need checked. Considering I am a first time owner he said it may be a simple fix. I said great when may I drop it by? He said he is backed up and it would really help him out a lot if I could bring it by that Tuesday, I told him that sounds great. He asked that I send him my address and the issues via text before hand. I did. I had to work late and had my cousin drop it off. Please see the photos of our texts. I told him a million times DO NOT BUY ANYTHING for the RV I ONLY want a diagnosis. He took a week, and ended up purchasing: -LP for the RV, Checking the outside, HE BROKE the generator and told me that it stopped working. He even said on audio, it was working when you dropped it off. HE broke the battery disconnect again which was working when I dropped it off. When I went to pick it up he kept repeating how he put me in front of other projects and he needs more time. I explained how he told  me to bring it in on that day because he was behind the previous week. He said well ,.... this that...ect Please see the itemized bill of the charges and work he tried to charge me for that I specifically asked him not to do. I have no doubt he is good at working on more commercial projects,but to try and take advantage of  smaller projects is just not good business. I found another company I would recommend to anyone else who is looking for help, If you drive to him he will diagnose for free and walk the entire vehicle with you! It's Deitz Mobile RV. He does have a few different businesses so his response may be slow, but at least he is honest and up front about everything!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88f541dfde9e7129:0xe6a0cb3d6d31693d"}

I Felt like the bill was a little high compared to the previous year but did not bring it up when I was there because I couldn't remember exactly what I paid before and I had to be at work.

More than likely fake accounts made to influence the rating on Google.  Look though the reviews of those with real accounts.\n\nWe had mixed experiences. It seems it depends on the mood of the sales folks if they want to be fair or try to score on a huge markup on a sale.\n\nYou will find \u201cinternet\u201d pricing on many of their products and that price seems fair compared to other shops. The problem is when they give you the \u201cout the door\u201d price you will see they jack up the \u201cfees\u201d to more than make up for that good price.\n\nThey matched another dealer on our first purchase.    When I wanted to buy a second machine they quoted almost $7,000 out the door on a $4,697 internet priced motorcycle with original msrp $5,299.   $1,700  in \u201cfees\u201d plus taxes.\n\nJust be aware of the hard sale tactics and watch the dealer fees.  They also want you to buy the massive markup warrantee and finance at 15-25%.  They actually don\u2019t seem to want cash sales.\n\nNeedless to say I drove over to Atlanta and I\u2019ve found several dealerships much easier to deal with.

I told him that all he had to do is turn the bike on and hit the gas (in order to see if it has a governor issue).

THEY WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AN INEXPERIENCED CONSUMER!\n\nMy 20 year old son purchased a Rancher with accessories including snorkel kit with Bama Power Sports. The salesman asked the service manager if installing the snorkel kit would void the warranty, the service manager said he didn't know but not to worry about it. They would fix it if it messed up. So, it was not disclosed to him that by using the accessories he purchased it could potentially void his warranty. He was however told by the salesman, in front of two witnesses, that Bama Power Sports would warranty it for 1 year \"It doesn't matter if you set it on fire or run it into a lake, we will cover it\".  THEY SAID WHATEVER THEY THOUGHT HE WANTED TO HEAR TO MAKE THE PURCHASE.\n\nThe first time my son took his Rancher out he used the snorkel kit. It got water in it. He looked under the 4-wheeler and there was a hose unattached. Had to be a poor install since it was the first time my son took it out. Honda Warranty will not cover it, snorkel kit, makes sense. But now Bama Power Sports is denying the salesman ever said anything about a 1 year warrant to these kids. Now I know these kids do not know anything warranties so they did not make this statement up. Bama Power Sports allowed my son to leave there thinking he was completely covered and is now refusing to make things right. $1,800 repair.\n\nWe tried to negotiate some sort of deal with them to take partial responsibility but they refused to speak to our attorney or have their attorney speak to ours. We decided we didn't trust these people enough to even work on it. When we went to pick it up they brought it out in pieces on pallets. I just hope all the parts are there. We now have to take it to someone else to fix it.

They advertised a sxs for one price but wrote it up for more than they advertised.not talking about the add on like extended warranty or prep fees.im talking the price on the tag for the unit. Save your self some time and money go to Motorcycle sports or Talladega cycle. Speedzone is already over priced. They sold my wife a used rzr for 2500 more than what it would cost new and it was bone stock.(extra b.s) so after taking our Polaris to have serviced thru there speed pass.this is ruffy 1 year later cause hey I paid for why not use it. Well let's start off by saying this is the 3rd time the ploaris has been in for service.so dropped it off on a Tuesday and they tell me it will be ready on the next day. So the next day rolls around and I do not get a call to come pick it up. So the next day Thursday I call them and ask if it's ready to be picked up. They informed me yes it is ready. So let's load the trailer and go to pick it up.once getting there they hand me paper work and he goes to find my sxs. He is walking around everywhere in the shop to find this sxs. So I look at the paperwork and it is paperwork for a Honda i used to own not the Polaris so I tell him it's the ploaris not the Honda due to the Honda being in Texas now. They then go on to tell me that they just completeld the work on my Honda.so that's when I decided to let him know that it's in Texas. But yet they did the service and paperwork.once we found our ploaris we were told it would be ready the next day. So moving on to next day we get there to pick up the machine thsy has 150 hrs on it and they only do a 25 hr service on the machine. They cant tell me how many services it has had even tho they did it. So there goes our warranty  and extended warranty. Man this place is the biggest joke ever.

I said why didn't you say that when I asked and he said you have to tell us the internet price to get it for that. I said that is ridiculous. I will be going somewhere else. He called me a little while later and said I could get it for $15,640.00 out the door. I ended up going to Auburn to buy it because I feel Speedzone is a RIP off. The place in Auburn was straight forward when I called and asked the price out the door.  Speedzone  also quoted me a windshield for $512.00, that on Hondas website has a MSRP of $479.00.

They advertised a sxs for one price but wrote it up for more than they advertised.not talking about the add on like extended warranty or prep fees.im talking the price on the tag for the unit. Save your self some time and money go to Motorcycle sports or Talladega cycle. Speedzone is already over priced. They sold my wife a used rzr for 2500 more than what it would cost new and it was bone stock.(extra b.s) so after taking our Polaris to have serviced thru there speed pass.this is ruffy 1 year later cause hey I paid for why not use it. Well let's start off by saying this is the 3rd time the ploaris has been in for service.so dropped it off on a Tuesday and they tell me it will be ready on the next day. So the next day rolls around and I do not get a call to come pick it up. So the next day Thursday I call them and ask if it's ready to be picked up. They informed me yes it is ready. So let's load the trailer and go to pick it up.once getting there they hand me paper work and he goes to find my sxs. He is walking around everywhere in the shop to find this sxs. So I look at the paperwork and it is paperwork for a Honda i used to own not the Polaris so I tell him it's the ploaris not the Honda due to the Honda being in Texas now. They then go on to tell me that they just completeld the work on my Honda.so that's when I decided to let him know that it's in Texas. But yet they did the service and paperwork.once we found our ploaris we were told it would be ready the next day. So moving on to next day we get there to pick up the machine thsy has 150 hrs on it and they only do a 25 hr service on the machine. They cant tell me how many services it has had even tho they did it. So there goes our warranty  and extended warranty. Man this place is the biggest joke ever. For anyone to buy from them and give a good review. They must be standing by your side telling you what to write before you leave there store.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb1bde65c108b:0x62fbe3204d515c82"}

I was keen  on the idea of having manual AND automatic transmissions on the same bike.  I felt this would be a logical transition from moped to a cruiser style bike.  Jennifer and the helpful financing department were able to help me trade in my moped and put me on a brand new Honda CTX 700.  I got on the bike and got used to it.  I rode and rode and had to make myself go home because I was having such a hell of a time riding.

Throttle response was great an more power but that's not why i brought it there. So i went home looked at the carbs and the funnel of the carb was cracked. Its suppose to be new parts.

My opinion, if you have a real issue with your bike take it somewhere else, but if you need tires or something small, by all means go ahead.
