Come to find out they have a contract with the state. which I understand. But if they are going to take another call and put it before mine I would think they would have the common decency to at least give me a call and let me decide if I wanted to wait three times what I was expecting.

The tow truck the police called out to pick my truck were nice and quick, But when they asked where I wanted them to take it to, they seemed a little bit annoyed that I wanted it to go to my home, as I wanted to talk with my insurance agent first. I suppose they prefer taking them to their place or a body shop.\nWhen they unloaded my truck, a good bit of the plastic from the headlight and grill fell out on the tow truck, And the driver just brushed it off into my yard where my truck was sitting. I didn't think much of it, I'd just clean it up in the morning when I went out to take pictures to start working with my insurance.\nI talked to my insurance, They told me because it's a newer model truck,  That they would have someone from their salvage provider come pick it up, I believe it was 3 days later when I got a call from a lady from IIA or IAA, saying that she was about to be giving a driver the information to come pickup my truck and verified my address and the damages with me.\nNot too terrible long after I spoke with her and said ok to having another tow truck company come out, Joey actually called me when he was roughly 30 minutes away from my home to verify my address and that everything was ready to go. He showed up just as he said and came to the door and got me to explain why he was there, And actually gave me the rundown on the process of what would happen if progressive did or did not total my truck. I handed off my keys to him, He went and got  his truck from the street and backed it in to where he'd be able to load it up. Before he backed up into the location, he did ask me if I had septic in the area (I I didn't)  He said he always asks when he has to enter a yard,  Said he's never had a problem with accidentally finding a tank but really didn't want to have to make phone calls explaining a problem!  LOL!\nHe got down under my truck and did his work with some chains, Put it in neutral to wind it up his truck and chain it down. Now, this is where I became surprised,  He picked up every piece of plastic and debris that had come from my truck and put them in the bed. I never asked him to!\nI asked why he did and he said he wanted it to be just as if he and my injured truck were never there. I'm still amazed that there a people that have that mindset.\nWe talked for a few more minutes as he finished loading and chained my truck down, I asked where they were out of and he gave me a business card with everything on it. I'm in Chilton county, So it's not feasible for me to call a company that's an hour plus away,  But he told me that you have trucks all over the place at any given time, And to call if I needed help, That you might be right down the street!\nAs I said early on, I never thought that my best experience in this headache would have been the guy that picked up my truck and towed from my home to Progressive's auction yard. It ended up being totaled,  But I'm loving my new blue f150!\nThank you to Joey and Hank's!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1580148883770, "text": "That is so amazing to hear, Brian!

They accepted the job and didn't call/notify/cancel the job to give my Dad the opportunity to get another company assigned to the job, they just left him stranded!!! Then, my husband called them last night and they accepted his request for a tow directly,no AAA,  he called them himself since they were close. They told him they would be there in no more than 45 minutes. 1 hour later, no word. He calls them back, they say they took another job and would get him as soon as they finished. 3 HOURS LATER, my husband is still stranded and calls them for the third time. They end up telling him he may be better off calling another company. God forbid what would have happened or how long my husband would have waited if leaving it up to them to follow up on a service they accepted to begin with. Y'all are clearly in the wrong business, and people can be seriously hurt or have personal things in their life that an be SEVERELY affected by your negligence and lack of consideration. Thank God they weren't on their way to work or something pressing that required a timely arrival. Lesson learned.
