I told the delivery people to let me know if the casing needed to be removed.  They wedged the corner piece into the room without removing the casing.

I asked her to discount the sectional and repair the damaged door casing, and I would be happy to keep the sectional with paint on it. Emily told me she could knock $75 off of the price.

Asked if he could get his manager to do it when she came in later and I said yes.  I finally get the refund for the 3 but almost a week later, I am still waiting on the refund for the remaining 1.

The owner is a very kind man who you can tell has been in the business for a very long time. When purchasing something that can cost as much as furniture does now, it is important to purchase from someone who will honor their word. Not only did they offer several ways for us to finance, but delivery quick being recently relocated to this remote area in Alabama and no family to help move furniture was extremely nice. The owner gave us real honest advice not based off purely an income percentage of what he would receive on each piece. Because we were buying a complete living room and bedroom package including a mattress it was a big purchase and he was willing to help with the more that we purchased. I recently have had several back surgeries and the mattress was the most important piece. He personally spent quite a while with us walking through explaining the purpose of each detail on each mattress and again we were first time home buyers so we didn't really know what we were doing with buying a mattress; never had anything besides hand-me-downs. All in all an incredible experience and would recommend anyone who desires longevity with their purchase of something this magnitude to not buy second hand stuff and purchase from Harvey's where they keep their promises!!!!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1578090754019, "text": "Thank you very much for the great review.Sorry so long with reply,systemjust sent to me.Thanks.

Because not only do they have THE best Sleep Consultants, but they also have 5 Advantages that really show why they are THE #1 Sleep Store in the country:\n\n1)  The Low Price Guarantee (If you find a better price somewhere else, get it written down and they will beat it by 10% or the mattress is free.)\n\n2) Red Carpet Delivery Service (even SAME DAY Delivery in most areas),\n\n3) they have THE Largest Selection of beds (the company's buying power allows them to pass THE best Savings and Selection on to you)\n\n4) they are involved in our Local Community (currently accepting ANY donations for Foster Kids - clothing, toys, monetary, etc.  Even if you don't need a new Sleep System, if you want to help the Birmingham Community by giving to local Foster Kids, then just simply stop by ANY of the 18 greater Birmingham locations and place your donation in the bin located inside the store.)\n\n5) and MOST importantly:  the Sleep Happy Guarantee - this is my favorite.  It allows you to pick a new mattress, try it out for 120 nights, and if you don't sleep happy within those 120 nights, (for a small processing fee) you can do a one time return or exchange!  (Go back into ANY MattressFIRM and pick out another mattress if you think your mattress wasn't perfect the first time!)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889164cb1f7fb01:0xa5b1a21a2ea275c7"}

The staff even moved around several mattresses to different bases so that I would know exactly what I was getting.\nDelivery was very smooth! Although the poor guys delivering got soaked.  They delivered the same day in the middle of a storm, the were very polite.

I felt that this was something I wanted to share with everyone who is looking to buy a mattress.\nWhen I buy a mattress it\u2019s like buying a car, my wife and I went to 4 stores, one of them had aggressive sales pitch tactics, this may be why they have the word \u201cFIRM\u201d in their name.\nAnyways, I was talking with the guys at the fire station and they started to rave about the mattresses they had slept on at another fire station. They said they would do business with The sleep center when it came time to buy for there home. So since this owner took care of my friends I decided I would check them out. When we walked in the door the manager met us with a hello from the back of the store, he saw that we had two kids and asked if we cared if they played in a children\u2019s area (Automatically we were less stressed) so while the kids played he asked the standard questions and then directed us to three types to choose from but then something amazing happened.... he left us alone! Lol, me an my wife were able to lay on each bed and were able to be honest with ourselves  about the comfort and the cost. At one point we were worried because we didn\u2019t hear our kids yelling like usually, well that\u2019s because the manager was keeping them entertained. The whole process took about 1 hour which is mainly because we couldn\u2019t decide which bed to buy. They were able to give us the best offer we have found out of all four stores and then even added some incentives! Do yourself a favor!! GO HERE FIRST, I promise you, you are wasting your time if you go anywhere else.\nP.S. Thank you for taking care of first responders, that goes a long way, now I just have to talk my Chief in replacing my mattress at the fire station!

Both of these gentlemen were extremely knowledgeable and helpful. We already knew which mattress we wanted from our previous trips to Enterprise/Dothan but they helped us pick out the perfect mattress cover/protector & sheets that would help alleviate my husbands severe allergies. Nathan also went to great lengths to get us the best discounts and price for our purchases.\n\nThe delivery of our new king mattress went smoothly. Our apartments are in Saraland, which is free, and our unit is on the 3rd floor. The delivery guys carried it up with no issues and were very friendly and helpful.\n\nOverall I would say that our experience has been amazing with every Sleep Center we have worked with.

Everything they carry is nothing but highly quality name brand product.  The store manager, Michael, is one of the friendliest, and probably one of the most honest persons, you will ever meet.\n\nAfter losing all my belongings in a fire, I decided to replace my Sofa Bed with a Futon, but knew nothing about them except for what I could find on the Internet, and had lots of questions.  I searched the Internet for places to buy, and right away noticed the Sleep Center with 30 Five-Star reviews, so off I went with over a dozen question in my head.\n\nWhen I entered the store, Michael was speaking with a customer on his cell, and upon seeing me asked the customer if he could greet me.  After we shook hands I told him to go back to his earlier customer, as I often deal with customers.  Once he was finished with his earlier customer I explained my predicament \u2014 he even remembered hearing about the fire.\n\nI told him what I had read online about Futons, and told every question I had, one at a time, which he answered, explained, showed and demonstrated one by one.  He never mentioned the word \"sell\", \"buy\" or \"purchase\" once.  The more questions I asked, the more he answered, explained, showed and demonstrated, as cheerful as when we fist said hello.  When I asked about the \"anti-slip pad\" that all internet articles said was a must for the mattress, he told me that it's true, but that they are nothing more than urethane foam anti-slip drawer liners available anywhere.  When I asked if he was serious, he lifted every Futon mattress they have on display to show me that that is all they use themselves.\n\nBeing an avid Geocacher, I asked Michael if he was.  He said he never heard of it, but could I explain it.  I always do one better by showing how the app works (and even the quickie online YouTube video), and point out nearby Geocaches on the app's map.  Mobile may now have new \"Cacher\" in the game.\n\nBack on track.  I bought my Futon right there on the spot.  When it was the day of delivery, their truck driver called me up exactly when they said he would, told me he was nearly loaded, and would be over in 20 minutes.  18 minutes later they were knocking on my door, two minutes ahead of the promised time from earlier in the week. 15 minutes minutes later, maybe less, I had a fully assembled Futon in my living room., without a scrap of paper or cardboard anywhere.  A perfectly professional and quality operation, from start to finish.\n\nI now need to replace my master bedroom bed, and I will be going straight back here.   I have no need to even visit anyplace else.\n\nThe bottom of all this:  if you need to buy a Bed, Futon, Mattress, or the like, or simply have questions about such, this is the place to go first.  You will be patronizing local, and patronizing family owned, and you'll never have to give it a second thought.  (If you're also a Geocacher, ask Michael if he has a game name yet.)", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1516760301546, "text": "We very much appreciate you allowing us to care for you, Jay!"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d7350d88ab9:0x2ca38cf06b581b9e"}

Melissa Triplett Berger and I purchased an expensive Sleep Number Bed with all of the bells and whistles.  It was delivered last Saturday.  There is a $200 delivery and set up charge.  The person who delivered the bed could not get our phone apps to work (we did also order controllers).  I told him I would work on it after he left (and I was successful).  That night when Melissa set her sleep number and then I set mine with the controllers, neither side of the bed seemed to do anything even though we could hear the compressor pumping air and deflating each side separately (and yes, we know that you can only do one side at a time).   In addition, whatever number we were on, the best was just uncomfortable for us. Finally, neither of our individual sides of the bed seemed level.  We decided we just didn't want the bed.  We called customer service on the following Monday (after a poor night's sleep) and after waiting 15 minutes, I told the representative my story.   He reminded me that I needed to keep the bed for 30 days before I could return it.  I asked him if he really wanted me to sleep on a bed that didn't do what it was supposed to do for another 28 days (and yes, we tried resetting the bed)?  He said that it sounded like the bed was defective.  He said, he would waive the 30 day requirement but would still have to charge me the $200 return pickup fee that was in the contract.  I then said, so, you're going to charge me $200 to return a bed that even you think is defective.  He said he could send another bed but it might be \"a few days\".  I said a) So, you're not going to discount the delivery and setup fee for a bed that is defective, nor the return fee, and b) I don't want the bed anymore.  He said we would then have to pay both the $200 delivery fee and $200 return fee.   I decided to arrange the return and called the store.  The person we bought the mattress from said what customer service is doing is ridiculous.  At the very least they should waive the return fee because it sounded to him like the bed was defective.  He wrote an email to customer service to ask them to waive the return fee.  They called and we missed the call.  After calling back and waiting 19 minutes, they said they will not waive the fee.

I found the recliner that I had been searching for and asked if it was available in a different color. The sales lady rushed to answer \"No\" without checking their website or trying to verify her answer... I left there and went online, found the lady had lied and it WAS available in the color I wanted. So I drove to a neighboring city store and found a sales lady who was more than eager to help me... so I give the Sylacauga location a 1 Star rating, but the Alexander City location gets 5+ stars!

I completely paid it at the beginning of April 2021. From the time I fully purchased it in April to the end of May. No one had informed me of the status. I would call the store once every other week. When I called the facility they told me that the furniture was not showing delivery date. I showed concern that I have not received any possible delievery date and asked to speak to the store manager about finding another item with tbe same value that is available. Finally the store manager, (after I was concerned) said that it should be here the first week of June. I decided to not find a replacement since the manager seemed to be sure the furniture will be there. I called after the first week of June since I received no contacted in regards to delivery or any issues. Manager than proceeded to say it is now pushed to the first week of July. I received a call last week and the week prior telling me that my furniture was scheduled for first week of July. After first week of July passed, I called them Monday, July 12th, to be informed that it was again pushed to the week of July 26th. I asked the sales associate if I could get a full refund because their poor communication. And customer service makes me uneasy and I do not trust them that they will delivery my item. The manager was not there and the person said he will contact me on Wednesday when he returns. They told me that refund would not be possible because of the 72 hour no cancellation. I proceeded to call cooperate to file a complaint on their store and because it is privately owned they could not help me. They filed a complaint and said they will get in contact with me within 24-48 hours. After I received no response from cooperate and the store, I called cooperate again. During the process of calling cooperate on Friday, July 16th (less than four days since the last conversation with the store) I found out that the corner of my section is in the warehouse but that other pieces will be in august 26th. Again another time pushed and no response. Each time the dates have been undetermined or pushed further. There is no promise of a secure date. They are persistent on telling me cancellations are not possible due to the 72 hours after full purchase but yet this company does not hold themselves accountable to communication and delivery if their items. After long conversation, the sales associate on Friday, July 16th said the manager will issue a request for cancellation to the finance department and I will receive a paper check refund. I called today July 20th to ask about the status. The request was given to the finance department and now waiting for the finance department to contact me about my refund. The sales associate said that it will take up to 14 days. This is ridiculous. I understand that we are in Covid 19 times.

Please refer to Ashley Homestore\u2019s Facebook page to see my review in detail. The sales clerk ordered the wrong item. The delivery team did not honor their delivery time slot and did not have the decency to inform me in a timely manner that they were coming 2 hours early. They left the wrong dresser. I called Emmitt, the store manager, and requested for them to return to pick up the dresser, needless to say the dresser remained in my home for three weeks. I tried to contact the general manager, Nick on two occasions and, Emmitt was of no assistance and he never returned my phone calls either. After finally getting a scheduled pickup a week and a day later, the delivery team was an hour and 15 minutes late with once again no phone call or text. After posting my experience on their Facebook page, Nick called leaving a message with my phone number as the return contact. Also, someone from their management team left an email address that was not accurate. I say all this to say, my concerns have not been resolved and I did not receive the correct dresser that I paid for. Ashley Homestore will NOT admit their mistakes, correct their mistakes, nor treat their customers with respect. I spent right at $6000 and this is how they treat their customers.

Josh and I agreed on a (out the door) price that he stated would included free delivery and would include the best warranty that I could purchase. Once I got to the register to check out I was charged an additional 199.00 that was supposed to have been already applied to our agreed upon total. I didn't notice until after I left and looked over the receipt of this infraction. They told me that the set wasn't in stock and would take 3 weeks to be delivered. I offered several time to pick the set up myself but they insisted that I let them bring it out and set it up for free so I agreed. They told me that the set would come in a different dates and offered me split delivery. I told them I'd prefer if we just wait an get it all delivered at 1 time when it all arrived and they agreed. Fast forward to Thursday April 8th I called and was told that only 2 pieces were in but they were all scheduled to be there the week of the 8th. Friday the 9th I called bk and was told that the set was there. I asked when would it be delivered and was told that I had to come pick it up and that it wouldn't be delivered. Therefore I (rented) a haul and angrily went to to their store to pick it up. Once I got there I was told that it wasn't there and was at the warehouse which contradicted everything that I was told and wasn't where I originally paid for the set. At this point I was furious and Josh wasn't there so I was told. They then called him/Josh and he magically appeared from the back of the store smiling with mischief all over his face. Once he got close enough to see the anger in my eyes he detoured behind me and finally stood behind the counter accompanying the other 2 young ladies. He lied and tried to tell me that I wasn't given or offered free delivery but one of the assistants who also helped me select the set( she in particular was great and very helpful and even apologized) agreed that I was supposed to have free delivery. I then told him about the split delivery in which I knew nothing about until they offered and he dropped his head knowing that I was being honest. At this point I was furious but still needed my set. They then told me that it was at the warehouse and that the warehouse was closed. This is after they told me that it was at their location and I had to come pick it up. So now I'm standing there with a rented uhaul, being double charged for a warranty, furious and still not able to get my furniture. Long story short I still have to go pick it up again today. I would've canceled it all together but your charged a  25% restocking fee and can't return it over 3 days after the original purchase date. Josh continued to try and lie and say he told me this or that and I made him out to be a lie everytime. Josh is a lier so don't let those fb commercials fool you. My set was over 4k and paid upfront. Read over your receips as soon as you get it and make sure everything you agreed upon is stated and accurate. This is my personal experience, hopefully this will detour you from having a disastrous nightmare just as I did. Please shop else where. Hopefully everything goes smooth today once I go to pick it up.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1618330066688, "text": "Hello Mr. Gipson. Firstly, I would like to apologize for any miscommunications or any tribulations experienced with the Ashley Homestore Outlet. From my understanding of the matter, there were many miscommunications on the team's behalf. I am not sure why there was so much confusion with the Customer Service on this particular order, and this will be addressed to them. We are experiencing delays on orders due to covid, and though this is a common response for almost all things furniture nowadays, it is honestly the truth. Again, I would like to apologize for the lack of communication resulting in you prematurely renting a U-haul. Our Warehouse hours differ from the store hours, and this should have been addressed upfront ahead of time. I truly feel that if things had been communicated better, a lot of these issues would have been easily resolved, and that is our fault. On behalf of the company we hope you will accept our apology, and please feel free to discuss this matter further at cescalations@ahsmal.com, and a manager will respond.  With all this said, we want to thank you for shopping with us and appreciate you being a member of our community.

We were greeted by a salesman named Alex. He seemed to be a nice guy well versed and educated in product knowledge of everything they had to showcase and sell. We instructed him that we were just looking but we'd come back if we were interested in doing business. He and his manager promised exceptional customer service. We came back about a month later ready to purchase. We spent almost $7,000 with this salesman and company and was sold several empty promises. We were told that we'd have all of our furniture at the store ready to be delivered to our brand new home that we were building by the first week of December. That didn't happen. We were promised several different customer service calls concerning our furniture. They never happened. In December we were told for 3 weeks straight that our stuff was coming and it didn't come. Finally we got some of our things only to find out that as our stuff was coming off the truck that the delivery guys forgot the mounts to put our mirror up that goes to our dresser. Also that Alex ordered 2 loveseats instead of a sofa and loveseat. When I called to make him aware of his mistake I was told immediately that it was my fault as if I made up the invoice myself. I spoke with the manager Josh he apologized and put in a new invoice for a new sofa. He said that our recliner which we are still waiting on would be here the same time the sofa would, which would be Jan. 15th. I was told that if anything changed that I would receive a call. Guess what? That didn't happen either. After the delivery guys left I noticed that they messed up my front door casing in 2 different places. I called this Thursday to inform them of the damage and check to make sure everything was still on track and yet again I was given the run around by the employees and manager Josh as to when my stuff would arrive. Finally he said that yet again its been pushed back to the first week in February. He gave me Ashley's customer service email to send proof of damage and I was told I would receive a call or email concerning the damages as you might've guessed THAT! DIDN'T! HAPPEN!  Before ending our call he said he was going to give me a call the next day at 9:30 when he starts his customer service calls and you guessed it IT NEVER HAPPENED! Mind you we placed our entire order at one time in OCTOBER!!! We were told that there was a 6-8 week wait to receive our stuff which we were fine with because our home would be finished being built by then. It's now January and still were being given the run around. I have never experienced such unprofessionalism, deplorable customer service, and lies by a company who's standards are supposed to be way above par. I am livid and hate that I ever gave this company my business. They care nothing about their customers only about the quick buck that they can get. I wouldn't advise anyone to ever do business with this establishment. Your just another sale to them and they give you nothing but empty promises. If I could've given no stars I would have!

Management was very good.  Prices seemed to be excellent.  Quality seemed to be excellent.  Selection was very good.  The -2 star is because of my delivery.  I paid $75 cash for delivery, which is fine.  But, after all my furniture was placed inside my apartment and the delivery men left, I failed to check to make sure everything was delivered correctly.  The next day I open the box that contained my headboard and it was the wrong size and color.  Management had a new headboard delivered to me, but the delivery man refused to take back the incorrect headboard because he said, \"I don't have the paper.\", so I took the headboard back to the American Freight warehouse.\n\nWithin the next few days, I opened the mirror to my dresser and it was the wrong color.  I took the mirror back to the American Freight warehouse and management swapped it out for me.  In the end, I happy with my furniture but it appears my $75 delivery cost was wasted on my end due to the driving back and forth a few times to fix a few mistakes the delivery men made with my purchase.

They are very unprofessional and unorganized. We bought basically a whole house worth of furniture, when it was time for delivery they informed us that our sectional was not in stock and that it\u2019ll be in stock in 2 weeks and that they\u2019ll deliver it out to us with no delivery fee but we could still get our bedroom suite that we ordered.\nIncident #1: On delivery day I had to call and ask what time would the furniture be in because we were out running errands. They forgot to put our furniture on the truck and the delivery people had to come back and get it\ud83d\ude44 (I\u2019m sure if I had not called I would not have known)\nIncident #2:Two weeks later, which was on yesterday (Sunday) at around 12pm I called and spoke with OJay and asked was our furniture in. She told me yes(why didn\u2019t they call?) and that they can deliver it out same day. Okay cool. She then called back and said that we didn\u2019t pay all of our delivery fee which in fact when they delivered our furniture the first time my boyfriend gave them the delivery free PLUS A TIP. She then told me that it was okay and that they would take care of it. Later that day, at 4pm, I called again just checking to see what time they would be coming. The guy I spoke with asked would I be okay with getting it delivered first thing Monday morning. Uhh no. (My problem with this was WHY DIDN\u2019T ANYBODY CALL, I would be okay if they had the common courtesy to inform me of any issues instead of me having to call them.) The guy told me my furniture should be at my house no later than 10:45AM(I didn\u2019t know how if they opened at 11am) I asked was he sure and he said yes.\nSO THIS MORNING MY FURNITURE WAS NOT AT MY HOUSE AT 10:45! I called promptly AT 11am and spoke w/ the manger Rodney and he informed me that a driver was on the way to get my furniture to deliver it. If my furniture was not able to be at my house at 10:45AM they should have communicated that with me. I received my furniture at 12pm after all the mess I had to go through. I appreciate it if you guys would be more professional with your customers and communicated more with your drivers.

DO NOT RECOMMEND.\n\nFull story: I shopped at American Freight on Black Friday 2017 with high expectations after reading these reviews. And the experience in the store was fine. No pressure to buy, but a helpful staff answering any questions my husband or I had. We bought a sectional and ottoman set we liked even though they weren't available for delivery for 2-3 weeks. We were fine with the delay and left looking forward to it arriving in a few weeks (more time to find homes for our old stuff).\n\nThat's when the trouble started. Fast forward 4 weeks, no sectional and no call/news at all. I call the store and was told that my purchase wasn't on the truck as expected, but they would be calling other stores to see of they had it and we should hear something the next week.\n\nLife was busy so I didn't check again for another 3 weeks. This time when I called I was told they didn't know why, but it was on back order. But it would for sure be in the next week. I again expressed by hope that it would arrive as I very much looked forward to using my furniture.\n\n2 weeks later, no furniture.  At this point, 2 months after purchasing the furniture and as my husband and I are both active duty military and didn't have the time to go to deal with it, my mother-in-law visited the store on a Friday. She made a bit of a scene stating the facts in front of other customers, and wouldn't you know it our sectional and ottoman arrived on rush order the following Monday. Corners were scuffed in some areas, and a few tears from packing staples, but at that point we were so glad to have the furniture  and tired of dealing with the company that we accepted it anyway. I will never shop there again  and highly recommend you don't either.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2bce410ad21f:0xb1653e3c3ad41741"}

However the great reviews must be only for furniture that they have in stock. The couch and love seat we really liked was not in stock and we were told it would be two weeks until our furniture would arrive This was 15th of July. It even said August 1st on the sales receipt.  Two weeks go by and we heard nothing. We called American Freight and we were told that they don't have a date that the truck will show up it will just show up one day. Three weeks out we had heard nothing and we're told it would take 2 to 4 weeks. At this point we would of asked for a refund and shopped somewhere else but their policy states you can get a refund after 4 weeks from purchase.  Now four weeks arrives still no furniture still no date a truck will arrive.  We call on Monday with all intentions to ask for a refund and were told there is a truck and the Manger will be in on Thursday for us to get a refund. Thursday comes no phone call from American Freight we call on Friday and we're told oh your couch is here. Alot of effort on our part to find the status on our order. So after 4 weeks and several days of a family of 5 sitting on the floor since we just moved to Montgomery we have our couch and love seat. When we picked them up we told them we were still in the market for furniture and we were told to come back and they will give us a good deal for being so patient  well why not give us a deal while we were there. We won't be back.\nGoing back to the day we purchased the furniture the couch and love seat we wanted they actually had in the back but it was already sold to a customer who was waiting for it to be delivered some sales people were telling our sales person to just give us that one but we would not do that to someone else. So it puts into question did our furniture arrive weeks ago and they sold it to someone else it's possible especially since they could never give us a date our furniture would arrive.\nWe do like the furniture but if you shop here and they don't have it in stock BEWARE you will never know when you will get it.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1471896687656, "text": "We do apologize for the inconvenience, Wes.

When it was delivered, the delivery guy Preston had noticed they sent the wrong chairs but I had noticed the box with the table looked as if it had fallen off of the truck or dropped from a distance. After bringing in the table, they left and came back with the correct chairs. After putting together the chairs, I opened the box containing the table and it had indeed been dropped. It was well after store hours at this point but I still called the delivery guy with my issues. The next morning at 11 sharp, I got a call from the owner. Like he has obviously done before, apologized for it and said that he's send another out by the end of the day. TWO DAYS later, the table finally arrived. They opened the box to make sure that nothing is busted up and I was very pleased with the way it was handled. I was so pleased that we decided to order two more chairs from them. We were told that it took 2 weeks for the chairs to arrive. It was November 27th and we needed them before Christmas. Before they ordered the chairs, we had to pay and that wasn't an issue for us. We paid the full balance of nearly $180 for two Madrid. counter height chairs. Two weeks go by and no chairs. I was told that the truck hasn't come in but I'll definitely have them before Christmas. December 22nd, I gave them another call and I was told that I could pick them up the next day. I was overjoyed to hear that. On the 23rd I got a call from the manager telling me to not come because they wasn't there and he didn't want me to ride there for nothing. He said that he was just have them delivered when they came in. The delivery guy Preston brought to our home at 6pm that night. He told me that they were in a different box because they opened it to make sure that they sent the right chairs because of what happened the first time. Trusting his words, i signed for it then took them upstairs myself. I placed them in a closet, grabbed my things and left home until Saturday night. Christmas morning I pulled out the box, opened it and removed all of its contents. I then took the box to the dumpster. When I returned, I settled myself down to begin assembling the chairs only to find that the chairs HAD ONCE BEEN ASSEMBLED. There were marks on the chairs, the screws were stripped and rusty. and the floor protectors were very worn. There were also four screws missing as well. There were hand smudges all over the wood. There was nothing about those chairs that said NEW. In complete disbelief that Rodney the store manager for charge me full price for two chairs off the showroom floor then have me wait nearly a month to receive them made me a bit irate. Without thinking, I called the store on Christmas morning. After realizing, I messaged the delivery asking for the cell number of the manager and I've yet to receive an response. So as a result, I feel it's very necessary to be waiting in the parking lot with two unassemble Madrid counter height chairs and several questions that gonna require an answer as well as a solution. Until this, I thought very highly of American Freight and its coworkers. Now it's BUYERS BEWARE... there's a reason they say that all sales are finals. For me, I don't want my money back because I do want the chairs. I just want what I paid for and I DID NOT pay for recycled chairs", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1483030131860, "text": "We're very sorry to hear this happened to you, Sylver.

Yes thats right he never showed us anything on sale nor did he bother to ask what our spending limit was so he know what to work with. Instead he just showed us around the store that highlighted\nThe furniture with the 699 and up prices.\nWe spotted a black leather sofa that had 398 price tag on it, sat on it to try it out, and as we began to show insterest in it and began discussing to each other about maybe we should get this or not. Thats when the salesman kinda brushed us away from the actual sofa set that we were sitting on that was 398 and started reverting us back toward that 699 plus tax sofa set. Smh thats not the sofa set we wanted or was discussing.we felt that the salesman wasnt offering us what we wanted but yet offer us what he wanted us to buy.....and we are the customers...its our money not his....we felt like our wants were disreguarded so we decided to check another store, told the guy we were gonna check somewhere else also before we decide. Asked him for a bussiness card and of course he didnt want to give us one and by him doing so gave us even more reason to be absolutely sure that we dont want to shop there now.\nSo as we started to walk out the door the guy then decided to offer us a deal on a sofa set\n...A BETTER PRICE is what he said so im like oh ok he wants to work a deal on the actual leather sofa we were sitting on with the 398 price tax. So im like ok turn around and ask what are you offering...he reply...600 right now walk out..we refused and left and went somewhere else because once agin the guy was still attempting to sale us what he wanted us to buy rather than what we the customer wanted to spend our money on...", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1462553897247, "text": "Hi Byrdie, I am so sorry to hear that you had this experience.

What made it 5 star worthy was the overall experience.  We came in looking for a hybrid mattress due to all the rave reviews we had seen and heard.  Alex started us off on what I would consider mid grade mattresses.  He took us over to the TempurPedics next.  I know what you're thinking because we thought the same thing.  While the TempurPedic was nice, so was it's price tag.  I compliment Alex, he definitely did his best to try and sell us on that particular mattress.  When we would try others in the store, he wouldn't talk bad about them per say, but he also wasn't singing their praises as loud.  However, once we told him our financial situation he was a complete gentleman about it and began telling us the great things about the mattresses we were testing.  When we found the one we purchased Alex was super complimentary about it and raved about our choice.\n\nShopping for large purchases can be so stressful and overwhelming. I kind of equate mattress stores with furniture stores and car lots.  I don't like being rushed or hassled the entire time, but I do like attention when I have questions or want opinions.  If we had to do it all over again, I can guarantee you we would return to Mattress Firm and ask for Alex.  He assisted when needed, gave exceptional customer service and made the process smooth and worry free.\n\nIf you go to this location you are in good hands and won't regret it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88892218e9cd6499:0xd630aaa9cefc29a3"}

All of my furniture didn't arrive on time... I still haven't received my living room furniture nor an update on when it's expected to arrive. I finally cancelled the order and asked for a refund yesterday. When my bedroom furniture did arrive, the wrong chest was delivered. Also, Marcus claims he forgot to include my bedrails and I didn't have screws for my headboard. The delivery fee was $100, with no assembly. I had to drive back to the store for my bedrails. No considerations nor accommodations were made for me regarding my time or gas even though this order was paid in full and this was a mistake he made. As of yesterday, he still could not give me an update on the status of my living room furniture. I finally spoke with the manager who was unaware of this situation and told me that my complaint was one of many and that Marcus had been demoted.

The pricetag was certainly lower than anywhere else we looked, and it looked like OK quality furniture.\nLess than 3 weeks after purchase, the sofa literally fell apart. We're pretty normal sized people and have treated it with care. I turned it over and opened up the upholstery to have a look.  The construction quality is the worst I've ever seen; low grade partical board, half-rotted knotty 1/2\" thick pine, and the whole thing is held together with staples.  I identified 6 separate joints that had come apart inside the couch due to the staples simply slipping out of the wood, and many more that were halfway undone.\nI ended up taking around 3 or 4 hours and meticulously replacing pieces, reinforcing joints with metal brackets and screws, and closing up places in the upholstery which were mysteriously split and leaking stuffing.\n\nThe furniture here is truly of the lowest quality, even if it appears fine on the surface.  If you buy from here, make sure you also purchase their ridiculously expensive warranty (that will tack on $100 - $200 to your purchase), because you're gonna be needing it a whole lot.  If you need cheap furniture, go to the thrift store or use Facebook marketplace. If you want new furniture, spring for something more expensive.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1592838868666, "text": "Hello Adam,\n\nWe are sorry to hear you are having troubles with your purchase and would like to help as best we can.

I called 2 days before and they told me to call on Saturday when I wanted to pick up.   So I call on Saturday morning when they opened telling them  I wanted to pick up and 1pm.  They told me to call 30minutes before I came so they could spray it.    Got there and the couch they had ready for me was not even the correct couch.  On top of that it had not been sprayed with the fabric protection.  No one there really knew what was going on or who had done what with the couch.  Thankfully the couch I did buy was still there and had not been sold to anyone else.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888926e71f395913:0xac5904c3b32b67d7"}

My purchase was actually from the Trussville location, and my experience with them has been far below professional. They did not provide me with the information I needed to know for my furniture to be delivered. I paid ONE HUNDRED FREAKING DOLLARS for them to literally drop the box off at my house. That is a LOT of money for a box to be dropped off regardless of the location. So I spoke to Darnell at the Helena location who very kindly listened to me rant about this experience is resolved the matter in much less time than the Trussville location. Seriously, he's your guy. He's amazing!!! I cannot thank him enough for what he is done. While I will never go to Trussville again, should I find anything else I want from American Freight, I will most certainly do my business with the Helena location!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1563451868098, "text": "Thank you for your review.

If we didn\u2019t call the day before, they would\u2019ve done it.\n2nd...the delivery was not on time and the decided to send ya a loaner mattess but instructed us to not remove the plastic and expect us to sleep on crunching plastic for 2-3 days. NOT ACCEPTABLE! 3rd....They delivered my furniture late and it was not installed and setup properly.\n\nTheir solution was a HUGE insult!!! $99 credit!!\n\nWhen we called to discuss with manager, he kept passing comments and words through a sales rep and not wanting to come to phone to talk with an upset customer.\n\nAdditionally, we were told we should receive a call in a couple days from a manager that never occurred. After 3 days, we contacted corporate with same results. They told us that they will forward to a district manager and they will call us in a couple days.\n\nThis place is HORRIBLE!!!

I bought it on a Saturday evening and contacted them on Monday to let them know something was wrong with the chair. They would not let me return it. It was under warranty so I had them send some one out to look at it. The guy came week 2. Agreed the whole time that something was wrong with my chair but he wasn\u2019t sure how to fix it. He sent the report to Sabrina\u2019s Furniture Store week 3 and she said nothing was wrong with it. I hung up and called the manufacturer in Mississippi they said the brake for the footrest was not working. Therefore my footrest slowly goes down while sitting in it. They sent me a new motor for it. I contacted Sabrina back and she was gonna send someone out to put it on. So I\u2019ve waited all week and nobody has showed up or called. I contacted Sabrina to find out why nobody has showed up to fix it and she said the system is kicking out the maintenance order. I told her I was tired of waiting because my feet were staying swollen from not staying elevated. I also told her I would bring the chair back tomorrow and swap it out for a new one. She said they were all out of stock. So I said I would bring it back and get my money back. She agreed to it but then wanted to charge me a $200 restocking fee.

Andrew was very knowledgeable and asked questions that helped him determine which ones best suited me. He was great and not the type of guy to push you into the most expensive one on the showroom floor. After looking at several different options, he discussed the current specials they had going on. Long story short, we got to talking about us needing another mattress set and that we would be back later because we were so please. I ended up leaving the store with two mattress sets with adjustable bases for a price no other store could even touch. If you need a new set, he is the man to make a deal with.\n\nThe only negative thing I can say is that, I was a little put off by the delivery guys. The adjustable bases we tried in the store were a decent height off the ground. When they set ours up during delivery, they were extremely low to the ground. I questioned them about this and asked does the whole bed let up, because I remember them being higher off the ground. The height was so low to the ground it left a 6 inch gap between the top of the mattress and the bottom of the headboard. Their answer was no they do not make them like that and to just go buy some taller legs at a hardware store or some bed risers from walmart. After they left, low and be hold, I look in the boxes they left and what do I fine? The extensions to the legs they could have been put on when I asked about this issue. So then, I had to go next door and ask my neighbor to help me lift the frame up to attach the extenders. Glad I went ahead and did this, because I noticed they also did not put on the seventh leg at the top. The instruction book stated that this should be put on for king size beds. So now I have one bed with the extenders on correct and one that I still have to get fixed. These frames are too heavy for just one person to do by themselves. Also, I hate that they just left trash under our beds that I had to dig out. Whenever the zip ties and twist ties landed, is where they left them. They did at least take with them the plastic and boxes that the frames and mattress came in.\n\nOverall, I am pleased with our purchase just a little disappointed with the delivery service. Had the delivery gone better, I would have given 5/5 stars. I would definitely buy from them again and recommend them to everyone else. (Hopefully the quality of product lasts a long time though and I don't have too!)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0546bf165a3b:0xcb1d38730a0f650b"}

They had a good experience with the owner/manager Josh Johnson so we decided to check the store out. Our visit went great, we ordered a Stearns and Foster mattress, a couch, and a chair. $1500 including delivery. Josh told us he would be going out to Atlanta the following Thursday, February 2nd, to pick up our couch and chair and have it delivered Friday or Saturday. He'd call to set up the final details. The mattress, however, he could get to us by Monday the 30th. We set up a delivery time for 3:00. Josh stated he would call me the morning of the 30th as a reminder. Up to this point, everything was great. Until Monday the 30th rolls around, it's 3:00 and there's no reminder phone call or delivery person. I call Josh and he asks if the delivery could be changed to 5:00. OK. Fine. No problem. Five o'clock rolls around. Nothing. Six o'clock. Seven o'clock. Finally, after being stood up repeatedly, my husband (the second of the two men delivery...That we paid for) helped Josh load the California-king mattress into the house. My husband is a disabled veteran and large part off his disability is his back. It is now the 9th of February and we have not received a single phone call from Josh about our couch and chair. I've called him nine times. Once while standing in front of him yesterday. He informs me that their number has changed as of that morning. Mine hadn't. He never called me. Though it expressly states, via their own contract, that if there are any shipping or delivery set backs they will contact me immediately to let me know. So, on Monday, February 6th my husband goes to the store to inquire as to what is going on. Josh tells my husband that they're having some delivery issues but we'll definitely have our furniture by Friday. He'd be giving us a call to set up a time. However, by Wednesday afternoon still no call. So, I went to the store Wednesday afternoon and Mr. Johnson tells me that we 'should' have our furniture by Tuesday. When I asked him why he hadn't kept me informed he said he was busy keeping up with his other customers and if he neglected to call he was sorry. I asked him why he hadn't returned my calls when the number has only recently changed. Surely he got them. No. He says he never got a single one of the many phone calls I made. Then I ask him if he has my number. He says he wrote it down wrong. That's funny, because he knew it when he was talking to my husband, and it's clearly written in our contract/receipt. Oh. And he tells me they're getting out of the furniture business. Be WARY, folks. Be VERY wary. All I'm asking for is common courtesy. Keep me in the loop. I'm not unreasonable. At this point, however, if I do not receive my furniture by this Tuesday I will proceed to take civil action through litigation if I am not given a full refund of the cost of the delivery fees, couch, and chair that I have paid.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88f333433646516b:0x4d6a49b20bf770f4"}

Some place else\u2019s furniture will be made better and I bet their customers service is so much better also.\n\nThey have deleted my other review about things being fixed from previously. The manager at the time did fix the problem. But I made a stupid mistake by buying something else that was more exspensive thinking it would be better, now they don\u2019t want to fix that again a few months back. On top of that I completely forgot to come in and make November\u2019s payments (normally someone would call me between the 1st and 10th just to remind me)(I\u2019m a mother of two and full time college student so I\u2019m forgetful when I don\u2019t get reminders) they called me last week while I was sitting in class so I asked them to call me back in a couple of hours to discuss why they had called. Didn\u2019t think nothing of it. Well today I got a letter in the mail saying I was avoiding them and refusing their calls (which I have not I answer every phone calll that comes in because I never know if something might have happened to someone) then the \u201cnew manager\u201d tried to say she delivered this letter to my house today. This letter has a stamp on it has been through the post office lines and was in my mailbox at the bottom of the box(I haven\u2019t checked my mail in three days so it was full) but she proceeds to tell me that my account which as of today is 30days late it wasn\u2019t 30days late when she sent this letter to me. That she would be sending it to the court house this week. And that she would not work with me because I\u2019m 30days late as of today. That this was policy after 30 days. I worked at this store in 2017 for a while and they normally don\u2019t send to collection until 120 days or later. She also tried to tell me they have been calling I have not received but that one call from them a little over a week ago when I asked them to call me back and they never did then my grandmother received a call from them last night and she told me today when she seen me. So hearing this plus receiving this letter today I did call them only to be told she wouldn\u2019t work with me. I also know that when I worked there and I would help the collector there to make calls you can just click in the computer saying that you called when really you didn\u2019t. I told her I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay her right now Christmas is a few weeks away my sons birthday is also the week of Christmas and my car payment is due this week so I offered to pay November and December\u2019s payment on December 28th the Friday right after the holidays she then told me I would have to pay court cost and do it that way because my account wouldn\u2019t be there any longer.\n\nI have been dealing with farmers for a couple of years now and I always pay my accounts off wayyy earlier than need to be.\nThis is also the first time I have ever been more than two days late on making a payment. I understand they want their money, but sometimes things don\u2019t work out like that so they should really work with someone who has never been late like that. When I was employed there you still got worked with at 120 days out.

I went to the local store and met with a very nice gentleman named David Paffumi.  Mr. Paffumi handled the exchange and scheduled a pick-up of the damaged mattress and set a delivery date for the exchange.  The manufacturer (company headquarters/people in charge) still need to place more importance on Customer Service.  I really appreciated the concern that Mr. Paffumi demonstrated in helping us get this matter resolved.  The management of Mattress Firm would do well to take some lessons on Customer Service from Mr. Paffumi.  My original rated of one (1) star has been changed to three (3) stars.

A little more than $2,000.00 worth of products.\n\nThe mattress started bleeding through the cover with some sort of dye.

Spoken down to and rudely by manager after what she thought was the final sale. Appalled and shamed, I felt like an old fool after my 3rd attempt to talk to Brittany who went from so agreeably accommodating to abrupt, in to much of a hurry to be bothered with me unless \"I could keep my question VERY BRIEF as she was busy with the Labor day sale\".  Phoned a few weeks later to add a queen mattress but was met with the same behavior before I was able to ask about adding a queen. Very ill I rarely leave home, I began to cry and said  I'd call another time about  adding to my purchases when she wasn't so busy. Told her my feelings were hurt and I felt chastised like a child. She did try to call me back 2 x's once I mentioned spending more $.  Having been treated so unkindly, decided to blocked the number. In all fairness, she was exemplary during the 1st purchase and I wrote a 5 star rating for my experience. She seemed upset at how lengthy and detailed it was but I only tried to cover all the horrible things she said she'd suffered from another customer who frightened and wrote badly about her. She was so upset about it that my adult mentally disabled daughter worried, prayed and asked me to check on her safety several times after our visit/purchase. I'm sorry if I embarrassed her. She was very direct about my lengthy rating stating she didn't have time to read it when I asked if I covered everything she asked me to. Confused and ashamed I will not go back to that store.

Spoken down to and rudely by manager after what she thought was the final sale. Appalled and shamed, I felt like an old fool after my 3rd attempt to talk to Brittany who went from so agreeably accommodating to abrupt, in to much of a hurry to be bothered with me unless \"I could keep my question VERY BRIEF as she was busy with the Labor day sale\".  Phoned a few weeks later to add a queen mattress but was met with the same behavior before I was able to ask about adding a queen. Very ill I rarely leave home, I began to cry and said  I'd call another time about  adding to my purchases when she wasn't so busy. Told her my feelings were hurt and I felt chastised like a child. She did try to call me back 2 x's once I mentioned spending more $.  Having been treated so unkindly, decided to blocked the number. In all fairness, she was exemplary during the 1st purchase and I wrote a 5 star rating for my experience. She seemed upset at how lengthy and detailed it was but I only tried to cover all the horrible things she said she'd suffered from another customer who frightened and wrote badly about her. She was so upset about it that my adult mentally disabled daughter worried, prayed and asked me to check on her safety several times after our visit/purchase. I'm sorry if I embarrassed her. She was very direct about my lengthy rating stating she didn't have time to read it when I asked if I covered everything she asked me to. Confused and ashamed I will not go back to that store. To EVERYONE reading this: you never know when you'll be old, sick, unable to look and feel good due to illness.

She had the door locked during normal business hours, open sign was on and all the lights were on in the store. After myself and three other customers kept knocking on the doors and windows and she would not come to the door, we became concerned for her safety. We all called the store repeatedly and no one would answer. We finally called another store to see if they could get in touch with her and she would not answer for them either. That store manager finally called their district manager who called the store and she finally answered. About 10 minutes later she finally came out of the back room appearing like she had just woken up. She immediately opened the door with an attitude and stated \"someone is trying to get me in trouble calling my district manager, I was here by myself and in the back room\". We attempted to tell her given the area and the fact that all the lights were on, open sign was on and that we noticed a car parked there that we were concerned for her safety. She continued with the attitude. I told her that there were 3 other customers there who had left and she replied \"well that's their problem, they can go somewhere else\". We told her 5 times what we were looking for and she repeatedly asked what we needed. We finally left, only to be chased out the door by her stating \"ya'll see I was here....my car is parked right there. There was no reason to call my boss and tell him I wasn't here\".  I again told her that we were just concerned for her safety and she continued to run her mouth at us outside the store. Well, to me if you were there then you should have had the door unlocked and certainly shouldn't have had the attitude you did with me about the other customers leaving. I personally would appreciate someone being concerned about my safety if I did not come to the door after repeated calls and knocks on the doors and windows when we clearly read that the store was supposed to be open. I  did get a call back from the District Manager, Bruce, who was very nice, and thanked us for being concerned about her safety even when she was not appreciative of that to us. I took my money elsewhere. I see other people have good reviews about the store, and maybe this was just a fluke, but it was a very odd situation to say the least.  I was also told by the District Manager that she has caller ID in the store, and that is likely why she answered his call and not anyone else's. I am only giving one star for the fact that the District Manager called me back and was very professional, apologetic and appreciative of my concerns.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a3ec7efea06c3:0x11e4dd951231ecfa"}

During the sale the salesman said many time if we find a better price else ware, let them know and they will refund the difference.  I went home, went on the MattressFirm web site and realized I paid over $70 more than the web purchase.  The salesman said he would refund the difference (which they did 3 weeks later).  I then went to a local competitor and found the same mattresses for over $300 cheaper.  I went back to the salesman and he told me they were not the same mattresses.  He said the memory gel was \"better\" on his model.  A little background here, Serta make mattresses and different retailers put different names on the SAME mattress.  This is the case here.  MattressFirm named the Serta Mattress \"Kozma\" where other places named it \"Kellerman\".  It is the SAME Mattress.  I even called Serta Corporate and they confirmed.  I commented to the salesman that it would be more advantages for me to give MattressFirm the $79 to come and get their mattresses and then purchase them at the other retailer.  The sales guy called me \"an extortionist\" and I politely said it was about getting the best price on the SAME mattress.  Once I mentioned (in email traffic) that I would be contacting Serta Corporate to see if the were the SAME Mattress, the salesman said they would refund me $300 more on the sale (which they did 3 weeks later).  Here is what MattressFirm WON'T tell you.  They will only match ADVERTISED  prices of their competitors.  They will not honor quotes.  The ONLY advantage to purchasing a mattress from MattressFirm is that you can give them $79 to come and get the mattress if you absolutely hate it.  Here is my advice.  DO YOUR HOME WORK.  Compare the specs of the mattress you want and then shop around.  On a good note (hence the 2 Stars), we LOVE the mattress.

It was really amazing to watch the screen above your head. You see your pressure points in real time and can see literally see your optimum sleep number. If your considering a new mattress don\u2019t let the prices scare you away from Atleast experiencing it first hand.
