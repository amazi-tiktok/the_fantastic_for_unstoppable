My sub wasn\u2019t made right in front of me like literally every other sub sandwich place. They got it served through the window then I got asked \u201cwhat you want?\u201d And they peel open your sandwich to add ingredients.\n\nThe food, albeit edible for a hungry shift worker, was pretty sad. All I wanted was a normal BLT sub sandwich with mayo, and some chips. Instead, I got served this weird but sad triple-decker pressed Texas toast BLT. I didn\u2019t mind the non traditional approach, but the execution was bad. The Texas toast was smashed so thin I had this dense layer of mayonaise soaked bread to peel off my teeth. The bacon was cooked well but the lack of lettuce, tomato, and a normal sub bun kinda ruined it.\n\nAt least it was cheap, around $7.50, so at least it wasn\u2019t an expensive mistake.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88929213968b8e9f:0x74dd735e10f9a6d"}

So I went back to the restaurant and explained what was going on to the sweet older woman at the register. She had the cooks remake my burger again. I got back out to the car only to discover that the cook screwed up by burger yet again!!! This time by giving me a completely different burger than what I ordered. I did not take it back a third time bc I was dealing with a cranky toddler and was just beyond frustrated with the cooks. They need to get better cooks or properly train their cooks.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1601877596218, "text": "We are sorry that you did not enjoy your experience and would like the opportunity to address your concerns!

I never leave negative google reviews but at this point I feel obligated to. On my first 2 visits to this cookout they manage to completely mess up both of my orders. On my 3rd visit I sat in the outside lane waiting to order but no one answered me through the speaker. I then pulled up to the window and asked if the outside lane speaker works and the employee told me no it did not. I asked why was there no sign on the speaker indicating this or why was the lane not blocked off. At this point there was already a line of cars waiting behind me attempting to order in the outside Lane. The worker then had the audacity to ask me if I would personally go tell the other cars waiting behind me that they would have to pull into the inside lane if they wanted to order. After all of that they did not let me place an order at the window and then told me I would have to drive around and get back in the one functioning lane. I promptly said no thank you and left. Honestly, if I could give this place negative 5 stars I would.

It took around  8 minutes from the start  of the line until we got the food but wait was mainly due to people reading there very big menu and not due to waiting on food.\n\nI did love the choices of options. I would recommend you view their menu online and decide what you want before you get there because you could become overwhelmed by choices if you see it for the first time.\n\nWe spent around 7 dollars each.  I got a drink, burger and dog. The other order was a chicken sandwich, slaw, onion rings and drink. The chicken patty was small and flat compared to other fast food. The slaw was in a small sauce cup and she only received three breaded onion rings. She said the taste was good but the potions small. My burger & dog were ballpark field quality in a good way. The taste was great and they were the perfect size. I also loved being able to customize what I wanted on both.\n\nI saw they had a walk up window for orders as well in case you didn't want to wait in the drive thru line.
