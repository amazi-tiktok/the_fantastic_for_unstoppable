The response was \"we don't do miracles.\" Mom had TWO UTIs while there. The second time we came close to the room on Sunday to a foul smell.  I checked to see if she was wet. She was wet and the pad beneath her was wet as well. They sent a culture of urine to be tested on Monday; the result was that she had a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI). By Wednesday they were awaiting prescription orders for her treatment.  My mother in law was transferred from there to another facility the next Tuesday. The UTI was still not treated. The facility where we had her transferred handled the UTI immediately. Dementia gets worse when there is an infection or UTI. She's Diabetic: they told me that they don't have a diabetic diet there to give patients. Well, I asked them not to give her sugar, caffeine, and pork. Her sugar was as high as 300+. When she was home, 118 was the highest unless she cheated then 220. She never took insulin shots; she got them there because they sent it up high with the bad diet, then gave insulin to bring it back down. Diabetic patients are groggy or sleepy when their glucose is up. According to them, she doesn't respond to commands. DUH if her glucose is high and she has a UTI, what the heck do they expect?

No husband of 66 years holding her hand.  No children or grandchildren at her bedside.  We were in the parking lot being\ncondescended to.  We were being offered a \u201cglance through a window\u201d moments before being told, in a parking lot, that she was gone.  If the roles had been reversed and any human being had tried to stop my Mother from being at the side of her loved ones as The final breath were drawn: No Earthbound force could  have stopped the Power of Love that coursed through that remarkable woman.  She would have been at my side.  I am a weaker soul than she.  I tried diplomacy.  My cries fell on ears so consumed with ego and a sense of power that the only meaningful response from the tyrant who dared only speak with me via speakerphone was  \u201c...that\u2019s how we\u2019re doing it.  That\u2019s off our best judgement.\u201d\nI posted a video on social media prior to Mother\u2019s passing, after the phone conversation, asking for support from friends and others in the community.  The calls that they place were met with hostility, rudeness, and empty promises of \u201cthe administrator will get back in touch with you\u201d.  As those phone calls were coming in and my sister was being told of Momma\u2019s passing, I was receiving cold, disdainful stares by the only staff member who could even bring herself to look in my direction.\nThere is no way this injustice can be reversed.  This beautiful creature whose pastor said in his eulogy \u201c... was a beautiful soul.  It was my privilege to be her pastor and to be her friend.  I'm not sure that I've ever known anyone who had so much love, so concentrated, deep within her being.  Every interaction I've ever had with Carolyn was permeated with love.\u201d This giant of a giver.  This Child if God.  My Mother.  I cannot change the final moments of her life.  I can, however, see that her story is told.  I can see that these individuals who slither through this life generating pain and sorrow need not be concerned if they are alone.  I couldn\u2019t be there for Momma on that day but with God as my witness, until I draw my last breath, I will live as a reminder to those who tried to diminish her that She lives in me.

The simple fact that the Covid in this facility is being spread by the staff is the only explanation.  The place has been locked down and no visitors could possibly get in.

The folks in the rehab department seemed earnest in their effort and my mother actually thought they were very nice. The doctor/nursing aspect is a totally different matter that seems to operate on providing the minimal care and effort.  If you have a loved one at this facility, you need to pay attention to the needs of your family member.  When I noticed fungal growth on my mother's hand, I called it out.  The nurse told me that the doctor determined it to be a callous. They then promised they would apply fungal cream. I left on business for two weeks and when I returned, her entire hand was covered is what appeared as crusted skin and had spread to her other hand and face.  Only after I raised it to their attention did they start to address the situation. I mean no one seems to have noticed it before this?   It turned out to be scabies which means that she required isolation and likely infected other in the facility.\n\nThere were a few other matters such as trash on the floor of her room, the fact they couldn't hang up her clothes, and that when they put her on an air mattress, they shoved the other mattress into the bathroom preventing any access to the bathroom.\n\nA few days later, she fell out of bed. Supposedly she slid off of the air mattress.   They sent her to the emergency room for precaution.  Although she sustained no injuries, the hospital kept my mother as she had a bacterial infection causing her white blood count to be extremely high.\n\nThe management staff was nice, and the rehab people seemed genuinely engaged.  Some of the nursing staff were conscientious but to ignore a situation that was clearly out of control and in need of medical attention is inexcusable.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862133a7685b99d:0x29b04ab624a44d28"}

From day one I have been impressed and amazed at the level of care she has received.  Mary is 90 years old and in very good health.  Up until her fall, on November 7, 2013, she and her 93 year old husband had been living in their home with the help of a care giver who was with them during the day. ( 8 a.m. - 4 p.m. )  On the evening of Nov. 7th Mary fell and broke her pelvis.  Her GP doctor put her on pain meds and sent her home.  We arranged for 24/7 care for her at home, but within a week after her fall she became listless and stopped eating, sleeping and dehydration was setting in.  An ambulance ride to Crestwood Hospital ER was arranged & she was admitted for 3 days/nights of intensive care to bring her pain under control & getting her back to eating and sleeping normally again.  The admitting Dr. recommended The Kindred Transitional Care & Rehabilitation Center quite highly.\n\nFrom the first moment I walked into Whitesburg Gardens until this evening, two weeks later, I have felt completely at peace with our decision to have Mary under the care of the caring folks at this rehabilitation facility.  The atmosphere is so positive, and the entire staff works together as a team so completely, that any worry I might have had when Mary was placed in this rehab center has completely vanished.  I've observed a delightful group of caring people who are truly committed to the rehabilitation & attaining the goal of giving their patients their lives back, no matter what age or disability they have upon their admittance to the facility.\n\nDuring the course of these past two weeks at Whitesburg Gardens, I have had an education in true compassion, a deliciously keen sense of humor expressed by the majority of the staff and a depth of dignity shown to the men and women who are going through a positive rehabilitation while on their journey back to living the lives they want to live.\n\nKudos all around!\n\nI wish to express my sincere thanks to everyone who works at Whitesburg Gardens.\n\nLynn Sanders", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862133a7685b99d:0x29b04ab624a44d28"}

I wish I could give some type of notice to close down this facility and relocate the residents that are stuck there... to some this is as close to a death sentence as possible. The best recommendation I can give anyone is to not consider this facility to provide the care for a loved one. Moving my mother to another facility was the best thing we could do for her. Diversicare of Riverchase left much to be desired. The lack of compassion and the poor communication are two of the things they should be known for. Their admin leads most of the group that treat you in a very disrespectful and unprofessional manner. If you disagree with what she has to say she will quickly threaten to write up a 30 day discharge notice for your loved one. They recently upgraded their phone system which gives you false hope of being able to get someone on the phone and have your issues resolved. Most people do not return your calls unless you have to escalate your concern by emailing or calling the number on the website. I will say that there are a couple of staff members that did assist my family, and those ladies are Vicky and Lauren. If you send your loved one here please do not send any belongings that you would not want lost or given to another resident. My mother was sent to Diversicare from a short term facility with notes from her husband (who suddenly passed away while she was in rehab). A staff member hung one of the notes on her wall and at some point it was lost and never located. In addition to a note that they placed on her wall being lost, a note inside of my mothers glasses case was lost, a cell phone was lost twice, phone chargers were lost, numerous pieces of her laundry were lost, a hard back photo book with her name and photo on the cover was lost. We were offered a reimbursement on a cell phone and book but no one ever got back with us to issue reimbursement. The most important thing they lost was MY MOTHER - she was supposed to go to the ER and I called to see which one she went to. The two staff members who had me on speaker phone were disagreeing with one another about if she was sent out or not. One finally said \"I know she went out but I can't tell you where\". 32 minutes later I had to call them back to see if they found where she was. 7 minutes of being hold I was told that she either never was sent out or already returned. No one could clearly tell me what the true story was. For an hour or more they were not even aware that she was in their facility! At one point a photo blanket of my mother with her family was lost and then found and kept in the admins office for weeks. Upon picking up some of our mothers belongings we found dirty laundry with another woman's name in it in a bag with trash, some purses and wallets that were not our mother's, etc. As our mother made it to the new facility we found that the new clothing items we took to her a couple of months prior were not sent with her. We saw our mother at doctor appointments and through zoom calls and she was wearing clothes that were not hers. I would do your loved one a favor and find any other place other than this one to send them to. REMEMBER YOU ARE THE ADVOCATE FOR YOUR LOVED ONE AND YOUR VOICE IS STRONGER THAN SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THESE CARE FACILITIES. This is only a highlight of the ridiculous things my mother and family endured from late June 2020 through late February 2021.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88892267c3d3aa39:0xaee638499242526b"}

So I called the transfer NEW facility and admissions said \u201cwe will take care of this for you and we will get you the lowest price possible, we will try to make this transition smooth\u201d. About 15 Min later I was set with transportation.\n4. They are always short staff, once my mother had a very bad case of heart burn. She pushed her button for help, a hour later mom called me and I called the nurses  desk. The supervisor came, took her BP, said she will be back with some tums. An hour later Mom pushed the button. No one came. She called me, I called the desk, the new shift nurse said the supervisor WENT HOME! So I got dress and went to the store and drove from the South side to Gardendale to take mom some heartburn meds.\n\nWhen you enter Magnolia Ridge the smell of OLD urine and bowels will meet you at the door and it lingers in the hallways. Whenever I leave the building that smell is stuck to my clothes.\n\nIf you put your love ones in this facility \u201cYOU BETTA CHECK ON THEM DAILY\u201d", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889043c16246da9:0x49264155c51aeb0"}

They can very easily rectify matters, but so far they refuse to do so. It has to do with the beauty salon.\nIf you\u2019re loved one wishes to get their hair done they may make use of the in-house salon. There is a form that the person responsible to pay the salon charges fills out. You may leave a credit card on file and you may opt to just have your card used whenever the resident wishes or be asked if you\u2019re in agreement with your family member having their hair done before being charged. This is so that a family member who is losing their mental acuity doesn\u2019t decide to go get their hair done too often, which was our situation, and we stipulated on the form that we\u2019d like to be contacted first.\nHowever, our card was charged several times with no permission request beforehand. To the tune of approximately $500.00. With our busy life we didn\u2019t catch these charges as they were incurred. Once we did see them, we called and got them stopped.  To their credit, The Blake admitted they were in the wrong. However, it has been over a year of requesting the fraudulent charges be reversed or having a check sent to us. We\u2019ve been in touch with the beauty salon, patient representatives, the facility manager and a regional manager. We\u2019ve allowed each person along the way ample time to make it right, sometimes two months before we call again, but no resolution is ever forthcoming. Now, they\u2019ve stopped taking our calls.\nWe will now pursue this with our credit card company.\nOur family member passed away in May of 2020, so they are no longer a resident. I would hate to think that is the reason we now are not even getting our phone calls answered.\nIf you\u2019re wondering why our family member passed away, it was due to the virus. We were told she was the only one in the whole facility to contract it. A subsequent email from The Blake that was emailed to families of the residents claimed to have zero cases of the virus at The Blake.\nI suppose no place can be 100% above board at all times, but these things concern us.\nPlease don\u2019t misunderstand us. We realize the virus is strange and can effect some and not others. We have no ill feelings in that regard. These things happen.
