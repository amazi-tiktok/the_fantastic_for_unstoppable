I live a couple of hours away from Piedmont, as does my relative.\nA Google search turned up this range, but I had a difficult time finding anything else about it, even if it was operational. There was one review, and a Dec 2019 facebook reference to a new ball dispensing machine. I tried calling the city and left voice messages, but no one called back.\nI visited yesterday and found that it is maintained by Piedmont Parks and Recreation (or whatever they call themselves). It is located off highway 21 in the sports complex, adjacent to the swimming pool. For this size town, I felt like the range is very nice and a good place for general swing practice.\n\nThe good about the place:\nNice open area with good parking\nHitting area is level with reasonably good mats\nFairly new ball dispensing machine\nRange extends for 250 yards\nCost is $2 for 25 balls, which are in good shape!\n\nAreas for improvement:\nNo bathroom facilities\nRange is an undulating up-hill (some prefer flat)\nDispensing machine requires dollar bills (go prepared)\nNo close targets (chipping!)\nNo putting area\n\nI am surprised that no one at the city has \u201cclaimed\u201d this location on Google maps. It would also help attendance to get this location added to the golf resources web sites for Alabama.\n\nI enjoyed my visit until my dollar bills were exhausted ($12 worth). The up-hill angle of the range encouraged me to get under the ball. Probably helped my practice!\n\nWhile it may not be perfect, I appreciate the City of Piedmont for their efforts to construct and maintain this facility!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdsQ7evcJHamRpHSYes7McM-n2925lz55PeE6b=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZJUMA8F0koQ3YWci_OVbJMfGKBCgEHR4rwn1L=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9V38M7EZ_qhq-tS5b2w8uNFFkBqiXko7H8538=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmpWgm_8gRneSYUs6SJriiaH25Spq2euSsuF7Y=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a59b22559ac1d:0xa26aa276edc2aa2d"}

I went out to the course and spoke to the gentlemen about the incident.  They were delayed only 5 minutes from their tee time.  My worker could have had a cooler head dealing with customers, but an apology was made and the men appeared to be happy that I looked into the situation. I offered to buy them a round of beers as a friendly gesture.   I am more than willing to accept a one star review than cower to a person trying to extort money in lieu of a bad review.
