I used to be a regular plasma donor at CSL a few years ago but haven't had time until recently.  I'm on a break between semesters so I thought I'd make a donation (you know, towards those life saving therapies) and make a little money.\n\nI gathered all of the required documents, per Ked's website, and arrived at their donation center early.  First impression- rough.  People loitering outside shouting at passersby or donors as they enter.  The parking lot and building are disgustingly unkempt with litter and trash strewn about.\n\nI approached the new donor side and met a joyless, rude employee who very obviously didn't want to process a new donor.  She rattled off a list of documents hoping I was missing an item so she wouldn't have to do her job.  \"License?\"  Check.  \"Social Security card?\"  Check.  \"Utility bill?\"  Two of them, check.\n\n\"Something else with your social on it?\" Nope, you got me.  All I have is the document the Federal government issued to me that is accepted EVERYWHERE.  \"W-2?\"  Nope, I'm a graduate student.\n\nApparently the list of documents that Ked says is acceptable isn't acceptable if the bouncer at the front desk doesn't want to do her job.  I could drive home, print tax documents (like my 1098-T) and return... but I'm sure she'd find another reason not to do her job.\n\nSo I'm going to go donate whole blood to LifeSouth.  I'd rather give my blood away for free, knowing that it goes toward a good cause, and be treated with dignity than ever return to Ked again.  And if any other students (or anyone for that matter) ask about donating plasma I'll point them to Biomat.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a52b58886a5c7:0x15f6a7f4b85bbcaf"}

After having it tested by the Dr. Only to find out it wasnt high at all which tells me that they could possibly be giving out bad test results to others either by faulty equipment or on purpose.

I say what's that meaning, as in do I need to drink more water, eat iron or what? She rudly says that means you can't donate. I leave feeling like I was lied to in order for the staff to get off work on time, but I still come back today.

They agree but not before allowing the other screener to approach me like she wanted to fight and says \" you gotta problem\". Very unprofessional I thought. I get the new screener which is a Caucasian girl with glasses, I can tell she was young because she was very defensive about the other screeners behavior as if the way I felt didn't matter. Not once was she understanding of what I was saying.

I ask what did I say that made you feel disrespected? she continues to say I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. I ask to speak to the person above her and she quickly says he's in a interview call back later. These employees need a class on customer/donor service.

I was suckered into donating plasma supposedly to help people live so I came when they opened at 8a.m. Since I was a new donor to THIS company the website informed me it would take about 2.5 hours for the full process and to be patient. I am patient. What I am NOT cool with is seeing exactly how many people work here and how little is actually getting done. It is now 11a.m. and I have just made it to a donating chair surrounded by women taking about holiday plans and shopping trips. HELLO some of us would like to not be here for closing! I was told I can't leave so now my stomach is growing because I've been being patient since 8 am. Honestly I used to donate a lot but it became more of a burden on recent years than helpful to me so I haven't come back in years. They're going to pay me $50 today for plasma they can't use because I will NOT be back.\n\n*** UPDATE *** It is now May and I was contacted by a member of management concerning my bad experience almost 6 months ago. I wasn't actually able to donate because the untrained phlebotomist Jasmine had punctured my vein and blood was everywhere so the got me off the table and out the door with 50 bucks not telling me ANYTHING about how to care for my carved up arm. When I got home I took the bandage off and it was purplish. I iced it thought I would be fine, no it bruised enough to cover the entire inside of my arm and elbow. I went back to show them they thought I was trying to donate and turned me away so I washed my hands of it. 6 months later in may NEW management with the SAME staff calls me to tell me they will pay me the new donor fee of 50 plus the 70 I WOULD'VE made had Jasmine not messed up my arm. So I go back. Jasmine is still there and the new mngmnt lied to get me there. I was one week out side being a new donor, so I only got 20 plus 70 but no prob right I just won't let Jasmine anywhere near me. (She tried to help but I was like NO she devil stay FAR away!) So I got a different sticker and she did fine but tried a new vein I had never used before but it seemed fine till it was time to put blood back then my whole arm started hurting. I made it up in my mind then no matter how much she calls or sends letters I'm NEVER going back. Then I get home and take the bandage off 5 hours later and a golf ball sized lump is under my skin. I panicked and called them back they said ice it and it should be fine. That was a week ago and I STILL have no strength in my arm. NOW my arm has bruised outrageously AGAIN. The messed up part though is the FACT that it's summer time so I'm having to wear sleeves to hide THEIR mistakes. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't go to these butchers! I know sometimes life gets hard but your LIFE is worth so much more than a punk a$$ 20 dollars.

Our first overall experience was very pleasant as far as the actual donating of his plasma. Unfortunately the customer service we received was UNACCEPTABLE but we were grateful for the compensation. We also respected the possibility of knowing we could actually safe a life. On our second visit (which was within the same week) my husband was informed that our address was not accepted and he would have to provide mail from a different address in order to donate presently and in the future. We returned to the location 3 different times with mail from his mother's address whom he had resided at and currently still does from time to time when we are in a bind. All the mail was unacceptable. At this point I intervened into the situation asking to speak to a Manager whom I felt would give us a more detailed explanation of  information required of us.  This is where my whole experience turned negative plus. An African American customer service rep with long black braids name Yvette (I believe) was standing at the counter with a young gentleman representative when we approached to ask for a Manager. The young gentleman politely informed me he would get someone to assist me. He exited the area to wards Tha back (I'm thinking) to go get a Manager. The representative Yvette stayed at the counter inputting keystrokes into the computer terminal she was standing in front of. I proceeded to discuss with my husband that he should always ask for a Manager if he is not understanding what is being requested of him. While I'm talking I look over toward the back waiting for a Manager and I see Yvette totally engaged in our conversation as she was looking directly at us. I involved her into the conversation for her input b/c she is an employee at this center. I asked her if she understood what we were asking of them. She rudely responded \"No I don't, but I hear you talking.\" I told her okay nevermind & thank u. She replied. \"I know that's real.\" Then proceeded to grab paperwork off the counter and walk away laughing. I responded with a mimick of her laugh. Three minutes later she returned calling my husband's name requesting him to meet her in one of the consultation rooms. I could hear their entire conversation from the waiting area. She, Yvette (the same representative whom earlier had no input nor help on our situation, informed him he needed a post office marked letter or an unopened piece of mail addressed to him from a different address. We left went and got another piece of mail for the fourth time. We returned an hour later to find out that unopened mail without a post mark was unacceptable. At this point my husband was given a blank envelope and told to mail himself a piece of mail to the address and this would be acceptable. In my hesitation we agreed to do so. We got the mail the next day and returned to the center. He was informed that they also needed a utility bill in his name from his Mom's address. We left and decided that was enough for us. We will never recommend this particular location to anyone. The rep Yvette is rude discourteous and unprofessional and we will not tolerate this type of behavior in any business endeavor we participate in. FIND ANOTHER LOCATION, IN THE END YOU WILL APPRECIATE ME.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bbfe824dcdd:0xa2d02235b2cc2f66"}

I am employed and i often have to work til 6pm and it is tough to make it to the center before 6:30. Well Today i made it at exactly 6:30 and the doors were already locked so i walked around to the side door that the donors exit from and tried to speak with one of the managers i had spoken with before in the exact circumstances and he allowed me to donate..... Well in this case today, which is December 15th, i spoke with another gentlman named ELI  and he denied me permission to donate as well as said he was deferring me for my actions. I explained to him  i have a daughter who is 5 years old and i need the $ from my donation for her Christmas i have on layaway. He kept asking my name so he could defer me. I apologized for the way i walked in through the back exit door and explained  That i was just in very much in need of the $. When it comes to my lil girl i do not give up and i will do anything and everything for her. I was never rude but i did not give him my name. I showed him i had $80 in my wallet and let him know i was not one of the drug addicts and desperate for money for dope, but that i was a working father who is doing what he can and would love to see his dauggter happy and excited on Christmas. Though Eli never quit or even thought about changing his mind after i explained what that little but of change they give us for donating meant alot to me. And i apologized sincerely numerous of times. Well as i walked out he said to me. You cant donate today and ill see u again and when i do u will b deferred. It furiated me to the point i dont like. He purposely and willingly stood between me and my lil girls happiness. I find that Eli (the manager) is very unprofessional and is fully taking advantage of his authority.

Come to find out after I moved to the state of Washington, I had to get a transfer from the midfield location. Even though I had not donated or gone through screening. So. They lied. Be careful if you go here, you could end up permanently deferred because an employee can do it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888e1dcc69bb5ef:0xdfbe15e426032af8"}
