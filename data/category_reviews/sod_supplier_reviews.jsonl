There are two separate businesses in Green Valley: the market and flowers and the landscaping.  You can judge the flowers for yourself and should get a good quality product.  I would recommend Porters just across the river for a much larger selection.\nNow the BEWARE.  I hired Ken Irby to do my landscaping.  His crew did a good job.  As soon as the job was done and the sod laid I was very satisfied.  THEN IT RAINED.  I took pictures of the washed-out sod to the business and showed it to one of the landscapers.  He immediately said they did not put pins in the sod so it washed away.  I then went into the office and showed MR. IRBY.  He said he could fix it for over $1000.\nI stated that since it was his workers' error it should not be that much.  He and I agreed to $800 to fix.  I know.  Why should I have to pay anything? As of today, November 4, 2020, I have not gotten responses from e-mails or calls.  I still have a mess and have waited too late to resod because MR. IRBY did not keep his word.

He (Green Valley Nursery & Landscape) never showed up that day. I questioned him, & he acted like he was doing me a favor by fitting me into his busy schedule. Told me he\u2019d send a bobcat over to finish the job right then... I asked if the gravel was even at the job site, & he replied, \u201cI have no idea! Guess I better check.\u201d Wow! If that doesn\u2019t tell you how unprofessional they are, I don\u2019t know what does? Said he might be able to get the job done on Tuesday. I finally had him nail down a time for Friday, because I like a guaranteed job when I am paying for it. I felt like I had to babysit them to make sure the job would actually get done. Finally, the driveway was installed by people who are supposedly professionals. They literally just dropped off gravel & spread it out a bit. I\u2019m not a professional landscaper, but all the research we found said that the gravel needed to be plate compacted through the process. He said they don\u2019t do that, & he never promised me that. I only expected him to professionally & properly install a driveway... sorry, that\u2019s what I thought they were. Professionals. Nope. He refused to fix the job, even though I was promised I wouldn\u2019t have to pay until I was happy, & he would make it right. He told me he wanted to wash his hands of me, & wished I\u2019d never bothered him. The gravel in this driveway is so loose that the first rain will wash it all out, it\u2019s uneven, has a poorly graded slope that makes it hard to enter the drive without scraping the bottom of your car, & my husband couldn\u2019t fit his Jeep in the carport anymore because there was so much gravel under it. They refused to fix it at the present cost, & said they would plate compact it for another $500. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll bill you, don\u2019t pay it, & I\u2019ll send you to collections. We\u2019ll let the law handle it.\u201d Unbelievable & awful experience. My husband & I could\u2019ve done this job properly for as little as $700, but we decided to hire \u201cpros\u201d instead, & now, we are out $950, & it\u2019s not even done right... meaning more expenses for us now.
