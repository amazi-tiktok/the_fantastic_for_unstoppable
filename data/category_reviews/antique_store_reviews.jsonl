When arriving the owner approached us and apologized for it being disorderly. Another nice gentleman approached us and informed us of all the areas available to be seen. While speaking to both men we informed him of the interest we had in the reclaimed lumber and that we custom make them ourselves back home. He gave us pricing on what he had and told us to check out the shop area and to let him know if we needed help with any lumber. We also refinish furniture for a living and are on the look out for good fixer uppers to refinish and resell. So we walked around the top and bottom floor. They had nothing of good quality to choose from. We then made our way out to the \"OPEN TO THE PUBLIC COME ON IN\" shop area. The craftsmanship done by his employees was great and we were simply admiring the work done. NO PHONE, NO CAMERA simply looking and out of no where the owner comes up to my husband and tells him \"IF YOU ARENT HERE TO BUY YOU NEED TO LEAVE\" \"WE BUILD CUSTOM TABLES FOR CLIENTS\" \"WE ARE A CHRISTIAN BASED COMPANY AND WE DONT NEED ANYONE STEALING OUR DESIGNS\" Now if I was taking pictures of this mans work I could understand his hostility but we weren't we were simply browsing his shop, custom tables, painted furniture and doors as we were told to do. Then he approaches me and tells me if I'm not here to buy anything from him to leave right now and never come back. He turns back around to my husband who was holding our 1 year old in his arms and leans in like he is about to grab him and yells to my husband to walk faster and to get out. While this place looks great in pictures it is not what they display online. How this man stays in business talking to customers the way he does is unreal to me. Christian business?!? You are a hotheaded joke. I have browsed the other reviews and this is not the first time or the last that this man has ran out good paying customers.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888de28403f2045:0xada7b71477cb7e8c"}

We were told to let them know when we were ready and the owner would come out and talk to us about prices. When he did he was very rude, inconsiderate, and his pricing system made no sense. He wanted $75 per door on every door we had, even though some were in much worse shape than others. We came prepared to spend a pretty penny and ended up spending a fraction of that because of his attitude. We won't be back.
