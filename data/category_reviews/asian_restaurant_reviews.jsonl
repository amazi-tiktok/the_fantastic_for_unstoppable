We ordered an appetizer and were told they were out of it.  Which would have been fine, if it hadn't been 6:45 pm on a Friday.  Also it was a Friday evening and over half the restaurant was empty.  But looking past that, we ordered the lettuce wraps.  20 minutes later our entrees showed up.  When we inquired about the lettuce wraps, the waitress admitted to forgetting them and that being the 2nd time that night she forgot someone's appetizer.  With that in mind we just asked to have it removed from our check.  The food come in what was mostly a timely manner.  Had we received our appetizer the wait would have seemed minimal.  But since we waited 20 minutes for what we thought was going to be our appetizer, it seemed longer that it probably was.  The food itself was average to above average, but nothing exceptional.  My portion of Kra Prow was appropriate and filling.  My girlfriend's portion of Sea Bass was significantly underwhelming.  It was so underwhelming to the fact that we almost ordered an appetizer for after dinner.  However due to the previous experience with appetizers during the meal we just asked for the check and walked up to Cajun Steamer instead to grab something else.  Aside from that, the waitress while cordial was pretty absent most of the time we were there.  My beer sat empty for quite awhile, and I wasn't offered a refill until the meal was over.\nIn summation, the food was ok but small portions, the service while friendly was poor, and the atmosphere of the place as a whole was down.  We weren't a fan, and I would highly recommend Surin off Airport or Thai Garden off Andrew Jackson to anyone looking for Thai food in the Huntsville/Madison area.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cab12c92179:0x6d5acb67ad126791"}

Therefore, I did some research on WAITR for the best deal and what I had a Taste. I ended up ordering from Wok Express.  I had the Luncheon Specials, that comes with an egg roll and fried rice. I also ordered a egg roll and the  6 angel crab.\n\nI ordered the Shrimp Lo Mein and the Shrimp Fried Rice Meal and they were sooooooooooo Good. I don\u2019t know about anyone else giving them a 1 rating. But, mine food experience was real good and I give them an overall 4.2 rating.   Let me tell you how!\n\nFirst, my fried rice was actually FRIED RICE!  It had eggs, carrots and green peas in it; plus the onions I requested to add along with it for no extra charge. I couldn\u2019t believe it! \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31 Why you asked? Because a lot of Chinese Restaurants don\u2019t do that anymore. They give you fried rice and nothing else, and it\u2019s sticky and gummy. But not Wok Express it was fresh and I had it for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. I didn\u2019t want one grain to be lost Okay! ( Now my noodles was a little overcook but still good)\n\nThere was 12 large pawn shrimp in both my Shrimp Lo Mien and Shrimp Fried Rice. (See Pictures) Plus, I request onions to be added to Both items and make  it SPICY and they DID JUST THAT! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nHowever, other Chinese Restaurants that I\u2019ve ordered from tell me that can\u2019t do it.They cancel my order or ask me to accept it which is plain  fried rice nothing in it. Also, with no onions and not spicy. (Take a look at the pictures). Look how large my egg rolls are. Yummy!  Yummy! In my Tummy on All of it.  My Angel Crab was crispy, fresh and good. \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31  (SEE PICTURES)\n\nI give my entire order a 4.2. I will say this;  I didn\u2019t like that they sent me 2 nice large thick plastic forks that were not packaged. But they are among many other restaurants who send me silverware loose and I throw it away and use mines. I don\u2019t know about you but with everything that\u2019s going on, I don\u2019t trust not having  my silverware in a sealed up package. But they did put my napkins in a bag to make sure they didn\u2019t get wet. (I Requested they did) \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nHowever, go make sure to get your Chinese there during Lunch time and save money. Next, if you order in make sure to check for a Free Delivery Promo Code to get your Free Delivery for WAITR.\n\nNew post; On Monday the 28, of December 2020, I order the Lunch General TSO\u2019s and it was good, I also, ordered my favorite Spicy Shrimp fried rice on the Lunch Menu and asked for the side fried rice to be spicy and placed in a separate container.\n\nBecause, I didn\u2019t want it mixed with my Shrimp fried rice but they didn\u2019t do it. Also, I only receive 9 shrimp in my meal and it\u2019s supposed to be 15 or 20 shrimps in my Shrimp Fried Rice. I\u2019m very disappointed especially after the good reviews that I\u2019ve given them.  I will always be fair and impartial but I\u2019m very disappointed in how their quality of food portions have went down on my favorite Spicy Shrimp fried rice.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlTbSQ9Gp43Kzw__JQaFlVqzZWHub--JKCyAcE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeNcBABrSWjDIRG5pUIaj9T7Tz0QO3WHPlx7Hf=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHwl1hjj8CRzUI4zJbh1aJIL3i41mw4frQO6AU=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPi8Z1Lszu3Am99t2lzZmyIRhVHhi0vIVncZjFI=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPK_wz3qQBDjRIs6ughWVz6IuyNdHLb19uVAqVr=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889175c961872eb:0xa39ef524b25ebc1d"}

It was failure after failure, and I have never before been subjected to such poor customer service.  That\u2019s the short version.\n\nThis is the full story. I ordered (and paid for) delivery from Asian Rim through Yelp Eat24 and, after waiting an hour and a half without getting any food or as much as a phone call, I called the restaurant directly to ask when I could expect my meal. I was informed by Colton that there was no order because they don\u2019t associate with Yelp Eat24 at all. Understandably, this freaked me out and lead me to believe I had been scammed. I then called Yelp Eat24 and demanded a refund after telling them what Colton had said. While they did quickly offer a me a refund (which \u2013side note-- I won\u2019t be getting for \u201cup to 5 business days\u201d), they were adamant that they did in fact work with Asian Rim and that their restaurant had actually already confirmed the order before I had called. I was still falsely placing my faith in Asian Rim at this time.\n\nAfter hanging up with Yelp Eat24, I hurriedly called my bank to inform them that I might have falsely been charged. All of this was quite time consuming and anxiety inducing. On a whim, I decided to call Asian Rim back again and relay to them the information I had been given by the representative at Yelp Eat24 for their own benefit. That\u2019s when Colton then informed me that they did actually work with Yelp Eat24 after all. He just hadn\u2019t known a third party, Backdoor, was also involved and it was their name coming up in his system. He unapologetically told me the food I had originally ordered would be at my house shortly.\n\nBut was it? No. So after even more time elapsed, I called Asian Rim a third time to ask what was going on. I was told by a different person that I should \u201cjust try calling Backdoor.\u201d I had to flat out demand to be told if the food had at least left Asian Rim yet. She finally said \u201cyeah.\u201d No apologies were given and I was rushed off the phone.\n\nThen I called Backdoor and was told that they did pick up the food from Asian Rim, but then realized the order had been cancelled. Aside from the refund Yelp Eat24 says they will give me, no other amends have even been attempted to be made. To reiterate-- his whole ordeal lasted about 3 hours from the time I placed and paid for the order to the time I was definitively told that there was no food coming. To say this place, and Colton specifically, handled this poorly is an understatement. I adamantly advise everyone reading this to refrain from ordering from Asian Rim.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889179da3445e5b:0x39c8686e22b7dc4c"}

Boy, big mistake. Apparently if you want something spicy, you have to ask for it. It being marked spicy on the menu means nothing. We also ordered Kung po Chicken  and shrimp, that is supposed to be very spicy hot , but again, nope, and it No shrimp  to be found. The last thing we ordered because we wanted to celebrate Valentines Day late was General Tso chicken, yes that is supposed to be very spicy too. Not only was it not spicy , it tasted exactly like the bland orange chicken. When I called to complain I was told that I didn\u2019t know what I was talking about. That her cooks know how to cook their food and if I wanted it spicy I was supposed to tell them. They charged me for the noodles which was ok because I expected that but when she asked if I wanted fried rice I said yes because I am not usually charged for that, Wrong. Not only is their food way over priced,but it isn\u2019t worth a reasonable price. The customer is never right there so don\u2019t bother to complain as she will just shout you down.

I\u2019m aware it is owned by a different individual than the one in Troy was but perhaps they should work on a few things. Nothing was labeled on the buffet bar, the potatoes were raw still and they do not keep the the buffet bars stocked well. My first experience was much worse so I thought to give it a second chance a few weeks later in case I just had bad luck that one time. The food today was OK...the waitress is really why I gave it three stars instead of just two. She did go out of her way to make sure our drinks were refilled. She didn\u2019t ever bring us our receipt and no fortune cookie. We waited around fifteen minutes but she sat in the corner with the other cashier/waitress talking and eating. So, we got up and paid at the counter then left. I don\u2019t know. The experience just wasn\u2019t grand by any means. The buffet is my biggest complaint though.

Needless to say, I've been around the Chinese Food block a few times. When I was younger my families favorite spot was the China Express right off Victory Drive next to the Raceway. Then when I turned 17 we moved to the Harris County border, which is a good 40 minute drive to our beloved China Express. The search began...... when it comes to exterior and interior design, and amusement levels, Ched Lee's is hand down a place of it's own. Its beautiful, and feel really traditional with all their koi fishies. However, the amazing atmosphere does not reflect in their food. Chef Lee's is easily the most expensive chinese place in Colunbus, and yet somehow the food is easily not the best in town. Their lomain tastes and looks exactly like the microwave kind from Walmart. The egg rolls lack flavor. I dont really know how to explain it, the food just seems.... off. The fried rice is not truly fried rice. Someone called it \"northern chinese food\" which might make sense as to why my mother LOVES them. She grew up in NY. The building is so over the top Chinese vibes, that I guess they didn't think the food needed to be too. I'm sorry Chef Lee's, you're just not for me. But I do love your fishies!

The ambiance is broken if or when you see multiple employees staring from various places. I understand you might want to be quick if a customer needs something or if an employee needs help, but please don't stand in plain view right around the corner. It's kind of creepy and made me feel like I was being judged.\n\nAs for the food, here's what happened: I ordered the squid with green onion and ginger. I was so excited after reading how proud the owner of the place was of his food. I really wanted to try your cuisine. But when I got my food, there was no flavor. The sauce was thick and brown and looked good enough, but it was barely savory despite its looks. As for the ginger, it may have been a milder variety, but it wasn't spicy/flavorful at all and at first I thought I was eating bamboo. The green onions were fine. The squid was the tougher, more chewy kind I personally dislike. I have no idea what it's called but some dishes from other restaurants have it too (when I get Tom Yum) it's not just this place. I'm not holding the squid against them for this reason.\n\nI don't know if it's usually like this, but when we went we saw a lot of old people so maybe they hid away the spices until senior swim was over. Jokes aside, I'm disappointed we aren't able to experience the cooking that earned your restaurant awards and praises. I wonder if it's gone downhill or if we just came on a bad day.

Although the food is acceptable and decor is fun, the chairs are not comfortable.  As soon as you start eating, they try to get you out.  We came on Friday afternoon, we only saw one other table occupied inside, and we were seated by the kitchen in a terrible uncomfortable booth.  Is this really your best seat? In the back by the kitchen and bar when we had 2 young children?  The lady  serving us was constantly at our table hovering and telling us what to eat and how to eat it.   My husband tried to order more than 3 dishes so we could take some home and she told him no and could only order 3.  She actually started to pile other plates on the plate I was eating from!  She started to put our \"leftovers\" to go although we were still eating.  And was all over our dishes.  I threw away the leftovers because we asked her not to handle.  I actually started to not look at her and look away hoping she would go away.   If you want to be in and out with no time to relax and enjoy, this is your place!  Sadly, we will not be back.\n\nWe came back without my husband and they tried to place me at same area.  It\u2019s 4:30 and not really crowded so I asked to move.  Lin was our waitress and very nice.  But while we were still eating, she tried to pack up and now the \u201cto go\u201d boxes are on the table with the food.  I had to stop her and I was telling her that we are still eating.  The food was hot and delicious.

As obvious the waitress must check your ID to order an alcoholic drink, and that was no problem. The manager had came over though and started yelling in the room \u201cyou look sixteen years old\u201d. Then demanded to check my ID again. So of course I let her check me ID. As she is checking my ID she is repeatedly yelling \u201cyou look sixteen, no way\u201d. After she questioned me on about everything my ID had, she seemed upset and gave me my ID back with no apology. I felt all the attention in the room just locked on my table. As the manager walked away she continued to yell \u201cyou look sixteen\u201d and then go talk to her employees angrily as if I had gotten away with the best fake ID in the world. At the end of the dinner the manager decided to take it upon herself to yell at our waitress as well for not coming to grab the check, even though she was giving us excellent service.So further more, do I recommend going to Chef Lee\u2019s? No I do not. I especially don\u2019t recommend anyone that may look on the younger side of your actual age, or you will be humiliated.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1512668490890, "text": "Katie, we apologize for any inconvenience during your recent visit.

We ordered sweet and sour chicken for the kids and when we received our order it had the chicken completely smothered in the sweet and sour sauce. When the kids barely ate any of it, the waiter said \"you should have listened to me when I told you that you should have had the sauce on the side\". That would have probably been great advice. The problem is she never gave that advice. It was wrong for me to assume that it was going to come on the side in the first place, but In fairness the order description does not suggest the chicken comes smothered. Overall I just thought the tone of the waiter was a bit rude.  The food tasted okay but wasn't anything better than you can get from a regular takeout restaurant. The prices are certainly higher. I guess you're paying for the environment which is pretty nice.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1526913799611, "text": "Rich, thanks for the feedback on your visit.

Seeing a lot of reviews, a high rating and then the beautiful outside and inside atmosphere I was excited to try the food. The prices were only slightly higher than what I'm used to paying in a sit-down restaurant and the service was excellent. Unfortunately, we found the food bland or overly sweet with the fried appetizers having a heavy grease taste.\n\nMore detail for my fellow read-every-review people and the owner:\n\nWe felt that the egg rolls were large and fried well but tasted bland and were greasier than we're used to; the pot stickers tasted of grease and the dipping sauce tasted only of soy, not the pot sticker sauce we know and love; the won tons in the soup were very large and there were plenty of them but there was little filling and the broth was very, very bland; sweet and sour pork had nice chunks of pork that weren't overly battered but the sauce was almost too sweet to eat (my kids have never said this before); the lemon chicken came as a whole breast that is battered, fried and then sliced which looked great and the chicken was moist but the sauce was overly sweet without lemon flavor; the orange chicken had chicken in small pieces fried so hard we had trouble chewing it and the sauce was just sweet without any orange flavor; the kung pao shrimp looked great and had a generous amount of shrimp but had a bland sauce without any heat; lastly the mongolian beef was very tender but the sauce was again way too sweet. All of the meat was of great quality and the vegetables were fresh.\n\nI rarely leave a negative review. We don't consider ourselves to be picky eaters. We have enjoyed Chinese food all over the US and have tried 5 other Chinese restaurants in the area to date and have never been disappointed like this. I feel this must be out of the norm for Chef Lee's or they wouldn't be so successful. That said, we weren't happy with any of the food and that is out of the norm as well. Usually if one menu item is disappointing the others are fine and enjoyable. According to my experience and other one star reviews something is going occasionally but very wrong in the kitchen or the food is hit/miss and we had the bad luck of spending a lot of money there on such a night.\n\nSorry Chef Lee, I really, really wanted to love your place!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1529596913968, "text": "Sara, it's very disappointing we didn't live up to your expectations.

We went in and realized the restaurant was ran by Koreans and not Chinese as their advertisement would say.  I asked to order a half Peking Duck and inquired if it was true Peking style that came with the buns.  The old Korean lady said \"yah yah\" as she answered the phone and took another order at the same time.  I asked again about the buns and she said \"yes.\"  I paid for my order and waited.  When the food came out, I told my husband to look at the order and make sure the buns are in there.  The old lady then said \"no buns unless you order full duck.\"  I reminded her that I asked earlier and she said yes but then the answer swiftly became a no.  Also, the way the duck was prepared was definitely not Peking duck style.. It's like breaded duck scraps. Disappointed.\n\nMaybe sit down service might be different but definitely the Korean lady was not the greatest.  I might try eating here again but I am so dissapointed with the service that I really might not.

First, please know that while we employ many people from many different nationalities, Chef Lee and his wife are both Chinese, and only create authentic Chinese dishes, including the Peking Duck.  Speaking of which, it appears that you mistakenly ordered the Crispy Duck, which is very different from the Peking Duck and doesn't include the buns. If we were at all unclear in describing the difference between these two dishes, I apologize, but I hope this helps to clarify what happened. I do hate to leave a poor first impression like this, so I hope you'll consider giving us one more chance to show you a better time. I know you'll enjoy your next visit, and I look forward to proving that to you.\n\nShould you need more personal attention, please ask for me and I will make sure you get what you need.\n\nSimply ask for Ed !
