I asked them how their days were and the news I would receive from my children would change my outlook on the world. My son, who is 5, stated he had good news and sad news. (This is a usual statement. He like to say something sad and good that happened during his day. He said his teacher pushed him down. Taken aback, I inquired what happened? I had thought for sure I misunderstood. He repeated himself in more detail that she had taken her hand to the back of his head and pushed him off of the picnic table. He continued that he had fallen on the rocks of the playground and hurt his hands and knees. I checked his hands and knees, but there were minor indications of trauma. The owner of the daycare assured me she would get to the bottom of it and let me know. She expressed how much she loves my children and cares for us like family. Trying to reassure myself, I say how maybe he was mistaken, because his sister had said stuff before and recanted. Surely, I told myself, there has to be some mistake. My children have attended this daycare for over 4 years, and we have not had major incidents in that time.....Boy, was I wrong....\nThe owner of the daycare gave me her phone the next night, so I could feel better about the situation and know that my children are safe. She stated how my son was mistaken and that the teacher had caught him from falling, etc.. I was left to watch the video in slow motion to find out what happened....Shocking!

I have always enjoyed spending time with my son so it is not uncommon for me to him off in the morning and stay for 20 minutes or longer to hang out with him and his friends in his class.  The teachers have always been appreciative of me spending time with him and when he was younger, I would stop by at random times without warning just to check on him, to see him and was always greeted and got a chance to know his teachers. I have appreciated the curriculum because my son always comes home having learned new words, colors, shapes or just singing a new song. He loves to go to school and loves to be with his friends. All the kids I see usually are really happy and smiling. He moved up into classes with older kids at times which I appreciated because in order for him to learn to crawl or even walk, it was helpful for him to see other kids who were already doing those thing so he could mimic what they did. We love the staff and the hours and I feel confident that he is taken care and truthfully the teachers as a whole are not appreciated as much as they should be because it's a hard job and not everyone can handle that stress. We have recommended this school to numerous friends who have their kids now and it is nice for us to watch them grow up together.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923c63d1e68f1:0x3f6222559ce30c38"}

We loved the teachers and that class so much. One morning when he was in the guppy class I was dropping off my son and the lead teacher of sea turtles was opening that class. My son had a blow out so the teacher was changing him and I was standing there helping her. As I\u2019m talking to her she is taking his clothes off and then begins to use his outfit to wipe his stool off his entire body. His outfit ended up having to be thrown away because after three washes it was stained. I mentioned it to the admin and the director and nothing was done. Everything was great until he moved up to the sea turtle class. We did not want him moving up to that class because he was only about 7.5 months old. He wasn\u2019t even crawling, but was attempting to crawl. They kept pushing me to move him up even though I expressed my feelings towards it several times. They stated he was \u201ctoo big\u201d for the guppy class and he couldn\u2019t fit in the swings anymore. He was a 7.5 month old who couldn\u2019t even crawl, in a class full of 1 year olds who are walking. After he moved up to the sea turtle class we started having issues instantly. The lead teacher would tell me what to do and not to do with my son. He came home with three knots on his head over the period of time from when he moved up until this week. Nobody called me to inform me that he had hit his head either. When I picked him up the teachers or admin staff would state they didn\u2019t know how he got the knots and bruises on his head. Also, every day when I pick up my sons nose is crusted with snot. It clearly hadn\u2019t been whipped off all day. His clothes would be covered in the foods they had eaten that day too. Several times I would have to change his clothes and clean him up before leaving because he looked so bad. On many occasions he came home with 3 out of 4 bottles still filled with formula that I had pre made that morning. The teachers would state he refused to eat. Let me mention that my now 10 month old is 27 lbs, he doesn\u2019t miss a meal. When I would pack his bottles up to leave he would get so excited like he wanted one, so I would give him one and he would drink it so fast like he hadn\u2019t eaten all day because he hadn\u2019t. They only gave him one bottle for an entire 10 hours. When my son was close to 9 months old he came home for a week straight throwing up randomly and having bad stools. I finally took him to the doctor thinking he was sick. I came back to the daycare the following week and told his teacher that his doctor said he was fine. That is when I find out that his lead teacher had been giving him whole milk with his formula without asking me or even telling me for an entire week. What if my kid was allergic or I didn\u2019t want him to have milk? The doctor even recommends children not have whole milk till they are a year old. I expressed my feelings towards her stating all my concerns about it and she states in that class they train the children on whole milk. I told her not to give it to him anymore but I would find out from the other teachers that she continued to give it to him. One day I had to pick my son up during nap time for a doctors appt and she told me to shhh that I would wake the children up. Let me mention I was whispering asking how my son was that day. The same teacher has gotten a stern tone with two of the other kids in his class while I was in there talking to her during drop off, so it makes me wonder how she is talking to my son without me there. These are only a few things that have happened. The director was aware but never did anything about it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923c63d1e68f1:0x3f6222559ce30c38"}

They have animals and learn how to take care of a garden in the back. They teach the children the most important facts and truly care about the children.

The Montessori Learning Center just did not know how to handle him. They are looking for easy kids to watch so they can sit around and collect checks. Would not recommend them after my experience.\n\nI assume the 5 star ratings you are giving yourself are in response to my review. I am sorry if you do not know how to handle children.\n\nIf you are reading this and looking at schools please don't take convenience into account when choosing a school.
