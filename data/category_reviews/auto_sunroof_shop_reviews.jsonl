From the start, I was uneasy about the experience, but I went ahead with it. Huge mistake. I drove by today and a woman who said she was the owner's friend and acting manager waited on me. I asked her to inspect my car to put tint on the driver and passenger windows only. She inspected them and we agreed on a tint grade and a price. Then I walked down the street to the library to wait. About an hour later I decided to head back, and got a call from the manager on my way. She was agitated, and demanded to know if the car had ever had tint on it before. I replied that it may have, I bought it used. She said that they had already started applying tint to one window when they discovered that there was residue from old tint below the window sill. When I got back to the shop, the manager was in a frenzy. She pointed out the residue, and kept going on about how they had \"wasted $50 worth of tint\". I remained calm and asked them to finish the job. She said they would have to charge me $10 per window extra as a cleanup fee. I refused, saying it was their mistake and they should have inspected the windows more closely before starting (they are the experts, after all). She became very upset and began to shout, again blaming it on me for not telling her about the residue (which, again, was below the windowsill line and not visible). I stood my ground and insisted that it's not my job to know everything, that's why I brought it to a professional. She blew up, began to curse, shout, and refused to look at me in the eye. She shouted at the tint specialist to reassemble my car and send me away. I knew it would cost me even more at another tint shop to have them clean up the messed up tint that was already on my window from Tint Spectrum, so I reluctantly asked the tint specialist what it would take to get the job done right and get be out. He said it would take another $20, so I agreed to pay it. This time, I sat down in the shop and watched them the entire time. I'm not a tint expert by any means, but in my humble opinion, neither are these guys. One of them (who I later found out was the owner) was eating pizza over the hood of my car and asking me whether it was pink or red (it's obviously red). The tint specialist who was working on my car had to rip the tint from the passenger's window, replace it, install tint on the driver's side, rip it off and replace it, and then replace the tint on the passenger's side AGAIN. I'm not sure what he kept messing up, but if each one of those sheets was $50 worth of tint, he easily wasted over $200 worth. The manager continued to stomp around the shop shouting and cursing. The owner didn't seem to care. The tint specialist left lart \"3M\" logos on my window's right in the middle. The manager asked me if I wanted those removed (who in the world would WANT 3M logos in the middle of their window?).\n\nWhen it was all said and done, my final bill was $140 before tax, which was $20 higher than agreed upon earlier that morning due to absolutely no fault of my own. The manager remained rude and loud the entire time, and I must have waited in the shop for well over an hour after I got back from the library. The manager offered no apology other than something about \"didn't mean to snap earlier\". I don't think there is anything in the world that could make me go back to this place or recommend it. The manager is rude, loud, inappropriate and unfair. The staff are very slow, appear to be outrageously incompetent, and are all dirty on top of that (the tint specialist kept spitting tobacco juice on the ground right behind my car). The owner didn't seem to care about anything. I think the quality of the tint is good, since it's 3M. But the service and the installation quality were absolutely not even worth the one star I am forced to grant them. Do not take your car to this place. You will regret it, especially if you have to deal with the manager.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889293004402c64d:0x5a3bd58c8045da98"}
