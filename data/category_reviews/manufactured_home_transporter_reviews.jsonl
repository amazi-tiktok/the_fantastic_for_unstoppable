Underpinning got installed approx 1 month later.\n\nThere are repairs that are needed now which should fall under warranty, however I am not confident they will do quality work (\"they gave us a bad review, so we'll do just enough\" type of deal). That said, who knows - maybe things have changed internally and they'd see this as an opportunity.\n\nA lot of the headache around our purchase (and the subsequent bad review) probably could have been avoided with better communication both internally (within their company) and externally (with contractors they hired and with us). Buyer beware is all I can say. If you go with them, I hope you have a better experience than we did. While I still don't necessarily recommend them I do hope that, in the months since we purchased, they have been able to fix whatever issues caused the hiccups with our experience and provide a better product for future customers.\n\nOriginal review:\nAVOID THIS PLACE. Our experience declined when they ceased to be Dream Home Outlet and became regional homes of Cullman. Been waiting months to get into our house because their installers can't do anything right (no AC in half our home because they forgot the crossovers, AC unit installed in an improper location, water crossovers improperly installed, missing door hardware, etc). We have been patient about waiting but enough is enough. The goalposts keep moving- first it was one day, then two days, then weeks. Shame that I can't even live in the house that I'm already making payments on. Moe, Wendy, and Les are all decent enough people but there's a major hangup somewhere for these types of issues to be so prevalent, and because of that (in addition to the lack of requested -repeatedly- communication) I cannot recommend anyone go here when looking for their new home.\n\nAVOID AVOID AVOID", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1590528128684, "text": "Hey Steven.
