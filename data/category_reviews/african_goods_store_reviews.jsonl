We spoke with the owner, Yemi (spelling?) and she was so sweet! She said she\u2019s been designing clothes for over 30 years. I bought a beautiful blue skirt which I received a lot of compliments on already! The prices are standard for what I thought I would pay (the knee length skirt I got was $50. It\u2019s a nice material, bright colors, and IT HAS POCKETS!!) The owner says she can customize clothes for you if you ask, she has sizes up to a 6X (there\u2019s a lot of skirts that are one size fits most that have a tie waist). I wear an XL up to XXL in most stores and I have no problem with the fit.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEDco6iqLqFS17k84Nk_4ax9S6wISlvR2_zqYT=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8kxb4xY8Er3fBLiJLSroKiKADVJzY79VtfB1S=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e816e758f4e87:0x80fb8e1d0d239b06"}

There's a nice array of styles seated in the quaint little shop. You have one on one service and the ability to get your clothes tailored just for you. When new items arrive, you must get there quickly because they sell out fast. You can find various herbs and natural products along with the beautiful clothing. The colors, fabrics, and styles are a refreshing reflection of cultured class. The owners are sweet friendly people.
