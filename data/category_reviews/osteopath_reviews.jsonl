If it were possible to give less stars I would do so.\n\nI have never been treated so disparagingly or with such utter patronizing disdain from a medical provider in my entire life. Gaile Prentice CRNP (not even a medical doctor mind you) was assigned to me when I called in for a general wellness check over a year ago.  After a not so pleasant initial experience with a CRNP who was clearly not well trained or very competent for that matter I thought I'll try again when I call back next time for another appointment with another doctor. Unfortunately you are assigned the same doctor for LIFE at this practice.\n\nThis is the most absurd practice concept I have ever heard of. Instead of seeking the best doctor patient relationship this practice cares more for administrative duties and collecting as many co pays as possible.\n\nAs my wife accompanied me to my appointment literally in tears pleading for  help with managing my general anxiety we were met with ZERO SYMPATHY and were denied a refill of an very common anti anxiety medication I have used in the past on multiple occasion when it was absolutely necessary to do so (valium).\n\nRather than attempting to dig into the problem she exasperated the issue and the most she would do was refer me to a psychiatrist. Never mind in Texas with my  primary care doctor I was able to get prescription refills without ever having to see such a doctor. They were more than competent and experienced enough handle simple issues like these.\n\nI was treated with contempt and my personal integrity was questioned on multiple occasion regarding a medication I have been taking literaly for years.\n\nDo not waste your time with this practice.
