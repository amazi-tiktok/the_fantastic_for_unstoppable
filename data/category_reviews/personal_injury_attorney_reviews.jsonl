As a result, my case was settled by dismissal and I never sat foot into the courtroom. This was trully a blessing as I like to keep my family and personal affairs out of any forms of public veiwings.\nThanks so much  - Attorney Howie - may you continue to receive Spiritual blessing for the righteous work that your firm is doing.\nCedric D.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1630083495129, "text": "Thanks so much for the amazing review as your divorce attorney in Morgan County!

It was an uncontested divorce except for the fact that my ex wanted child support. Well, I didn't know any better, and I knew she wouldn't sign the papers if there was no child support so I agreed to give her what Mr. Campbell had come up with: $400. My ex originally wanted something like $650 per month so I looked at that as a win. Well, after talking with different people who have joint legal and physical custody like I do, they wonder why in the hell am I paying my ex ANY child support, since I have her week on and week off. And, after talking with two different lawyers, they wonder the same thing. The lawyer I have now told me if I'd taken our case to court, the judge would NOT have awarded child support to my ex. We will be going back to court needless to say, will definitely not be using Mr. Campbell who screwed me over.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1450297464686, "text": "Dear Mr. Kemp, I appreciate the opportunity to have assisted with your case, but I do wish you had taken an opportunity to follow up with me about these concerns.  I did leave a message for you to call me concerning this matter, but I have not heard back from you.  I can address your concerns here.  As you might recall, you came to me to fix the agreement that you had tried to file on your own and that the court had rejected.  Without going into the details of the numbers involved with your case (which details are a matter of record) I can confidently say that you would likely have been ordered to pay around $400 per month in child support if you were awarded true joint physical custody after a trial.  If you had tried your case and been awarded joint legal custody, with your wife being awarded sole physical custody, you would have likely been ordered to pay around $650 per month.  Note that there is a difference between joint physical, versus joint legal, custody.  In Alabama, child support must still be calculated, and the judge still must state whether or not Rule 32 has been followed, even in joint physical custody situations.  This means that one party who makes significantly more than the other may still have to pay an amount of child support, and the method used to calculate $400 per month in your case is one that is accepted by the courts.  If two people make the same income, or have an agreement to deviate from guidelines, it is possible to have an order without child support.  Those conditions were not present in your situation.  The alternative would have been to pay me (or another lawyer) much more money to take your case to trial, and make an argument for custody and support, the result of which would not have been a certainty (and could result in less favorable terms of custody and having to pay more support than your agreement).  I'll be glad to explain this to the other persons that have provided feedback to you, as I fear that they must be either misinformed as to the facts or the law.  I am glad to have had the opportunity to assist you, and I will be happy to follow up with you concerning any questions that you have about this matter."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626b54406e816d:0xec1834fe93991c53"}

This place moved three times since she has been their client, and they never informed her until she called them herself because they do not contact her. David, the person with whom she asks to speak, is constantly dodging her because he is always \"out of the office\" or \"with another 'more important' client.\" I'm sure NONE of those \"more important\" clients have been as equanimous with them as she has.\n\nDavid has apparently trained his staff to dodge her as well since she called them, and Alice refused to answer the phone (probably because of caller ID) but when I called, she answered the phone just to place us on hold to retrieve something so minuscule that it took less than 30 seconds to do...\n\nApparently this lawyer and his team care nothing about their clients--and dare I say clients of color... But this is the behavior that is typical of many businesses in the north central region of Alabama. Once the better business bureau is contacted, however, maybe they will change their tone.\n\nIf she had not contacted the actual courthouse to get her court date, she would not have even known of the impending court date. After calling these people several times, they refused to give her any of her case details.\n\nSo with regard to the other negative review this institution has received, I do NOT agree with the owner that \"it is the work of a competitor.\" I have seen these practices first-hand, and I am far from a capital seeking adversary.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1594754666809, "text": "Because we don't recognize your name and you don't appear to be a client of our firm, based off your screen name, there's no way for us to address this issue without knowing the exact name of the client.

Are you sure you have the correct firm?\n\nIn relation to your comment about \"people of color,\" approximately half of our clients are non-caucasion clients and are \"people of color.\" We have dedicated this firm to representing clients who have been injured, oppressed, overlooked and not been treated fairly, regardless of their designation. Over the years, the lawyers and staff of our firm have also volunteered countless hours of their personal time participating in charities and outreach programs that benefit all segments of our community.\n\nAlthough we're respectful of your opinion, the assertions you've made about the issue of race are reckless and inaccurate and thats clearly proven by 17 years of close relationships with people of all genders, races and socio-economic statuses that are repeat clients. Many people leaving reviews on this very site are \"people of color\" and would strongly disagree with your statement and actually take offense to it. Writing a negative review about a business that's never represented you is one thing but making baseless accusations of racial unfairness about people you don't know and who have spent their careers representing underprivileged segments of our state and communities is something else.\n\nIf your mother is dissatisfied with any service that any lawyer or staff member of our firm has ever provided, then please have your mother, personally, reach out immediately and ask for the head practice manager so that we can rectify this matter.\n\nWe take any client dis-satisfaction very seriously and want every client to be satisfied with our efforts.

He refuses to return phone calls. He called me ONE TIME during my divorce, the day before the hearing. He never even bothered to send me the final divorce decree. I had no idea what my divorce papers said until his secretary emailed them to me, after the THIRD request. I know all of his secretaries because they are the only ones I could ever talk to. Half the time, they didn't return phone calls either. Halfway through the 'mediation' I got the distinct feeling that he was working for the other side. He obviously thinks he can make a living by gaining clients, screwing them over, and going on to the next victim. He must be too young and immature to grasp the concept that most people will need an attorney more than ONCE in their lifetime, and if he thinks he can be successful without the benefit of repeat clients, he is delusional. If he was the last attorney on earth, I would never hire him again. My divorce is final; I'm still missing half my belongings; he's promised me a refund twice and never delivered. On top of that, he suggested we file a contempt motion because of the fact that I was not given all the belongings I was entitled to. He didn't mention at the time that he planned on charging me an additional $1500 to do what I'd already paid him to do. In my opinion, the reason all his pictures on FB look like gangster photos is because he is a crook. He will stand there and 'listen' to you, but he is just pretending to hear you. You'd have more luck talking to a brick wall. Plus the brick wall might return your calls. I read a bad review of his, and I should have heeded it.

They were pressuring me to settle without an attorney. I could tell they were trying to intimidate me.\n\nI chose Cross & Smith and was awarded \"10x\" the offer the insurance company originally offered me. It was more than I imagined and more than what I would have settled for, if I had to do it alone.\n\nThere were no surprises, no hidden fees, they explained everything every step of the way. I would also like to give a special thanks to Leslie Bradley. Leslie kept me updated through phone conversations and emails. Their staff offers nothing but warm hospitality.

I was satisfied with the fact that I felt that I got what I paid for. I have used other law firms in the past for things unrelated to a bankruptcy, so I knew in advance what to expect from a competent, experienced and knowledgeable group of attorneys. They have always handled my legal concerns in a timely, professional and competent manner. They even went above and beyond, on more than one occasion, to assist me and did things for me that I really did feel were outside the scope of what I had paid them to do and I even expected to be charged more for their services and would have been happy to pay additionally for the services they provided to me. That is enough to warrant an excellent referral to the point I would be more than happy to recommend them to all of my friends and family, but that's not where their professional services ended. Truthfully what I am more impressed with and what has meant so much to me personally is the fact they have a \"heart\". When you get a letter in the mail that you don't understand and need help deciphering the \"legalese\" you can call and speak to someone like \"Morgan\". She's not just someone answering their phone. You helped me understand what it was that I got in the mail and set up an appointment to speak to attorney the next day. That all wonderful, but what meant the most was that she listened to me, the struggle I have had since the pandemic and how my financial circumstances have worsened. She helped me relax she offered an ear to listen to me and a heart to respond to me, not as just a client of their law firm, but as a human. She gave me kind hearted conversation that's given me the strength to relax until I speak to the attorney tomorrow. That is priceless! I don't know how you can assign a dollar figure for something like that, but it reinforces the opinion that I sought out the best law firm I could find to help me with this matter and \"Morgan\" cemented the opinion to me that I made the right decision. If you need a lawyer to handle your legal affairs, that watches out for your best interest, doesn't charge you again to assist you you when you have additional needs that arise out of your bankruptcy and most importantly to me, has your back and cares about how this is impacting your life and you emotionally, call Brock and Stout. They will take care of you professionally, legally and in my case emotionally when I absolutely needed it the most; you won't regret your decision. I never leave reviews for companies because I am usually so busy. Today \"Morgan\" just went so far out of her way, not just to answer the phone, not just to help interpret the letter I received in the mail, not even to set up a much needed appointment with the attorney; she helped me moby listening and having a heart so I can continue to make it through this very stressful time in my life. In the midst of all my financial struggles and hardship God has a plan and I know that calling Brock and Stout was part of that plan.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1589423145362, "text": "It has been our pleasure to help you.

Therefore his claims will prob be put on top of the stack compared to other attorneys. It was in my case. Me personally, i was hurt in a car accident on I-65 and was worried i couldnt pay the medical bills. After having 2 sprained ankles and other various injuries(none too serious, thankfully) i ended up in a financial bind and needed the case settled quickly. He had my case settled and doubled the money i received in my hand in just 3 weeks compared to when i broke my back with another injury attorney that took over 2 years. Not only does he do a great job, he seems to genuinely be a good person and will help you all he can (his secretary, too!). Lastly, Tyler doesnt seem worried at all about taking your case to trial if he needs to. This attorney will not just try to settle your case and then pass you off to other attorneys if your case isnt an easy \"cut and dry\" claim which is VERY common in personal injury cases. I personally believe he will do a better job than ANY other injury lawyer for you because he did just that for me and he is still helping my father who was in the wreck with me but hurt worse.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b5a58dee519:0x4218ed631d7b5121"}

The receptionist who answered the phone helped me as much as she could with my general questions and then passed my information on to a member of their legal team. From there,  Billy Elliott called and was one hundred percent HONEST with me and didn't try to take advantage of my legal ignorance. He took the time to give me some extrmely valuable advice over the phone without ever being retained by me! He gave me detailed explanations and responses to my questions and really helped me to figure out what I should expect from the insurance company! I am positive that this will be my go-to legal firm for all future incidents and the one I would recommend to anyone who is looking for an attorney.

The envelope contents naming me a co-defendant made me change gears and begin researching my options. Several legal firms sent unsolicited advertisements to my mailing address. In searching my home city for legal council I discovered that  most only handled bankruptcies. That was not the route I wanted to take. My wonderful wife found the legal firm of Watts and Herring LLC online. On the website were a number of  useful Youtube articles explaining how to handle my situation and even how to do it myself. However, the old saying about the person that represents himself in court has a fool for a lawyer rang out loudly in my brain as did a movie quote, \"A man's got to know his limitations\". I decided to contact Mr. John Watts.\n\nI told my co-defendant about Mr. Watts and it was agreed to see if they would represent us. Mr. Watts assistant, Carolyn was cordial, professional and to the point. She arranged a phone conversation and Mr. Watts listened to my side and let me know about my options. None involved bankruptcy and he told me how to fill out the defendant's responses. My co-defendant agreed to be represented by Mr. Watts and the step by step procedure went as planned. It was reassuring that we were informed along the way and Carolyn was usually available to answer any questions I had either that day or the next.\n\nNow that it is over, I am glad that Watts and Herring represented us.

The lawyer responded that she believed that she could produce the information.  Judge gave us 60 days to return back before him.\n\nThe lawyer asked if she could speak with me in the hallway and the judge suggested that I see what she had to say.  She asked me did I not received the credit card statements that were sent to me.  I stated, \"I repeat my answer from court --- I have received everything that your office submitted to circuit court\".  She replied, than you have everything (I remembered Atty.

Once I listened to John\u2019s video on \u201cyour 5 options if being sued by a debt collector\u201d I felt as if a \"ton of bricks\" had been lifted off my shoulders.  I immediately contacted his office online and within 30-45 minutes I was contacted by his staff and was very pleased with the prompt reply, professionalism and knowledgeable staff.  John was very thorough in explaining my options and patiently listened to me with his full attention and I knew I was in capable hands.  I was able to turn all my worries over to John and his staff so I could focus on my job. John and his staff kept me updated and communication regularly which really eased my mind. My humblest thanks go out to John, his staff and his expertise which gave me peace of mind once again!!! If you ever find yourself in this predicament, I highly recommend that you contact John and his staff at Watts & Herring, LLC.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1563375102635, "text": "Thanks WB!

Reluctantly she gave and realized she had just been served papers.  She immediately went in a total panic attack.  Thank God my older children were home at the time.  My wife, being a former paralegal, called around to friends who all refused to help us.  Due to circumstances beyond our control 4 years before, we lost our vehicle due to a job change for me that proved disastrous.  It was a very dark time for us, but we managed to pull ourselves up from it and found good jobs, we even bought a house.   We didn\u2019t hear anything regarding the vehicle for years.  Then we got a letter that an attorney had the old \u201caccount\u201d.  Then we got served 2 weeks later.  We thought we going to lose everything again and that process was inconceivable.  Being desperate, my wife looked on the internet and found Watts and Herring.  The testimonials were unbelievable.  The videos on their site only made us feel even more like someone cared and help was attainable.  We filled out the online contact form and within 24 hours we were contacted.  The attorney we spoke with was so understanding and comforting regarding our issue.  We felt we could breathe again and that things would be ok.  We had prayed for God to lead us to a strong tower, and we found it in Watts and Herring.  They were so kind and understanding and were able to settle our case in a matter of days.

Immediately after receiving my first paycheck I began calling creditors to \"do the right thing\" I had no clue that I was actually waking a sleeping dragon!\nAfter a year in the nightmare with creditors, I felt bankruptcy was my only option. I had hired a credit counseling service, who took my money and ran. I hired a credit clean up service, who took my money and ran. The same story repeated itself over and over.

I was amazed at the amount of advice he gave! He really seemed to care! He spent ample time helping me to understand my situation and gave me several options, bankruptcy was not one of them! He even sent a packet full of information! He felt like he could make an impact on my situation and that he did! One of my  creditors was American Express. They are no longer a creditor because the debt was cancelled and is to be erased from my credit report!!! John Watts was able to accomplish this without having to step foot in the court room! One case down and one to go! I am incredibly thankful to have found John Watts! Has been so very kind and generous and has given me the peace of mind I need!

When I stated I didn't want to do that the attorney said, \"I guess we can go to court\". Well from Attorney Watts' video I learned you NEVER want to pay the debt buyer money because they paid the original creditor pennies on the dollar so everything they collect from you is profit!! I called Attorney Watts' office and spoke with Carolyn. She was so understanding and really comforted me during this stressful confusing time. I hired them to handle the lawsuit. I was told I wouldn't even have to go to court, he would go to court for me and call me with the decision. Then I received a personal email from Attorney Watts himself, which I found so sweet. Sometimes when you hire attorneys you never receive anything from the actual attorney only his staff but that is not the case with this firm. Well fast forward to 2 weeks since hiring Attorney Watts and I received a notice that my case had been dropped, no judgment against me, no consent judgment, and I don't owe them a dime!

I am a young mom and have a lot on my plate, not to mention- I have never been in any \"legal\" trouble before. The debt was far more than I could afford. At first, I did very little research. I tried reaching out to the debt collector directly to try and settle this. When that did not go anywhere (and it typically doesn't, they would rather not settle directly. They can get more by taking you to court.) I reached out to Ferry & Nichols. Ferry & Nichols send out the same letter to everyone in the state of Alabama that has an open case against them. They state they are a mediator and will \"assist\" you in \"settling your debt at a much lower price\". For me, it was $300 lower than the alleged debt..but with their fees I would be paying only $50 less than what I was being sued for. After a few calls to them, something was fishy. They never answered any of my questions and I spoke to multiple different people who kept telling me different things. I was not confident with hiring them. At this point I had only a few more days to respond to my summons before a default judgement was placed against me. My anxiety was through the roof. I did more extensive research and came across Watts & Herring. The videos on his website were so helpful, I called immediately. Caroline answered my call and she was so comforting..I laid it all out on the table; my problem and how fearful I was. She reassured me that Mr.John Watts could help. And he did! Not only did he give me the best possible choice, he taught me a lot! He was always a text, call, or email away. He solved my debt with this nasty debt collector better than I even expected! My total cost spent was far less than I would have guessed when I first started this process. My only regret is that I let myself worry and stress too long...I should have called the minute I found out. John is a life saver and made what could have been a very bad experience into a great one! My advise- do not make any decisions into solving your debt until you speak to John. He is an amazing and genuine person.

We were so upset and didn't know where to turn. We had only 14 days to file an answer to the complaint or the plaintiff would get a default judgment. I started searching on the web of how to answer the complaint, but had no idea how we were going to fight this! I didn't know where to even begin!\nThen, I came across Watts & Herring, Consumer Protection Attorneys website and blog and started reading and watching videos that John Watts had posted. I started feeling much more at ease and decided we would try to fight this.\nWell, before I had even submitted an answer to the complaint, a process server came again and my husband was being sued for a SECOND lawsuit by the SAME \"infamous\" DEBT COLLECTOR!! Now we had TWO answers to file. I felt a bit overwhelmed, but felt like I could tackle this. We WERE NOT going to let them win by a default judgment!\nI turned in the answers and got notice of court dates. The court dates were exactly a week apart!\nI did a lot of research and felt VERY confident on our day in court. I did have some concerns in facing a judge and not knowing what questions may be asked by the plaintiff. However, I came prepared to court, and after speaking with the attorney for the plaintiff for awhile and questioning everything that was his \"evidence\", he caved. We WON lawsuit number one!\nThe very next week we went to court for the second lawsuit, very confidently, with our heads held high, and lo and behold...the same attorney was representing the plaintiff! Again, he caved. So, WE WON AGAIN!! We had been sued TWICE by the same \"infamous\" debt collector and BEAT THEM both times!\nWell, I had sent an email to John Watts of Watts & Herring to let him know about our success and to thank him for all of the wonderful information on his website. He congratulated us and suggested we sue the debt collector back in Federal Court. WOW! I had no idea that was an option!\nEven though we succeeded in our county small claims court twice on our own, I knew we would need the expertise of John Watts for the Federal Lawsuits; there's no way we could do that on our own.\nJohn explained our options and was very attentive with any of our concerns. He represented us in filing TWO Federal Court Cases against the debt collector that had no right to sue us.\nThe process went very smoothly for us. John or the knowledgeable staff at Watts & Herring kept us updated regularly throughout the whole process of any kind of progress being made on the lawsuits, and that put my mind at ease instead of worrying and feeling overwhelmed.\nBoth Federal Court Cases resulted in settlements that we were very pleased with. We could not have been any happier. We truly would like to thank John Watts and the staff of Watts & Herring! We could not have fought those battles alone!\nSo, for any of you reading this, if you're sued by a debt collector, I highly recommend Watts & Herring! Be SURE to answer any lawsuit within the deadline and do not let them win a default judgement! Try not to be overwhelmed, intimidated, or let it stress you out or give you anxiety. Seek the advice of Watts & Herring. They are very friendly and knowledgable folks and can explain your options.

When I first received those papers of being sued and possibly having my wages garnished I felt helpless. That made me depressed and hopeless  I wasn't able to sleep or eat for a couple of days. It seemed unfair that my credit and my income were constantly taking hits and there wasn't any room to breathe or get ahead. Then I started to look for help and come to find that there aren't many lawyers that are willing to help and support you during those times. Fortunately in one of the oddest places I found a person who would teach me a lot that was Google and YouTube. First I was able to find Randi on Google and she enlightened me on many aspects of how these things go then she sent me links to helpful information that led me to John and YouTube. The videos were a breath of fresh air! Finally someone who is interested in educating others as well as putting actions with it. Randi connected us and there wasn't any delay in him reaching out to me and putting the situation in terms that I could understand and making me sure that there are options. Many people don't get the chance to have options when dealing with legal issues and I am glad that there are lawyers out there that will inform as well as help you to stand up to poor collection practices and tactics. I wish that they had a larger platform to reach many others like myself whom otherwise would have to take being mistreated by the collections system. I feel if all lawyers could be like this then people would have less disappointment with the legal system, from start to finish his whole team treated me like a person and kept me informed as to what was going on with my case and made me a part of what was going on. One of the most satisfying things about this whole process was to deal with someone who when they said something they meant and did it.

Prewitt", "time": 1475939366348, "rating": 5.0, "text": "As for how I felt when I was sued, It was very unsettling for both myself and my Husband. I have to admitt that I immediately went into a panicked. Although it was after 6 pm on a Friday evening, I grabbed the telephone and began to call the list of Attorney's I had Googled. My stress level shot up and I thought about taking the pills that my Doctor recomended to calm my nerves a few weeks ago, but I discovered that I had ran out. \u00a0What I did do, was make sure that I had taken my blood pressure meds. for that day. Thereafter, the entire weekend was a blur. \u00a0I could not get my mind from focusing on being sued.\n\nMonday morning rolled around and we figured that perhaps we can try to work this out without legal counsel. I then called the number on the paperwork. The person on the other end (whom I thought represented the TJMAXX Co.)convinced me that I would be out of this mess if I paid them a lump sum or payed a sum monthly for 2 years, and signed a Concent Judgement Form. That was a chance I welcomed if it meant that we would be out from under this pressure. We considered selling my Husband's vehicle to do the settlement but decided against it( his car isn't worth much anyway). Instead, I made the first monthly payment which was money set aside for my 14 year old daughter's Curriculumn for that year. We felt uneasy about the Consent Judgement Form after we did some research on it. My Husband and I placed a stop on the check , but the bank said it had already been processed. We then decided that we will seek legal counsel because clearly, we needed it!\n\nTuesday morning I got a call from Mr. Watts's Secretary, Carolyn. Just speaking with her, \u00a0made me feel less anxious, but I was still not completely settled. The following day My Husband and I spoke with Mr. Watts. He took his time and explained the situation and our options. All of our questions were answered and we ended the call with the feeling of having had a black cloud literally lifted from over our heads! Although we are aware that the process is in its infancy, our anxiety level has greatly diminished!\n\nFast Foward to October 8, 2016:\nAround 8:45 that morning we got an email from Mr. Watts stating that we won our case! We were so grateful to God and Mr.Watts and his Staff! One other thing...during the time we were waiting for the case to settle we did not receive anymore threatening comunication from the Company that we were being sued by. This made waiting for our Victory a great deal easier! We recomend Watts & Herring, LLC to all anyone who ever find themselves in such a terrible place as we did.\n\nSincerly,\nMr. and Mrs. Prewitt", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b91690004ef:0x82b36df943c7bdf8"}

I will aslo never forget the relief I felt the day that I walked into the office of Watts and Herring and spoke with John Watts.  I have never felt so relieved in my life.  The first time I sat down to speak with him, I felt like he was an old friend.  I walked into his office hoping for answers to get the bad guys to stop harassing me.  Not only did Watts and Herring get the bad guys off my back,  all communication from them ceased immediately, AND I ended up suing THEM for violation of the FDCPA .  It really felt great to turn things around on them.  Lately, with all of the scams going around, I have received threatening phone calls from phony debt collectors.  All I had to do was send an email to Watts and Herring and they answered me immediately to assure me that the phone calls were from scammers.  I felt that same feeling of relief as when I spoke with them for the first time.  If I ever have questions, I know that my old friend is only an email away.   So, if you are experiencing similiar issues, I would highly recommend a phone call to Watts and Herring.  They will fight for you; take care of those bad guys; and turn your feeling of fear into a feeling of relief.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b91690004ef:0x82b36df943c7bdf8"}

I told him that he needed to talk with my friend because I didn\u2019t have no clue exactly what all he had going on in another state that had him on probation here. He said he would video call him to find out exactly what his background was to better understand the case. HE NEVER did a Skype call like he told his mother and I he would do. Every time I came into pay my hard earned money being a single mother, trusting he would be this great attorney. He agreed that he would get him home for me so I wanted to pay him off ASAP so he could get to doing what he needed too.  He made 1 phone call to his P.O.  When court came, I couldn\u2019t believe how awful it went! To the fact I literally had to stand up and address the Judge that 2 charges was already dropped so he didn\u2019t even discuss anything with the DEA like a great lawyer should have done. I could have went to jail for reminding the lawyer in front of the whole court that these charges shouldn\u2019t even have showed up because I personally went down to the city to make sure those charges wouldn\u2019t show up. (I Politely stood up addressing the Judge and sat back down because he kept asking about something he should have already been told by a great lawyer) After court, he actually said to his mother that we should just let GA. come get him and feed him!! We\nall know that Gadsden is completely broke right now from our past crooked sheriff is the rumors.  I was in SHOCK!! He told me exactly what I wanted to hear, that he would have him out before the end of the year! His mother went to talk to him yesterday, clearly upset because he didn\u2019t do anything he had said he would do and his mother called me saying he actually said I lied about information with Ga. like it was all my fault because HE is always so busy, he didn\u2019t even have a talk with him about ANYTHING. 1,500$ that I put up, when I could have went with another lawyer who I\u2019ve worked with before and I know he would have did so much more and actually CARE about the situation instead of going in like a deer in headlights. I\u2019m so disappointed that a lawyer I paid really quick because I wanted him happy actually. He blamed me saying a lied when I take great responsibility about how honest I actually am, when really he wasn\u2019t prepared nor negotiated any kind of deal like we actually talked about AT ALL!!! He is so busy apparently he didn\u2019t even care to try and fight for us as his clients. So, when finally telling his sister/secretary the whole story today she actually was smiling while I was telling her literally shaking and crying because I couldn\u2019t believe Vincent blamed me for him not going to talk to his client in jail to find out more on the case to even be prepared.  Then actually even said to my friends mother yesterday that he wouldn\u2019t have took the case?!? Then WHY did he? I could have went to the other lawyer that helped me on my brothers case and Millican would have talked to everyone before court knowing what exactly could be done. I feel like all my hard earned money was just took and then he actually blamed me for himself not even being prepared. Then his sister had the audacity to smile and about laugh at me crying explaining that is why we kept wondering why he NEVER went and spoke with my friend about his Ga. probation that got moved to Alabama because he moved back home. I\u2019ve heard of people getting dunks, (whatever that means) if they\u2019ve never had one and going into community corrections. We had a whole plan for a rehab to pick him up from court. He NEVER mentioned that to the Judge. I\u2019m so upset with how I was treated. I still have NO clue as to what is happening now but I hope no one ever gets treated like I was today. \ud83d\ude2d", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a3ea769e73a2f:0x2ecc6ff1c257ae69"}

Roberts is an African American as myself and I feel enriched and blessed to have a firmly established, very educated without question, a sharp attorney \"who represents justice for all\" but makes me proud for testimony; he truly represents the \"black community, in a quality image\". From one African American male to another, both  having Master Degrees Criminology/ Criminal Justice, I respect you sir. One noble undertaking is his lighting quick response in calling you back. Meeting him you might not be sure if he is an attorney or pastor with the extremely sharp increase look of professionalism, yet with a personification of spirituality (bishop Roberts} lol.  So if I said  dam, I would be safe; it  meaning water dam. lolllllllllll. Should I say Amen, or what's up man. lolllll The office also gives you a feel of , I'm in the right direction. I recognize the fundamental principles, hard work, and the possessed skills to have a Masters Degree, and it is a cemented foundation when dealing with the much more complex criminal justice system. The great ideal person to navigate you through this process is attorney Roberts. Sitting in the office a thought popped in my mind as if I were the rebirth of Einstein   \"Faith is not Faith until there is nothing else to do\". The legendary Johnny Cochran is no longer with us; but I believe attorney Roberts is the link in the positive outcome of faith per Cochran. Roberts is an upstanding individual with a soft landing way of articulating questions and answers. He takes a solidified position, with a mental alertness of impressive response. Hedi, is the  secretary who immediately responds to the main mission of achieved information for the Roberts law firm. She carries clout with me because she is very professional and a matured vital link in centerpiece concerns. She is properly focuses on the positively  best moral image and performance contribution of case. Roberts and Hedi, look like models to me. loll. My respected viewers, across the broad spectrum, this law firm has a genuine care of/for your represented best. I had to say more, being retired Navy, one of my embodiment talents is writing and talking. You feel a comfort zone, like you knew him already. Eric, your wife is so pretty in the wedding pictures, and you two compliment, and I'm sure complete each other with guiding principles of love, respect, and equally yoked intelligence. I did not know you were Hollywood in Jet magazine.  I wanted to say we played football together and you was the backup quarterback to me. lollllllllllx 100. Hedi look sooo sexy in that dress in web site pictures.  Dammm she does, Beyonc\u00e9 level sexy. Eric, I am proud of you and firm, and if I can do anything to help I will. Put up more awards and Hedi in those dresses. lollllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll.  I had to zoom in on pictures.   In the criminal justice field a match in identification is essential.  Spinning around in the computer chair, I  jumped up sayings, that's them. lolllllllllllll. Loyal. This is fun, I add more each time I visit this page. I need to stop, you have to meet him to understand. He talk really mellow, mild,  soothing. Example, If your hand shake to the point you can make a milk shake,  you might feel like you can be a dentist after talking with him.\n\"C\"", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4e1ecd9848db:0x52aee1da03742c99"}

When I was faced with mine in 2019, I was referred to Dani Bone through a coworker and friend that I trusted. I initially hired Dani because I heard he was the very best and he would fight for me. I called and even though they were extremely busy, they saw me right away. After hearing my situation, Dani was honest with me and said, \"You need Sam. \" My case was very complicated having both personal and business issues, assets and properties to divide, custody and other court issues . Sam took it as a challenge. He stayed with me and guided me through the whole divorce process. It was not easy, it was extremely tough but Sam knew how to handle every situation that came up. When going through a 2 yr battle, you need to know and  feel confident that your attorney has your back and has your best interest at heart. I emotionally fell apart many times and he helped me to learn to stand up for myself and it made me a stronger person through this process. All I wanted was what was fair- he got me exactly what I asked for! I was extremly pleased with services of Sam, Dani and their dedicated and caring staff. Amanda, Fredrick and Osha were just wonderful to work with. The whole staff made me feel comfortable and at ease through a very uncomfortable life circumstance.  While the other party had 5 attorneys through the process , I had one.  I only needed the one team- I had The Best with Sam & Dani Bone. Sam was honest, upfront, bold and encouraging. He never had to be ugly or raise his voice in court or trial and never once belittled anyone. I recall him saying, \"It doesn't have to be ugly\". Being a Christian, a professional, a self employed woman, a Realtor and a mother of 2, this was imperative to me. Sam treated both parties with total RESPECT always . That was very important to me.  I did my part and provided the true facts, evidence and proof- he did his part and presented my case with true professionalism , Integrity and no one was disrespected in the process. I would \ud83d\udcaf percent recommend Sam & Dani Bone if you want to be represented by someone who will always have your back and is not afraid to fight for your best interest.

Sam will be honest about your case, talk with you about the possibilities, and develop a plan to protect your best interests. Phone calls/emails are answered promptly and you are made aware of appointments and court actions. Even though my case was regular family law issues, it was treated as a priority.\n\nWhen emotions run high and people play dirty, you need an attorney that will keep you focused. It was nothing short of a blessing to have Sam\u2019s counsel during this time. Sam will listen and use what will benefit your case most, helping you to make the best decisions.\n\nThrough my experience, I learned that Sam is wise beyond his years and holds a unique combination of qualities that make him an excellent attorney. He is a younger lawyer in comparison to many of the veterans in the area, but his expertise speaks through shrewd discernment, both in and outside the courtroom.\n\nIn retrospect, I know that employing a professional, well-versed attorney who gave honest legal advice was a valuable asset to me.

His extensive background in problem solving, his communication skills, his leadership style, and being remarkably emotionally intelligent, sets him apart from most, and I can confidently say from all other lawyers with respect to practice of law, client relationship development and communication, and negotiation talent. He brings a unique enthusiasm to each engagement balanced with a structured, plan-oriented approach that sets a foundation for miraculous outcome. Jamie Moncus is a committed and devoted lawyer. He also possess an affable personality which puts his clients, his opponents, his team at ease in working with him even on the most complicates cases.\nI very strongly recommend Hare, Wynn, Newell & Newton of Birmingham and Attorney Jamie Moncus to anyone, including my own family members, my professional colleagues, and my friends, who may need an effective, high energy, compassionate, graceful law firm to take on any case, large or small. They are highly professional with a natural ability to develop best strategies, and reaching out to all to solve the most difficult problems with grace and integrity. They are and remain to be what we the people need: A stellar law firm with a high moral and ethical standard, a real wonderful American, a dispensable asset to our community and our country.\n\nThank you.\nGodspeeds Attorney James R.

As the trustee to one estate, executor to another, and administrator & realtor for the other estate, I have had to rely heavily on Dee's continued counsel and guidance, which has been impeccable. Staying on top of complex matters, while grieving the loss of family members, can get tricky and overwhelming at times, and important documents can be missed. But with Dee's wonderful paralegal, Debbie, always on top of everything, I never worry that I will make a mistake that will injure someone. Debbie calls and texts me when I need to sign documents or pay expenses, and she keeps me and the process up-to-date and always moving forward to closure. These two women have guided and walked our family through the most complex time of our lives, and I recommend them to everyone I know who needs a really sharp estate attorney with a smart, on-the-ball paralegal. I must add that if there is a time you need an attorney to fight for you, if you don't choose these ladies, just pray that the entity you need protection from hasn't chosen them.  As nice as they are, when it comes to protecting their clients, they don't play.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0e0edc682359:0x33450141cdb7c545"}

Well, they were not lying completely however they lead her to believe they were filing the suit only on her behalf. When, in actuality it was an ultra-massive tort suit. None of this is what really upsets me, what upsets me is that from day one they have lead her believe that she is going to receive a minimum of $2,000,000. I have done several hours of research getting the background on the lawsuits filed for the same reason she filed hers. First off I have not even seen the name Cory Watson Attorneys mentioned in any of the reports. Secondly there appears to be over 10,000 people file suite for the same exact reason, against the same exact company, with several law firms. The litigation for this particular devise has been going on for many years. And, it would appear by all indications she will probably never be paid one penny. To this day, they never contact her, if she contacts them they tell her they expect some kind of payout soon, and they are still insisting that it will be $2,000,000+ Why would they cntinue to lie to her?

I felt like my life was over. The shame of not being able to provide for my family was crippling. I began to look into how my family would be provided for if I passed. It was bad.\n\nFrom the onset Renee was very compassionate and beyond helpful, as was her entire staff. Anytime I had a question it was answered quickly. She explained the process to me, was honest about the time it would take, and the difficulties of my case because of my age.\n\nLooking back, I think it was her hope and encouragement that sustained me, because I had none of my own.\n\nI was awarded Full Disability, and my back pay was set six entire months before I thought it would be. I don't know how that happened, but I am grateful to Ms. Thiry for making it so.\n\nI have my life back now and, with whatever time I have left I can concentrate on making quality memories with my children. That would not be the case if not for Ms. Thiry's considerable attention to my claim and the dedication of her staff.\n\nI consider her a family friend now and highly recommend her.

They actually reach out to me that Sunday morning. I had a face to face meeting with Mr. Richard Thiry the following Monday. Mr. Richard went above and beyond my expectations. He was very passionate about his clients and it shows in his work and spirit. The legal process was easy and stress free, I was very informed throughout the whole process by Mr. Richard and his team, and I felt at ease asking any questions I had. Richard Thiry was very diligent and got me a settlement quickly. Fast forwarding on June 14,2018 I was again involved in another car accident on the job after only been employed 2 days. I immediately reach out to THIRY & CADDELL, LLP. Mr. Richard no longer practice law because he had retired but his daughter Renee Thiry also is a lawyer there.  First, I'd like to say THANK YOU to Renee Thiry and the staff. They are very professional, personable and very helpful team.  Renee always keeps her word and came through for me when I needed her most. I hired Renee for my workers comp and personal injury suit.  Renee always made me feel that she had things under control and was on top of the case. My job terminate me after 7 months because of permeant injury due to the car accident. She help me get my unemployment to help me out until my case was settle. As a single mom with two kids it help out A LOT. My workers comp case has now been settled and i am so relieved and will be forever grateful. I know that she is also going to do a great job with my personal injury case as well. I honestly don't know what I would do without them. If you want the best then you definitely want to hire Renee Thiry.  I cannot thank her enough for all she is doing for me.

However, I looked it up and the alleged offense for which I was arrested CANNOT be expunged under Alabama law, though I plan to litigate that issue when the time is right.

There are other lawyers who would give you advice without suing outside of legal aid.\nHowever, he did refer me to legal aid, after the fact I suggested legal aid because it's FREE to receive legal advice. That was by far the best advice he could give me being that Legal aid has helped and guided me through cases before which led me to winning cases on my own, or cases being dropped. If you do not receive the advice you need with any law group(s) I would suggest Legal Aid. Legal Aid response is much quicker. Also, legal aid will listen.

He said that he could handle the case; however, it would become more expensive because that area is approximately 4 hours from him. In my opinion, most people wouldn't even care about that. They would only care about running the bill up on you. In addition to that, he even found and referred me to an attorney in that area that could assist me.\n\nI certainly appreciate his honesty and his assistance.

While my charges were from 2017, I was not arrested until 2019 because I was sent to the hospital on the date of the offense instead of jail and diagnosed with Sudden Traumatic Shock exasperated by alcohol.  Being arrested was completely out of the norm for me.  I did not know where to begin, what to expect, and was consistently imagining the worst possible outcomes and scenarios.  Based off my charges, my bail agent highly recommended that I contact Mr. Crumbly for counsel.  I had an initial meeting with Mr. Crumbly within a week from the first time I contacted him.  The initial meeting did not take longer then an hour and during that time Mr. Crumbly was able to explain all my available options to include representation options, payment options, court expectations, and expected timelines.  Perhaps the most beneficial thing Mr. Crumbly discussed in the initial meeting was the overall stress of the situation.  He told me that it was human nature to imagine the worst possible outcomes and to not worry about that as it was him and his teams job to make sure those outcomes don\u2019t happen.  He was absolutely right and ,during the entire course of my case, I constantly imagined the worst possible scenarios; however, I always made myself think back to that initial conversation with Mr. Crumbly and remembered that is why he is there.  After that initial meeting, Mr. Crumbly and his team handled everything for 6 months up until my court date with the Judge.  Before I even had to go before the Judge, Mr. Crumbly had secured a deal with the DA for me to enter the Pre-Trial Intervention Program (PTIP) and have charges dropped following the completion of the program.  I was more than happy to enter PTIP as it took all uncertainty and stress off the table and I was able to hold everything going forward in my own hands.

In addition, I was uninformed of all the specific issues pertaining to Alabama State Law as they apply to a DUI charge especially, with respect to possible fines, imprisonment, unknown future adverse impacts, or establishment of an unfavorable permanent criminal history. The level of stress in my daily life was extremely high, to say the least, due to this situation and these concerns.\n\nI was referred to the Law Office(s) of Russell W. Crumbley to try and sort all these issues out. Russell put me immediately at ease and clarified for me, in a no-nonsense way, what needed to be done to effectively address the DUI charge against me.

I am here for either, or both, of you. I will make sure your husband is heard. I will make sure he knows he is heard. I don't know if he has an issue we can help him with but, if we can't, I will make sure he understands that and I will make sure he understands why. If we can't help but I know someone who can I will give him a name and number of that lawyer. I am here to help - not frustrate. Thank you for your time. ~ Russell Crumbley"}, "gmap_id": "0x886214b5eb6aa54b:0x60d777fdf93ee41a"}

When I explained I was busy I was asked if I would speak with him over the phone. I agreed and I was transfered to Mr. Crumbley.  After listening to me explain my why I left the review and my account of my interactions with Mr. Matt Wisda, Mr. Crumbley asked me several questions.\n1. Would I consider removing my review?\n2. Would I consider moving it to Mr. Wisda\u2019s webpage?\n3. If he (Crumbley) were to fire Mr. Wisda would I then delete my review! I said no.\n4. Was there ANYTHING he (Crumbley) could say or do that would result in me removing the review? To which I responded \u201cNot ethically\u201d, because I felt he was trying to \u201clead me\u201d into asking for a monetary resolution.\n\nDuring our discussion Mr. Crumbley stated he was not at all happy about Mr. Wisda\u2019s conduct. And that he was considering actions (including termination).  He asked once more if there was anything he could do To get me to retract the review against \u201cCrumbley, Blackwell, & Wisda Lawfirm\u201d.  I explained to him that when I researched Divorce Attorneys/Firms I based my decision in part on the reviews of his Firms website and information regarding the lawyers and therefore would not consider removing the review. We said goodbye and I hung up.\n\nI spent that day wondering if he would call again. I just knew \u201cIT\u201d wasn\u2019t over.\nSo this evening I checked on my review out of curiosity...and wouldn\u2019t you know it there is this long drawn out explanation that it was I who was misinformed etc.  Never once mentioning any unethical behavior on behalf of Mr. Wisda!\nI want to SHOUT from the highest rooftops what a sleazy slimeball you are! Shall I post more? Shall I post information Mr. Wisda freely disclosed to me about a clearly VERY SENSITIVE divorce and custody battle where the children involved had been...!\nYou disgust me!\n\nI retained Matt Wisda to represent me for my divorce.  I feel he acted unethically.\nI contacted his office after receiving an invoice for services that were not rendered. When I followed up with an appointment a few days later not only did he begin by talking about another case he had been working on (this was the 2nd time he mentioned details of this other party's case!) but he also presented me with an official Settlement Agreement\" that clearly stated me and my spouse had both agreed to - WHICH NEITHER OF US HAD!\n\nWe never went through discovery at all! No mediation - nothing!\nThe entire document looked copy and pasted, and all of the assets and then some were to be awarded to me!\n\nMr. Wisda was trying to fool me into thinking he had been hard at work on my case and that I was entitled to everything when in fact he hadn't done anything. Additionally It was never my intention to try take my husband to the proverbial cleaners. I just wanted a fair settlement.\n\nI didn't even look at the \"Settlement Agreement\" he'd drawn up while at his office. I had already decided to sever our business agreement and told him so.  I asked when I could pick up my remaining retainer and he said it would be about a week.\n\nWhen I went to pick up the monies, enclosed with my check was an invoice of almost $700 for the bogus \"Settlement Agreement\" that had been drawn up without consultation or discovery.  Coincidentally the new invoice showed just one line item for the preparing of said agreement which was dated after the phone call I mentioned above.\n\nI immediately drew up a letter refusing to pay and insisting I be refunded.  Additionally in the letter I called him out for trying to fool me and get paid for it. I emailed this letter and received a response early the next morning stating they would immediately refund the that money, which they did.\n\nI am leaving this review to make others aware.  In our consultation meeting he told me his practice \"is like a game to me.\"  And because  conducting his business in such a way, I feel, is an abuse of his power as an attorney and is extremely unethical.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1528493792927, "text": "We deeply regret that your experience with our office did not meet your expectation. We work very hard to not let that happen. Having said that, you say that you received a \u201csettlement agreement\u201d that indicated you and your husband had agreed to the settlement terms when, in fact, you had not agreed. You also say that this agreement was put together without doing any \u201cdiscovery\u201d or any \u201cmediation\u201d. You initially hired Mr. Wisda to assist you in negotiating an uncontested divorce with your husband\u2019s lawyer. In fact, you produced, for us, a \u201csettlement agreement\u201d created by your husband\u2019s lawyer when you hired Mr. Wisda. That settlement agreement had already been prepared absent any \u201cdiscovery\u201d or attempt to \u201cmediate\u201d. It was clearly the intentions of both parties (and their lawyers) to settle this matter, if possible, without costly litigation. This type divorce typically does not involve \u201cdiscovery\u201d (in the traditional sense) and most certainly doesn\u2019t involve \u201cmediation\u201d. In these type matters we simply go with settlement negotiations to the extent we are able, which necessarily includes \u201csettlement proposals\u201d. Also, in this type situation, both parties tend to agree that they know what the assets are and their values are not in dispute.\n\nThe \u201csettlement agreement\u201d your husband\u2019s attorney prepared, and gave you, was just like the one Mr. Wisda gave you. In reviewing your husband\u2019s proposal it is noted that it also includes language stating that the two of you \u201cacknowledged and agreed\u201d to things that you had not already agreed upon. In other words, both lawyers settlement agreements included the very same language in that regard. In fact, most paragraphs in all settlement agreements are full of language such as \u201cthe parties acknowledge and agree \u2026\u201d. This language is included to satisfy legal requirements and applies to you ONLY AFTER you have actually read it, agreed to it and signed it. It is not intended to mean that you have already seen it and agreed to it. And, it is NEVER INTENDED to deceive. Your attorney, Matt Wisda, did exactly what your husband\u2019s lawyer did with respect to that language.\n\nAs far as the \u201cattempt to fool you\u201d is concerned: you received an itemized statement of the charges. You received two billing statements. The second of those two seems to be where you objected. That statement involves the \u201csettlement agreement\u201d. You were dissatisfied with that charge and objected to that bill and, although you had NOT notified him of your desire to terminate him until after that work was done, we refunded every penny to you of that part of the bill. And your objection, as much as any we can tell, is founded on your belief that it included the \u201cbogus\u201d settlement language indicating that you and your husband had agreed to the terms that you had not agreed to.\n\nWe strive to handle cases the way our clients direct us. And, while the services you received were not satisfactory to you, Mr. Wisda DID NOT bill you for services not rendered. His conduct was not unethical. His ability to communicate effectively with you, I will agree, must have missed the mark. For example, we are not sure how, exactly, you did not understand that the \u201cacknowledged and agreed\u201d language in the settlement agreement did not mean you had both already agreed to that agreement. That was no more the intent of what Mr. Wisda provided you than it was the intent of what your husband\u2019s attorney provided him. It was merely two lawyers doing their jobs and adding the language that was going to be necessary at some point, in advance. Perhaps THAT is why it looked copied and pasted.\n\nWe would encourage ANYONE who is dissatisfied in ANY way, with ANYONE in our office, to meet with any of us. WE ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE to meet with that person and do everything we can to alleviate their concern and fight for your cause. Your case matters to us. And, YOU matter to us. Best wishes moving forward during this trying time.\n\n~ Russell Crumbley & Matt Wisda"}, "gmap_id": "0x886214b5eb6aa54b:0x60d777fdf93ee41a"}

Mr. Crumbley is the most exceptional, top notch attorney in the area and will exceed your expectations each and every time under his representation. He has represented me on 4 separate cases (3 misdemeanor and 1 felony) and has impressed me more and more each time with his results with all 4 of the cases being dismissed with NOT GUILTY verdicts when I was very GUILTY as a matter of fact. As soon as he walks in the courtroom you should know that you will be taken care of. This mans representation is like the results of having the combination of Peyton Manning in the regular season and Tom Brady in the playoffs which in other words is about as good as is gets when in comes to criminal defense representation. I honestly do not have enough words or ways that I can use to describe how high level of an attorney he is and worth every dollar of the premium cost to afford him to represent you because you get what you pay for so you won\u2019t be disappointed no matter how guilty you are of your charges. Don\u2019t hesitate to call his office as they are more than happy to assist you with whatever questions or concerns you may have in regards to your case. Mr. Crumbley is hands down the best attorney in our area for any criminal matters. Do yourself a favor and make sure you hire him to take care of yourself because I\u2019d honestly be hesitant to have anybody else to represent me in a potential criminal defense situation besides Mr. Crumbley. To Teles Walker, you won\u2019t find a better attorney or receive a better result than having Mr. Crumbley by your side and am sure you received a contract as Mr. Crumbley is always sure to provide one so everyone out there should disregard any negative reviews because those folks are more than likely either trolls or generally unhappy with their own lives and you can tell the literacy of the individual by reading their review from a grammatical standpoint. To the rest of the folks out there, be sure to disregard the ignorant individuals reviews as that is a false representation of Mr. Crumbleys services. As GUILTY as any individual may be, I can guarantee that you will receive the best possible legal result with Mr. Crumbley by your side and I say that with no doubt in mind.

This  event started in 2020 and finally resolved in spring of 2021.    The response from the members on his team has been pathetic at best.  Not returning phone calls or emails so many times.  I would have to follow up several times to make sure what I had requested was being done on various issues.   We have been told incorrect information during probate causing us a lot of extra work when it wasn't required.   Then at closing, I had to point out several items that were not correct and even the fee we were told to pay wasn't correct.  Actually, the fee was short from what was discussed and we corrected saving them a loss.   The lawyer did not seem to know the details of the closing when we pointed out discrepancies and had to go ask his staff.   The front office lady was very sweet and helpful.  However, the remaining staff we dealt with was unorganized and unprofessional.   For the amount we paid,  we feel we did not receive good service as the process and experience was difficult and frustrating throughout.   Then we still have one outstanding matter we asked for them to provide legal documents on and  over a month has passed with no communication from the office.   I have followed up 3 times and still no response.     I thought a small town attorney office would have been a very good experience to work with, but I was wrong.   I would not recommend.

What started out as a simple consultation to learn what my rights would be if divorce became real would ultimately become a saving grace.\n\nIf I had to describe Mr. Matthews I would say he is a very straight shooter that will not try to sell you \"hopes and dreams\" or \"blow smoke\" just to get money out of you. He will definitely let you know where you stand and how things are, and believe me sometimes that is definitely what you need even if you may not want to hear it.\n\nAnother thing about Mr. Matthews I can say is that he has the experience and know how to go about your case. He knows the exact moment and places to strike to when it matters the most. In my own situation, Mr. Matthews delivered such an amazing defense in an emergency hearing that at that exact moment after nearly a year of feeling beaten, battered, bruised and so tired that I was about ready to give up. He managed to unravel my now ex-wife's entire testimony with just a single question. Mr. Matthews did such a good job that after a few follow up questions the judge stopped the hearing, and I didn't even have to get on the stand to defend myself.\n\nThen a few weeks later Mediation came around, and the tone suddenly shifted from everything my ex-wife wanted to pretty much everything I wanted. I have to thank Mr. Matthews so much because thanks to him and his amazing defense I now have my name cleared, and I can be the father to my children that I always wanted to be.\n\nI also want to extend a thank you to Mr. Matthews team. You will not find a more friendly and knowledgeable staff that is prompt with informing Mr. Matthews of your concerns and questions, and getting that information back to you.\n\nSo if what your looking for is an hometown attorney that won't steer you wrong, won't try to sell you a line, and give you a true blue unquestionable defense then  look no further than Mr. William Matthews.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88628b6820dacf57:0x2d7964e50605b3ad"}

I am sure He handles cases involving much more money than my case, yet his helpfulness, guidance & availability to me in the weeks following my accident were stellar. 1st, I would not have gotten a car rental from the insurance company of the driver that caused my accident after mine was totaled without Dean's help/guidance. 2nd,  I texted his personal cell phone on a Saturday night after arriving at home to a high anxiety causing letter from the insurance company of the person that caused my accident.  Dean replied within 5 minutes, and with great interest in my inquiry! Asking questions i hadn't thought of in order to fully understand my status & give the most accurate reply. I was put very much at ease. 3rd, I stopped into Dean's office the 1st time unannounced by text, phone or email.  I had multiple questions ranging from money to get my stitches removed to whether I needed to obtain a police report and wanted only to speak to the staff member in charge of my case.  Before I could finish saying my name to the receptionist, Dean exited his office and greeted me. And although he had a meeting in 20 minutes & i offered to just ask a staff member, he wouldn't leave until all of my 5 or 6 questions were personally answered.  4th, Attorney Derek Siebert, in charge of my case, did a phenomenal job for me.  He contacted me multiple times to explain my options & offer opinion if I desired. He was truly in my corner for me.  Lastly, but very very impressive to me, every member of Dean's staff i had any interaction with treated me with great courtesy & with professionalism.  I felt very & truly cared for as a client.  I wouldn't recommend any one else.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fd3ebe1d6ff:0x7356cbf1e4e2d598"}

Mr. Smith knows the family law concerning divorce matters and can go about this process in a calm and respectful manner to everyone that's involved yet get his point across in the best interest of his client. If you are needing a divorce lawyer that will be looking out for you - his client I highly recommend Mr. Smith and his staff.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1551401114549, "text": "Joyce, thank you very much for the wonderful review.

False advertisement Really!! My true story: My now ex husband and I went through a chaotic divorce and his lawyer was Mr. McGhee. My experience is based on what I dealt with in phone and email conversations as well as what was told to me by my ex husband and McGhee's  Secretary and how the divorce was handled. First Mr. Mcghee, does not like to speak to people that are \"Pro Se\" (representing yourself) so even though you worked for over 10 years in the law field as a paralegal and you can easily save your money by doing the settlement and divorce yourself, Shawn McGhee will make sure to give you a hard time. Not only does he lie and says there is a conflict of interest, which is why he won't speak to you which by the way, THAT IS NOT TRUE, but he will not answer any of the calls. For whatever reason he was not able to speak to me which to me seems very unprofessional, he would often have his secretary let me know what was needed for the divorce to be settled. I think because I do know what I needed to do legally, and trust me lawyers hate people that have worked in law fields you cant pull a sheet over legal assistants or paralegals eyes easily, we know all the tricks.  Now his secretary had given me some information that had holes in what she said that included the discovery process and hearings as well as the laws. Because of the communication between me and her and then what she told my ex husband of what I said, which were twisted, this made the divorce messy and long . And I believe the reason was for trial which is very expensive, but lawyers love expensive. Now one thing which is grounds for a grievance is that Mr. McGhee gave advice on the amount of payments for child support that should be paid which is unethical and should only be done by a referee. Mr. Mcghee, has no compassion for children as he informs his clients that they don't need to be responsible parents and pay for the kids until a judge says so, which to me makes me wonder about his character. Being out of state I was not able to do much, and my ex did not even live in Alabama as law requires in order to file but as usual somehow McGhee got around that. I have worked for law firms since I was 16 years old I could never work for someone that does things that are unethical, shady and down right wrong  he has no moral character, and I would be scared if my papers would be questioned by a judge with the amount of lies that my ex and his lawyer gave to me.  Please look at other Law firms that will look at your case and care enough to not control your decisions and won't run up your bill for no reason. Me and my ex husband  managed to settle together without the hearsay talk of his lawyer. The issue I have is there are amazing lawyers out there and Mr. Mcghee is the reason that lawyers have such a bad reputation. Make sure you chose a lawyer that will care about your interests and especially the kids, don't let the kids get lost in the divorce they are the most important thing, don't let the lawyer stress you or the other party or you will cause more harm and extend something that is not good for anyone. And make sure to hold your ground. Research on your lawyer don't chose someone because they are cheap eventually they will show you why they are cheap, Mr. Mcghee was affordable for my ex-husband until hearings and trial came around and then up goes his hourly.

Involved in a case that had never been before the Alabama Courts, we had no idea if we should fight or roll over and (pay)dead.  I am far from being a quitter but sometimes you feel that there is nothing or no one that can help you and the ones you care for. Sometimes it seems that the Justice system is anything but just. This is exactly how we felt all the way up to our final hearing. We new we were going to need an intelligent and thorough attorney. We researched and asked people who we should use and was referred to Mark. We went and talked with him and he took our case, but told us he couldn't promise anything. He told us that he would do the best he could, and that was all we could ask for. We just wanted what was fair and felt it was worth the fight. After trying to go to court without an attorney and seeing how that was going we just knew we had to have representation. Our finances were extremely tight and we worried that it might just all be for naught. It seemed the law just didn't have anything to protect us. Mark Gober searched and searched and found cases in several other states that supported our side, and gave us some hope. Still we were concerned that it could go either way. We even were concerned that the truth was not going to come out because everyone kept saying that it was all irrelevant. Even with all of the negative things we were hearing  we stuck it out and kept fighting because we felt that it mattered. We wanted our case to maybe help someone else in the future. Mark surpassed anything that we could have expected when we got in the courtroom for our final hearing. We were amazed by how thorough he was without even having to bring every detail into it (which could have taken a lot more time and cost us a whole lot more money). I could not believe it when he actually got them to admit things on the stand that showed exactly what was going on. Justice was truly done as much as it could possibly be thanks to Mark. This was a case for me of right vs. wrong and the good won out. Thank you so much for all that you have done for our family.
