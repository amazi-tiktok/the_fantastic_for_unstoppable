Terrible selection and was warned by a co-worker to research frames before hand. Went online to their website to see their selection and answered what seemed like a 50 question questionnaire which only resulted in a list of things I should discuss with the optometrist, not inventory to choose from! So frustrating and annoying off the bat. Upon arriving Family Vision said they could order frames I found online so long as it was through a mfg. that they dealt with, which was two different companies, since their selection was so horrific. So While my eyes were dialating I struggled on my phone to research the two Mfg's websites trying to find something I liked in the half hour I was there, while going legally blind from the dialation fluid...not ideal. My employer said they would cover $60 for frames so with that in mind I found a pair of frames that met those parameters and when I told the lady at the front desk which frames I wanted, she called the lab an confirmed that they carried them which I appreciated until she told me that they charged $105 for the $60 frames that I had found online meaning I would have to pay $45 out of pocket unnecessarily. I showed her the price from the mfg. online, on my phone, to which she replied \"everybody's got to make a profit\" ...which I understand but a 75%!!! Get the heck out of town. This place is a doc in a box, feels like a sham and when it comes to the pricing...they are a total con unless you want to walk out with some frames that look like something your great grandpa would wear in a machine shop back in the 1940's or in other words useless frames...the place just has a dark depressing vibe and stack of outdated wrinkled germy magazines. Just save yourself the trouble don't bother and run the other way. And whomever left the raving comments about this place are obviously employees trying to get the ratings up.

After wearing my \"trial pair\" way past their use date, I was told about the contacts being on backorder (AGAIN). I mentioned that it was odd that each year I had a different brand, different type, etc., yet ALL of them were on backorder approximately 2+ mos. I didn't really get an answer other than, \"that's just how it is.\" They're nice enough on the phone but there's something wrong. I'm tired of having to pay \"up front\" to not get what i really need & have been promised. I feel like I've been put on ignore & my calls aren't returned until i pick up the phone  & call them again 7-14 days later. The \"oh yeah, I'll call you right back,\" has never happened. Not once. More than twice just makes it an \"untruth,\" cuz at this point you KNOW you're not going to  call back. So if sounding nice to gets me off of your phone, then that's what happens.

Well 2 weeks later I got the 150.00 they owned me FOR 2 YEARS WITH OUT INTEREST.  and its been about 6 weeks and still the 170.00 has not ben sent to me. DON'T GO TO THESES PEOPLE THEY WILL TAKE YOU MONEY. AND NOT GIVE IT BACK.  I'VE CALLED THEM EVERY 2 WEEKS AND STILL NO MONEY. I'VE NEVER HAD A DR. KEEP OVER PAYMENT.  FOR 2 YEARS. IF I OVER PAY. THE DR. WILL SEND IT AT THE END OF THE YEAR. WHEN THEY COLSE THE BOOKS FOR THE YEAR. SO U CAN'T TRUST THESE PEOPLE.  THE LADY CONTACTED ME AND TOLD ME THE HAD MONEY AND THEY WOULD SEND IT BACK WHEN THEY GOT AROUND TO IT .WOULD DON'T GIVE A DATE. ... SHE WAS VERY RUDE I TOLD HER I WOULD PUT IT ON THE POST IT .

Ashley compared the two current promotions to find me the very best price.  Then, several days later, I received a call that my glasses had arrived, but Eyecare Associates had rejected them after inspection and had ordered a new fabrication.  Wow!  Just a few days after that, I went to pick up my new remakes.  I was not satisfied with the field of vision they offered, and Ashley showed me the three types of lenses available.   I selected a set with a broader field of vision and, in spite of the $80 increase each of the three sets would entail, placed my order.  The next day, Ashley called to tell me she had discussed my case with the manager, and they had decided to wave all further fees, so these three new pairs would be free!   Double-wow!   I was impressed and, frankly, touched by the empathy, attention, personal concern, and expert service I received from Eyecare Associates.    EA went out of their way and beyond all my expectations to insure a fair and positive experience for me, and I simply cannot recommend them enough!

I normally see either Dr. Harris or Dr. Jackson. On this visit I was seen by Doctor Fredrick Jackson and it was a truly amazing experience. Everyone was extremely courteous and friendly. I was really impressed with Dr. Jackson on this occasion. He took his time explaining everything he was doing and why he was doing it. His explanations and genuine concern went a long way in putting my fears to rest. He not only took an interest in my eye health, but he was also very forthcoming with sharing some possible solutions to other areas of my overall health that could potentially affect my eye health. He offered some possible solutions to help with bouts of vertigo I have been experiencing for a couple of years now. He suggested some things that I could try to help to minimize the severity of the migraine headaches that I have been suffering for more than thirty years. No one else had ever made the suggestions to me that he did. I can't wait to put them into practice to see if they will help even the tiniest little bit. Thanks, Dr. Jackson, for one of the most enjoyable appointments I have ever had. And trust me, I will make sure that you are highly recommended to everyone that I know who needs a good optometrist. Keep up the good work.\n\nHad my yearly exam on February 4, 2015 and must say that it was a very interesting experience. Even though the wait time was a few minutes past my appointment time, I clearly understand why. The doctors spend as much time as needed with each patient and I realize that I will get the same type of treatment when it is my turn. Also, Dr. Harris' staff are extremely kind, considerate, and compassionate. I just love Dr. Harris to death (no offense Dr. Jackson, I love you, too). Even though he informed me that I have cataracts, he took the time to explain all of my options and shared his experiences with his father's surgery. I left the office feeling very good and felt that Dr. Harris had provided me with all the information that I needed to make a decision. Once I made the decision, he even scheduled an appointment for me--talk about the personal touch approach. I would highly recommend Primary Eyecare Associates to anyone. As a matter of fact, my entire family uses Primary Eyecare Associates. So, if you are looking for a good eye care center and optometrist, give them a call, THEY ARE THE BEST I have ever used.

I arrived at my destination only to discover I'd made a terrible mistake and had forgotten my contacts.  When I called the office, I had my Rx in-hand within 4 minutes.  When I contacted the closest eye care facility, I was told they didn't have my brand of contacts on-hand & asked if I could possibly get my doc to authorize a diff brand.  When I called back to Madison Eye Care Center, Delana went above and beyond and offered to call the eye care facility at the beach for me to figure out a solution.  Once she'd done so, she called me back to let me know what to expect since these lenses may feel a bit different that my usuals.  I had contacts in-hand within 20 minutes of calling Madison Eye Care Center & Delana basically saved my vacation!  :) Just cannot recommend this practice enough!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626f7b8da2a5c3:0xe1143c7fd91c9a0b"}

The view from our  previous lenses could focus on an entire page. We discovered that  the old prescription used Varilux lenses and Advanced Eyecare orders Kodak lenses. My spouse and I both considered the Kodak progressive lens to be unacceptable. Advanced Eyecare then special ordered Varilux lens to satisfy us. Thanks for that, our vision is back to normal, but the default Kodak lenses are lower quality lens in our opinion.\n2)\tThe decorative diamond on one frame fell out after a few weeks. Advanced Eyecare would replace the entire frame, but we would have no future warranty on the glasses. I was called a \u201cdifficult customer\u201d when I objected to the loss of warranty due to a workmanship issue with the frame. I left without fixing the frame and they asked which Optometrist they should send our records to.\n3)\tThe lenses in another plastic frame are loose.

Well let's just say I was not happy. First time trying the new frames on they were so big they did not fit at all. The first lady adjusted them but they were still falling off my face. Then she ask another lady to help while she is adjusting them for the second time I asked why are they so big and not fitting like the previous frame (demo) I tried on. She tells me that my actual frames are bigger because the thickness of my lenses and that demo frames will fit differently. I have never heard of that or had that issue anywhere else. Everytime I tried on frames I liked and was fitted they have always fit fine with little to no adjustments. After about 5-6 times adjusting my glasses they somewhat fitted ok. The piece behind my ear is adjusted so far inward on both sides that the top of my ear sticks out and the frame does not fit properly on my face or behind my ears. She then tells me that I will have to come back and get them adjusted again because overtime taking them off and on they will adjust back to there normal size. I was not told this when I was making my transaction nor have I ever experienced this elsewhere. I will not be coming back. Worst experience ever.

When I tried on the contacts I was given one of each color I wanted to try. Which does not make sense. Then I asked about the glasses I chose. I was told I only paid for the exams! I supposedly paid to be in the eye care club.  So I ended up paying for one pair of glasses and a 6 months of contacts. The total cost was $338. I felt like I was misled and overpaid. The office took over two weeks for the glasses and contacts. I had to call to find out if the glasses and contacts were in! Unorganized and unprofessional. Especially since I didn't have insurance and paid straight out of pocket. Seems like I would of had a pleasant experience. I forgot to mention my last prescription in my last pair of glasses is stronger then the new ones. So I continue to wear the old glasses. They can keep the eye care club. I won't use it.

I had picked out the frames I wanted.\n\nThey were all so super nice & helpful to my dad. They took proper time with his insurance, fitting, asking him all kinds of questions about what he wanted & everything.\n\nWhen we came back the next day, the lady didn't ask for my insurance, rushed through me & she didn't ask me any of the kinds of questions she asked my dad, like did I want tinted lens or anything else. When I asked how she knew what to charge me when she didn't even bother to see what insurance I had or what discounts I may be eligible for, she said it was because I said yesterday that I did not have insurance. That is a total lie & doesn't make any sense on so many levels. I had to wait a while on my dad the day before, so why not just go ahead & get glasses while I'm waiting if insurance was the only issue? When you apply, doesn't it take a while to kick in? If I didn't have it the day before, then I probably wouldn't have had it the day after either.\n\nShe just wanted to scam me for some reason. I agree with some of these other reviews that said these people are scammers. It's like they make up their mind about you right after you walk in the door. They must have liked my dad, but decided to try to scam me.\n\nI work for the federal government just like my dad. I have good insurance just like he does, but they decided to treat me like either a loser who still lives at home with their parents even though I am 42 or a total homeless bum. Well, if that's the case, then how could I have paid for my glasses? I guess my dad would have because in their minds I am a loser who still needs my parents funds to survive.

My sales clerk, Phyllis, was helpful about the type of frame I should get according to my face structure....after I was looking around about 20 minutes. When I entered the shop, I told her I needed a quote for frames and lenses, and without even looking up, she told me to pick out some frames and we would go from there. I asked Phyllis shouldn't she at least look at my prescription since it was pretty strong because I knew all frames don't work with all prescriptions. She glances at my prescription and says\" Oh yeah, it is pretty strong\", and tells me to stay away from rimless and metal frames. I really should have left then and went somewhere else, but decided to look around. Phyllis comes to assist after about 20 minutes. She brings over about four pair of frames for me to try and critiqued each one . I narrowed my choices down to the pair I really liked. As I was getting fitted, due to my special prescription, I was quoted a time of 14 days. Insert sad face here. Oh well, that's the price I pay for being a nerd and reading all those books in dim light as a youngster.\n\nMy glasses came back in about 10 days. After trying them on and getting them adjusted, I discover my right lens is scratched / cracked smack dab in the middle . While they agree to reorder the lens, I am quoted another 14 days for it to come back. Phyllis suggests that I go ahead and wear this pair to get used to them and when my new lens comes in, they will just switch the damaged lens out. I'm disappointed to say the least, but happy to get new glasses I was well over due for.

Staff and Dr. Harris are always nice and professional.  I don't have vision insurance, but price on visit is always reasonable.  Wait time is a little long but I never make an appointment either.  I'm always a \"walk-in\".  The eyeware part is a bit higher on retail prices for contacts so I choose to buy my contacts online.  They are always nice and helpful in providing my written Rx to purchase my contacts elsewhere.  Overall, I would recommend Dr. Harris @ Marx Optical to anyone looking for a good optometrist.......\n\nUpdate : I have officially quit seeing them after  10+ years.  After sitting waiting for almost 3hours with an eye injury,  I felt as though greater concern should have been given to at least administer a triage type exam to assess the situation,  but none was given.  In much pain,  I decided to leave after nearly 3 hours of waiting, since no concern was given.  I don't know if  my doctor knew that an eye injury was waiting,  but if not, his office staff have been poorly trained to deal with medical necessity Vs.  Standard eye exams.  I have seeked out an ophthalmologist and will begin seeing Dr Cain from now on instead of any optometrist office.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862847643db3f51:0x1eb815f284b146b5"}

The girl looked in the computer and said that the lens place hadn't gotten them yet, but they should soon and the 14 days wasn't up.

I called back an hour before closing the next day only to be told that my glasses were most likely in a box that got lost. So I waited for 2 weeks for glasses that went missing. I then I had to search  for an identical frame from another store.\nIf you don't want to chance your glasses being lost, go somewhere else.

Total game changer with Dothan Optometric Clinic.

A brilliant lens technician that knows everything about progressive lenses. For example: I\u2019ve never been able to read books with progressives. The peak progression is so for down making it impossible to fix ones eyes continuously. Kirk suggested a \u201cshort progressive\u201d that allows one to focus on the peak 4mm sooner with a much larger window. After purchasing, the change is incredible.\n\nBut the big story is: I took Kirk a pair of rimless glasses that I had stepped on back in 2005. They were my favorites and I was nostalgic for them. Kirk didn\u2019t hesitate, he immediately started the logistical process, built the glasses, and a couple of days later: I was looking through short progressive rimless glasses exactly like the ones I stepped on.\n\nBut the bigger story is: I\u2019m used to paying around $700 for everything.

I also had to bring my glasses back as the lens were cracked and when I got them back, they were not the same as the first ones.  I had paid extra for the top of the line with all of the add ons and when I got the \"fixed ones\" back, these were not added to the lenses.  Very disappointed also that if you call close to 5pm, they never answer the phone.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889badbf94081c6b:0x4f3c6da5ce8f1c70"}

Unfortunately the dentist doesn't seem like he should be working with children.

The first visit (for a pulled tooth) the dentist eventually stopped and gave him another shot, after which he was fine. This 2nd time, we were told we were the ONLY patients in the office, but the dentist seemed inconvenienced to even come in the room,  didn't say 2 words to me and acted in a rush to leave. He started a filling and my son raised his hand and made noises to let him know he could feel it, but the dr kept going and told the nurses \"He's fine.\" Then when my son finally jumped & grabbed his hand, he got aggravated and said to refer us to a pediatric dentist to be sedated. Very rudely made a point to say he wasn't even touching his teeth when he jumped. He didn't even offer to give him another shot or try to comfort him/talk to him about what he was feeling. My son is 11, knows what he can feel & has never had this problem with other dentists. :( I am very disappointed that an office so heavily geared towards children & close to home, has such an impatient & unkind dentist.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889badbf94081c6b:0x4f3c6da5ce8f1c70"}

He have a very professional staff and they are always ready to say or do something to make you comfortable. I was in the office about two weeks ago to get a permanent crown on a tooth that I had gotten a crown on about three years ago. Dr. Hankinson replaced that crown because he said that he felt that it should have last longer than that. I did not go in to received a free crown, I thought he could cement the old crown in considering that it was still pretty, but he insist on doing another one free of charge. You really don't see that kind of act of kindness today. He is a remarkable young man and he is very attentive with every patients. I have recommended many people to him and I will continue to do so, and he is VERY SMART. Please check out that SEMMES LOCATIO lt is beautiful.

The ladies at the front desk were lovely, but the man who did my prescreening was awful. He was rude right off the bat. I'm generally a nervous person when it comes to doctors and I like to know what's going on, however when I was asking questions about what he was trying to do to me, he got annoyed and kept trying to rush me into doing things. This automatically put me off, and made me feel unsafe. The puffer  test, for Glaucoma always has made me really nervous, but usually I try my best to get through it. However, I felt so unsafe and uncomfortable in the small room with this man that I was not about to do anything I wasn't comfortable doing to begin with. When it came to doing the eye mapping, he kept getting frustrated because he wasn't getting a good picture and ended up pushing my head pretty hard into the equipment. I wish I would've left at this point, but I figured it was probably just all in my head. He asked if he could hold open my eye, but made no attempt to even put on a glove, and at this point I had 0 trust in the guy. When I went into the exam room, the doctor was condescending. I try to tell doctors that I get anxious around them, and it typically helps the appointment go smoother, but she as well rushed me through everything which made me feel really uncomfortable. She then went to put drops in my eye, because I denied the puffer test and became really mad and threw down her paper towels she was holding when I refused. I know it is an important test, but they didn't try to establish any trust, and made me feel really freaked out and uncomfortable. I figured I don't have to go here again, and will take the test with a doctor who I actually trust, and who treats their patients with kindness.\n\nTo sum it up I will never be going to this location again, nor will I suggest it to anyone.

Still I didn't learn from them overcharging me from last year, that was partly due to my not so great insurance coverage.  I've been wearing corrective lenses for decades.  This would be my second visit to this office, I was in need of new glasses and my old prescription expired, so I dropped in on my lunch break.  This was one of few places my insurance covered.  The office assistants were nice.  They tried to upsell my dilation but I told the girl that I wanted to keep everything under my insurance coverage.  Everything went fine until I had to wait 45 minutes for Dr. Davis finish her causal conversation with the patient next door. When she finally appeared, she touched base on the astigmatism in my left eye.  I've had an astigmatism in that eye for years and there has yet to be any issues about it.  She said she wanted to try a specific contact lens for that eye, she would order me free trial and that I'm to come back for a follow-up.  She also suggested that I change my disposable contact lens from daily to weekly.  She asked if I slept in them, I said no because I rub my eyes in my sleep and I have symptomatic reactions with allergies which causes severe protein buildup.  She said she will write a prescription for some allergy drops.  I didn't think I needed them because I haven't had an allergic reaction like that in a while. So I thought I would just not get the prescription.  Finally I am about to check-out and the lady at the desk, Sarah, tells me that my final total is over $100.  I only assumed that my copay would be $40. Sarah said that my eye exam \"became a medical visit because the written prescription for the eye drops and the specialized fit for the new contact lens we are ordering.\"  I was blown away.  I had no room in my budget for that.  I know I signed the form understanding there would be extra costs but they should at least TELL me as they are working what costs are to be incurred.  Sarah saw I was distraught and made and additional comment, \"You know, I'm working on getting a coupon for these drops.  I don't know what your co-pay is, but these drops are expensive.  The coupon will make sure you don't pay more than $25. Oh and the follow-up visit is free.\"  Thanks but no thanks, you obviously know what you were doing and got caught.  I don't plan to fill out the unnecessary prescription.  I don't plan to use this office again.  I'll go back to get the rest of my contact prescription and that's it.  No more.  I've been seeing an ophthalmologists for, years under basic insurance and my copay was not over $20, let alone any surprise charges for a non-invasive visit.  My suggestion is to go elsewhere.  A medical office is supposed to take care of their patients, not rob them blind.\n\nUpdate 7/18/2014:  I came back for my follow up for my contact fitting.  This time I was seen by Dr. Bradley.  He asked about the contacts that were given to me, I told them that the left lens was difficult to adjust to because it was thicker than the right lens and that with my new job, I'm looking at a computer more so they dry out faster.  He examined my eyes and found out that it wasn't the computer use that was drying out my eyes.  He said the contact lens material was not working with my body chemistry and that my tears were being repelled from the lens and not being absorbed for normal wear.  He then looked closer at my prescription and said that I didn't have a need for these special lens.  I was doing fine before and this was not a solution to my problem.  He referred me to use a different lens, free of charge, and crossed out Dr. Davis' previous notes in red marker.  I'm so glad there was a second opinion in the same office that could help me out.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da239f8e191:0xca264ffb151bf5e2"}

Not only were they none attentive, but did nothing but rush & try pushing my teenage son to switch from glasses to contacts. Instead of giving a teenager time to think about whether he was comfortable with contacts or wearing them, they insisted on forcing you to pay for a lesson and a contact exam on top of his glasses exam before making a decision. After leaving the first time with a horrible experience, we got a call that his lenses were in after 2 weeks. Then, after calling to make sure they\u2019d have time to complete the service before driving the distance again, we get there to be told they had ordered the wrong lenses for his frame. The frame in which he specifically had with him at his first visit & had taken a picture of with him in them. The employees were unfriendly, unconcerned, and sat there arguing with me about them having more than one frame listed in the system for him as an excuse. Regardless of the fact that his current frames were there with him on his exam visit & they were responsible for making sure they ordered the lenses for that exact frame! They completely disregarded checking the frame model he had with him before ordering the new lenses I paid $362 for, and we were not only out of another long drive for nothing, but ended up being  left without him having his glasses.

I am 60 and have been wearing eyeglasses since I was 13, so I know how to take care of my glasses. A close inspection revealed that the Perry Ellis frames were shrinking over time, placing constant stress on the lens material. I will never buy eyeglasses from Costco again.

My advice to you is find an eye doctor that is there every time you go into their office, so you actually SEE the same eye doctor each time.  A doctor that will explain to you what's going on and makes the time to answer your questions.  A doctor that CARES about your eye health or lack there of, depending on the situation.  A doctor and his staff that know what customer service is all about.  A doctor and his staff that will work with you on the health of your eyes.  I'm dealing w/ these people today, b/c I have to.  But I won't do it again.  I don't care if I have to pay twice as much to see another eye physician.  America's Best does not care about it's patients.  Not in the least.

It had been about 5 years since my last eye exam. I used to suffer from horrible migraines (which I seem to have remedied) and I still do suffer from pretty frequent headaches and some other minor issues (floaters, some blurring in my vision, straining with low-light situations).\n\nFacy was the front office associate that greeted me and verified my insurance. She was VERY sweet and helpful.\n\nLinda did my preliminary eye exam and field testing. She was very kind, very patient and overall pleasant to interact with.\n\nDr. Mills is AMAZING. She is such a kind human being, she listened thoroughly while I talked about my history and concerns. She did not lose patience or make me feel rushed during my eye exam (especially when I had difficulty deciding between which two lenses looked more clear). We chatted while she checked out my eyes after dilation and she was just a joy. I love love love the experience I had with her and the fact that she is a WOC sealed the deal for me.\n\nCecily was a peach and walked us through what insurance would cover, our many options for lenses and frames and was able to play with some numbers so that we were able to get the most bang for our buck based on our needs.\n\nI'll come here to update about receiving our glasses, the fitting and how things turned out but the experience overall was wonderful!\n\n***Our glasses were ready for pickup 5 days after our appointments! We both got multiple phone calls letting us know they were ready.\n\nThe only reason that I couldn't quite give a 5 star review was that some of the staff that worked in the front were not as polite and patient (my wife didn't have such a great experience with the person who assisted her at first). Everything else was fabulous and we intend to make this our home for vision care even though it's in Hoover and we live in Calera.

He was patient throughout the exam and took time to explain my current eye health and prescription. He also went above and beyond to explain the contact brand options that would work well with my eyes.

Mr.Dr.McCurdy was very respectful and a very good doctor. My experience with Mrs.Dr.McCurdy, on the other hand was a nightmare. I came in with an eye ulcer and Mr.Dr.McCirdy helped me a lot and asked for a second follow up visit to see how my eye was feeling. When I returned I did not seem him. I saw his wife who works along side him. I was ok with this until she figured out I was a victim of a rare disease. When this became apparent to her, she began pestering me with questions. It ended with her asking \"If you would mind me taking a couple pictures of your eyes?\" I was reluctant but agreed. Instead of using the provided equipment to take professional pictures, she instead took the machine with a light and mirrors and instead of putting her eye to it, she took two pictures with her iPhone 7. I remember it being an iPhone 7 because it stated that it was on the bill right next to the 75$ price tag of each picture she took. After this I did not want to return for my yearly eye exam but I agreed to with the condition I would Mr.Dr.McCurdy instead of Mrs. So when we made the appointment we made it VERY clear we wanted him, not her. Well wouldn't you know it, who do I see when I walk in the door of the doctor's office. She was happily smiling with one of her nurses there. I sat in the chair waiting for the exam to begin. Instead of doing that, she asks the nurse to sit there and stare at my deformed eyes. After a couple minutes, I spoke up and asked if we could start the exam. She agreed and proceeded to put dilating drops in my eyes. When she got down to look she asked if I still had my contacts in. I said yes. She immediately pulls each of them out of my eye and throws them in the trash before I can react. I tell her those were my last contacts and she pulls them out of the trash and puts them in solution. Well we go on with exam even though I should've left right there. We finish and without asking me anything, she reaches to get the contacts and starts to try to put them in my eye. I ask her what she's doing and I explain to her I don't want contacts from the trash. She tries setting me up with a pair of sample contacts, which weren't even fit to my prescription, the equivalent of me putting on reading glasses when I'm legally blind without proper aid. She tells me we'd laugh this off and I left as quickly as possible. It's been three years or so, Mrs.McCurdy.

I have had occasions when an eye injury occurred, something diagnosed as a \"detached viscous\" which happened first in one eye then, a year later, in the other.  Dr. Nichols explained the first time that it occurred, how important it was to make sure that the condition was watched carefully for the first several weeks or so, until the detachment was complete as it could result in a detachment of the retina during the process.  He told me to call 24 x 7 if I had any issues and that he or one of the other doctors in the office would see me immediately.  This is the kind of service that is unexpected today but shows the care and concern that Dr. Nichols and his office provides.  If you want really good care for your eyes, and thorough examinations, I highly recommend the practice.\n\nTS", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a0335d9dc6d17:0xd729b4754302373e"}

I bought two pair and they both equaled a total of $63.99. However, the service was suspicious to say the least. Eyemart is advertising multiple pairs of glasses, at an affordable rate. When I went into the store, I noticed the employees were seemingly very nice and eager to help. Long story short, when it came time to purchase my glasses they were tremendously higher then I expected. My total came out to be $143.99 originally. I thought that was strange so I just simply asked is there not a more standard lens that I could get? Suddenly the employee gets nervous, as if I've asked a question that's too sensitive for her to answer. Her boss reacted rather strangely as well. What had happened was, they had rung me up for two pairs of glasses and lenses and instead of asking me what lenses I would like or giving me choices on what they have; they simply just charged me for the most expensive and weren't even trying to provide me with any options. This was very upsetting to me simply because their advertisement says one thing, yet they are not at all trying to correlate such through their services. What is even worse, is that the manager actually brought me an example of what I would be buying going with the cheaper option. Let me be the first to tell you the example she brought out was not what I ended up buying. Which leads me to believe that Eyemart is only after your money. Granted I got my glasses within literally 30 minutes I was a little bit taken back by my experience considering I was trying to be bamboozled. If you go into this store they have a great selection, and I suggest that you go with whatever you like, but I would be very wary of their service and also be sure to ask questions.

We go to our appointment and she takes our card she has to see it or she wouldn't of known they didn't take our insurance because of the mcr on it she didn't tell us nothing about it or we would of went some where else. Our insurance pays for the eye exam and 100.00 towards frames and /or lenses however u want to use it. We take our exams and I come out to the lobby while my eyes are dilating she said I could get with the receptionist and pay or do what I needed to do. Ok  I tell her that I shouldn't owe her anything that our insurance pays for the exam and 100.00 for frames.  I told her I called before we came in to make sure you took our insurance if u didn't we would of gone somewhere else. Then she said that she didn't know we had mct by talking to me on the phone. Ok you shouldn't of said you take it u should of asked about the mcr on the card first before saying I took it. The thing that really got me is I'll give her the phone call. But when we went in for our appointment and she made copies of our cards and highlighted where we had MCR she knew then they didn't take our insurance but she didn't tell us until after we both had our exams and was leaving. I told her that she did not tell us that or we would of went somewhere else. I told her she could file the claim and hope they pay it. We were not very happy about that.\nWe go next door to get our glasses thinking we can do all of this in one day and be done with it. Wrong again I called and asked did they take our insurance yes we do they just didn't bother to tell me that the machine tht runs the card through hasn't been sent to them yet and they have no way of filing our insurance. But we will call you when it comes in. How long will that be? I'm sorry I have no idea??  So we either go somewhere else or go home and wait on there call thinking it will be just a few days Wrong again. It was a long time before they called us. So we were still aggerivated about the whole thing we weren't sure wether to go back there or not. We did decide that if the insurance didn't pay for the exam that they could write it off or do whatever they wanted to do with that bill we werent going to pay it cause she knew before we had the exams and done them anyway without giving us a choice to have them done or not. So far I haven't got a bill from them or anything from my insurance.\nThey finally call us and say they can take our insurance now. So my husband goes and gets his done. They look good on him and so far he's satisified.\nI went Wednesday and got mine done and picked them up Friday so far I'm very happy with them. I bought the 29.95 year warranty I have narcolepsy and I fall and drop them all the time. I can mess them up I have had my dog to eat them and I'm being serious. I woke up and she was crunching on something I was trying to find my glasses to see what she had  that's when I found the frames.\nThe people were very nice, the place was nice they just need to have there knowledge together and tell people the right thing and most important tell them if you don't take their insurance before you do nothing to them. We were nice. There's allot of people hat would of caused a big big scene.\nThank you!!\nHave a Nice Day!!!!\n\nDebbie Waldroup", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1564174066563, "text": "Hello Debbie, thank you for your review.

My family and I have been ordering glasses through Lenscrafters for quite sometimes and never had an issue. But, this time for some reason, they can't get my prescription right. Not to mentioned the several trips back and forth to the store I've made. Within the last few weeks I have ordered 2 pair of glasses. The 1st pair that I ordered was a complete mess, couldn't see anything. My measurements were totally off. Took a chance on ordering another pair and found out that they didn't fill my prescription correctly so therefore I still couldn't see. The guy was very rude. Bluntly accused me of the mistake and not once did he\napologize.  After that he quoted me a ridiculous price to correct their mistake.

Also, since my employer is so strict on the glasses, they provide me with a free pair every year, but my prescription has to be up to date. The ladies behind the desk refused to give me my exam results because it was against their policy. Basically they didn't want me to take my prescription to a competitor and purchase glasses or contacts. I explained my situation and that I had just spent almost 500 on glasses and contacts (and thats additional to insurance paying 150 toward my frames) with them. Didn't matter. I walked to the back and grabbed the optometrist. He gave me my prescription so I could take it to work.

I have written a previous review concerning the immense amount of professionalism and care that the doctors and personnel provide; but once again, they have exceeded my expectations of their care. From the minute you walk into the door, you notice the constant upgrades that the facility is experiencing due to them becoming a part of Family Eye Care. This demonstrates that they wish to be on the leading edge of optical care with new equipment and a welcoming patient waiting area. I was welcomed by Cindy and Paige at the reception desk with a pleasant smile and greeting (unlike some medical practices that basically show that you are bothering them by requesting assistance); you will not see this here!\nThe wait time was incredibly short and I was escorted back to the back with questions of my day and further concerns of my wellbeing. Once I was in the examination room, I was greeted by Melissa and Dr. Mary-Kate Moring. They both intently listened to my eye concerns and took attentive time ensuring that my eyes were examined and explained any problems or developments with by contacts and vision. I didn\u2019t feel a bit like I was rushed out of the office by \u201cwriting off\u201d any questions or concerns; this gave me confidence once again that they really do care.\nAfter my exam, Melissa took as much time AS I NEEDED to ensure that I fully understood how to place and remove my contacts, as well as care of them. They also supplied any contact lens products that would assist me while I was getting used to the care and wear of them. While talking to Melissa, I told her that I recommended them to a family that needed eye care, but they probably could not afford eye care. She informed me that they work with the needs of many families when it comes to eye care, and they fully understand the hesitation of families to seek eye care due to finical needs. She continued to tell many that they have many eye care packages to assist those families in need of eye care; when comes to vision, cost should not be a factor. Again, this demonstrates a deep concern for an individual\u2019s eye care needs.\nOnce again, this visit amazed me! They really do care when it comes to my vision and eye care. It is ironic in the fact that they are becoming a part of Family Eye Care; each visit leads me to believe that not only do they care for me and my families\u2019 eye care, but now I can say that they are now a part of my Family.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1493320622796, "text": "We so appreciate you taking time to review us once again!
