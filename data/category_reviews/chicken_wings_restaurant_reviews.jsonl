To the owner you are a man of your word when you said you would fix the problems. We have been back a 4th and 5th time and every thing was fantastic!\n\n2nd visit maybe I just have bad luck, Stood at the door for several minutes with my wife. They were not busy and we even asked an employee if we could just sit. Someone will be with you. I want to like this place but....... a simple hey we see you would help. I would actually rate it lower but the fried chicken is good and that got them an extra star. 1st visit Ate lunch at Yard Birds Chicken Company. Today was the grand opening so I will forgive them for forgetting the jalape\u00f1o cornbread then giving me biscuits and having to ask for ranch multiple times. The chicken was excellent, They use a crumbly crust almost like you use on fried green tomatoes. And It almost seems like they smoke the chicken first then batter and fry. It was tasty and next time I will have to have the hot. Now for the bad the corn bread was cold, not just room temp but cold. If it was warm then man it would have been great. As a suggestion please please add a honey butter with the warm cornbread or biscuits and it would be perfection.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMB67Ig2rIVCVwn-kXoCR-W6S4oGRSUsPHAD2w=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnwaoXPa_WaTinbaf9Iu6SlzDGRj58gMR2JKk=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgLx6y3GWSljM9S2fLaVicRkHvdX6s5JparYg=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3jxyT29QGAyGNQZhsfe1InLAXtjsZtKV5yTI=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWUxct2iDRAYQV3HAR4zzq74gi_5mt24x62As=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5KOcA99jJum3jSKKjhtk4WOIAHxsNE24r2D4=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5lyoQ98LZMGXQyogs9O8Adjw92YzGTWc7BsM=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMh0St-1-wiRxQUVS14Cg7DaKdJ5xoy6rTX5c=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890dc1bc4cb6cd:0xf143b2afe703a64e"}

Three strips fries  and a small  dish  salad. Strips and fries were good tho. I got the Nashville Hot Chicken with two sides.  That was a whole chicken breast and wing for $10 and change. It was very good. Now our waitress was a different story. She was unenthusiastic and very dry. We had completely  ate our food but she had the nerve to ask if we wanted to-go boxes.

When he called back up there the assistant manager Renee on duty argued with my husband telling him that there were not very many olives on the pizza because we had ordered extra toppings and if they put to much they get into trouble. The pizza had no olives at all on it. I called her back and informed her that I did not order extra toppings, only substituted two of the toppings and that there were no olives on the pizza. She continued to argue with me. Made me so angry that I took the pizza back up there and asked for her to show me just one olive on that pizza. She proceeded to tell me there were olives on it when she made it. I told her this is what my husband brought home. I told her how I was treated was wrong and that I would be contacting her general manager and the corporate office.\nUpdate..... Just bit into the third pizza and it has Italian sausage on it....

They were refusing to refund money to those of us that were tired of waiting. The excuse was noone in the store was allowed to refund money and we would have to wait until the next day for the manager to deal with it.

Some of their policies do, however, tend to make me question the thinking behind them.\n\nThe most recent one is doing away with the complimentary parmesan cheese packs making the customer pay for a small parmesan cheese shaker for a dollar if they want the parmesan cheese to go on top of their Pizza.\n\nI also have a problem with chain pizza restaurants, like most of the main players in the chain pizza restaurants that charge a delivery fee for delivery yet that fee is not going to the drivers at all.  Pizza Hut, like many of the other major players seems to be doing away with their eat-in restaurants meaning you either have to carry it out or get it delivered so if that's going to be your main business you shouldn't be charging people extra for it making customers think the extra fee goes to the drivers because it doesn't.\n\nIf you're going to charge a fee for delivery then pass it along to your drivers and don't just add it to your bottom line.  I do like Pizza Hut pizzas but there are other places, in our area that I do like better.  I keep coming back to Pizza Hut because it's consistent, it's good, and when you crave Pizza Hut no other place will do.  Of the large pizza chain restaurants I do believe Pizza Hut delivers are provides the best product overall in their coupon specials are also good.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862ca5d92546e1d:0xeb7b0c9007dd9c3a"}

I WORK FOR A BANK so I have no idea how they are getting away with charging fees for debit cards... luckily I had cash... because the line starts on the other side on the building...& if there is a sign there, I didn't see it, I called my order in, thank god, because I had got to speak to the same lady for my complaint who also worked the window....so no way I could be accused of lying that my order was wrong (that didnt happen but you never know), had the employee not been honest about, thinking the poppers were a substitute I don't know if I would have been offered fries...\nI saw two boxes, checked my receipt, was charged correctly... and it was a line developing behind me... and I had been waiting... so I'm ready to go, simple order couldn't go wrong could it?\nthere wasn't a line in the drive thru before I got there, wasn't a busy day at all.... I CALLED MY ORDER IN...and it was not ready... I waited the entire time it would take to cook the order...\n\nso I am to assume they have sketchy customer who lie, want refunds, call but never show or call back to cancel, and they substitute more than buying an extra dish... assuming the past bad apples (customers) dictated my service... and the way they conduct business. Idk this was my first impression.\n\nI ordered hot lemon pepper wing combo with jalapeno poppers(I will never understand the mark up for seasonings, but we let wings shops do it, so hey, that sprinkle will cost you extra, in this case there wasn't any thing specifically different than DIY, if you have the seasoning at home just order the sause and save the money.)\n\nI got home to present things lunch to my fianc\u00e9e and he's like where are the fries...The gave me wings in one box and poppers in the other (poppers were fried too hard btw) ... I'm home, literally 5 mins away, which is why I called in... and dang no fries. BBecause the sing you dont wvwn want to call because it's your fault for not checking your order, not theirs for not making it right... RIGHT?\nI called she remembered me. (THIS IS WHY ITS THREE STARS AND NOT JUST 2) She asked the cook, he said he did it right no fries because its a substitute, she tried to explain to me that it was substituted and I explained I paid full price for both, this was not easy like a chick fil a refund, it wasn't sincere or apologetic it was like so what do you want us to do/ brick walls where as I call out the price and she verified that yes that's full price on both... based on the sign alone I didn't expect to be offered a solution... we can make you fries, do you want to come get them now, yes... I drive back and the fries were ready at the window. Thank god I didnt have to go inside or wait in the drive thru.\n\nStill my pet peeves are lack of accountability, Visa regulations seem bent, no fee for cash, fee for debit cards, no refund, unless you are as lucky as I was to at least get your food, the second time. My initial order was not ready causing me to hold up ppl behind me... then my order was incorrect when I did get it ...so I couldn't eat it when I got it. .. because I had to turn around to complete it... yeah I'm in the middle with this one. I mean what do you expect... its wing out... I want personally to expect more and see it grow and thrive... so I hope they use the fees and over priced food to spiffy up the location... customer service wasn't bad but I had no idea about the card fee, I feel like they need to let ppl order online, pay over the phone TELL THEM ITS A FEES because if I didn't have cash they would have wasted food HAD IT BEEN PREPARED IN ADVANCE or find a way to guarantee my food will be ready.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891eb22182d2f3:0x7b14b08e294ec2d2"}
