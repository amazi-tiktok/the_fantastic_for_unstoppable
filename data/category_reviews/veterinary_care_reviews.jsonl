We have a little kitty named Honey and she had been getting sicker for about a week and a half. We became extremely worried for her because she was not getting any better. She has had respiratory problems in the past but this time it was much more severe.\nWe called and the receptionist lady was so nice and said we could bring her in and was very understanding of our situation.\nOnce we got there we were amazed by the knowledge the staff has and the doctor, Dr. Pitman was so observant, caring, personal, and very gifted in his expertise.\n\nWe were scared our Honey was seriously sick. He took x-rays and personally wanted to show us what they looked like and showed them to us explaining to us what was going on in each part of the x-rays. To make a long story short, he explained what was going on and stopped our tears with comforting explanations telling us what he would do and that things would be fine with extra care and the medicine he would be giving her.\nFor us just to be traveling through, this is the most wonderful Vet Doctor we have ever encountered and he really cares about pets and takes each and every visit obviously very seriously whether you are a regular client or just passing through.\n\nAfter he explained the x-rays, he came in and explained thoroughly to us of how we would need to give her the medication and he practiced the steps with us of how to hold her head while giving her the pill and water. His lady staff helper was so helpful as well and they were both very hands on with us in showing us how to give the medication without any problems.\nWe sure wish we could take this Vet Doctor and his staff home with us, this was a truly genuine caring team of staff and the Doctor was absolutely wonderful and caring and the most knowledgeable we have ever encountered in a Vet Clinic EVER!\n\nWe would recommend anyone who loves their pets and who is traveling to stop at this clinic if you are having any problems with any of your little furry babies.\n\nIf we could give this Vet Clinic a 10 Star rating, we certainly would and if more Vets and Clinics were like this one with such an amazing team and Doctor, Dr. Pitman, the world would be in excellent shape when it comes to sick pets who need that extra attention and loving to successfully heal.\nIf you want to get to the bottom of what is going on with your furry babies, this is the Vet to go to.\nThe Doctor even told us, since my spouse travels through here on his trips often that if we are back through here in a couple of weeks to stop in and see him that he would like to see how she is doing and how her respiratory infection is doing and improving.\nKeep up the great work you all are doing here with your wonderful friendly atmosphere and loving care for all.\nIf you have written a bad review on this Clinic, there is something seriously wrong with you. This Doctor and Staff helped calm us down from being so upset and the staff lady brought us tissues because she was so observant and seen us crying and upset worried about our little baby Honey. This staff and Doctor has the most wonderful personalities and down to earth friendly attitudes of anyone we have met, and today, it's not easy finding that anywhere.\nJust an excellent experience and now we are back on the road with less worry and no tears. What a blessing it was for us to happen to get lucky enough to be here at just the right time and to find such a wonderful Vet and Staff!\nIf you are traveling and need to get your baby in to see a Vet, you could not go wrong here. The exit you want to get off on is 351 off of interstate 65.\n\nThank you Dr. Pitman and staff for making sure our baby Honey will be okay now and doing such a great job at helping us take the right steps to get her health back on the road to success. You are all Angels in our book!\n\nPatrick and Jennifer\n\nOur visit was on 11-10-2014.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88628c8f8dcc2b71:0xc141af2bcd17ea3b"}
