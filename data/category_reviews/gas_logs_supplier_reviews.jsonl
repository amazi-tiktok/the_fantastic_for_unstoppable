Had to go back in through the tile and found out the valve was never turned on/tested to the tub.  The rough-in work to the shower ended up being so poorly done, we are having to hire another plumber to come out and go in through the wall to fix the shoddy work that was done.  The plumber that came out to do this initial work was too concerned with having to leave early to officiate a soft ball game.  The worst thing about it is the owner is not standing behind his work and fixing himself. He has repeatedly blown me off and will not come back out.  I could also go in to how he threatened legal action if I didn't pay him for partial work before the job was completed, but that is another story.

After raving about the skill level of the mason that built these fireplaces in 1986 they still came up with several issues that had to be dealt with including cleaning, to the expense of OVER $5,000. We were appalled at the price because we do have some knowledge of masonry. Had someone else come out who said our fireplaces were good to go...did not even need cleaning as they did not appear to ever have been used for wood.

After the inspection and cleaning was done - he would not accept the quoted price of his competitor and made me pay $249.  This was $80 more!!!!  I objected and reminded him it was \"August\" and I was given the $169 quote as a Summer discount.  He raised his voice at me and was completely unprofessional - to the point where I told him to leave.  Lastly, he had me make the check out to him personally, which raises some other questions.
