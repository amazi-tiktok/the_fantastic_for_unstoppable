The sound was really good and the show was outstanding. The balcony gets a little high and there are a few stairs, but you can still see and hear everything very well.\nRestrooms and concessions are downstairs.

Apparently Samford's production of the Nutcracker is one of about 8 that is officially certified to do it and it was great! During intermission, head downstairs EARLY if possible for some nice hot chocolate, candy or a Samford Bulldog Bar (if I remember correctly). Anyway, the facility is very nice! Large and well kept. Our seats were beneath the overhang of the balcony so I didn't get to see what kind of theater magic they used to accomplish this, but during intermission they even made it SNOW on the audience!\n\nI'll be sure to keep an eye out for any other enticing productions taking place here!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889190d4077e61f:0x36daae75474ac42c"}
