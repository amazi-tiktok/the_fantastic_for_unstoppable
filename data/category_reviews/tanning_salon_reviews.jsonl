Due to our busy life styles, we join Palm Beach Tan specifically for the spray feature which typically alloys us to get in and out quickly.  In the last few months we have had terrible experiences with the lack of maintaining  there equipment with this location and the Auburn location.  Many times over I have undressed and stepped into the booth for a spray and with very much disappointment the only spray I`m receiving is air only.   No tanning solution!! Or we come in for a spray and the booth is not working at all. This has happened to my wife and I multiple times recently. Very frustrating to have to get dressed and go make someone aware at the front desk and then go and get undressed for the second time.\nMy opinion is. ..If the staff would spend more time preparing the machines for there next guest, these issues shouldn`t happen.  These unpleasant experiences are causing my wife and I to rethink whether or not we should  continue with our membership and this may not matter.

The staff helped at the front with changing my membership from another location. There seemed to be plenty of space. I didn't have to wait on anyone, which is number one for me at any fitness center. Social distance measures were decent, as can be expected. The only real issue that bothered me was that one employee was talking to a customer waiting to go into the spa while I was trying to leave, and he walked in front of me three times going back and forth from the other customer and the counter, as if he couldn't see me. He didn't speak to me at all. I didn't find it very professional to be cutting customers off repeatedly and not saying excuse me or anything, just expecting me to continue to move and go around after already changing directions without even acknowledging me there. It would've been much better if he had the conversation with the customer at the counter, at the table, said \"excuse me,\" or even \"sorry about that,\" anything really to let me know I was valued as much as the person he was talking to and not just in his way. Things like that irk me, especially as a customer. Other than that though, pretty great first-time experience. If it doesn't get too much busier without being expanded, then I'll plan on this being my main gym. Oh, one more thing, I wish they had the treadmills like Midtown. Only having an up and down and not a keypad is annoying when trying to change interval speeds.

I couldn't help but feel her response was because it was close to closing time or because they had already cleaned those and were closing up that side. I just recently moved to the area from Hawaii so keeping a tan is important however, working full time and having children prevents that leisure. So I promptly purchased the platinum package, which for the amount that I paid for it that you would think that I'd be given an explanation as to why I'm unable to use my package level at the facility. I just felt as if I was being rushed and that if there was an electrical issue that it should have been conveyed. Overall, I love The Palm Beach Tan in Daphne.

There were no baby wipes, and the floor was still wet from the previous tanner. The mystic bed's fan was also broken, so I had to breathe the fumes, and it did not dry. When I told the girls after that it was broken, they informed me that \"oh yea they forgot to tell me that part, and that it was either no fan or let the bed fry itself.

The staff is very friendly, but sometimes a little pushy when it comes to selling lotions. I love the atmosphere and the beds! However, there was a slight issue bothering me. My sister and I went in for a free spray tan, but little did I know I was gonna be spending close to $50 just so I could spray tan. You have to pay for the adhesive shoes they let you use and a primer to lotion on before getting in. So technically it wasn't a free spray tan. Next time include that in your offers.

But when I arrived there wasn't any other customers, the girl who helped me was very kind. The problem came when I found out the Versa was broken AGAIN & they have to come from ATLANTA to fix the only one shop has... it was too late to drive over to the Vaughn rd shop to use there's... but I tried there's last time and the versa is SO old! It's freezing in room, machine has what looks like an old heater that turns orange red when it's on to dry you. The heater doesn't go up & down & is a safety risk of burning someone if they slipped. It has NO feet markings so you best get it right & not go by the dalraida versa... cause it doesn't have all the cycles. You'll not be sprayed evenly if you don't know how it works. Did I say the room is Freezing? Swap rooms with a heated bed. ALSO after I got prepped using expensive single pk of primer, paid for additives (I'm a top level member &\nyou'd think since the versa is free ($100/month isn't free) I'd get the few dollars off since there equipment is broken. Well I'm prepped & the bed never comes on.\nI cover up walk all the way from back to very front all glass windows to tell the girl. Come to find out the computer has shut down. I was there at 9:10. So it all was a waste. She apologized & I wasn't mad at her... but I'm paying for the past few years this $$ Auto draft and this is how it goes. I'll be cancelling before next bank draft.

It is a transfer resistant white bronzer that is an adequate stater lotion for a new tanner. You may not know this but many tanning lotions you find on the internet at a price point that is much lower than we, as a professional tanning salon, can purchase it from our distributors are expired, discontinued or come from china. I apologize that we where unable to make you happy with your lotion purchase and that your felt the need to leave us a 1* review. The lotion you looked up on Amazon takes 3-6 weeks to arrive, that means it is in fact coming from china. Perhaps the tanning salon you are currently tanning at can price-match with Amazon.

I only took a star off because I told them I've had trouble in the past with sunless tanning - that it comes out blotchy especially on my torso. They advised me to exfoliate before my appointment (which I did), wear loose clothing (which I did), and to not shower for a certain amount of time (a direction I also followed). They suggested which sunless tanning option that wouldn't turn out blotchy. However, after all that, the color torso still turned out as it did in the past. The weather was chilly, so it wasn't an issue during my family's vacation; but I still would have liked for the staff's confidence in the sunless tanning product to have been true. The picture is of my brother and me in Epcot 2-3 days after my appointment. You can see the color difference there.\nTL;DR: Relaxing environment, friendly staff, sunless tan not fully realized.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCKlUr9x_OrQYfWHBP56kMpYx0BsJuG4L_WUYE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888910d6f9cbda57:0x22dab229562d74b6"}

However, as I drove across the south with the top down in my little convertible to go to my niece's graduation, I looked in the mirror and realized that half my face and the upper left part of my arm were a little more burned than the rest of me. I hadn't seen my family in 7 years and couldn't show up half-burned, could I? Most definitely not! So I came screeching to a halt in front of Hollywood Tans shortly after they opened, praying they could figure out something that would at least even me out.\n\nSara, the owner, was amazing! She quickly assessed my funky skin tone and squeezed me in for a custom airbrush. I left looking bronzed and EVEN. She was sweet and non-judgmental as I stripped to my underpants and showed off my pasty/burned fattitude. She took her time and I never felt rushed even though I knew that she had an appointment coming in soon. She explained exactly what I needed to do and not do going forward to keep my tan and make certain it developed the way it needed to.\n\nIf you live in the area (or are just driving through... it's right off the highway), make sure to give them a try. If I weren't still beautifully tan on my way back, I would have stopped in for a touch up.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888910d6f9cbda57:0x22dab229562d74b6"}

They offered to re-spray me the next day but I was leaving for my trip and would not be able to return so it was too late to get another one. Besides who knows what another layer would have look liked.\n\nI want to point out the sales ladies were nice. I had absolutely no issues with them.  It was the tan itself that was so bad.

Unfortunately, Olivia A. Salon is not the place for me.  I went in for an acrylic fill with gel on top and while everyone was friendly  I left unhappy with my nails.   The result was chunky, overly thick, and uneven.  It looked worse than press on nails glued and painted by a child.  The nail technician did NOT use a drimmel or motorized file but used a foam hand file to take off my existing and layer of acrylic.\nAt first this seemed nice but I was mistaken.  She was unable to file the smaller sectional of my nail bed and ended up filing skin which hurt.  My nails were embarrassing to look at as they appeared malformed and lumpy.  When she applied the gel she used 3 very thick coats of color that didn't dry under the light and were soft to the touch.  To be fair, I'm picky with my nails and when I saw the manicure going south I didn't say anything.  I should have.  Instead I left and went straight to another nail salon.  At the next salon they showed my Quasi-Modo nails around and laughed.\nThe salon itself is easy enough to find but the level of aesthetics is less than what I like.

On this particular visit, Ms. Katie went above & beyond in my opinion.  Though they were about to close, she still allowed me to tan. I did appreciate that greatly.\n\nAdmittedly, there are some \"minor\" things I would like to see changed (i.e., women's bathroom fixed, as it's been about 1 month since it's been \"out-of-order\"; some of the beds have cracks in them, which is a bit concerning; would be nice if they had at least 2 stand-up beds instead of 1; and it would be nice to be informed that bulbs have been changed out on a bed when you haven't tanned in awhile).\n\nOtherwise, I like that they have plenty of beds without any wait time.  They keep decent hours for tanning.  The gals are always friendly when I come in.\n\nThey also offer fun \"incentives\" for upgrades and/or freebies, which is nice.  It's truly the only tanning place where I've had \"fun\" tanning.  I've been tanning for more than 25+ years and in multiple countries, so I can say this honestly!\n\nBlessings to each!\n\nUPDATE (7/30/17): As always, Customer Service is top notch at this location.  I also like the fact that this company makes tanning \"fun\" by offering sweepstakes, upgrades & every now & then freebies (be nice to see more of these considering cost of tanning)!  Also, like the fact that this facility is always clean ...big factor!  Would be nice to see a full-length mirror in either tanning room and/or bathrooms for dressing purposes.  That would be my only recommendation at this point.  Thanks for listening! :-)  HAPPY TANNING! 8-)\n\nUPDATE (1/12/17): I forgot to get the gals name last night, but she was very helpful.  I also like that PBT has these \"free\" upgrades for members.  I'm really sad to hear the prices are going up, since there are no \"competitors' to even compare with.  So I do feel that's a little \"unfair\" on corporate's part, as I feel the prices are already rather pricey.  I'm on SSDI & can't afford ANYTHING above what I'm already struggling to pay.  Otherwise, I like the customer service, the fact that PBT does periodic contests and/or giveaways, as well as special priced upgrades.  I think for regular paying monthly customers, we should get at least 2 free upgrades a month, but that's my suggestion!  Who knows, in doing that, you may generate more people to upgrade that can actually afford to do so.  For those of us who can't, it's still nice to get that chance to experience what we can't otherwise afford.\n\n(FALL-2016) So far all the gals I've dealt with are very friendly, take time to answer ALL my questions without being \"annoyed\" by them or making me feel \"rushed\".  So I appreciate that!  I've been tanning longer than most of them have probably lived life, LOL, but with all the new technology that tanning beds offer now ...I'm still learning new things.  So thank you for taking the time to both listen & respond (respectively)!\n\nHave a blessed day, week, month & year!

She matched my color i had on my nails perfectly with no hesitation. Lastly but surely not least Tracy done my hair. I have naturally curly and extremely thick hair and i wanted it washed dried and straightened. Not very many can get my hair straight. Well Tracy didnt disappoint. She got it straight and with all the rain we have been having i can honestly say 5 days later its still straight. Hats off to all the wonderful ladies at Bliss Day Spa.

{"user_id": "103804845592874345668", "name": "Tera Shade", "time": 1393167773078, "rating": 5.0, "text": "In response to the \"1 star\" review written 3 years ago.  I responded 2 days after it posted but it never showed up, so I'll try again with my response...When this review was first posted the person included her name (it has since been changed to \"anonymous\").  I called the reviewer and inquired about her time spent at Bliss.  You see, I am the owner and very concerned about our reputation and our guests experience.  I believe the following information will help you decided if you want to take this reviewer seriously.   Let me begin by saying this reviewer called late in the day to make an appointment to have her hair cut.  Even though we were booked until closing time, one of my stylist agreed to stay late and take the appointment.  The two employees behind the desk greeted this reviewer, offered her something to drink, and informed the stylist of her arrival.  Because it was now after closing time, the two front desk employees left for the day.  This reviewer was not left alone or ignored at any time.  The stylist who volunteered to stay late, finished with the client she was with and was on time for this reviewers scheduled appointment.  This reviewer had her hair shampooed, had more of a trim than a cut, and blown out.  She was charged $15.  Her comment about being charged three times what she should have been charged... Well, I don't know where a woman can get her hair shampooed, cut/trimmed, and blown out for $5.  She did say she was new to the area, so maybe she could get the above service done for $5 where ever she moved from...Just to be clear, Bliss does not offer shampoos, haircuts, and styles for $5....  I noticed she did not mention the amount she was charged.   Could it have been she as embarrassed to admit that she thought $15 was \"three times more than what it should have been.\" Because this reviewer posted this review under her name and because we had her phone number on file, I called and inquired about her time at Bliss.  I stated I was the owner and was making follow up calls with our new clients.  I did not  mention I had read her review but instead asked how she enjoyed her visit with us.  I gave her every opportunity to relate any unpleasant experience she might have had.  I was told that Bliss is a beautiful place and was thanked for taking her appointment on such short notice and after hours.  When asked how she like her hair cut even thought it really was only a trim, she responded \"I like it, she did a good job.\" During our conversation, she never said anything negative about her visit at Bliss, and when I invited her to return in the future she said she would.  To be honest, she has not returned .  I wish she had given us another chance so that she could experience what Bliss is really about.  I would also like to respond to the comment about the service being done half-hearted and with no conversation.  The stylist's mother had just passed away very unexpectedly two weeks earlier.  She was still mourning her loss but trying to live as normal as possible and continue to work and support herself.  While this reviewer had no clue what was happening in our stylist personal life, I think because of the comment she made in her review for all to read, its important for you to know why our stylist was not her usual outgoing friendly self.   I am very interested in making each client feel welcome and appreciated.  I personally follow up with as many clients as possible to make sure that their time at Bliss was relaxing and that they are satisfied with their service.  I know this has been a lot to read, but I wanted to give a little more information about the above review.  I am sure I am not the only business owner that is willing to go above and beyond what is normal to make their guest happy.  If something is not what you are expecting, please let us know.  Give us the opportunity to \"fix\" it.  Our guest are the reason we even have a business and we understand that, without \"you\" we wouldn't be here.  We look forward to seeing you and making you feel \"special\" like the person you are!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d61a6391ccb:0x7321ebb76dd3fc84"}

She made me comfortable, held on to sensitive areas as she pulled the sugar, and braced me when she was about to pull. Today was NOTHING LIKE THAT. Zoey is friendly, with a great personality, but extremely rough, heavy handed, and messy. I should have followed my first mind and drove to Gasden, but I figured it would be the same experience. I was so pleased my first time, I tipped  $25. I am a firm believer in tipping if there is an option to do so, but, I still have hair in between my cheeks, along with clumps of wax,  and a Brazilian is something that can't be rushed.

I am from out of town and am in the area on vacation. I went here on the evening of 12/18 to tan and get some color since it has been cloudy the past few days. My time here was horrible from the minute I walked in the door. The young lady sitting at the desk was so consumed in her phone she had only looked up for a brief second to give a hasty smile. After walking over and explaining I was from out of tan and wanted to only tan once, the young lady handed me a clipboard and a pen. I asked her what this was for and she responded with \"fill it out\". She was very short and rude with me the entire time I was asking questions about the paperwork, making me feel as if I was an inconvenience to her. Before filling anything out (since I was not sure I even wanted to tan here anymore because of how rude the service and treatment was from this young lady), I asked her about the tanning bed and lotion options, explaining that I would like suggestions and what were the best options, and yet again she was very short and rude. She simply pointed me to where the lotions were, and did not help to explain what any of them were, and as for the tanning beds briefly explained the options very quickly. Because of all of this I decided to leave and to go to another tanning salon in Gulf Shores where I received much better treatment and assistance. Although the place was filled with beautiful clothes and jewelry, the young lady working up front ruined it by having a very ugly attitude. I am disappointed in this business after reading such good reviews on here about the business and their employees. I understand people have bad days and this young lady could have been having one, but to treat a customer with the lack of care she did was ridiculous. I hope that the owner/manager of this place sees this review and does something about this. Not only did this place lose a tanning customer because the poor attitude and customer service of this young lady, but money as well since she made the environment so uncomfortable to be in, let alone shop or tan. This was some of the WORST service I have ever gotten.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1547587791542, "text": "Jennifer I certainly do apologize that your visit was not a pleasant one. My personal phone number is on the door and I wish that you could have called me.  I looked on the date that you mentioned as well as the \"evening\" shift to see who the employee was. I asked her about this and she is not aware of anything like this happening.  All of my employees have been trained to provide excellent customer service so I am not sure what could have happened here. You stated that you left and went to Gulf Shores where you received better service. I did call them to ask them to contact you and give my number to so that I could take care of this. However they have not had a Jennifer Davis tan there in 4 years so perhaps you went somewhere else but there is only 1 tanning salon in Gulf Shores.

I was not told when I bought them of this expiration period nor are there any signs warning you of such in the store.

So an accelerator and bronzer are $10 each??? Wow\nI have sprayed here a few times, and never had a problem, but this time was horrible and has me not ever wanting to go back...I'm so disappointed....and I know that spray tans fade...but it's not suppose to like it is this time...every shower I can literally see it washing away off my legs...they are to the point to where they are almost spotty already...\nI can't suggest to never go there cause I know palm beach has a great name and usually has pretty decent service but this was the worse experience I've ever had with any spray tan.

I changed due to cheaper unlimited price. I normally tan around 8-9am every morning.  Yaw don't open till 12 on Sunday, which is great that your employees may attend church,  but if I tan on Sunday I won't be able to tan at my usual time from now on which is ridiculous.  Maybe don't have the 24 hr between Sunday n Monday.  It seems as if that's just a way for you to limit the unlimited to 6 days/week instead of 7, which is what we are paying for.  What can be done about this. I am very unhappy & disallusioned with palm beach presently & will not recommend to anyone unless this is resolved. Please contact me asap via phone preferably or email as  last resort.  Thank you so much.  The workers are great & very helpful but this needs to be resolved asap!

Even though we are a 24 hour facility for our members we strongly suggest that you have an appointment before coming to the gym for new membership, tour or day pass.  For this reason I cannot say who you spoke with or what information they gave you.  I can assure you it was not an employee.  I hope you find a facility to suit your needs.
