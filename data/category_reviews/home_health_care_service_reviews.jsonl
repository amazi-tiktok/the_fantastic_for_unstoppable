I contracted out 60 hours every week for caregiving and I took the other 128 hours myself.\n\nI contracted with BrightStar based on recommendations from friends, and I was not disappointed.   BrightStar provided qualified care givers, and if mom and/or did not relate well with a particular care giver, BrightStar would provide a different one.  We eventually evolved to a core set of 2 regular care givers, loved by my mom and I,  covering all 60 hours per week.  I don\u2019t know if other companies would be this flexible and supportive.  If a regular caregiver could not come, BrightStar would notify me and fill the gap, so that I could always count on a caregiver at my home at the planned schedule.  Knowing that a caregiver will be there, rain or shine, is a major consideration when determining if you want to hire a known private individual or a company with lots of caregivers.  Additionally, BrightStar schedulers, nurse, business office personnel were always a pleasure to work with and very supportive of mom and I during these trying time.  BrightStar may not be the cheapest, but you can count on them, so you just set your hours to what you can afford.  I highly recommend BrightStar, and if the need for caregiving arises for me in the future, I will be calling them.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862691000000001:0x6ce406a91cbe1e64"}

The phlebotomy program at Saad's no where near provided this to their students. My friend's instructor stayed texting and looking at the phone a lot while trying to teach them.  Clinical hours are the entire main key to having the knowledge, skills, and abilities to drawing blood. Saad's did not provide them or give them any clinical hours at all so they were lacking terrible skills and abilities of drawing blood because of the no clinical hours and lack of training. All the students complained and felt like the only thing they paid for was a phlebotomy button Saad's gave them after they were finished with the program. A hope to get job in the med.field but not a living off of job. Plus it's a very challenging job to get because too many people are trying to get a license for it so it is too much competition. Majority of jobs only hire experienced workers with 2+years of experience because they are afraid that you may cause a patient to have a permanently injured arm (hematoma) so they do not take risk. A permanent injury can cause the patient to sue the hospital. Volunteer programs do not offer many openings either because they are also afraid that you may cause an injury to a patient's arm so they do not take a risk on non experience phlebotomy technicians either. So be careful with this chose of career because it is no where near guaranteed to get a job for a while. And hospitals are starting to let RN nurses do more drawing blood than phlebotomist. So it makes it even harder to get a phlebotomy job. I also recommend and advise you to attend a college that offers the same cost for this program, more training, clinical hours, and you may have a better chance of getting a job. Because jobs trust colleges way more than a student who attended a healthcare place offering a program. Especially not Saad's due to their lack of non clinical hours and training.Take my advice seriously.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d2eebeb8da7:0x7f3bbfbe54537b08"}

A friend drove me from my MD visit over to this merchant  and I hobbled inside.  I knew I would need to present my insurance information cards and make a payment.\n\nThe employee desks are situated at the very back of the room beyond the product displays. \"For sale\" reclining and lift chairs are located to the left,  then there is a huge group of walkers, wheel chairs, bathing safety seats etc located in the middle section of the store. Neither employee visible got up when we entered the store.\n\nAn employee called out something to us from the desk area.\n\nMy friend encouraged me to sit in the first reclining chair but as it was a floor product I hesitated to do this and  continued towards the back of the store towards the employees.  One of the employees finally said, \"you can sit in one of those chairs\".\n\nI AM trying to make a long story short.\n\nI ended up buying a cast boot, but they informed me that they did not take my insurance so I paid out of pocket for the item.\n\nThe first boot they tried on me was way too big and they quoted me a price of $89.00 for the item.\n\nIn the end they sold me a higher valued, smaller product at close to the price they originally quoted, so I will give them credit for honoring the price they quoted. That is why 2 stars rather than 1 star. (I think the real reason I got the lower price was because my friend advocated for me regarding the price. I could not hear what was said,  because I was still sitting over against the wall in a recliner,  and my friend was over at one of the staff desks.)\n\nThe staff did not appear to know or understand their products very well and did not really explain much about the boot I bought. They were not gentle or accommodating of my injured foot which was covered in a sock, but swollen and quite painful. The boot was not put on my foot/leg correctly. The tops of the two rigid metal posts that are covered in a hard, rough, scratchy Velcro product were up above the padding of the boot.  After a bit of struggling by the employees, I really just wanted to finish the process and get out of the store. My foot hurt and nothing they were doing was helping at all.  Later, after I got home,  my husband and I looked at the picture on the cast boot box.  The picture clearly showed the boot padding extending up above the two rigid metal posts.\n\nThe posts had already sanded away the skin on both sides of my calf/shin. My husband reassembled the boot correctly and put it back on my foot after putting bandages on the two sores on my calf.\n\nThis store needs to rethink the showroom set up. The employees and their desks should be located near the door.  I realize that their product storage and office space are located at the back of the store but they ARE selling medical devices for customers who probably have some kind of limitation. The employees are the ones who should be making the trek across the store. It might also be a good idea for them to have a wheelchair available just inside the door that they could direct a customer to, if needed,  as soon as they entered.  This would be another advantage to the employees being stationed near the door.\n\nLet me be clear. No one was rude to us, but, no one seemed very concerned either. The first girl who tried to help us must have been new and was not familiar with the  boot products.\n\nThis necessitated a second, presumably more experienced staff member also assisting us. The second staff member was pretty obviously not pleased that she had to become involved and was very abrupt with the first staff member.\n\nAll in all it is not an experience I would repeat.\n\nAfter I got home and was finally comfortable with the cast boot, I looked up cast boots on Amazon and I could have gotten a comparable or even better product at half the price. And, Amazon has great customer service.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886266179711a56d:0x909b87d6f07bead6"}

You get to pick your schedule but the pay is only 8 dollars which is below minimum wage. Im a retired Air Force cop, so the pay wasnt really an issue for me. I wanted the experience since I am majoring in Nursing and I wanted to get a start in the healthcare career field. During my time, the clients were all sweethearts and I enjoyed them. They were the best part of my day. It really hurt quitting because I just love the clients and that is why I stayed. Well, some improvements for the company is as follows: better training, pay for the training, and raise the pay. When I first got to my orientation I asked how many employees they have? I was told over 100, but looking at their open shifts this company turn over rate is high and they dont have enough employees that care. They would send out available shifts but on the app employees had to use for myself  it wouldn't  show that I had available open shifts. The time off that I requested was always for VA (veterans affairs) appointments so my call in's where emergency only. I was always on time with all clients and I gave every client the best treatment, companion care, and respect.\nI dislike the company policies with COVID.  I was schedule to go into the office to do some training. I schedule this on my own because I knew that youtube videos couldnt get me by. I needed hands on training. They lack training. When I confirmed with my boss the time to come in for training I was told by my boss that they are not allowing people to come to the office. She sounded really sick on the phone so I couldnt give you a honest reason why they told employees to stay away. If i had to guess covid. I had called into work last minute for a car issue which i got reprimanded and the second issue was because i needed to make sure a relative didnt have covid because i was around them. I got written up and they told me they would fire me if I called in again. Well. I had to call in again because of covid symptoms. I told the boss if covid symptoms is not a valid excuse for calling into work, then i cant work there. I care about the clients health and if it takes me quitting to protect them I had to. You should not send employees to work or threatened them with termination. Im a hard worker so its really sad to see great people like myself to quit. Lastly, is the driving. I would drive about an 1 hour to get to a clients house. Like i said before I loved the job and I know some caregivers dont do right. They dont clean or take care of the clients like they should. So I stayed because there is not enough good in this work place. All in all it was the company saying I have one more call in and they have to fire me. If im sick i cant be around the elderly. They are vulnerable. They need to rethink their procedures.\n\nNow i dont get unemployment, i cant qualify because i receive the Post 9/11 bill money for school. I cant receive unemployment because i am in school and veterans are not allowed to double dip. Meaning i cant get free money from the Post 9/11 bill and money from unemployment. Like i said before i work because I care.\n\nOn a positive these are quotes I picked up:\n\nThe price you pay for the job you have\n\nCold hands, warm heart, dirty sweetheart\n\nKeshia", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1603139866776, "text": "Keshia, we also enjoyed you working for Senior Helpers. We were very proud to have a veteran join our team. The Federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. We do pay our employees this for training pay ONLY but once you complete the hiring process and start working with our clients you receive the wage that was discussed during your interview. We do not have a single employee that is working for less than $8.50 an hour. I pulled your check stubs to make sure we did not make a mistake on your pay while you were employed with Senior Helpers and we did not, if you would like  confirmation on your check stubs we would be happy to provide that information to you please just give us a call at our Senior Helpers office (256)650-2982.\nWhen you started working with Senior Helpers we were shorter staffed due to the pandemic and caregivers quitting without notice or calling in for shifts last minute (without COVID-19 symptoms or being in contact with someone who had COVID-19).\nI am sorry you felt we lacked training. We have an entire room in our office dedicated to hands on training that you sat in during our orientation. This training room includes: a medical manikin, hospital bed, shower, shower chair, walker, wheel chair, cane, gait belt, slide board, Hoyer lift, a change of sheets to learn to change an occupied bed, \u2018depends\u2019 to practice changing and bathing clients, bed side commode to practice safely transferring clients and more are available to any caregiver who would like additional training to come and schedule a time to practice. We just ask you schedule your time in advance to ensure we have sanitized all materials and your supervisor is available to assist you.\nAs for our COVID-19 policy that you signed and received a copy of in orientation; we ask if you have been exposed or have any COVID-19 symptoms to call the office and we will send you to the nearest clinic to get tested immediately. Your supervisor actually responded to you when you called out with COVID-19 symptoms, \u201cOf course COVID is an acceptable excuse. And are you going to get tested today? If so just send me the paperwork and it will excuse you.\u201d You told us you were going to get tested but you were going to pass on coming back to work for Senior Helpers because you did not like the call-in policy. We respected your decision and removed you from the schedule and just asked as a courtesy for our clients to let us know your COVID-19 test results so we can update them if they need to be tested in the event you tested positive. You responded stating you do not have COVID-19 and have not been exposed therefore they do not need to be tested.\nDuring your interview you agreed to drive up to 30 miles to a client\u2019s home. The furthest you were asked to drive to a client was 25.7 miles and this was not your regular client.\nWe thought you were a great a caregiver to our clients in the short time you worked for Senior Helpers and you are right, you did truly care for your clients which we greatly appreciated. I am sorry you felt the need to quit from a misunderstanding you may have had with the attendance policy. We wish you nothing but the best in the future for your nursing career. And if you have any other concerns, we hope you will please call us at our office (256)650-2982 and we will be happy to address this with you."}, "gmap_id": "0x886212cefb240ae1:0xf5f9c3acb77b2f17"}
