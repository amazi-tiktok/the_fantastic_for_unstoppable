The \"ala carte\" choosing of the services they provide was so user friendly.  All communication was done by email so everything was clear for me.  I didn't rely on any  verbal committments, it was all recorded in emails.  The price...frankly I don't know.  I live by the motto you get what you pay for....I love capitalism.  And if I paid more than other services, I don't care....I got what I paid for....a wonderful experience.  Our services included a DJ, lights, sound system, and mirror photo booth.\nThe DJ set up was compact, high quality and the DJ screened the music for me...(i had enough on my plate).  Their website allowed my daughter to upload a spotify playlist easily and he screened it.  It also allowed a timeline that he respected and utilized..  The website has event planning section ......It was great.  I wish I was gifted at writing so I could paint a picture of what a wonderful experience but.....I had a wonderful experience and will recommend and utilize them a hundred times over!!!  We also utilized the Mirror Photo Booth...so fun.  Great props, assistance at it's side the entire time, easily usable, I am so glad I upgraded to this but I am sure the starter photo selection is great too but I am glad I upgraded to this one.  They designed a stamp for each of the photos customized to our event and they initiated that process and went with it without much of my involvement because I didn't have time.  The individuals who worked the event were dressed appropriately for the event, cordial, available, cooperative....I appreciated them handling EVERYTHING.  It made it worth every penny.\nMy ONLY suggestion would be to work with them on customizing your props for the event.  That was a shortcoming on my part not theirs.  Their props were great but looking back, I wish I had included some things that were directed toward this group of seniors.\nI can't thank them enough for working with us on providing these high school seniors a winter dance that had been cancelled by those around them twice who were more concerned about perceptions of participating in a \"super spreader event\".

He performed at two of our friends weddings and obviously, recently at my own wedding. He set up the mood for the perfect party; one that my wife and I had desired. Everyone danced right right until the end.

What I loved about the website was that you could instantly find out if the booth was available for your event and how much it would cost. I also was very happy that this company was willing to travel to Huntsville, approximately 1.5hrs away from Birmingham, for my event.\n\nFrom the very beginning, Andre was courteous and professional.  This company definitely understands customer service and it shows! They provided an easy and convenient method to pay for the services online which I appreciated. They also showed up early to the event just to make sure everything was in its proper place.\n\nThe mirror booth was a real hit with my guests. Everyone absolutely loved it!

We hired Brandon Dunn as our DJ for both our ceremony and the reception after I saw his services first hand at my best friend's wedding a couple of years ago. We were blown away by how awesome he was! And then our wedding planner (Becky's Brides) recommended him as well, so of course we immediately knew we had to hire him. Needless to say, best. choice. ever!! I have been to weddings with DJs who are not as awesome as Brandon, and you never realize how important the DJ is for the overall vibe and energy of the party until you hear a bad one - haha. Those experiences made me even more thankful that we went with WellDunn because it made all of the difference in the energy of our wedding! Everyone was talking about how awesome Brandon was. He is simply fun and a joy to work with. He is also a genuinely good guy and I can't imagine what our wedding would have been like without him. I was a COVID bride and I was all the more thankful for his empathy and flexibility when we had to postpone our wedding to October. I have to say it was all worth the wait! The highlight of the night was when Brandon let me take over the DJing and the crowd went wild!! Those are some of my favorite pictures from the entire night.

They played at our wedding reception - very reasonable in price, played great songs, worked with us in advance, showed up early and stayed late.

When it came time to pick a DJ for our wedding, it was an easy choice!  We already knew how much fun trivia was with Tim, but we were blown away by the great music and professional service at the wedding.  The equipment was top of the line and sounded perfect.  Everybody could hear the service through the wireless mic system, and the reception equipment could probably have blown the roof off if we wanted it to, but it was kept at a perfect level so you could still talk to people around the dance floor.  Clear sound with no distortion whatsoever (and I'm really picky about sound systems, it's part of what I do for a living).  Celebration Crew gets an A+ from me.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88f56bc9bcdd9a25:0x6abce010b6691fac"}
