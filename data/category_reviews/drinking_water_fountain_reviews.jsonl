I chose AON over their competition, not because their system was far superior to others, but rather for the simple reason they went to great lengths to explain how the system would be installed.\n\nAlso understanding that they are a plumbing business first, and a water softener supplier second, gave me the reassurance the job would be done right and to my complete satisfaction.   Not only has the system perform flawlessly, I also killed two birds with one stone when they installed the loop system with my exterior main water line.  They were able to remove a \"frozen/corroded \" flow valve outside and replace it with a ball valve, mounted on the inside of the house, which sits right next to my system for easy access.\n\nI'm hoping this review helps other folks that are stratling the fence.

Overall, very good product and I'm happy with the product.  Customer service is sometimes excellent and sometimes poor.\n\nPro: AON's water softener is a very good product.  They bent over backwards to send a guy over to defrost my outside pipes in the middle of a Winter freeze!\n\nCon:  The whole-house water softener developed a leak after 18 months and the top part of the valve unit had a recall and required service.  They were not able to schedule the repair for nearly a month due to company manpower issues.  Parts were covered but labor was not.  AON charged more per hour than my local HVAC and autobody shops at $112 per hour.  Their service techs did a good job repairing my softener, but broke all the pipe half clamps that secure the pipes to the wall, and did not replace them.  ($2.50 worth of clamps - should have replaced them)!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626c91d840bec9:0xd90edadc72172ece"}
