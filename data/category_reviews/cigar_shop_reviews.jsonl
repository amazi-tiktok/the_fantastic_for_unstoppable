DONT GO TO ABC OR ABC SPIRITS or whatever that place is called - thats on 231. I mean its good but so far NO liquor store has compared to this one. Just come here. TRUST. ME.\n\nFull Review:\nI just went here for the first time today. As in just left. I loved this place SO SO SO MUCH. I was telling myself I must do a review as soon as I get home. What this place has to offer is so much! I just bought soju from there! And it was not terribly price. The only place I could find it was at a Korean restaurant (that was called Kalim Garden. And I would buy unopened bottles from them. I also got 2 different bottles of sake. Which I couldn't be more happy about! There is White Claw here. They still have it in stock despite the fact that there is currently a shortage. The guy inside (I didn't get his name was so friendly. This is also a place you can get CBD & vape products. I actually bought a pack of prerolles hempettes. It looked like they have 4 brands to choose from. I have tried a lot of the hempette brands and listen to me!! - just buy the red pack. Stunna Bubba Kush. I have tried the other ones pure hemp is pretty good but there are a lot stems in it even tho they claim theres not, wild hemp brand is just...really tame. Flavor is worst than the \"Pure Hemp\" brand. So that's usually just what ive been forced to get around here. HOWEVER I am currently smoking one of these Stunnas. The flavor - very good. Would rate 4/5 bc its good but it is def no premium ish. Stem wise give a 3/5 I'm hearing tons of little pops.... But nothing like the Pure Hemp brand. Price I give 5/5 stars. This one was $13.99 I think. The other brands I have mentioned were $9.99. Which is typical but very decently priced compared to other hemp shops ive been to. So just pay the extra $4 for the red one if you are interested.\n\nAlso as for how the store looks and atmosphere wise - AMAZING. hate that google is a 5 star system bcuz that for sure is a 10 star - no 11 stars for the atmosphere of the place. Employee also seems to be very knowledgeable although I didnt have to ask many questions bc I knew what I was going for and know my alcohol. But they had things in there I have never tried before. So that excited me a lot.\n\nI will be putting the TLDR at the top of my review as well in case no one reads this novella of a review. \ud83d\ude02 but if you need to go to a liquor store. DONT GO TO ABC OR ABC SPIRITS or whatever that place is called - thats on 231. I mean its good but so far NO liquor store has compared to this one. Just come here. TRUST.

The gentleman behind the counter walked me thru a selection of starter pipes, what to look for when purchasing a pipe and what they offered for my future needs. In fact, he was so helpful and informative that after talking to him for a little while it dawned on me that I had been burned (no pun intended) by the shop where I made my initial purchase. It may have beeen textbook salesmanship, I don't know but I ended up buying a new pipe with accessories and he threw in a bag of tobacco of my choice and a cool little box to store it in for free. All of that, and I still came out much cheaper with a better quality pipe than I purchased just the day before. Not only was the staff friendly but the customers who were there, all of which the salesman new by name, drew me in and not only helped me pick out a good starter tobacco but showed me how to pack it correctly and gave me a bag or two of their own to try.
