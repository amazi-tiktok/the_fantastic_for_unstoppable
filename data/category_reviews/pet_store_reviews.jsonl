The workers leave dogs in pee and poop filled kennels for hours before they are cleaned.\nThe dogs don't go outside from 4pm to 7am the next day.\nThey have had 2 cases of kennel cough since spring break, and have still been using the same sponge to clean all of the dog bowls.\nIf your dog is having a health issue while boarding, the workers will not tell you about it if they don't think it's serious. There are dogs who get incredibly sick either from stress or other health problems that result in blood in the vomit and/or stool. The only thing they do is take the dogs food and water away and don't let them outside.\nThe dogs water bowls are only checked at 7am and then again at 4pm. So your dog may be going without water for any number of hours between those times and the workers will ignore it. The bowls are only cleaned once per day, so if your dog is boarding for several days, there's a very good chance that they'll have the same bowl of water over the course of their stay. They have a major rat problem there, so often times there is rat feces in the water bowls.\nThe dogs are left alone all night with the rats, which your dogs could be eating over night, making them very sick and possibly catching diseases.\nThe workers do not have first aid training, so if your dog chokes on the mulch that is outside in the play area, then they are told to \"look up an instructional video\" to help the choking dog.\nThey don't pay attention to what the dogs are doing because they're too busy on their phones to care. So if your dog poops mulch (very bad for his digestive system) then it's because they were eating it from the play area. There are also several dogs who eat poop, so if your dog has that habit, it's probably only getting worse because they think they're allowed to do it while staying there.\nWhen the dogs are playing outside, they are sometimes not given water for several hours due to certain dogs not liking the water hose.\nI have witnessed a coworker giving the wrong dog her medicine. Once that realization was made, still nothing was done about it.\nIf your dog is not good with other dogs, they are set as \"individuals\" where they play by themselves. These dogs are only getting 10 minutes outside to play, and then they get 10 minutes inside to play. They are supposed to have another 10 minutes to play but are usually skipped because the workers want to go home early. So if your dog is boarding over the weekend and they're not good with other dogs, then they're only getting about 20 minutes of outside time every day while the other dogs get over 2 hours.\nThe weekend hours are different, so all of the play groups are shortened and the dogs are left alone for a lot longer than they normally would be.\nTheir medicine is put in pill pockets in their food. If the dog doesn't voluntarily eat the pill pockets, then that dog will not be getting their medicine that day.\nThe dogs only have access to their food for a couple hours a day. So if your dog is a grazer and doesn't eat all of their food at once then they will be eating very little over the course of their stay.\nThe kennels are painted very poorly, paint is always chipping off the walls, usually because dogs are chewing it off.\nWorkers regularly spray dogs in the face with Bitter Apple spray. This spray is supposed to be used for dogs that have problems chewing their fur, and is not meant to be sprayed in the eyes or nose of the dogs, but they are regularly sprayed in the face if they are barking in their kennels.\nIf you request for your dog to be given a bath, they will usually bathe the dogs very early in the day to get it out of the way. Once they're bathed, they are not allowed back outside and their food and water bowls are taken away. So if you dropped your dog off at 8am to be picked up around 5pm, there's a good chance that your dog hasn't been outside or had food or water since about 10am.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1519324162478, "text": "Hi Lori, I wanted to reply here as well since I did not hear back from you regarding this same review you left on Facebook.\nI'm truly sorry this is how you felt about working at CDT.\n\nAs one of the owners, and the person responsible for systems management in the locations I am very upset to hear these things.

Again, we are very sorry this happened during Chopper\u2019s visit to Lucky Dog back in January. It is never a good day when a pup goes home with a boo boo. We strive to be as gentle and safe with the pets in our care as we can, but unfortunately, sometimes these things do happen and it breaks our hearts. You did fail to mention, though, that your Schnauzer is a puppy, was in for his first ever haircut and had barely been handled prior coming here. This, of course, does not excuse the incident, but it does give context to the situation. Schnauzers get a very short blade on their heads and Chopper was in the process of having his head shaved when he jerked in reaction to a sound in the salon causing his groomer to lightly graze the edge of the top of his ear. Our Salon Manager handled Chopper\u2019s service and her incident rate was zero for the last year until this happened for which she was upfront and honest with you about and you told us you understood and even re-booked your next appointment. It was an incredibly minor nick as her reflexes are quick and it did not bleed. Again, we are very sorry that this happened to Chopper. We take things like this very seriously as it hurts us to see it happen, too. No groomer ever wants to accidentally injure a dog while in their care, but again, unfortunately, it is a trade risk when working with wiggly animals, especially puppies, and surgically sharpened equipment. Again, we deeply apologize and hope that you\u2019ll reconsider letting us take care of Chopper in the future. Additionally, I urge you to compare our reviews to those of the salon you recommended. You\u2019ll find they too have incidents happen and yours is our first complaint since we\u2019ve been open. Thanks again for your feedback. \u2764\ufe0f"}, "gmap_id": "0x8889159a6a1efbd1:0x684b11aa61d529a9"}

I blame myself because I waited until the last minute to make a boarding appointment at my usually facility, which is Golden Animal Hospital in Pike Road(great service and care everytime!). We boarded our 18 month old golden doodle for 10 days. He was supposed to be groomed the last day he was there. We keep his hair long so he was only supposed to be washed and trimmed.\n\nWhen I dropped him off, the receptionist was nice enough but the place smelled very bad. I've used several dog care facilities since we're new to Montgomery and the Bakery was by far the worst in cleanliness.  The dogs and the administration area are all in one. This created a very unorganized check-in since the receptionist was moving, picking up and pushing dogs off the counter the entire check-in. I looked over this because we were literally flying out of town the same day.\n\n10 days later, I called to the Barkery know I was headed to pick my dog up. They told me that they had to cut his hair down low because he had a few matted areas on his legs. I didn't like that but its understandable. I arrive to the counter and the owner hands me a bag of hair to \"prove\" how bad the matts were! They brought my dog out and he was literally shaved down to skin\ud83d\ude25 It was so sad! They didn't even grind or clip his nails. It was clear that they had no clue what they were doing. They couldn't find his collar and leash. They said that I must have taken it with me. I usually take them with me at my normal grooming place but I thought I remembered leaving them. I didn't take the time to debate the point because I was almost numb at the sight of my dog. I just kept telling myself, \"This is your fault for waiting too long to make an appointment and taking him to the ONLY place that had an opening\" Now I know why they had an opening. For the life of me, I can not figure out how people are giving this place good reviews.\n\nWhen I get home and the family and I console each other, lol.....I find my dogs collar and flea collar buried in his door food that I had left with the Barkery. My dog also wouldn't eat for days after we got him back and he was sick for at least a week. He sneezing and vomiting. Btw, he smelled horrible. I was trying to figure out what they used to wash him and if they actually bathed him the day before I picked him up.\n\nThis was the worst experience ever and I would learn to groom my own dog if this was the only place open. On top of all of this, the receptionist and owner never apologized for the haircut. They basically blamed me because I let him get matts.\n\nWorst experience ever!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81ba3e5eea13:0x87de1146e68cc888"}

Around 7 I went back to Barkery, and Kimberly and her significant other, Jake arrived( how she had time to go get her boyfriend while she claimed she was looking for my dog, not sure). Kimberly ran inside the building, never spoke, never apologized and sent Jake, who is not an owner of The Barkery,  to \"deal\" with us. Apparently, Kimberly had lied to Jake and told him that she was threatened by myself on the phone and was called a b****h, which was untrue, I was actually quite pleasant all considered. When Kimberly finally came outside, I asked her was she ever threaten or called any obscenity and she said no that never happened. Jake went off to smoke his KOOL cigarette, because the whole reason he came was because of her lie.Why Kimberly would make herself to be the victim when she lost my dog is beyond me. Kimberly yelled us, blamed us,  cursed, and never once apologized. I understand that things happen, but if you're a dog sitter and you lose the dog, you need to take some form of responsibility and at least be sorry and try to help. Instead of being concerned,  Kimberly(owner) and her daughter, and another staff member keep screaming about their \"Livelihood\".  Thankfully, me and my family were able to go out looking at 6:00 am and posting lost posters and found Midnight near Huntingdon College. The staff members saw us looking for our dog, offered no help, and still no apology.  Today is July 9, and The Barkery has never followed up, or showed any concern for their negligence. My dog refuses to leave me or my sisters side since this event, so I'd advise you to find another place to drop off your four legged family member.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81ba3e5eea13:0x87de1146e68cc888"}
