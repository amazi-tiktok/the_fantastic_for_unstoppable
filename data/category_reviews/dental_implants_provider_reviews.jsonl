I asked about prices for the procedure and inquired about getting an implant down the road. The lady I spoke with gave me a quote for everything including the bone graph required to have an implant done when healed. The price she gave me was $415, I do have dental insurance, but it still seemed lower than I was expecting. I asked her again to make sure I heard her correctly and wrote down everything she told me. Well I get there this morning and the Dr comes in to go over everything they are going to do and then another lady comes in to go over pricing again and get my payment info. She informs me that she saw the quote I was given in my notes, but she didn't know where the other lady had gotten those figures because they were not correct. She informs me it was going to be $992 for the exact same thing I was already quoted the much lower price of. I told her that I was not paying that price so she does some figuring on the computer and tells me $650ish without the bone graph to which I replied, I'm still not paying that price, she needs to go talk to the lady who quoted me the other price. She walks out for a few minutes and comes back in and says the other lady is not there today, but they can do everything but the graph for $476. I declined that price again and told her they should have to honor the price I was quoted, especially if it was in my notes. She said they could not do that, that it was just an estimate. Well I'm sorry, being quoted one price weeks ago only to get there today and it has more than doubled, is not an estimate to me. They never said it was an estimate, they specifically used the word quote! Needless to say, I am still dealing with a broken tooth because I refuse to pay more than double what I was told it was going to cost me out of pocket.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a83fef37800d:0x51e8a2ea70656792"}

( she said they would call later the day prior) Of course that didn\u2019t happen. At the appointment they gave me a price to pay (before they would see one child). I paid it, shortly after I was asked to pay for the other child\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f after she finished her appointment! One would think they would let me know both prices and pay for them together. Talking about frustrated with these people!!!!

I have a rare genetic disease that unfortunately my daughter has the gene for and if not carefully watched certain medications given can turn the gene into the disease. I wasn\u2019t informed what type of medications they planned to give her prior to the procedure when I asked to know the nurse seemed to have an attitude and reluctantly told me to come back to see. While back there talking about the list with the doctor the incompetent nurse proceeded to start my daughters I.V. Instead of at least waiting until we had finished determining if the medications were indeed okay all while rolling her eyes. Which was so disrespectful I can\u2019t even imagine how such a person in a field of care could show such disregard but I guess that\u2019s how she was raised to be. I\u2019m not sure. However, there are two office staff members that are always most helpful that sit on the side. The lady at the front when you walk in was not very thorough she didn\u2019t make sure I had the cost information prior to the day of the procedure in writing (I had to ask for it as well as the code explanations), she also didn\u2019t make sure my daughter had an excuse for school but did offer one to the Caucasian lady that came in after me just not to me for some reason \ud83d\ude12. However the lovely lady on the side provided what I needed which I am most grateful for. As I said there are good staff members it\u2019s just probably half good, half bad but the doctor was nice 50% of his staff I would say need some serious retraining and empathy towards others if they are going to stay in that field or look for another industry where care isn\u2019t essential.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886213520971870f:0x1444005ad0a93d19"}

His arrogance and lack of empathy made for terrible bedside manner. After removing all four of our 16 year old daughters wisdom teeth on July 3rd, she was in recovery longer than anticipated. I waited patiently until I was called back to sit with her. She apparently hadn\u2019t  tolerated the  Anastasia well. They released her to be taken home while her eyes were literally still rolling back in her head as the nurses walked her out. Over the long holiday weekend, dry sockets formed. I realize this is something that sometimes happens and isn\u2019t necessarily the fault of the surgeon. My daughter was in agony, with pain medication doing nothing to dull her pain. When I called the after hours emergency number, listed on the discharge instructions sheet provided to us, they were completely useless. I seriously don\u2019t even know why they have one. I was rudely told twice, once by the after hours staff member who answered the phone and again by Dr. Hudson himself to \u201ccall the office during regular business hours to schedule an appointment. \u201c  At that point, I debated going on to the ER, but decided to have her at Dr. Hudson office as soon as they opened the following morning. We arrived 15 minutes prior to opening, signed in 2nd, only to be \u201cworked in\u201d to the schedule. While my daughter sat in the waiting room in misery, no urgent attention was shown. When we were finally called back, dr. Hudson examined and packed a bottom socket. My daughter did not receive relief as the dr. and his staff insisted she would. She kept trying to tell them the pain was coming from the upper socket which Dr Hudson and his assistant would NOT hear of, nor would he even look at.  They told us repeatedly she was wrong, and the pain she felt wasn\u2019t coming from the upper socket, bc it was basically unheard of to develop an upper dry socket. They also repeatedly tried to get us to leave,  saying she would feel better in 15-30 minutes. I finally stated that I wasn\u2019t leaving with her until I knew she was relieved. Dr. Hudson then SHOVED his hand into the top of her mouth asking \u201cis THIS where you\u2019re uncomfortable?!?\u201d She grimaced and moaned in pain and tears flowed. Even I began crying just watching the scene. I absolutely was in shock and disbelief at what had just happened. Then, he stepped back and admitted it appeared to be an upper dry socket. He also admitted he couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d packed an upper, and that he didn\u2019t know that he ever had. Once it was packed, she did get relief from the pain within a few minutes. I suppose Dr. Clint Hudson is an adequate surgeon so long as the patient doesn\u2019t have any complications from the surgery, and if the complications aren\u2019t rare or unusual. If there are complications, better hope they only occur during regular office hours. Since there is no way of knowing beforehand if these will occur, I\u2019d suggest finding a different oral surgeon. I believe in giving credit where it is due, and there was an assistant who works for Dr. Hudson named Micki who was very sweet and sympathetic. On the flip side, another who I believe name was Jan was as rude and uncaring as the Dr. himself.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886213520971870f:0x1444005ad0a93d19"}

But none the less as a dental professional I am willing to provide a service.\n\nWhen a person has a throbbing pain in their mouth it needs to be diagnosed properly.  The first goal is to stop the pain and do a thorough exam once the pain has been relieved! And as for the fee you stated you were charged $150.00. Please note $150.00 is less than $275.00.  Simple or routine tooth extractions cost any were from $100.00 dollars to $450.00 dollars depending on the complexity of the procedure. A surgical extraction requires the removal of gum tissue and or bone. They are time-consuming, tedious, delicate, and cost more! Note this is why an examination is needed in advance.\n\nIn closing the statement you made referring to me as a crook is negative, derogatory, and inapprioate. It violates Google review policy. I will address this with the appropriate departmet!"}, "gmap_id": "0x88891c14416b545d:0x59582aad8561f7af"}

Upon reviewing my x-rays he quickly observed a new area of concern, which had not been brought to my attention by the referring physicians, and to their credit, it may not have been noticeable on other visits. However, Dr. Nazam reassured me that he would take care of everything. He and his dental/surgical team all have great bedside manners,. They equally helped to put me at ease with their warm, funny and engaging dialogue. Lastly, Dr. Sami personally contacted me the evenings of each procedure, I was pleasantly shocked and excited to have my him call to inquire how I was doing as the pain was intense. He explained what he saw during the procedures, what was done to resolve the issues, what to expect over the next few days, and how to address any concerns I may further encounter.  Wow!!!  His follow-up actions spoke volumes to me, VOLUMES...! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd   Thank you for making me feel like a part of your family.

I have no knowledge of how to care for oral postop things, but my mom's a nurse so i know these things can go smoothly or horribly depending on the patient's choices after surgery - behavior that is usually informed by the advise of medical staff, since the general populace is presumably ignorant (safest assumption). I asked if I needed to replace the gauze as soon as we got home, and was about to ask what all he needed to avoid doing. The nurse quickly said, cordially but also sharply such that she cut me off before i could ask, \"everything you need to know is written on this sheet\" and told me to call if I had questions. Well, long story short he ended up using a straw and doing a few other things I had no idea he wasn't supposed to, because i didn't //know// those were things i needed to ask about, and the sheet made no mention of any of them. I am now unsure how much of his pain is a natural consequence, and how much is our fault. So now we're keeping an eye on, questioning every symptom, which is stressful for both of us.

During that time, the intent was to keep my teeth and gums as healthy as possible. Regularly scheduled deep cleaning worked. However, my doctor retired and the new staff had different ideas. The regularly scheduled deep cleaning was no longer an option, and within a couple of years my teeth deteriorated to the point where it was embarrassing to even smile. The new staff recommended extractions, at first only a few teeth. Ultimately, they planned to extract all my teeth and do implants. I agreed to have the first three teeth extracted. That was the beginning of a horrible time for me. After the extractions I bled profusely and was in a lot of pain. For two weeks I continued to bleed on and off. I was frightened ,I could not eat, and I was miserable. As time passed it didn't get much better, and I was not myself, as I was normally very outgoing and talkative, but now became very uncomfortable around people. The staff then recommended extracting the rest of my teeth and doing implants. But I was afraid of what might happen after the last experience. I thought, \"if I bled so profusely from 3 extractions, how would my body react to all my teeth being extracted\". The thoughts going through my head were all scary and uncertain. I sought out other opinions, but did not have a good feeling with anyone. Finally, in late 2016, I met with Dr. Sam Nizam. When we met, I immediately felt the connection, and I was comfortable. Dr. Sam listened to all my concerns attentively. I knew the qualities in a doctor that I was looking for and Dr. Sam had all of them. Dr. Sam sat me down and explained step by step what he recommended and how the procedures would be done. He was so calm and confident, and did not sugar coat anything. He explained that I needed 26 extractions, and why. He explained that I needed bone grafting for the implants to take, where he would need to do the grafting, and why. He explained that I needed a sinus lift, and where and why. Also, he showed me visually on the computer and pointed out exactly where my implants would be placed, to have the best chance of success. He explained how all procedures would be done at the same time. I was still nervous about the whole process, but I had total confidence in Dr. Sam and agreed to schedule it as soon as possible. It was February, 2018. I was in surgery for 5 1/2 hours. He performed all the work that he had explained to me. I went home, knowing I was in good hands and that I was going to be fine. But I was just a little nervous, thinking I might bleed. Dr. Sam prescribed pain killers, which I took that night and went to sleep. I awoke after a peaceful night sleep. My bleeding was the size of a dime!. I had minimal pain. I stopped taking the pain killers. I went back for a follow up. Dr. Sam was pleased with the results and so was I. No pain, no bleeding, the implants (all 11 of them) all took. I now have new teeth. I can smile again. I can speak without fear and embarrassment. At my daughter's wedding I was able to proudly smile and laugh all night! Dr. Sam gave me my life back! I am myself again! Thank you!! I will always be grateful to Dr. Sam for the incredible work he did, that now gives me the chance to enjoy life as I had not been able to do for so long. If I ever have a problem, even though I now live many states away in New Jersey, I would not hesitate to make the trip. I recommend Dr. Sam highly . He has been blessed with a tremendous talent and gift to help people. I wish him all the best,and pray that his success helps thousands more like me in the future. - Linda K", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXOD5MDeQykhOWyJzNjQ_ZTNsvFxMngiU7Owt6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2b3cc3f973f1:0xa4ac2f65d2cc478d"}

I got my boyfriend home and about an hour later he went to remove his gauze and noticed they had FORGOTTEN TO REMOVE TWO OF HIS TEETH.

Not once did they say out loud they forgot anything, they just quietly whisked him back and seemed to want to keep everything hush hush (again, trying to leave early).
