I described my problem and he assured me he could fix it. I told him I worked quite a ways away so I'd drop it off in the morning (which was a Saturday). He said \"thats fine but I won't be here. I'll look at it when I come back\". I agreed and we hung up. So I went on Saturday around 1130 am (the man said they opened at 10 am) and the lights were off and door was locked. So I called a few times with no answer. Fast forward to the following Tuesday (I worked from home that day) I went to the store to drop it off....it was about 2 PM. The door was locked and lights were on. Another lady (probably in her 70s) was standing there with me and we were discussing the fact the door was locked and why. So I put my face to the glass and saw someone so I knocked. A young man came to the door and mouthed something about an errand (we couldn't hear him thru the glass). After a few times of yelling \"WHAT, WE CANT HEAR YOU\" I yelled \"CAN YOU CRACK THE DOOR OPEN AND TELL US WHAT YOU ARE SAYING?\" well...he didn't...he yelled thru the door louder that it would be 25 or 30 minutes til someone came back. Not really sure why HE couldn't open the door so we could leave our vacs but she and I looked at each other and said to each other as we left that we won't be back. For me it was about a 20 minute drive to get there from my house. The ONLY reason they get a star is because of the super nice man on the phone. I ended up taking it to Fairhope (I work in Daphne) and they were nice and open!\n\n**thank you for such a nice response. I'm sorry it didn't work out this time. I will definitely keep you in mind in the future. All your son had to do was open the door and tell us what he was trying to say. The nite he was pointing to said \"will return by 1130\". When I questioned him about it he said it was an old note. Also there are sooooo many notes on the door its hard to know what is what. Maybe clean it up a bit. No one will stop to read all that.

The truck air conditioning part wasn\u2019t coming in until the 21st and it came in Yesterday and so it was able to be fixed today but when it was ready at 2:00 I put a sign on the door and locked it because the vacuum man and I are the only ones that run the store during the week and if I didn\u2019t get him to take me to get my truck I wouldn\u2019t have any vehicles or a way home I had no customers and the trip to pick it up is about 30 minutes. I have tried leaving the store open with my 15 year old and my husband who cannot get around but it doesn\u2019t work I get 50 phone calls because someone needs something they can\u2019t find or a software question if it was only repair machines to be dealt with I would not mind it but it never is so I told my son leave the door locked I will be back in 30 minutes. I had to get my truck and if I waited I would not have any one to take me to pick it up.

I apologize for the situation but it is what it is and I would rather be at the store instead of dealing with 2 vehicles and repairs this week but no matter how you feel I after a month I have air conditioning in the truck and it\u2019s wonderful and my van is still in the shop"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a527e86a298c1:0xc35dac5cfcaea79"}

In less than 30 minutes, we were up and running with perfect calibration- and it saved us $675.
