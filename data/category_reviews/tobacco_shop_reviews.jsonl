His reasoning was he couldn\u2019t confirm I didn\u2019t break it and was just trying to get another battery. He also said it could be the charger, after which I told him the charger worked fine.  He said if I would have returned it that night or the next morning, maybe. Which makes no sense. Wheather it was the next day or three days later. I assumed it would work since it was brand new out of the box. That\u2019s just bad business. And I will NEVER shop there again. How can you not refund or AT LEAST just exchange a $10 battery that was broken right out of the box.

Since then, Bill has become a friend, not just a shop owner.\n\nPrices are a bit above average, but that's because Bill and his team take a great deal of time ensuring that every product meets their high standards of quality.\n\nThe selection is great. Pipes, vape juice, super-fresh RYO tobacco, rolling machines, and excellent cigars, even vintage memorabilia and lighters. If he doesn't have it, he'll order it for you. You can shop online, pay exorbitant shipping for stale products, or you can come here, and leave happy every time.\n\nThe cigar selection is amazing, and they just got a new humidor, and are likely stocking it as I type.\n\nIf you're a connoisseur of tobacco, and are looking for a local tobacconist who cares more about your satisfaction than the mighty dollar, this is the best place in town.

This is a serious problem because most people use their debit cards and a lot of people are members of the smart spin club such as myself which you have to input your phone number in order to receive your coupons that you've clipped and some earned by free spins!!! By the machine being down this is not possible. I spend$50 plus dollars a week in Family Dollar and I want to use my coupons. This really is an outrage how corporate the district manager or whomever has let this problem linger so long. I spent almost$80 yesterday and the cashier was really sweet because she manually gave me the smart spin coupons but the rude store manager gets upset because it was a long line behind me. How about you get on the other register and take care of the guests because I wanted my coupons and she was only doing her job... The nerve of her. Take that anger and frustration out on corporate or whomever is responsible for taking care of this issue. You're already losing money don't due to something you can't control but don't lose more customers because of your terrible attitude.

He even watched customers to their cars to be sure they made it safely which is a big thing as this area has had an big increase in crime lately. Let me not forget about the cashier, she was very talkative and interactive woth the customers and coworkers.  It just seem like these had some kind of joy on them.

Not one person disrespected me or treated me like I was insane for wearing things to keep the rain and cold off of me. When I finally entered the Standish meant, one of the persons within the store, was very helpful and considerate and help me find the products that I need. They treated me like a human and respected me. I thanked them for their help several times. When I went to check out was when everything changed. I was scolded for wearing a hoodie and not seeing a sign that says no hoodies by a gentleman and a blonde old lady. Granted if I had seen the sign, it would\u2019ve told me right away what it truly means: No PoC. I wouldn\u2019t have walked in and took my business elsewhere. This store is in a predominately PoC neighborhood and they band people from wearing hoodies, even on rainy days. That should tell you the type of people they dont want to enter their store, even though they are surrounded by nothing but PoC. I even went back inside and said how rude it is to treat people that way. I even bought stuff with my Navy Fed card, and they showed no respect, and talked down to me like I was a second rate citizen. I never been so humiliated for just trying to stay dry.

I called up there and asked him why would he take her money and not correctly fix her phone causing more problems than before. The man went on stating he didn\u2019t break her speaker but the person prior to him who fixed her phone damaged her speaker and camera. Now prior to him fixing my daughters phone, my son fixed her screen 8months ago and everything worked fine. I relayed this information to him in hopes of him reopening her phone to find the problem. He again stated, he will not. It will cost another $49.99. I asked for the manager. He replied he\u2019s the owner. I said so your not gonna do anything about not fixing my daughters phone correctly. He said no. Unless you pay $49.99, there\u2019s nothing else I can do. I said sir, do you know you just crushed a 15 year old lil girls heart who tried to do the right thing on her own?

I have been a long time customer (approx. 6-8yrs) of the Discount Tobacco store and I must say the customer service/cashier whose name is Nicole is amazingly nice and respectful. When it was just her and Smokey running the store,  those times were great and service was always 5 Stars, most definitely than any other store within this county. With Smokey no longer working there, I just hope they keep Nicole there because it wouldn't be the same without either 1 of them. I see them both as the backbone of this business and the reason it's as successful as it is today.

My wife is black and both cashiers were also, but I'm not. After  seeing proof from a doctor,  they still refused to help me even though they asked me for it. After I walked out they eventually checked her out. Now I'm no expert on discrimination,  but they saw us walk in together and she put one on but I didn't and I would think that they would have been able to figure out why I didn't,  but they didn't even ask.
