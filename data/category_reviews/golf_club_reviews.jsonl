By the time you finish hole, its a 3 second cart ride to snacks and drinks waiting for you. Very nice locker room in the clubhouse, with built-in, wooden lockers.

I went out to the course and spoke to the gentlemen about the incident.  They were delayed only 5 minutes from their tee time.  My worker could have had a cooler head dealing with customers, but an apology was made and the men appeared to be happy that I looked into the situation. I offered to buy them a round of beers as a friendly gesture.   I am more than willing to accept a one star review than cower to a person trying to extort money in lieu of a bad review.
