I was told by all four people that the deposit was necessary because people bring their computers there and never come to pick them up. I pointed out that was not the case here. I then asked if I could come there and purchase the power supply for $80 minus the $35 that had already been paid. At first the answer was yes you can do that but we won\u2019t guarantee the part. I said I was fine with that. As the conversation progressed and I pressed for a solid answer on the purchase person number four (apparently the top of the ladder there) he began to to fish tail. He said power supplies can range in price. I reminded him the technician actually showed the power supply to my son that was needed for his computer. The price tag said $80. He said you can bring the computer back and we will look at it before the EOB today. At this point I wouldn\u2019t trust these people to hold a penny. Person number four hung up me. It\u2019s a scam.

They did the same troubleshooting things that I did and came to the same conclusion I did: a new motherboard would fix the problem. I accepted my fate. That was on Friday. On Monday I called and asked if there were anymore developments. They said the motherboard was the issue and that I could pick it up. I asked if the 30 dollars included tax. They said because it was an extended diagnostics period that the fee was now 45, to which I never agreed. I paid it anyway and when I got home I realized a fan was disconnected and so was my RGB LED strip. They didnt put them back the way I left it. On top of that, the pin header for the strip was bent and it snapped off when I tried putting it back in. I booted my system up using a different CPU and it worked fine, only I kept getting some error that wasn't there before. The broken pin and the error wasn't their fault, but they should've plugged the fan and strip back in and properly informed me  about the price hike from 30 to 45 dollars before I agreed to their terms. 3 stars because of the problems mentioned but I wont drop it down worse because I dont know how they could have fixed my computer.

No where has this picture ever been shared, sent, or even seen by another soul other than myself. That is until I took my phone to get the battery taken care of at CH PC Repair.\n\nNow I understand that this is partly my fault for leaving that picture on my phone, I accept that. I had honestly forgotten that it was on there. But I had incorrectly assumed that my personal data would remain personal while my phone was in Chad's possession, but apparently that isn't the case.\n\nWhile the battery was fixed, I've now got to live with the fact that there are not so tasteful pictures of my wife out there for the world to see thanks to some perv PC repairman. If you for some reason desire to use this child for any repair work, make sure your data is extra secure or you wipe your memory card/hard drive before you take it to him.

Everything is on his demands, but never his fault.  Respect is free, try giving it away sometime.\n\nDon't believe his stories.  He complained in LESS than a week - regarding a shipment originating in Canada - which were the terms he agreed to when he purchased (and also mirrored by the eBay shipping expected time).  But mistakes happen - all I needed was for him to say 'Sorry, my mistake'...  But he couldn't do that - preferring to say that he would be leaving negative feedback (for something he was completely wrong about).  Fortunately I had not shipped the part yet, as I was going to be in the US shortly, and able to do a much quicker & more secure USPS shipment...  But once you threaten negative feedback over something that you're wrong about, and are repeatedly unable to understand that you're in the wrong - damn right I'm canceling that order.  I have the right to \"fire\" a customer who is not conducting themselves appropriately.\n\nMost notable is the fact that negative feedback was left for me, and it took ~5 minutes for the eBay rep to review the details and get it taken down.  His complaints to eBay have resulted in absolutely zero effect on my account.  Clearly he was in the wrong in every part of this transaction, and he has YET to take responsibility or apologize for his errors.

Ordered a battery from Amazon and they couldn't get the back of the phone off.  So they call the Verizon retail store in hazel green and the girl told her to take it to ch pc repair and he would do it.  My mothers phone worked FINE when she took it in there.  She could do anything and everything on her phone.  When she went to pick it up the phone would not even turn on.   He said he tried both old and new battery and it still wouldn't come on.  So he took the screen off and put it on another phone and the screen works.  So he is saying that the mother board is messed up.  He can check it out BUT he'd have to charge her to do it.  Momma said he really messed the back up,  like it was melted!!  I met her up there and his attitude is  basically \"screw you \".  He insisted that the phone was not working when she took it in.  I asked him why he didn't call her and tell her and he said because she didnt leave a number.  To which my reply is \"when you work in customer service like this it is your responsibility to get a number so you can get in touch with the person\". He is a total jerk!!  He takes ZERO responsibility for his screw ups.  Said he was not going to make it right.  But he did tell her that he'd buy the phone from her when she bought a new one.  Then he threatened to call the cops on us \"because it was after hours, he was closed and we wouldn't leave\".  He never asked us to leave, period.  He brags about how much money he makes per year and all of his vehicles and house is paid for.  Good for him.  I dont give a \ud83d\udc01but what he has and doesn't have.  And now Marina tells us that her stepfather took a phone to him that was kinda messed up and was going to get the guy to repair it.

You came into my office, clearly disgruntled. You then continued to talk over me without giving me a chance to respond or explain the situation.\n\nPam visited my store with her device, which she believed to have a battery issue. She provided an aftermarket battery and had explained that an attempt was made, using a hairdryer, to open the casing and replace the battery, prior to me looking at the device. When the device was dropped off, I was in the middle of an extensive repair, as well as having a conversation with a different client. Not only that, but the device was dropped off quickly, without any contact information, and with very few details.\n\nI replaced the battery with the after-market battery she provided and then attempted to boot up the device, but to no avail. I investigated further but was unable to find a solution. Pam then arrived to pick up her device, and she was, understandably, very upset to find it not working. She wanted it in working order right then and there, and while I understand her sentiments, I can only do so much so quickly. I needed more time to troubleshoot and determine the problem and possible solution, but she would not allow it. I was even willing to reimburse her with a fair value for her device.\n\nI have been in business for more than 10 years now. I work hard every day, and I like to think that I am very good at what I do. I manage hundreds of computers monthly, and I repair and fix many devices daily (thousands of devices yearly). I can remove a device's back/screen in a few minutes with simply a bit of heat and some playing cards, and I have never had any issues. I would never damage a device intentionally. I treat all repairs as if they were my own. That being said, mistakes can (and do) happen as there are many risks involved with these repairs, but I do my best to make things right. To me, it's not just about collecting payment for the services I provide\u2014although that is necessary for me to stay in business and provide for my family. It's about building long-term relationships with my clients, and I deeply enjoy helping and providing knowledge to my clients.\n\nThis is the first complaint I have received with the BBB, and I would truly like to resolve the issue, and have the opportunity to change your outlook on me and your experience with my business. CH PC Repair is my business\u2014it has my name in it, a fact that I am proud of and would never change.\n\nSincerely,\nChad Harbin\nCH PC Repair"}, "gmap_id": "0x88623f52db6fed93:0x398f7a17a9216be3"}
