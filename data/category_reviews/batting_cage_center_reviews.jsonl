I've been bringing both of my kids to D-BATS SW Birmingham since they opened, and they love it.  The place has everything your kid needs to get better-- huge cages that have tees, l-screens, and coaches stools; pitching mounds are set with multiple plates, so no need to move anything if one kid pitches from 60', and the other from 50.  Four of the cages have pitching machines, so one kid can workout in a cage while the other hits off the machines.  Plus, they offer lessons, have hit-trax technology.  Great place!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1619637240683, "text": "Thank you for the review David!"}, "gmap_id": "0x88891f1f4a508159:0x10dc69b7bd7ba306"}

They held us two cages and we ran a pretty solid practice with 10 6 years olds for an hour. They had a slight scheduling mix up and had to give us one slightly smaller cage. To make up for it they gave us some some credits to hit balls from the pitching machine which was fun for the kids. All in all a great experience. Thanks again for making it work for us!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3gaRwacnoZDKlSHBEp4L0Q8QCRLSCT47Z7ca-=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1581023759714, "text": "Awesome!
