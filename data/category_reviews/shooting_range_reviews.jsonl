The touch screen interface has me sold on coming back to bullet and barrel. With just a click, the target goes the exact distance.

And with the RSOs keeping an eye on everything, it's a great environment to enjoy your firearms.\n\nI tried the 88, and it performed beautifully. I added some extra cushion due to a shoulder injury. For those that would ask, you can't shoot bird shot here. But you can fire buck shot and slugs. But I'll tell you, it's fun firing a shotgun at this range.\n\nAfterward I wandered around and struck up conversations with some of the staff, and showed me a selection for sale.

My husband and I have shot guns for years but our daughter didn't. He took the time to make sure our daughter was comfortable with our guns and gun safety! We have always gotten excellent service and are impressed by Roberts attention to detail when it comes to safety. I would NEVER want to go to a place that is lackadaisical in the importance of safety and that he is willing to turn away customers that may not take gun safety seriously. He takes the time to ask questions on your abilities and your knowledge of gun safety and is not afraid of turning someone away for the safety of others. I want to know that when I am in the lane next to someone they know what they are doing and practice proper gun safety. I don't want to accidentally get shot by someone who hasn't gone through a gun safety course and been properly trained. As a gun owner you should expect nothing less from your gun range! The extra time it takes to answer a few questions should be welcomed and not taken as a sign of disrespect.

I could get deployed today and have to fight for the very person who does not look at me as a part of the military!  I was going to let it go, but I couldn't. I called the business this afternoon and expressed how I was offended. His defense was that he was told that a reservist in the military is basically nothing but a part time position. He did offer me a full refund, but I told him that it wasn't about the money for me. He needs to do more research on his own and take care of ALL military members or no one at all!

All of the people on here crying racist are probably just people he weeded out through some very simple questions on experience and safety. My only gripe is that the range was too small to fire my new shotgun, but I knew that going in.

The only marginal benefit to this place was his stock of 7.62x54r ammo crates, which were overpriced by all means, but convient. Personally, Id recommend going to Bullseye out in MS if you want to spend a fun day at the range. Great damn people and staff there, a good amount of guns to rent, and plenty of shooters more than willing to share a few rounds from their purdy pieces with others.

The only person that I saw working in the store never asked if he could help me and there were no other customers in the store.  I had driven over an hour with the intent of renting a gun to better determine what would work best for me, since I wasn't happy with my .38 special revolver.  After perusing the gun case I finally approached the worker (who never got off his rear I might add) for help.  I explained that I had read about the business online and wanted more information about renting guns and test firing on the gun range.  It was at this point that I was told there were new requirements to be able to use the range.  First requirement was to determine why I wanted to use the range.  Second requirement was that an individual had to have someone with them with a pistol permit, to which I replied that I did.  At this point it all started to seem like he was just making things up because he had decided he wasn't about to let me use the range.  He then asked how many rounds I had shot.  I explained that I had taken a course with my local police department and had spent time shooting a 9mm, a .40 caliber and my .38 special.  I told him maybe 100 rounds to which he said his requirement was 150 rounds.  He told me to bring an experienced person back with me before I could use the range.

If you have a problem with him then you have a problem with yourself. Robert is very aggressive on safety and making sure you know what you are doing before you take a LOADED HAND GUN ON A RANGE WITH OTHER PEOPLE. Me being a Law Enforcement officer, I have seen other officers who can barely make the cut on the range, so officer or not, dont get your panties in a wad when he comes at you with his saftey spill. As for the retards that have given him bad reviews, like I said before, you have a problem with yourself. I read one that said he is a know it all. Well if you were there asking questions, then you must not know to much. If you do know that much, Why were you in there asking questions? Get over yourself. To the guy who said he has the only gun range around mobile so he thinks he can charge what he wants.... You sir are an idiot. There are a total of 4 gun ranges in mobile. Do some research before you pop off at the mouth degrading the way some one runs there business. The other gun ranges in mobile all charge the same amount to shoot. You too can get over yourself. I have done business with robert and many other gun stores in mobile. I prefer going to robert because he takes care of me. I may not agree with some of the things he does or the way he does things but in the end, I got what I came for and got it at a good price with friendly service. If you want to go somewhere that they kiss your a$$ and tell you what you want to hear, dont go to Roberts. If you want to go somewhere that will be blount, give you an honest OPINION, and invite you back to talk guns and gear...

The drive out to the range is down a long and winding dirt road. Make sure you bring what you need with you out there. A nice pit stop to the range is at Walmart in Centreville to get targets, hearing protection, ammunition etc. You may also want to use a restroom before leaving civilization since your only option will be a pit toilet at the range. Another tip is to pack all you need to carry in one trip. The walk from the parking lot to the actual range is down a steep trail covered in pine straw that you will only want to trek twice, once down and once up. There is a covered shooting area which is nice and shady.
