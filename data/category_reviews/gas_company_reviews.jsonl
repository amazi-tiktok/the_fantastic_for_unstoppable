There is decent barbq nearby in town but none of it even comes close to this store's fine Q.\nToday i was served a HUGE T-bone steak with potato and side salad for $11.99.\nYour simply not gonna beat that.\nAnd if your in the mood for a simple bbq sammich then they have a sammich, bag-o-chips and 20 oz. drink deal.

Go with anyone else.\n\nTo add to my review. I was not a customer with Central Propane. I bought my home and the previous owner rented a tank from Central. However, I was never informed of this and was told by my real estate agent that we owned the tank. There were no markings on the tank.\n\nOne day I came home and my propane tank was gone. It turned out that Central propane owned the tank. However, instead of sending a bill for the rent of the tank to my address, or contacting me by mail about the late rent, they just repossessed the tank.\n\nSo now I am without heat. I called Central to understand what happened and the lady at the Hazel Green office was extremely rude. She told me that she had no obligation to contact me about the tank and she didn\u2019t have to explain anything to me because I wasn\u2019t their customer.\n\nI also had been filling the tank under the assumption that I owned it. So, when Central took the tank, I had about $300 of propane in it that I purchased. Central refused to reimburse me for the propane that they stole, even though it was worth more than their late rent. They were extremely rude the whole time. I can\u2019t imagine how anyone deals with them on a regular basis.\n\nI now rent from and buy my propane from Heritage. I\u2019ve never had a problem.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1539195617826, "text": "Dear Mr Bailey, We are sorry you feel this way.

Overall it helps us keep operating costs down. Our normal business hours and days of delivery are Monday \u2013 Friday, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Delivering to customers on a scheduled timeline provides more reliable, cost-efficient service that is not possible with off-route deliveries. We understand your concerns with the Off-Route fee as we hope you understand that running delivery trucks and staff overtime is not inexpensive. We value you as a customer and want to work together to keep this situation from happening again in the future. Please be sure to call us when your tank\u2019s gauge reads no less than 30%. That will give us time to include you in the next routed delivery for your area, providing you with the best value and service available.\n\nSincerely, Central Propane"}, "gmap_id": "0x8862386c31d8c4e3:0x570540642cc581d8"}

I am moving on to another provider but I do appreciate the follow-up and attempt to make things right.\n\nHorrible service: I schedule a simple site survey to have new service installed. They made me wait 14 days. When the 14 days arrived nobody came and nobody called. I called them and they said, \"yes it looks like you are on our schedule for today, let me call the technician to see what's up, and then he will call you right back.\" At 4PM the technician calls me and asks \"Hey, you want to talk about propane with me or something?\". I said what? you were supposed to be here between noon and 2 and you don't know why you are even calling me. he said \"Nobody never tole me nuttin about an appointment, you want to talk on the phone or sumpin?\"\nSeriously, stay away from people like this.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1608148238761, "text": "Thank you for your feedback.
