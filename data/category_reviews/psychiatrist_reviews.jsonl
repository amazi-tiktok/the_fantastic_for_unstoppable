If you are anything like me and suffer from anxiety and depression, he will only make it worse. He completely lacks compassion and refuses to acknowledge concerns regarding mental health. When feeling uncomfortable or that his medical opinion has been challenged, he resorts to belittling. I have never worked with someone that was so narcissistic, egotistical, and overall rude! He places high priority on getting patients in and out of his office faster than one can exhale and then bills for the entire hour block. In the two sessions I have had with Simon McClure, I have left feeling worse than I did coming in. He laughed off my concerns about very addictive medications and did not offer solutions. Also, he told me to adjust medication and wrote the prescription stating the opposite of what was vocalized. This person has no business having access to any medication involving a person\u2019s mental health recovery. If the fact that he  ignored my concerns and then scoffed at a second opinion isn't enough, he made rude comments about my weight and choice of clothing. If you are seeking help, Simon McClure is not the person you should turn to. Find a doctor that cares more about helping you than what is in your wallet. The additional suffering he has created is not worth it and I hope he does not get the chance to derail another person\u2019s life and recovery like he has done to me.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890db08be5611f:0x7d1b3bef19d6de73"}

I emphatically mentioned to Dr. McClure that I must return to work 1/2/20.  In my anxious state and with great hope that the electro shock therapy would assist in my return to a normal life free of this debilitating condition I thought I would have one session on 12/30 and I would be able to return to work on 1/2/20.  Dr. McClure understood this and never made any comment to the contrary.  I was hospitalized by self admission on 12/30 and was seen by Dr. McClure on 12/31 in the hospital and was told staff were out for the holidays and my first electro shock could not be scheduled until Friday 1/3/20.  I was on Christmas leave from work until 1/2/20 but was willing to take the additional 2 days believing I could return to work on Monday 1/6/20.  Later in the day on 12/31 I met with my hospital social worker and told her I would have to return to work after the treatment on 1/6/20.  The social worker stated \u201cHoney, don\u2019t you know you won\u2019t be able to return to work for 2 weeks, you will have multiple continuous days (6) of electro shock and will then have to be monitored for memory loss before your return to work.\u201d  I stated no, my doctor had never discussed the duration of the treatment and since I had emphatically informed him I needed to return to work on 1/2/20 without any comment whatsoever on Dr. McClure\u2019s part, I assumed that it would be a one day treatment.  I had to request an immediate discharge from the hospital and relayed to the nurse to convey to Dr. McClure my extreme disappointment that he had not informed me of the treatment duration.  If this had been done I could have arranged this at a later date with proper notification to my employer.  I was subsequently informed upon my discharge from the hospital that Dr. McClure stated I need to find another doctor.  This would have been done without Dr. McClure\u2019s request.

She said she would call me back after I told her to go ahead and cancel my appointment. Never received a call. I showed up at the office 30 minutes early and she asked to see me in her office where she tried to further explain the \u201cconflict of interest\u201d that they kept referring to. I told her I could find a place closer to home that wouldn\u2019t turn someone away who was looking for help. If you\u2019re thinking about going here, make sure no one you know is a patient as well. Otherwise, you might become another \u201cconflict of interest\u201d like me and not be told until you show up because even though they say they called you and got your voicemail. I guess actually LEAVING a voicemail is too complex. I\u2019m not doubting their ability to help, but being turned away at the door when you want help feels like an emotional slap to the face.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88892510d3a7786d:0x15ee073c7b99ccdb"}

She has help change our life around for the best. Altogether, my wife and I are very appreciative for Doctors like Dr. Lachman who has a caring heart, open ears, & a shoulder to lean on. My opinion has never changed for Dr. Lachman and my wife has been with her for about 8 years. Also, it\u2019s really sad about the passing of her husband that happened just about 2-3 years ago.

She does whatever is necessary to make me be my best self. I was a mess when I first started seeing her, and I have a ways to go, but I trust she is the only one who can help me. I couldn't deal without her. She has guided me through so much trauma. I can never repay the debt of gratitude I owe her.\nDr. Lachmans staff is another reason I like seeing her. They treat me like a person. Anita and forgive me for forgetting the other lady's name, make sure that I am taken care of while I'm there, by being nice and understanding. They put up with alot from patient's, and continue to smile, treat me with respect, and give me my follow up appointment.\nThings have been crazy with covid-19 going around, but they seem to handle it when things get hectic.

She knows how to give advice without being offensive, because she knows how to treat people. She gives the level of care that you want for those most important to you. She was the change I needed in my life. Again there is no fix, only coping skills. During my time spent going to her, my quality of life has gotten much better.

However, two huge issues. 1.) she seemed to be working on an almost assembly line sort of protocol and took a very short time to listen to my concerns and prescribed medications that gave me multiple concerns due to potential side effects I wanted to avoid 2.) the lady with whom they scheduled my appointment also did not have her insurance credentials in order so I ended up paying 155.00 out of pocket. I have excellent insurance and I would have had zero copay if she could\u2019ve accepted my insurance. I paid because they assured me that by the time my follow up appointment was scheduled they would have the situation remedied. I called before I went to the next appointment and was advised she still didn\u2019t have credentials for united healthcare so the visit would cost 90.0. I canceled the appointment and will have to find another doctor. This has also left me dealing with the side effects of those medications without any support in handling that.

If anything they should have said come into your appointment and we will not charge you and will handle the insurance after the fact. I do not understand why they think it is acceptable to force a patient to pay their outrageous prices for twenty minutes of their time when it\u2019s their fault they\u2019re not getting paid through insurance.

I was experiencing PTSD and extreme distress during my service and was admitted to this hospital\u2019s behavioral health unit twice within a year. Here\u2019s my story:\n\nThe first time I was admitted, it was voluntary...\nI was going through a lot on base, where I lived. My chain of command in the military allowed me to admit myself for a short period of time. They wanted me to get myself together and have me go back to continuing my service.\n\nThe neglect for patients here was disgusting to say the least. The staff allowed my chain of command to enter the unit without my password. They were the last people I wanted to see. I was sure that this was illegal and requested to speak to a supervisor, who told me it was my mistake for not turning them away. Being a soldier, I knew she did not understand that I could not do that and she clearly did not care about the law that her staff was breaking. This was not the only kind of neglect I witnessed/experienced. The geriatrics room was so sad. The older patients are sat down in chairs all day and night, in front of a tv. One of the older men was taken into a private room with a female tech. When they came out, he had a bloody mark on his forehead. Some of us patients noticed but felt that nobody would do anything about it. Another older gentleman in the geriatrics room died while I was there. Nobody knew the cause but he was wrapped up in a sheet and placed into a giant gray bin and wheeled away in front of all of the other patients!\n\nDuring this first stay at this hospital, there was a day where a group of student nurses were visiting to observe the staff and patients. They were observing a therapy group where the therapist was breaking HIPAA laws and verbally exposing each patient\u2019s diagnosis in front of all of the other patients, as well as the student nurses.\n\nThe second time I was admitted, I was court ordered. My command knew I was in distress and did not know what to do with me. I was sent to this hospital a second time and knew that it would not be a long stay. I was met by two giant men, telling me I have been court ordered to the psychiatric unit. I knew that something wasn\u2019t right and that the court order was not justified. This time, they admitted me to the third-floor. There were beds available on the second floor but had decided that I would be better off on the third floor. Anyone who has been to this unit, knows that the third floor is for patients with severe mental health issues... this time, there was a poster on the wall with all of the patient rights (that wasn\u2019t there before)... I read all of my rates and noticed that it said that I could request a patient advocate and a lawyer. When I approached the glass window at the desk, I requested Mary Anne, A wonderful recreational therapist that I remembered from my first stay- as well as a lawyer!... I was met with a nasty attitude and told to sit down because I was court ordered. At this point, I was panicking and angry so I threw a fit in order to get the attention of whoever was above this woman telling me to take a seat. When I got the supervisors attention, I requested that lawyer and therapist. The lawyer asked me if I had been \u201cBaker Acted\u201d but I had no idea what that meant. He pulled up my information on a computer and informed me that I had not been \u201cbaker acted\u201d and could leave anytime I wanted. I was out of there within a few hours!\n\nWhat a horrifying experience this was. The neglect and abuse here is disgusting and I would never EVER recommend anyone admit themselves to this hospital!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88928d9733f9a99d:0xdd43af3d45a5a602"}

Perhaps my previous doctors were influenced by the labels and words used to describe some of my symptoms which caused them to think I didnt need this form of treatment.. I dont know but there are medicines that will help you that you may never have heard of like me.\n\nIt actually makes my brain WORK the right way Versus just numbing it, and covering over the problem .\n\nI am now in a position that I am safely tapering off the medication that I dont truly need to be on(faster than I thought I could) and put that \"mistake\" in the past and I am focused on my life and my future for the first time in years.\n\nNever give up hope! Dont settle for bad help or mediocre treatment that just helps you \"get by\" each day as long as you have your \"meds\"\n\nIf you not thriving or on a path too it dont settle like I did for way too long.\n\nDont assume you know the only things that will work for you and be TOTALLY honest with the Dr so he can help you .\n\nIm even getting back into old hobbies and my next new career goals and even back into My Faith in God.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling please take this as a message of hope that its never too late and never hopeless.\n\nGod Bless and Thank you to Dr. Islam and Thanks to President Trump or whoever in the Government made this Tele-Medicine / new video conferencing option available. Without it I may never have found Dr. Islam.\n\nThank You Dr. Islam\n\nSincerely,\n\nMatt", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923d657d7a777:0xd29d293725d9d7a7"}
