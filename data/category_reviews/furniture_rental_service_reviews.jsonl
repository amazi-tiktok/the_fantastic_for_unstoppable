Since then, I have been told \"they will be on our next truck, call back Tuesday\" \"call back Friday\"  \"I called and verified that they would be in our warehouse the 16th\" I'm leaving my original post, so everyone can see the whole story behind trying to get 2 recliners from your store!\nI live in Sylacauga and went to our local Badcock store. I found the recliner that I had been searching for and asked if it was available in a different color. The sales lady rushed to answer \"No\" without checking their website or trying to verify her answer... I left there and went online, found the lady had lied and it WAS available in the color I wanted. So I drove to a neighboring city store and found a sales lady who was more than eager to help me... so I give the Sylacauga location a 1 Star rating, but the Alexander City location gets 5+ stars! Very happy with the lady there! Too bad I couldn't do business in my hometown.....", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1617373794540, "text": "Hi Carroll,\n\nOur sincerest apologies.

I spent an incredible amount of time planning each of the tiniest details for our wedding and sacrificed a lot of extras to make it happen financially.\n\nWhen I arrived to the venue the day of the wedding, I realized that Pre Events had delivered the wrong tables. I spent the first thirty minutes of my time there crying because I had spent so much time planning every detail and these tables looked absolutely nothing like the ones I had ordered. Unfortunately despite the efforts of my MOH and wedding planner, there was no time to have the tables swapped out. It was a hard pill to swallow but I married the man of my dreams that day and tried to let it go with promises that the company would do something to make it up to us.\n\nI have never been talked to the way I was talked to by the VP of this company, Mike. He said the mix up was our fault. BRIDES BEWARE. When you go to their landing page for tables, there are no names. You will only find the item name and detail if you click on each individual photo. Mike said the miscommunication happened when I chose the \u201cfarm table\u201d available in the Auburn location but their sales rep in Birmingham thought I wanted the \u201cfarm table\u201d in the Birmingham location. With Auburn being only a drive away, and also not even knowing about the other \u201cfarm table\u201d I just assumed that the delivery fees included getting me the tables from Auburn.\n\nNot once did their sales rep mention that they had two tables by the same name. Not once did she try to clarify. And to have my wedding day tarnished, TO BE TOLD THAT IT WAS MY FAULT, was completely disappointing to say the least.\n\nWe spent around $6000 total with this company. And if I could do it all again I would\u2019ve given every cent to a company that cares about its customers.\n\nTrying to let go of the fact that a big business wins again and this will never be made right.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891ec16cf24d91:0x44584351917a1f47"}

I will NEVER do business with these people again. I came in looking for a playstation. To begin with they were great. They said no problem and brought me out a 500 GB playstation. I got it home and....well let's just say it IMMEDIATELY went back. It came with FREE bugs. They told me it would be a few days before they would be able to get me another. So I waited. Finally they called and said they had a brand new one in. I went to pick it up and turns out it was brand new but it had more storage. They said that the whole thing was their fault so they wouldnt charge me anymore and gave me an extra controller. Turns out THEY LIED! BECAUSE THEY GAVE ME A PS4 FILLED WITH BUGS, THEY CHARGED ME FOR THE EXTRA SPACE AND THE EXTRA CONTROLLER THEY TOLD ME WOULDNT COST ME ANY EXTRA! So at this point I'm already aggravated. It gets much worse. I'm standing in line to pay one day, and the 2 customer reps were speaking to each other. The one lady said \"Weve got people that haven't paid  in almost 4 weeks. If they would just pay on time we wouldnt have to go repossess their things\". Okay no big deal. Every now and then I get a week behind. BUT I ALWAYS CALL AND LET THEM KNOW AND I ALWAYS PAY FOR 2 WEEKS PLUS THE EXTRA FEES THEY TAK ON!!!! ALWAYS! The most recent week I was 5 days late. I called them and told them. And they had the audacity to tell me they would have to come and take it if I didn't come pay it within 2 days. I ONLY HAVE 100$ LEFT AND YOUVE GOT PEOPLE THAT ARE 4 WEEKS LATE AND YOURE GOING TO COME TAKE MY PLAYSTATION THAT I HAD TO WAIT AN ENTIRE WEEK ON BECAUSE OF YOUR MESS UP!!!! YOU ADD EXTRA FEES!!!! YOU LIED AND MADE ME PAY MORE BECAUSE OF YOUR MISTAKE!!!! I told my mother and sister in Law yall were great to go get Washer and Dryers and TVs from. I gave yall business and this is how I get treated? When I pay the playstation off I will NOT be getting my Sofa from you. I will go to Aaron's and NEVER BE back. I will tell my mother and Sister and Law to go to Aarons. I will review you on every social media account I can because of how you treated me. My email is parks.samantha1031@gmail.

They had a good experience with the owner/manager Josh Johnson so we decided to check the store out. Our visit went great, we ordered a Stearns and Foster mattress, a couch, and a chair. $1500 including delivery. Josh told us he would be going out to Atlanta the following Thursday, February 2nd, to pick up our couch and chair and have it delivered Friday or Saturday. He'd call to set up the final details. The mattress, however, he could get to us by Monday the 30th. We set up a delivery time for 3:00. Josh stated he would call me the morning of the 30th as a reminder. Up to this point, everything was great. Until Monday the 30th rolls around, it's 3:00 and there's no reminder phone call or delivery person. I call Josh and he asks if the delivery could be changed to 5:00. OK. Fine. No problem. Five o'clock rolls around. Nothing. Six o'clock. Seven o'clock. Finally, after being stood up repeatedly, my husband (the second of the two men delivery...That we paid for) helped Josh load the California-king mattress into the house. My husband is a disabled veteran and large part off his disability is his back. It is now the 9th of February and we have not received a single phone call from Josh about our couch and chair. I've called him nine times. Once while standing in front of him yesterday. He informs me that their number has changed as of that morning. Mine hadn't. He never called me. Though it expressly states, via their own contract, that if there are any shipping or delivery set backs they will contact me immediately to let me know. So, on Monday, February 6th my husband goes to the store to inquire as to what is going on. Josh tells my husband that they're having some delivery issues but we'll definitely have our furniture by Friday. He'd be giving us a call to set up a time. However, by Wednesday afternoon still no call. So, I went to the store Wednesday afternoon and Mr. Johnson tells me that we 'should' have our furniture by Tuesday. When I asked him why he hadn't kept me informed he said he was busy keeping up with his other customers and if he neglected to call he was sorry. I asked him why he hadn't returned my calls when the number has only recently changed. Surely he got them. No. He says he never got a single one of the many phone calls I made. Then I ask him if he has my number. He says he wrote it down wrong. That's funny, because he knew it when he was talking to my husband, and it's clearly written in our contract/receipt. Oh. And he tells me they're getting out of the furniture business. Be WARY, folks. Be VERY wary. All I'm asking for is common courtesy. Keep me in the loop. I'm not unreasonable. At this point, however, if I do not receive my furniture by this Tuesday I will proceed to take civil action through litigation if I am not given a full refund of the cost of the delivery fees, couch, and chair that I have paid.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88f333433646516b:0x4d6a49b20bf770f4"}

(i have leased with this company on a previous occasion, my experience at that time was very sub par. the delivery was late and the dryer power cord  was damaged to the point of causing property damage to my wall plug in my home.) A red headed woman approached the counter with no mask and asked me \"how can i help you?\", i replied i am looking to lease a laptop. she then told me \"i have the desktop over there\" i stated then what kind of laptops do you have \" the kind that turn on!\" she stated. so i disregarded her unprofessional remark still uneasy about both employees not having on a face covering, and asked to know my options of computer choices. she then with an attitude that i was an inconvenience to her began putting laptop boxes on the counter. i read the specifications and made my choice. she asked if i had leased with them before, i stated yes. it had been more than 30 days since my last lease so i was directed to fill out another lease application. during this time of filling out the application i came to find out the employee that was behaving in this manner was the general manager. she then informed me while i was filling out the rental application that she \"hated these mask\" and that i did not have to wear mine while in the store. i was now fully uncomfortable from a collection of lack of safety procedure during a pandemic. i continued to wear my mask. once the application was complete another employee then took a copy of my drivers license. the general manager took another 10 minutes to ask me to please come into her office. she was pulling up things on her computer. she then turned to me and rolled her eyes and said\" so you have rented from us before huh? \" i said yes i have multiple times. she then proceeded to question why i was late on my rental payment. i told this brute of a woman that i had financial hardship and lost my job at the time. i got behind on the lease and once i realized i could no longer afford to get the payments from these loan sharks up to date due to exorbitant late fees and penalties i returned the leased merchandise. she then stated that she \"believed in giving second chances\". i  acknowledged the comment but did not rebut to the comment. she then looked over more information on her computer. and turned to me and said \" being late im ok with, but people keeping merchandise that is not theirs im not ok with!!\" at this point i have become very uncomfortable and feel as if my visit to the store this day has become a humiliation session for the store manager. i stopped the woman and told her i felt degraded and would no longer like to do business with this establishment. she then laughed at me and said \" fine then\". i contacted the corporate office for this company and was informed they condone this behavior. a few notes if you intend to rent from this establishment, you may be exposed to covid 19 by employees or other patrons due to lack of adherence of mask mandate while in this location or lease merchandise that has not been sanitized properly. you will be belittled by the staff if you ever have financial hardship while in a lease agreement with this company as well. i hope this review is helpful to those thinking of leasing from this company. i would recommend the better competitor YOURWAY RENT TO OWN which is located at 2547 Bob Wallace ave. when i left this establishment i went to your way and was able to lease a laptop computer in less than 15 minutes without being belittled or shamed. (quick your way rent to own history) they do not charge daily late fees(best ways policy is built to extort with late fees)  when a payment may be late and will work with you if you hit financial hardship. also the merchandise is of higher quality, the facility is cleaner, with more inviting more professional staff. stay safe out there in this pandemic!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626c968658c4e5:0xe253ce2faeb99938"}
