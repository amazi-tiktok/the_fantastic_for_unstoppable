After 20 minutes of running the saw broke and needed a new head.\n\nFirst Stihl gave me a hard time about the saw, made me take pictures of an obviously brand new saw and after a lot of hull-a-ba-loo agreed to fix the saw.\n\nThen they had Electrical Outlet fix it.  It took Electrical Outlet six months to fix the saw.\n\nWent back into Electrical Outlet today (a year later after the saw fiasco) and put $300 dollars worth of material into my buggy.\n\nI went to get a log chain and requested help from the owner, a Mr. Alexander.\n\nHe helped me get the chain and I requested help obtaining hooks to put on the end of the chain.\n\nI had some reservations about the eye hooks, such as would they be as sturdy as the chain itself.  What type was better, etc.\n\nDuring this question session three men came up to us and interrupted our conversation.  Mr. Alexander then just left me standing there with a couple of different hooks in my hand and walked away to discuss college football with what were apparently his friends.\n\nSo, I shopped a bit more, patiently waited at the front desk while these four people gabbed about college football.\n\nWhen Mr. Alexander finally decided to check me out I indicated I was not happy with his leaving me standing there.\n\nWhile explaining this I did not raise my voice or act rudely, I simply told him I wasn't happy with the service level provided.\n\nIt was at this time that Mr. Alexander decided to go ballistic on me.\n\nI got a good reaming out by him.  For good measure he also tossed in a few choice four letter words.\n\nI told him that I was having a difficult time being calm with him.\n\nTo that he pointed at the door and told me to get out.\n\nI then told him about my chain saw experience and that I had refrained from criticizing the store about the poor service because one of his young employees had been very nice to me during a weather emergency we had April 27th, 2011.\n\nOnce again I got told where the door was and to use it.\n\nSo, I proceeded to do so.\n\nAs I was opening the door he shouted at me \"You must be another one of those Terry's\".  I promptly told him who I was and spelled my name out for him.\n\nI try to support local businesses, but he effectively sent me next door to Tractor Supply (where I got everything I came to town for anyway).  Guess it will be Tractor Supply or Lowes in the big city from here on out.\n\nGood luck with your attitude Mr. Alexander.
