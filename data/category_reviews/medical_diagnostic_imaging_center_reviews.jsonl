To safely scan a patient with one of these devices, proper monitoring must be performed during the exam, i.e. pulse oximetry or electrocardiography.

An external defibrillator must be available nearby during the MRI procedure.\nICD and CRT-C Requirements: Proper patient monitoring*must be provided the entire time SureScan is programmed to On.  An external defibrillator must be immediately available the entire time MRI SureScan is programmed to On.\n*This includes visual and verbal contact with the patient and monitoring heart rate using instrumentation such as pulse oximetry or electrocardiography.\n\nAs an out-patient facility, we are not equipped to provide the level of monitoring required to perform MRI on patients with these devices.

All of a sudden the receptionist, patients and staff are running screaming at me to run down the hall. They scream over the intercom code silver. I get up and start going down the hall. The first waiting room I came to was x-ray. The staff inside locks the door and I\u2019m tapping on the window to find out what\u2019s going on. Just so happens I know one of the woman working there. A gentleman asks her if she knows me and she replies yes. They slip me a note through the door telling me to call them in 15 minutes. I hear a woman inside say get forceful and tell him to leave. I turn to look down the hall and every soul is gone except for me and the man who stole a gun out of a car in the parking lot. I had no idea where he was. No one would help me or tell me what was going on. I was locked out in the hallway that is at least 80 yards long by myself with no means to defend myself. The man was obviously sick and out of his mind. I saw him when I pulled up and he gave me an uneasy feeling. I was not scared for me but thought to myself what if an elderly/young woman or a child walked in the door behind him what would they do. The only thing I could think to use to defend my self was a chair that was sitting in the radiology waiting area. I said to myself he will probably shoot me but hopefully I can beat him enough with the chair that he couldn\u2019t hurt anyone else. I was starring down the hall waiting for him to walk/run towards me and I was going to do my best to stop him with a chair. Another thought I had was if I had my gun on me I would at least be in a better position to defend myself. Luckily the police got there and disarmed the man. I was so mad at the hospital staff for telling me to run down the hall and then locking me out of EVERYTHING. I was nothing more than a target at that point. I could understand their policy a little better if I hadn\u2019t been waiting for 45 minutes in the same chair they ask me to flee from while rushing other patients into offices to protect them from a possibility bad outcome. I asked the Administrator what was the big plan for me. Wait till he shoots me then scurry on over to the E.R. All he said was this is not supposed to happen here. Needless to say I am extremely, extremely disappointed in the way St. Vincent\u2019s Blount handled things today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

She called me at 11:30pm to say she felt lightheaded, a little dizzy, and had what felt like a slight pressure in her chest. She called the ambulance and the EMT's took her to St. Vincent's to be checked out.\n\nI had left Montgomery immediately after receiving the call and arrived at the hospital minutes after her ambulance had arrived (the EMT's were just bringing out the gurney to their rig when I got there) I went into the Emergency Room, told them why I was there and gave them info on my mom (name, date of birth, address, phone, and reason for admittance). The woman told me they were going to get her in a room and then ask when I could come back. I was the ONLY person in the waiting room. About 20 minutes later she said again that they had her in a room and would see when I could go back. Fifteen minutes after that she said a woman had just gone back to see if I could go back. Needless to say it was over an hour before they let me go back. The worst part is that I had assumed they would at least let my mom know I was there. Even though she had been asking them and voicing concerns about how I had not yet arrived no one from the waiting room told her I was there and none of the nurses back with my mom bothered to check if I had arrived. This was not a far walk either, considering my mom was approx. 30 ft inside the doors from the waiting room I was in.\n\nWhen I finally did get back to see her she was hooked up to a heart and pulse/ox monitor and they had a fluid IV in. They took her out to get chest X-rays and a CT scan minutes after I got back there. When she returned to the room about 15 minutes later, the nurse that brought her back first said she didn't know how to hook my mom back up to the machine and the IV...then was going to try...then decided no, she would have someone come in and do it. A half hour went by and no one came in to hook her back up. I stepped outside the door and explained that she had not been hooked back up and the nurse at the station said thanks, and they would come in and do it...which they never did. The original doctor she saw was also standing there when I told the nurse and did nothing. You would think if you were monitoring someone who you think may have had a heart attack you would want them hooked up to a monitor.\n\nFinally, the doctor came in a little before 4am and said that the X-rays, and CT scan were just fine, but there were concerns with her blood work (PS no one had ever come in to hook my mom back up to the monitors). The doctor explained there are three types of cardiac enzymes. One that tells if there is actual muscle damage and that they use to determine if you've had a heart attack (which was normal and my mom did not), and two others. One of the extra two was normal and then the doctor said that the third was \"significantly higher.\" She said that could indicate that although she may not have had a heart attack that enzyme could mean there could be something brewing or big That could happen on the horizon. She wanted to admit my mom so she could see the cardiologist in the morning...which we did. Kicker is when the cardiologist came in and looked at the tests he said it was slightly elevated, but nothing that he found alarming.\n\nAll in all I just felt like even though the ER was extremely slow, and at times there were 4 or more staff members sitting at the desk area within the ER, the overnight crew seemed fairly insufficient at simple things, like communicating that family members are there, or rehooking a patient back up to monitors and IV's.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ec8f4e3dd0d69:0xabe5f655cd2e4f08"}

They were then able to have their doctor evaluate my images, contact my primary doctor, discuss the images with her, and get back to me within 15 minutes while I waited in the lobby. It was determined I would need an MRI for further diagnostics and they got me in last-minute (again) within 20 minutes. At this point, the ultrasonographer came out to the lobby and offered me a coffee for my wait. Between the friendliness, punctuality, and consideration, this place deserve nothing less than a 5-star rating. For extra information, the facility itself is clean, open, well-lit, and offers plenty of comfortable seating along with restrooms and access to a water-fountain. I'm considering injuring myself again just so I can come back and  have this experience a second time - but that hinges on how much my insurance is able to cover.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1602952994379, "text": "Please do not hurt yourself again.

It was great to speak with you so long ago about your review. As we discussed, it is often quite difficult to obtain great ultrasound pictures of a baby at 38 weeks. Sometimes the baby is faced head down and is not as \"cooperative\" for pictures as he is earlier on in a pregnancy. We also discussed that visualization is limited at this stage because the ratio of amniotic fluid to the amount of baby is small. Fluid assists the  ultrasound technologist to see the baby's body parts more clearly. The ratio is better earlier on in the pregnancy during the time when we typically do the full anatomy scan (18-22 weeks). Later in the pregnancy (38-42 weeks) the doctors are looking at fetal movement, heart rate, amniotic fluid amount, and fetal presentation to determine the safety of a vaginal delivery. Although great pictures are difficult to obtain at this stage, the information they need to assess those items can be obtained. Thanks again for allowing me to discuss this with you. We do love our patients and we want you to know we will always strive to give you the best care and the greatest level of satisfaction with our services."}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf29cf68a2b3b:0xf6ad5f2eeb6ffd62"}

I brought it to the receptionist's attention and nothing was done about it.\n3) They mandated that I pay my co-pay for an office visit.  I explained this isn't an office visit it is for  testing and I am not required to pay a co-pay, but they demanded it anyway.  I have received my explaination of benefits from my insurance and a co-pay was not due.  When I called they said they would send out the refund.  They showed a credit balance on my account but I never received a credit statement.  Hmmm.  (This review is 4 months post visit).\n4)  NOW THE BIGGEST PROBLEM....I previously had kidney cancer and have had to have follow up CT scans due to my condition.  The radiologist stated  it appears that my kidney cancer is not only back but he couldn't rule out that it had spread to my liver.  This news was very concerning as you would imagine.  When I had my follow up appointment with my Oncologist, he did not like the very brief unprofessional report and suggested that he have my ct scan reviewed by the radiology team at my hospital as a second opinion.  Come to find out, my cancer was not back nor had it spread to my liver.  The radiologist must have mistaken scar tissue from my previous procedures as cancer.  Needless to say.  The 3 weeks prior to the 2nd opinion on my CT scan was not pleasant as I was preparing for metastisized kidney cancer.\n\nPLEASE HEED THIS WARNING AND GO ELSEWHERE FOR YOU MEDICAL NEEDS!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf29cf68a2b3b:0xf6ad5f2eeb6ffd62"}

I was in and out in a short amount of time--- no waiting at all.  The x-ray tech and the young lady who did the Doppler were very nice and both seemed very knowledgeable.  However my experience this week was horrible.  I notified them on Monday that I had just been told I needed an MRI. I  specifically requested they perform it because they were close to my office and I had a good experience the week earlier. I said I must get the MRI by midnight October 31 as my insurance changes.  I was told \"no problem\"  -lots of openings.  My physician faxed over the order and my physician had a confirmation that it was received.  I asked the imagine center if they would get a pre-certification for it and they said they would and that they would contact me to schedule. I heard nothing else on Monday. Nothing Tuesday.  Wednesday I called again.  They said they did not get the orders.  I called my physician again and they were re-sent.  My physicians office even the centered and verbally verified that they were received.  Still I heard nothing for the remainder of the day.  I found out later that they left a message on my home machine for me to call (never tried my cell --or my work number) .   I called again today and was told my orders were not specific enough and that a pre-certification was needed.   I attempted to tell them that I had asked that do it.  The office manager immediately came on the phone, was very rude and unprofessional. She preceded to tell me how I needed to call my physicians office and get them to call the center and get the specifics.  I re-enforced  kept saying that I really need to get this today.  Bottom line I did not get my MRI before my insurance changed.  A total lack of communication as one employee is leaving a message on my home phone to schedule and it will not be anything out of pocket while another employee is on the phone with me telling me it will be $1600 total.  They can't do the MRI today but would be happy to schedule me for another day at  $1600 out of pocket.   What would have been zero out of pocket for me will now be $1600.  Am I aggravated and disappointed? YES!  I called and asked that my orders be sent to me so \"maybe\" I could find an open all night MRI facility somewhere and get the MRI taken care of.  The office manager refused to fax the documents to me.  I was told that they could only fax them to another physician.\nThey were my records, a fax is HIPAA compliant but they still refused even after I offered to sign a release.  The office manager is incredibly rude and there does not seem to be communication from one employee to another.

Sadly, even though they had great things to say about Dr. M and her outstanding team, I simply didn\u2019t feel like they were as gung-ho about how amazing the experience actually is......hence, the reason for my review of Camellia Women\u2019s Imaging on Valleydale Road, in Hoover.\nBefore we had even arrived, as we made our appt. over the phone, the gals at the front desk, sent me over an email while we were on the phone in order for them to get my digital signature, so that they could have all of my images and reports, transferred digitally from Brookwood Hospital, which we also have never had issues with.\nThat was done instantly, and that was that.\n\nMom needed a diagnostic appt. due to the fact that they had seen something at Brookwood and wanted to do further imaging/ultrasounding. They didn\u2019t have an immediate appointment, and I was already coming in to Camellia, so the team at CWI  got mom in, immediately, with me. Dr. M even sent somebody from her office over to Brookwood the morning of mom\u2019s appt, because it was with such short notice, that we didn\u2019t have time to compile everything. AND this all before we even walked in the front door!\nDon\u2019t let the exterior of the building fool you. Once you step into Camellia, you\u2019ll feel so welcome and at ease, that you\u2019ll have to keep reminding yourself that you\u2019re there for imaging and not at the spa! Ha!\nAt the onset of our appt. BEFORE imaging, we were offered a beverage of our choice and we then sat down with Dr. M so that she could listen to our concerns. Such a pleasure to have a professional who is genuinely interested in us and our health. After Dr. M took all of the time necessary, we were then shown back to the dressing area where we were given the most luxurious and softest robes we\u2019d ever had on! Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons have nothing on these robes......no paper towel, opening at the back, degrading piece of paper around CWI.\nOnce changed, one by one, we were escorted to our imaging and ultrasounding.........ultrasounding performed by Dr. M, herself. Thorough, patient, kind and caring. Yes, ladies.....I\u2019m talking about mammograms, here.....ha!\nListen ladies, we\u2019ve been told that all mammograms are the same....well, they had been, until CWI came on the scene. This is not your same, run of the mill experience.\nAfter imaging is finished, Dr. M then met with us, AGAIN......To go over her findings and any other concerns and questions that we may have had. Not to divulge private info, but mom\u2019s mammo wasn\u2019t 100%, but nothing dangerous. You would have thought that mom was Dr. M\u2019s mom. She really handled her with extra TLC and mom was almost crying with relief after all was said and done. Not to say that we all don\u2019t get the same enhanced and personalized attention, but mom\u2019s older and Dr. M really knew exactly how to care for each of us as individuals.\nA Forward-Thinking professional, such as Dr. M and her team players, make this world a better place. Mom and I are forever thankful, as our those who loves us, and is it crazy to say that we\u2019re looking forward to our next appt??? Ha!!! Let\u2019s put it this way........never again will we miss our appt\u2019s, or make excuses for rescheduling or whatever. Every single woman  (and man) who wants to be treated with kindness and dignity, MUST only ever use Dr. Monika Tataria and her lovely, state of the art 3D imaging center. Her team supports her wholeheartedly, and they run a well oiled machine.\nThank you Dr. M......I sure hope our words have expressed how grateful we are for kind and caring professionals such as yourself. \ud83d\ude03", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923ac54102317:0xd019e3bd9643010f"}
