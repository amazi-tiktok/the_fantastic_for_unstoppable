Morgan, AL and want to have a great experience and get your money\u2019s worth, this is your charter! Our experience was worth this extended review.\n\nPrior to this week, I had been deep sea fishing only once and that was on a \u201cparty boat\u201d of sorts. It was an overall bad experience being on a boat with 30 or more people, lines all tangled up, people getting sea sick, etc.\n\nMy wife and I had a totally opposite experience with Captain Black. As a matter of fact, we booked and fished three separate charters with three separate companies during our week at the beach. While each experience was pleasurable, for the most part (come on \u2013 it\u2019s fishing!), our charter with Reel Attractions was by far THE BEST overall charter experience. The customer service was second to none. From our initial phone call to discuss and schedule the charter, to the phone calls in the days and hours before the charter to discuss weather (Hurricane Nate), Captain Black was prompt, courteous, and patient with all our questions. He was at the dock waiting for us when we arrived (early). The boat was a perfect size with all the necessary amenities. He took time to explain everything to us. We didn\u2019t want for anything. Captain Black was very attentive to our every need, he is very, very personable, he made every effort to make sure we were catching a variety of fish (and we did), he operated safely, and he did a great job cleaning our fish. Captain Black is a consummate professional and my wife and I highly recommend him and Reel Attraction charters.\n\nOn a side note, you don\u2019t have to just take my word for it. Not only was our experience with him a stand out of the three experiences we had this week, but it was later validated when we took our haul to a local restaurant who will cook your catch for you. The restaurant staff was asking us about our experience and complimenting the variety of fish we had. Without us even saying his name, the waitress asked, \u201cwho did you go fishing with, Captain Ronnie Black?\u201d You might have chosen a reputable charter when the locals attribute a successful catch to certain charters!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1508070130020, "text": "Thank you for an awesome review!"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a260b09a9133d:0xeaa2bd6d182d9a68"}

However this was not the case on the Dolphin cruise. Trouble started as soon as we boarded the boat. As we walked up the stairway to the upper deck to view the dolphins there were no benches or any permanent seating just the cheap white lawn chairs you buy at Dollar General. This not such a big deal but very in professional looking. Second of All as soon as we sit down in our lawn chair we noticed there were way to many people on the upper deck for the amount of chars provided. This was due to the lower deck witch is enclosed and air conditioned smelling like raw sewege. We not talking about a little stick, it was so bad not one person could stay inside and by the end of the trip the smell was leaking out of the lower deck and was ingulfing us on the stairway outside on the boat.This was my chief complaint just due to the fact I have 3 small children that use the bathroom a lot and I was having to go in and out of this stink a lot!! Also could have seen more dolphins from the beach and we had got a lot more close to the dolphins the day before fishing. It was hour into the trip before we seen a dolphin 200yds away.

We booked the 8 hour trip.  We caught Red Snapper ( which we could not keep - not in season), White Snapper, Grouper , Wahoo, B-LIners, 2 large Bull Sharks, and more.  The boat is awesome.  Captain Alex is great and knows where the fish are. The crew ( Perry) was very friendly and worked super hard to keep us fishing all day. We had a great day on the water thanks to Alex and the crew.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a07830f26e02b:0xddbf7aa2c4b26286"}
