I felt very much at home as I browsed through their collection of healing crystals, ritual candles & incense, inspirational/motivational art, spiritual & meditation tools, and all sorts of unique trinkets and decorations. The store is filled with interesting products from across the world. There is something here for everyone! The owners even showed me a few of their prized personal possessions which were kept in the back room, making me feel like V.I.P.  The store itself was well kept...which I can only imagine to be a constant struggle considering how many shelves and items must be dusted frequently to maintain the clean environment. Everything sparkles! If you have the chance, ask the owner about the musical vibrations produced by the bronze gong hanging behind the register -- it makes beautiful sounds which fill the space entirely, engulfing it's visitors in a sense of peace and tranquility. This store is just the kind of retail attraction our community needs in this area - Definitely recommend visiting A Coastal Zen as soon as possible!!! Bring more money than you think you will need because you will be surprised how many items will strike your fancy! The owners are well educated in product knowledge and price the pieces very, very reasonably. It's a treasure trove of goodies!!!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6tYhpY_pMuZpJO8S_typrW-ZMwGWMcZoT_6-M=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2hVRgi4jSugsZNl_wWH5F6VEsuvuoII7AFCkY=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkK_x-caP5-0GhCKa7vuRO-zR9iOdUfJlqGvqc=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRgnVpymKcLYk0TqJBglyJycKLrevPqLIrm3Nl=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeh4dCZxY8xpGux4bZ6NeguJyDhyH5mMXjdOZ_=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1573675648474, "text": "Thank you so very much for such a glowing review.

Yesterday I decided to treat myself to some new books. With a Pandemic happening around us it\u2019s easier to just order a book online without needing to contact anyone else BUT I\u2019m grateful I didn\u2019t go about it this way. I messaged the online store about the \u201cblind date\u201d book program that they do (you should look into, it\u2019s cute and a great way to find a new book BASED off of what you love rather than judging it by its cover....get it?) and surprisingly enough I was actually talking to a real life current worker! When I tell you that I have never once been spoken to in a bookstore much less asked for a suggestion (everyone has different taste, and I\u2019m a little picky at times) I\u2019m not lying. Katie (a ray of happiness and a great personality) not only gave me the information I asked for but then continues to give me suggestions, update me on new books to try, offer curbside services or porch drop offs AND thought of another book after hours and sent me an email with it( after I didn\u2019t find a book Style that I was looking for, and the new book was a combination of genres I love!). Today I feel like I not only found 5 AMAZING books, but I was able to support a local business with and amazing staff that\u2019s willing to go above and beyond. I was even greeted with smiles and the same enthusiasm from those that I picked my bag of goodies up from( didn\u2019t catch their names but just as sweet and attentive!)\nIn Summary, a huge shoutout to Katie for making me feel special and taking such good care of me, as well as the other store workers! For those that seek this place out in Auburn, you will NOT be disappointed! This town needed a good hearted bookstore like this one and we need to support our local businesses!!!

If we ever have to close early, we make a sign on the door and post to social media. If we can't get up there we post to social media only. It's a shame that people have to leave vague negative reviews when we rarely close during our regular posted biz hours. If this person would've contacted us after \"missing\" us the first time we would have done what ever needed to be done to assist this potential customer but odds are they came on a day we are closed (always closed Sunday and monday) or they came after 5pm. It's that simple. I have documented time sheets that prove when our biz is open and many, many days we rarely close right at 5pm to accomodote shoppers in the store!"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a6d772e1de2df:0xa51c6c938247b5fc"}
