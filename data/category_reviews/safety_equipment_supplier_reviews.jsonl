Thanks Jamie!\n\nThe reason that I am giving Uni1st an overall 3  stars is because we often have problems withour towels being full of lint. They also come torn or very worn also. We sometimes do not get a full bag, shorting us before our next delivery.  Our aprons that we receive often have half of the tie torn off. So we can't even tie them on. Also, they come very stained occasionally as if they have been mildewed and then laundered. The mildew stain is still there after the wash. We pay a fee each week for these items to be replaced as needed, but we rarely see new items in the\nmix. We have also had problems with the posting of payments in a timely manner.
