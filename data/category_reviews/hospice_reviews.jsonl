First off they are very disorganized and they do not seem to have qualified and compassionate employees.  My uncle was in their care while severely sick, they only provided minimal support and care visits and did not listen to the family on how they could help and support.  The nurse who saw him day (hours) before his death said he was good and should be good for another week or so, she left without changing his colostomy bag and turned to my aunt and said, ok I\u2019m leaving now you can do your job and she had to change his bag.  When he did pass it took them 4 hours to get to the home and pronounce him.  They called a day after his death to see if they wanted a nurse to come visit my uncle that day, he had been dead already a day!!!! And after 3 days after death they have STILL not picked up the equipment from the home! This place is horrible and would tell anyone NOT to use them!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1615220366244, "text": "Hello Mary.

The phlebotomy program at Saad's no where near provided this to their students. My friend's instructor stayed texting and looking at the phone a lot while trying to teach them.  Clinical hours are the entire main key to having the knowledge, skills, and abilities to drawing blood. Saad's did not provide them or give them any clinical hours at all so they were lacking terrible skills and abilities of drawing blood because of the no clinical hours and lack of training. All the students complained and felt like the only thing they paid for was a phlebotomy button Saad's gave them after they were finished with the program. A hope to get job in the med.field but not a living off of job. Plus it's a very challenging job to get because too many people are trying to get a license for it so it is too much competition. Majority of jobs only hire experienced workers with 2+years of experience because they are afraid that you may cause a patient to have a permanently injured arm (hematoma) so they do not take risk. A permanent injury can cause the patient to sue the hospital. Volunteer programs do not offer many openings either because they are also afraid that you may cause an injury to a patient's arm so they do not take a risk on non experience phlebotomy technicians either. So be careful with this chose of career because it is no where near guaranteed to get a job for a while. And hospitals are starting to let RN nurses do more drawing blood than phlebotomist. So it makes it even harder to get a phlebotomy job. I also recommend and advise you to attend a college that offers the same cost for this program, more training, clinical hours, and you may have a better chance of getting a job. Because jobs trust colleges way more than a student who attended a healthcare place offering a program. Especially not Saad's due to their lack of non clinical hours and training.Take my advice seriously.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d2eebeb8da7:0x7f3bbfbe54537b08"}

Now they are refusing to give his money back and we can't afford to pay his nursing home for the month. They are shady and all about money.

My lack of knowledge caused my mother a lot of neglect and humiliation. There is a ton I could say but I\u2019m going to narrow it down to four:\n1. My mom called me one day around 730pm and stated she had been calling for someone to come change her diaper since 3:30pm.\n2. My mom suffers from CHF and needs a low sodium diet. Whatever she would chose from her REGULAR menu to eat, the kitchen would send her whatever they wanted her to have. Usually something processed and high in salt. Now my mother retains fluid very badly.\n3. After seeing other areas of neglect, I researched better facilities and put in to transfer my mother. I put the request in, in person on a Thursday morning. I came back Friday afternoon and it had not been send. I checked on it Monday evening it was finally sent. Then there was the transportation issue, the family pays, WHAT no one told me. Well Magnolia social services didn\u2019t help me, nor did they offer guidance or contact numbers. So I called the transfer NEW facility and admissions said \u201cwe will take care of this for you and we will get you the lowest price possible, we will try to make this transition smooth\u201d. About 15 Min later I was set with transportation.\n4. They are always short staff, once my mother had a very bad case of heart burn. She pushed her button for help, a hour later mom called me and I called the nurses  desk. The supervisor came, took her BP, said she will be back with some tums. An hour later Mom pushed the button. No one came. She called me, I called the desk, the new shift nurse said the supervisor WENT HOME!
