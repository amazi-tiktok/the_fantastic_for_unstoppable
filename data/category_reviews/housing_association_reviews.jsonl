Many of the negative reviews have nothing really to do with EHM.  They only enforce the covenants that we as a community have in place.

Absolutely not the case with Elite, as I have yet to receive a voicemail box during work hours.\n\nThere app is very helpful.  I have not encountered another company using one.  I am sure some do but I am just saying it is a plus.  Email responses are super fast.\n\nFor the reviewer that complained of Elite not keeping streets cleaned/street swept!!!  Really??  Just Really??  Address that with your HOA board members and have them allocate funds to have it done.  Elite will then ensure it is handled, I can assure you of the latter.
