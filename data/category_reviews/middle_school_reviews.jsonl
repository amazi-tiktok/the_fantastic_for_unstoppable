Phyllis Norton, the owner of the franchise in Jones Valley,  is the most amazing person!  The educator shared her own family struggle with her kids and math.  That\u2019s why she opened this business. Her passion is evident! She  and the staff worked diligently and continue to follow up with us to make sure our child is getting what she needs. After many, many tutors and lots of other strategies, Mathnasium was what our child needed.  It offered a family peace that we had not had in a while when it came to math. I highly recommend it  here and continuinally recommend it to friends.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88621257020989f3:0x9dc71c982239e578"}
