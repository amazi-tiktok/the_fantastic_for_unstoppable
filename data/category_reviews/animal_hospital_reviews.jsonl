I have a little Yorkie that suffers from flea Allergy and unfortunately he also has a bad reaction to any type of flea control. I live close to a dog park so it's a problem during the summer. I called my vet and of course they were not available so I called Countryside and they were so nice and said bring him it right away. I loved Dr. Ryder from day one. She takes up time with him and because I know my Little Man so well she really listens to what I have to say. The whole staff is so sweet and very professional at the same time. When I went to pay my bill I was pleasantly surprised. Dr. Ryder doesn't always make us come in to pay a dr's visit every time either. There has been a few occasions when they were able to call in some meds for him. I have seen the same vet for years and to be honest I wish I had been using Countryside Vet the whole time. I would recommend this vet to anyone who loves there animals, if fact I have sent several of my co-workers there. Thank you Countryside Vet for taking care of my baby and for loving him, almost as much as I do!!! :-)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c934bea51fdcd:0x7ef4c40e5105d6d6"}

On Thursday, you dropped your cat off to be spayed and requested that she receive all vaccinations recommended for an outdoor cat. We spayed her and gave her a rabies vaccine, feline distemper vaccine, and feline leukemia vaccine. We did not test her for feline leukemia. It is not our office policy to test all adult cats. A feline leukemia test is $50. If you check your invoice, I think you will find that this procedure was not done. We make every effort to ensure that we follow the client's requests to the best of our ability. On Friday, your wife brought in 4 kittens for their first vaccinations and deworming. They each received a thorough physical exam, their first feline distemper vaccine, and a dose of dewormer. A 20% discount was applied to the vaccinations because you have 4 kittens. Your wife paid the entire bill at checkout. Angel was the receptionist that you spoke with on Thursday when you dropped off your cat for surgery as well as who you spoke to on the phone when you called back with concerns over the bill. Angel is one of our lead receptionists and does her very best to ensure that all of our clients are happy and their needs are met. Prior to this visit, you had not been in our office since 2016. Again, we are very sorry for any confusion and we wish you the best in finding future veterinary care. Sincerely, Dr. Lauren Ellenburg"}, "gmap_id": "0x8889e65014243269:0xa4e772d3ec712f62"}

They told me they were looking and had the police and animal control looking too. My family looked for four hours that morning with no sight of the police or animal control looking. When I called on Monday to get an explanation on what happened, they wouldn\u2019t give me information over the phone because I wasn\u2019t the \u201cowner\u201d on paper. It was in my moms name. This was after I paid for the bill and brought him to the vet myself. I had to go up there with my mother to get my refund and a proper explanation. They only gave me a partial refund and no one came to talk to us until I asked for camera footage. The manager was somewhat sincere and I learned that he in fact did not chew through any metal or fence. He chewed through a wooden door and managed to bend the chain link fence to crawl up under it. I got a clear explanation and some of my money back, but have yet to find my dog. They told me they were still looking but I have no way of knowing that. We\u2019ve been searching for a week now and no sightings of him. I was under the impression that he was going to be watched 24/7 since he had never been boarded before but I was wrong.

Above and beyond, even on her weekend off. Dr Myers will always be straight with you about your pet. Yes, some people don't like this but i would much rather have a doctor, people or animal,  tell me the truth no matter how hard it is to hear. I respect this about her.

Told it would take 3 hours, after not receiving a phone call I followed up at 1pm, only to be told my dog was groomed, except nails.  He would be ready after groomer retuned from lunch.  Why not finish him, nails take 5 mins???  Well then I go pick him up a hour later and he still not ready.  So the person working the front counter goes back and cuts his nails and now he is bleeding from that experience as I take him home.  (3). While I\u2019m waiting at front counter for my dog another gentleman brings his dog in who is barking quite a bit.  I happen to look back at the Counter Rep and catch her look of disgust of having to deal with this dog. (4) I call on Weekend because my dog has ear infection, Doc calls me back after second message and says it will have to wait till Monday.  Gives me remedies I had already looked up, but no option to get medicine after hours.  I brought my dog in Germany and he has lived in and been cared for Vets on Turkey, Tucson Arizona, Chicago, and Alaska.  Never have we had any of these experiences, and I have all these in 3 short months..  Time to move on and I tried to give benefit of doubt.  Just cannot keep doing it and they really need to have people work the front counter that displays a loving attitude toward pets.  They faces don\u2019t say I love doing this for a living.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e856bc6525c67:0x6bde3ce9d192bca1"}

If these animals are only \"animals\" to her and not a life worth protecting, why is she in the field to care for them?\n\nDr. Bellamy nor Dr. David McKenize have replied to emails, although they promised they would.\n\nPlease make sure you think throughly before taking your pet to this Hospital. I know mistakes happen, however; as a Medical entity, there is a duty to make sure you are licensed to practice in a specialty and Dr. Vigg was not. Dr. Bellamy told me he did not have to be but that is not true and the Neurologists at Auburn and UGA confirmed this. They said you NEVER pull a canine off a steroid suddenly as their system will go into shock and if he were a Neuro, he would know this.\n\nA lot of progress was made to get Mahogany back on track and Dr. Vigg's negligence caused the Neuros to go back to the drawing board which upset them. They told me he never should have treated her for a Neuro condition as he is not a licensed Neurologist.\n\nPlease think twice before coming to Tuskegee University Vet Hospital. Auburn is far more rounded and the professionalism/bed-side manner exercised along with certified Medical Professionals who treat your pet with care is reasonating. It gives you peace of mind to know your pet will be given the utmost care. TU, on the other hand, views them as 4-legged property with no regard to the level of care amd treatment they are given.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c510e303e62e9:0xf598f4353e4e7ffe"}

She remembers you and your pets names. You dont have to tell her who you are when you come in.

They treated our cat's chronic and severe UTI and he hasn't had one in 2 years; where as at the other vet we felt like he was not being fully treated and was having unnecessary testing for his diagnosis. In Sept. 2013 we noticed that our dog was not acting like herself and it was after hours, so we took her to the ER vet and they misdiagnosed her with gastritis. We took her to Dr. Price the next day because she had gotten severely worse. Within minutes he diagnosed her with an IMHA, which is a very serious, usually fatal, diagnosis. He sat down with me and explained the disease and treatment course. He stayed with her through the night while she received a blood transfusion, to ensure that she didn't have a reaction to it. He even called me late that night to give me an update. Now nine months later she is her perky self. I would never trust my pets to anybody but Oak View!

A year old border collie mix of some sort, who knows? I did my research looking for a vet and asked my friends who they recommended. Oak View came up multiple times so eventually i decided Oak View would be Max and mine's vet. I could not have been happier with the choice. They helped me take my firsts steps as friend and pet owner and made both of us feel like we were part of the family.\n\nMax didn't have his first seizure until 3 months after i adopted him. Oak View walked me through the different reasons a dog can have a seizure and laid out a plan to help moderate or even eliminate Max's seizures. Had Max's condition been epilepsy or even one of the many normal conditions that can cause seizures i can honestly say Oak View would have been able to help him. Through the empirical method we tried everything to help Max. Unfortunately Max's grand mal seizures persisted and i lost a piece of my friend after each one. Dr. Price and Dr. Robinson admitted that this may be beyond their scope and I respect them all the more for it. I took Max to Neurologists, pathologists, and almost every specialist at Auburn and in between. No one could put a finger on it.\n\nWithin a year my friend was no longer himself. Oak View helped with his final moments and the level of caring and comfort they provided i will never forget. Thank you Oak View. I can never thank you enough for the love and support you gave Max and me.\n\nIf you are debating what Vet to use i highly recommend Oak View.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1455550971601, "text": "Our sympathies on your loss - you worked hard to help him with his seizures and issues.

This had nothing to do with how she had been cared for her whole life, seeing how she had lived well beyond her life expectancy and was a very happy and loving.  I knew her life was coming to a close but when I found her collapsed on the back porch one day after letting her out , she appeared to be suffering from a stroke or cerebral hemorrhage I took her to Southern Regional  Veterinary Specialist because it was the weekend and my usual Veterinarian was closed. The staff were very helpful and caring but unfortunately there was nothing that could be done except ending any pain or suffering that she may have been experiencing.  The experience was awful but the staff were very kind.\n\nA few months after this I was looking after a friends place in a rural area when I kept hearing a persistent tiny meowing from a kitten.  Unfortunately his hind leg had been pinned and severely mangled and I was afraid I was going to have to once again have to poor animal euthanized but after once again having to take the animal to southern Regional because it was the only vet open they reassured me that they could save the animals life and that he would have a good chance of having a pretty normal and happy life albeit without one limb. I choose to adopt the poor critter and spend the money to have the amputation performed. I can say that although the price was what I would describe as fairly considerable, its been by far the best choice I've ever made. The cat and I have bonded like no other animal and I have before. I am very thankful that the staff explained that the kitten would very likely survive the amputation surgery and go on to have a normal and happy life as an indoor cat. I was worried about him not being able to get around well or being handicapped by the surgery but they assured me that since he was so young he would very likely adjust and go on to adapt to not having it and indeed this is what happened.  He is very happy, loving, playful and gets around just as well as any cat I've ever had. He's very fast and can jump on a counter top with very little difficulty and has had no problems to speak of  besides not being able to scratch behind his ear very well on the affected side,  which I happily scratch for him when I see the need or he brings it to my attention.

Our 18 month old Chihuahua Pee Wee was outside on Mother's Day playing when he took off running through the woods chasing a squirrel. When Pee Wee came out of the woods he was limping and wouldn't put any weight on one of his back legs, so we took him to the vet. After having x rays done we were informed Pee Wee had indeed broken his leg and the best option with the best outcome was surgery. After having Dr. Martin at SRVS highly recommend to us the x-rays were sent over and we was told to be expecting a call from SRVS. It didn't take long before I was contacted by SRVS to set up an appointment for Pee Wee to come in and have surgery. The lady I spoke with on the phone was extremely nice and set up Pee Wee an appointment for the following day. The morning we arrived for surgery we was greeted by both ladies at the front desk and was checked in. We didn't have to wait no time before we was called to the back.\nDr. Martin discussed everything with us and we was given an estimate of what it would cost. When given the estimate it was detailed very well with the lowest and highest estimate. (Which I totally appreciated) When we checked out I was ASKED if I could pay the lowest estimate right then and told if it did go over that amount they would let me know the following day when I returned to take Pee Wee home. It was explained to me that if it ended up costing less than the lowest estimate that I paid the day of the surgery that they would refund me the difference. I appreciated the fact that I was given the lowest and the highest estimates that way I would know  about what the cost would be. A couple of hours later I received a call from Dr. Martin himself informing me off Pee Wee's condition and details of how the surgery went. I was told if I wanted he could come home the following day or he could stay an additional night if I felt more comfortable with him there. I chose to go ahead and bring him home the following morning because he was doing well and we missed him dearly. The day after surgery I returned to pick him up and Dr. Martin went over all the aftercare instructions with me and the medications given. Pee Wee is home resting now and is expected to make a full recovery! \u2665 Thank you Dr. Martin and ALL the staff at SRVS for taking such wonderful care of Pee Wee,  you've been such a blessing to our family!!!

He advised us that they were the only ones set up for surgery unless we drove her to Auburn, AL. Regardless of them being the closest, we wouldn't have chosen anyone else knowing the experience we've had.\n\nThe staff immediately took an x-ray and Dr. Champion confirmed our worst fear, she had a flipped stomach.

However, they are a specialized staff that are available at all hours of the night to care for your animals. We love our Finnley like she is no less important than any other member of our family. No doubt about it, she would have died. No matter the cost, we would have paid it. However, they were extremely fair.

I believe he was more concerned about how many surgeries he could do that day and how much money he could make.  Duke is a Miniature Dachshund.  They are prone to have back problems.  When he was 11 years old he woke me up about midnight in pain.  I took him to SRVS where they gave him a shot.  I spent about $200 then.  The next morning, he was still in pain so I took him back.  They gave him narcotics and put him on an IV of fluids.  He did not have access to water, otherwise. I believe they gave him too much narcotics because he was howling and did not even recognize me when I went to see him.   After a quick diagnosis, they said he needed surgery on his back near his neck.  They couldn\u2019t do surgery right away because he was dehydrated.  Dr. Martin admitted they did not give him sufficient fluids. They told me they would have to do a Myelogram.  I specifically asked Dr. Martin \u201cWhat are the dangers?\u201d  He remarked that he may hit a bone (vertebrae) and have to move the needle.  He did not say anything else or tell me of any complications.  When I confronted Dr. Martin about his answer regarding complications, his remark was \u201cMy bad\u201d, meaning himself that he didn\u2019t inform me.  That was no consolation. Duke also had seizures that I was never told could occur.  When I got upset about that, his daughter got all high and mighty like I had done something wrong.  It was only later in talking with friends that I realized how dangerous this procedure was.  In my opinion they did not take necessary precautions when administering the Myelogram, such as keeping his head elevated so that it didn\u2019t go to his brain.  The next day they took him outside to potty but said he just wanted to sit down.  This was the second lie I was told.  In actuality, his hind legs were paralyzed from the Myelogram.  Then his liver and kidneys started failing.  They put him on an IV to try to regain function but it was too late.  On the discharge papers they told their third lie.  They said that he was standing on his own.  At that point I took him to his regular Vet where they tried desperately to save his life.  The damage had already been done.  I took him home.  I took him outside and he took two wobbly steps and that was the last time he walked.   Duke lost his dignity and his pride when he lost control of his bowels and bladder.  I had to have him put to sleep the next day because of what I believe was negligence by Dr. Martin.  That just about killed me.  I knew my little boy had a few good years left.  He never reimbursed me for the surgery he never performed which to me shows just how greedy he is.  I took him to small claims court just to show him that there are consequences.  He didn\u2019t need a lawyer because the judge argued his case because he was a \u201cProfessional\u201d.  Professional or not, he lied in my opinion. I spent about $5000 at SRVS.  Of that about $3000 was for surgery.  Dr. Martin never reimbursed me a single penny for surgery that was NOT performed.  I still mourn the loss of Duke.  My only solace is that he is in Heaven.\nEverything I\u2019ve expressed here is my opinion but I believe everything to be truthful.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892927f2f2133b1:0xc87b5d9adef21328"}

Sounds to me like most of the folks were in seek of free advice. If you need after hours emergency care, you can certainly expect to pay for it. The first time I called this clinic was late at night on a weekend and I agree, the person I spoke with was definitely determined to get my commitment to pay if a Vet was coming to meet me. How many of you would get up at 3:00 AM on a Sunday morning and go to your office if you were not going to get paid? I can only imagine the frustration they experience when pet owner has a possible emergency but yet balks when expected to pay to have their pet treated. It is very expensive to obtain the education necessary to cure animals of diseases and to fix them surgically. Should they do it for free? Is it wrong to make money? There's a difference between a business and a charity. Some evidently don't realize that.\n\nI was thrilled with the care my dog received. Yes it was expensive!! So what, they saved my dogs life...Dr. Martin removed an insulinoma- a tumor from his pancreas and inspected his lymph nodes, liver, etc. for signs of spreading.\nA major surgery that included over 48 hours in the hospital. should I complain about the bill? Should it have been cheap? If your child had cancer would you look for the cheapest oncologist? Of course not. The doctors at STVS are kind, patient, and most importantly skilled. If I went to College for a decade and spent God knows how much money on those degrees, I would like to think I would be well compensated for my expertise. Try calling a surgeon at your local people hospital and asking them if you should come into the hospital or not? Come on folks....everything related to medical care, animals or people, is expensive. If you had gone in and paid the 250,  you would have received very good care for your animal!!! Thank you to Dr. Martin and the entire staff!

We discussed the options then I said let's put him out of his pain. I was then made to go pay more money ($16) to have his suffering ended. Then I waited awhile while they tortured him and blew out the veins in his front legs trying to euthanize him. That didn't work so they took him to the back and I got to hear him scream as they jammed a needle into his heart to put him down.

Naturally, I didn\u2019t had much of a choice b/c of my dog issue. The desk clerk seemed to be new at her job b/c she continued to ask surrounding vet specialist for help on every question that I asked. After basic paperwork, I was hit with an itemized bill that was x2 the cost for normal OFA x-rays and submission fees. I also had to write down my credit card information on the OFA paperwork for additional reading and filing fees (In which, I learned later this is false). Now, I fear about my credit card information. I questioned everything with little to no help. Faced with little choice at the time, I continued with the process. Before they took my dog, they asked me if I had any questions before they begin. I ask how are they going to evaluate my dog\u2019s legs to determine if it\u2019s a soft tissue or ACL damage. They replied by saying during sedation they would flex my dogs legs by feeling for full range of motion. I, again, ask how is that going to determine anything since my dogs muscle is relaxed and limped. That answer didn\u2019t settled well with me. In the mist, the desk clerk wanted me to pay upfront for the entire procedure. I questioned this action since it was unusual. She replied that it is company policy and we would credit your card if any after the procedure. I told her that I wasn\u2019t leaving my dog during his sedation (previously showed her my military card to validate personal information) and my dog is microchip with corresponding information. After the x-rays, the veterinary physician went over the x-rays. He didn\u2019t give me any answers to why my dog was having issues with his rear legs. However, he kept on saying that German Shepherds are prone to hip dysplasia. This was his go to answer for everything. He didn\u2019t provide recovery recommendations, treatment, potential future issues, or anything. I felt like I was rushed after they finished the x-rays. After paying that high bill, I asked if they had a dog gurney to ease my dog\u2019s problem but nothing. The following day (today) I reviewed this situation with the on post vet. They were shocked and surprised by the entire process. Now, I am in the process to black list them from post.

All of our animals have been patients of this practice. There has been a steady decline of customer service. We had a dog injured 5 years ago due to a dog attack and they handled that situation with the upmost love and respect. We paid for MONTHS of laser treatments to heal our dogs open wounds. This was after we spent money on several surgeries to help with the extent of her injuries.\nThis past week we had to make the difficult decision to have one of our pets put to sleep. He had terminal cancer and they offered no treatment plan for him. My husband took him in for an appointment for euthanasia. He told me the method they used to euthanize him, and it was not the standard as to other local facilities. Our pet was not sedated at all. They immediately administered the shot to stop his heart- which within 3 seconds our beloved family pet fell over in my husband\u2019s arms. As hard of a decision as it was, this small act made it so much worse. We felt this was not correct procedure and actually inquired with other local veterinarian offices. They in fact confirmed our suspicions. We will no longer take our other pets to their office, and in good concience cannot recommend them. We are heartbroken over the way our sweet boy was taken from us and do not wish this experience on another pet and their family.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88892db0405718e3:0x6c002e9f2a7af094"}

We recently purchased one, Ramos, from  Germany.  After about  6 weeks here,  he developed a case of bloat that could have killed him.  With bloat, the stomach actually \"flips over\" and cuts the blood supply off to the stomach, causing a rapid distension, and death if not treated quickly.  Fortunately, Ramos' stomach flipped back without emergency surgery.\n\nNot wanting to go through this again, we researched bloat and found the best \u201ccure\u201d for it is a laparoscopic assisted gastropexy.  In this procedure the dog's stomach is sutured to the abdominal wall. The sutures eventually dissolve but the stomach is held permanently in place by an \"adhesion\" preventing recurrent \"flipping\".  Many animal hospitals do not have a laparoscope or the skill to accomplish this procedure.  Dr. Daniels was able to take care of this surgery and Ramos is 99% normal after five days. He has personally checked on Ramos 4 times on his own time since surgery.\n\nEverything about Drs. Daniels and Clark, and their clinic and team  was strictly professional, yet courteous and friendly.  We can't forget Cassidy, the glue and the center of their clinic.  Exceptional personality and warmth!\n\nIf you are looking for a superior team to take care of your special \u201cfamily member\u201d, consider Dr. Daniels and Clark at Nall Daniels Animal Hospital in Homewood.\n\nNot close enough for you?

The first time I took him for his annual shots and a check up I asked about the small lumps on his body and they said it was nothing. 6 months ago I took him to this office to get a check up because we had some concerns. After paying hundreds of dollars for tests and x-rays, they assured me that there was nothing usual going on with my dog. This week he started getting very sick, and after a trip to a different vet, we found out he had cancer and it was very prolonged and caused other problems like anemia, kidney failure and lesions on his lungs. This kind of progression doesn't happen in 6 months. It happens over years. He had been coming here for years and they never once said anything about the cancer that was all over my dog's body and covering his organs. At this point, he was in too much pain, couldn't eat or drink, and could hardly breathe. The new vet and I decided it was best to put him down so he wouldn't be hurting anymore. After years of coming to the same office they never said anything remotely close to cancer.\n\nThere is nothing I can do for my dog anymore, but there is still something you can do for your's. DO NOT bring your animals to this office. There is no way a cancer this severe goes unnoticed for so long with an office that provides quality care. Find somewhere to take your pets that won't treat them like they treated my dog.

Upon arrival to the clinic the dog had to be carried in and was recumbent the whole time and clearly in medical distress.   The blood panel showed that the dog was in end stage renal failure and to complicate matters was Heart Worm positive.  The medical team at Nall Daniels immediately relayed to Adopt A Golden Bham their findings and indicated that the dog was indeed suffering.  It was their medical opinion that the dog should be euthanized.  Neither Adopt A Golden Birmingham nor Nall Daniels Animal Hospital medical team take these decisions lightly.   We are in the business of rescuing and saving dogs.  Not making this decision and watching the dog suffer was simply not an option, as much as it devastates all of us involved to terminate the life of any of our dogs.   We have the utmost respect for Dr. Daniels and his medical team and are proud to be associated with their clinic and the \"above the call of duty care\" they give to all the rescue dogs that they have treated for us and will continue to treat.

Nall-Daniel\u2019s provides a variety of veterinary services including well pet check ups, grooming, surgery, and prescriptions. We went there for our yearly check up and vaccinations for our two dogs; a senior Golden Retriever, and a six year old mutt. The entrance was very clean and clam. When we got called back, we were in a decent sized examination room with a vet tech, I can\u2019t remember his name, but he was a very kind and patient young man with brown hair. He was very thorough with us; he listened to and answered all of our questions. He even provided us with a printed out quote of what all the shots, the visit, and the treatment for the ear infection that our Golden had, before performing any procedures. Then, Dr. Dunaway came in to examine them. She immediately got down in the floor and started loving on the boys. You could see her passion for animal care when she came in the room. She was very articulate and detail oriented, laying out all of the treatment options for the ear infection and recommending medication for his arthritis, too. Her bedside manner was impeccable and I felt listened to and informed as she explained everything that she was doing. We never felt rushed, even as it got near closing time. All in all, it was a wonderful experience. I had called fifteen clinic before choosing this one. The reason I chose them in the first place was because they were one of the most affordable. Sometimes, affordability comes at the expense of the quality of care, but not here. I could tell they genuinely cared about the well being of our animals, and I think that we have found a lifelong vet!

I had recently made Nall Daniels my vet and had only needed to bring my dog in a few times before she died.  Although the prices are not low (comparable to other vets, but all are high these days it seems!) the care she received was excellent, the staff was very friendly, and every time I brought her in I received calls to check on her in a day or two.  When I brought her in a week ago, I knew it was probably going to be time to put her down.  She was suffering and could no longer walk.  The staff at Nalls Daniel couldn't have been more kind, caring, gentle, thoughtful, and patient with me and my family.  They made the process as personal and easy as it could be made.  They took good care of my dog and of me until the end.  They were respectful of me and my wishes during this heartbreaking time.\nToday I returned from a luncheon to find beautiful flowers waiting on my porch in memory of Mini from the staff at Nalls Daniel.  I am overwhelmed at their kindness.

The actual docs have been super nice each time I\u2019ve been there and walked me through the whole process of having a new puppy very well. However, my dog will never return to this place again. I\u2019ve boarded my dog here 5 total times. The 1st time she seemed skinny when I picked her up, but there was no way for me to know how much food she got because I dropped off a whole bag. Because of this I started measuring out exactly what she would need for each stay. The 2nd stay went fine. The 3rd stay was for 3 days, she was eating 6 cups of food per day, and I dopped off 18 cups of food. This time again she was noticeably skinnier, and they gave me back 6 cups of food, which let me know that they only fed her twice per day instead of 3 times like I asked. A whole day\u2019s worth of food that she didn\u2019t get in a 3-day period. I checked before the 4th stay if it would be better to do 3 cups twice per day to make sure she got her food, and for a 7 day stay, everything was fine. I just picked her up today for her 5th and last stay. She now eats 7 cups of food per day, so I told them 3.5 cups twice per day. The person that took her from the car noted that I still feed 3 times per day, but to make sure she got her food, she wrote 3.5 cups on the page. Again, she was noticeably skinnier, and I was given back 8 cups of food. They showed me the boarding page with a sticker that said 3 cups twice per day. I pointed out the fact that it said 3.5 cups on the other sheet. Even if they fed 3 cups each time, I would have received back 4 cups of food from a 4 day stay. Not 8 cups of food.

When my wife showed up at 1:20 the receptionist was as rude as anyone could be to my already frantic wife. She told her no vets were in because they were on lunch. Then when my wife said so there's not a single thing you can do (keep in mind my dog is right in front of her bleeding all over the place) she rolled her eyes and said she could kennel him until they got back from lunch unless it was a real emergency...really lady??my dog is bleeding from his neck everywhere, but no it's not an emergency. After my took him down the road to Irby Overton where they immediately took him back and extracted the bullet from his neck. They said if it would've been a centimeter lower it would've hit his artery in his neck and he would've bled to death in a matter of minutes.

I went there because its convenient to my home, but after several months of using them, its obvious they care more about making money than about your pets health!! I was already displeased about being talked down to when I asked Dr. Leonard about getting my dogs monthly flea/tick and heartworm meds from an online vendor. He told me it would only save me a few dollars, blah blah... but, he seemed to fail to realize that, they are MY dollars!! 4 months later, after paying about $45 a month for her meds through him, I finally decided to place my order through 1800petmeds and pay $60 for a 3 month supply.  Of course, the Rx has to be authorized by your vet, who we just saw less than 2 months ago and had an appointment to see again on the 17th for her final round of puppy shots and to make an appointment for her to be spayed in the coming weeks. After a week has passed, 1800petmeds has faxed them for approval 3x and I have called twice. Finally, they called my husband to say it'll be $18.50 to approve her prescription, and she will need a $25 heartworm test first??? Regardless of the fact that she's been under his regular care since the day I got her at 6 weeks old. I am switching vets. Like, today!!!! I will not be extorted by a cheap, condescending vet who cares more about making a profit off the meds than about the health of my dog. Also, at her last visit, I had her nails trimmed, it was going right along fine when he got to the 8th toenail and all of a sudden she yelped so loud and totally freaked out and he couldn't finish.. but, of course, he didn't cut or hurt her.. she just suddenly got upset.. after calmly letting him cut the first 7 nails!  The ONLY thing I can say positive I can really say about this place is there's a very nice lady that works there on Tuesdays, who seems to care about pet owners and helping them save money while caring for their fur babies.  I used to interact with her alot with my previous pup, who I lost tragically in April, but I haven't seen her much since I got the new one. I'm not sure of her name, but it wasn't the vet, or his wife, who treats my dog like she's just any old anonymous dog... didn't even bother to write her name on the folder containing all the shots, treatment info she sent home, it's just a blank card with no \"pet's name\" written in the blank.

This review is completely unfair and not honest. Her dog was seen here four months ago. We don't know why she is suddenly writing a review. First, we don't keep pets here just to make money. We did not charge her $900 for boarding. That's just not true. Hospitalization (boarding) was charged for her pet to stay here for two nights at the cost of $108.22, which included administering the pain medication and antibiotics through the weekend. We stayed late to examine, sedate (to eliviate her dogs pain while she was positioned for radiographs), administered intravenous fluids, splinted her leg, and administer pain and antibiotic medications to her dog through the weekend. All treatments that we provided were completed at her request and signature. The charges weren't any different than would have been charged at any other clinic in Birmingham. This client was not our client and she couldn't get in at any other vet in the area late on a Saturday morning just before we closed at noon.\n\nFinally, we could not discharge her pet because he was completely asleep (sedated). It's something that vets just don't do. Bad things can happen when patients aren't kept quiet and still to rest and stabilize while under anesthesia. Also, the liability of someone driving in a hurry down the highway, slamming on their breaks and causing their dog to fly through the air and breaking it's neck is not a smart thing to allow.\n\nAlso, our honest experience had been that the surgical center doesn't see patients for routine fractures on the weekend. They are kept hospitalized at a general hospital or at the ER until Monday. The emergency hospital that is associated with the surgical center IS open 24/7 for emergencies throughout the weekend. That is probably the information that the client is referring to. This wasn't an emergency as he wasn't in shock and we had stabilized him on intravenous fluids. We literally called down there today and the technician told us that a bill for observation through the weekend for a dog with a simple fracture on intravenous fluids, antibiotics and pain medications at the emergency hospital would literally approach $2000.\n\nSo, we saved this client over $1000, saw her dog when nobody else would, stayed late and provided high quality medicine, and did what was best for her dog.\n\nThis review is not honest or accurate and should be removed."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889046cf4f5b825:0x6863f15c86bf3033"}

We strive to give our clients and their beloved pets the best experience we can offer. Your sweet baby Mercedes came in on 7/14/20 for a spay, which went perfect. Unfortunately the morning after her surgery, we noticed that she was vomiting a little, which we immediately informed you about. When we spoke with you about the vomiting, our associate suggested treatment, which you approved. The relief veterinarian that was on duty thought a fecal exam (stool sample) would help us to be sure that there were no other issues associated with her vomiting, which may have been miscommunicated (we gladly refunded this nominal fee). With this test we did find that Mercedes had hookworms, which can be associated with vomiting in many pets. We informed you of her results and suggested we deworm her. At that time you declined that service. At pick up the receptionist informed you of all charges before finalizing any payment, which at that time you agreed to with no questions asked or problems. When we spoke on 7/16/20, two days after your sweet baby had her surgical procedure to discuss your overall experience, to our surprise you told us that you were unsatisfied with our services. At that time you stated that when you first called for a price quote you were quoted $129 for the spay and were also told that included an IV catheter. This could not have happened as all of our receptionist have been on staff for quite some time and know that these procedures are not included in the surgery fee. I think what happened (because it happens a lot) is that you truly wanted these important protective measures for Mercedes but it all added up to more than you expected it to be with the treatment for the vomiting and nausea. Also, on the sheet that you filled out with the list of recommended pre-surgical procedures such as blood work and IV catheter, the price is clearly stated next to it. Plus there is a box to check yes or no as to whether you wanted the procedure or not right next to the price. Why would we ask you to chose yes or no if it was already included? We refunded you over $107 (which we didn't have to do) as a gesture of good will and you still remained upset and gave us a negative review. Bottom line is that you chose the added procedures which were performed."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889046cf4f5b825:0x6863f15c86bf3033"}

BEWARE!!!\n\nSo to start this off please understand, I am not a medical professional, however I professionally remove and rehabilitate wildlife. I am very experienced in just about all wounds, injury's, illnesses, and human harm caused by domestic and non-domestic animals.\n\nI have recently adopted a Dutch Shepherd, my primary vet for all of my inquires is Mercy Hospital(whom in my experience I would trust with my own life!)\n\nMy dog was a rescue, obviously covered in parasites from previous settings.\n\nI explained the situation to the profession under review( my wife made this appointment due to the ease involving COVID-19, as mercy was booked)\n\nKeep in  mind as a wildlife professional, I have already assessed my dogs illness.\n\nThe main reason for a vet was to acquire a  accurate heart worm test.\nWhen handing over my beloved Dutch shepherd I caught myself telling the vets office about her harmless  Sinus Arrhythmia Heart Rhythm(very common in dogs while sleeping)\n\nLonger story shorter, the vet personally talked to me telling me that my dog has a serious heart murmur, and attempted to sway me into the tests to verify. I already knew with no doubt there is not a heart murmur.\n\nThe doctor himself turned into a upselling salesmen attempting to use sympathy to sway me into purchasing tests. I am also a licensed insurance producer for Alabama so I am very aware of salesmen tactics, and I will say he tried. He tried very hard in his sympathetic approach claiming I need to do it now, its very serious.\n\nI then proceeded to my normal vet at Mercy Hospital for a second opinion. My Vet listened to my dogs heart for an extended period, as well as got another in house vet to listen as well as me, we all concluded there is no murmur and the heart is in great condition, afterword's ran tests to conclude.\n\nThis goes to show, don't try to scam people on sympathy, you never know how educated the other party is in your field.\n\nAlso as a consumer warning always be weary of ratings when choosing a service, especially when life is involved, a huge amount of services either pay for reviews, or pay there employees a commission per 5 star review.\n\nI wouldn't use a dishonest practice such as this, but I also can not say my mentioned vet is your best choice, I only speak from personal experience.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1591036913227, "text": "We unequivocally and absolutely DO NOT upsell unneeded diagnostics at this hospital! We offer and provide medically what is appropriate for each pet. We are sorry that Mr. McAllister did not have the experience at our clinic that he wanted. Due to the accusative and completely unfair nature of his review, we must clear up numerus false assertions that he has made. We have reviewed the chart from his dog's visit with the doctors and staff involved. After discussing, all involved remembered clearly the visit. To say that we use sympathy to perform inappropriate diagnostics is completely inaccurate and unfair.\n\nFirst, he requested (just like any other clinic, our receptionists write down EXACTLY on the chart what the client requests for us to do) to have his dog examined because lately she had been mopey. That was his exact words. The primary request was not to have a heartworm test performed. That was a secondary request.\n\nSecondly, his dog had a heart murmur and wasn't feeling well. That is something very different than a sinus arrhythmia which is completely benign. The further cardiac diagnostics that we offered to fully assess the heart condition in a rescue dog was completely indicated (remember this is a rescue in which the medical history is unknown) and was the best medical practice for this dog. Sometimes diagnostics that are performed come back normal and that is great but it doesn't mean that the diagnostics weren't indicated. All vet hospitals offer tests that commonly come back normal.\n\nBoth of our doctors have been out of vet school 24 and 47 years respectively and are very capable of diagnosing heart problems. They do not offer diagnostics that are not indicated but they do offer the best medical diagnostics and treatments for all pets. Do some pet owners decline to have offered diagnostics performed. Yes, every hospital experience this on a daily basis. Do some murmurs come and go? Yes. Did this happen in this case? Maybe.\n\nAlso, why did the other clinic go ahead and do the further diagnostics if it wasn't indicated?? The answer is that they were indicated! Unbelievable! The diagnostics that we offered were indicated.\n\nSo we were presented with a large breed dog that was approximately 5 years old (which makes it middle aged) and had been RESCUED. Dogs that have been rescued commonly have heartworms because they haven't receive proper care which includes heartworm prevention. If it had heartworms they very well could have and commonly can cause a heart murmur.\n\nBottom line: for someone untrained in the veterinary field that rescues and rehabilitates animals to accuse us of using sympathy and scamming people to increase diagnostics is deplorable. The other clinics in the area know we don't do this just as we know they don't practice this way either. This clinic has been here for over 45 years and the current owner has owned it for the past 15 years. We have a great reputation and thousands of happy clients.\n\nThis review is a good example of LIBEL and is illegal. It should be removed!"}, "gmap_id": "0x8889046cf4f5b825:0x6863f15c86bf3033"}

DO NOT take your pets here. Especially if you have cats. They are extremely careless and are very inconsiderate of mixing pets. The whole time I was checking in, a huge retriever kept sticking his face into the carrier I had Lulu in. The front desk saw that, saw me pushing him away, saw the owner doing nothing about it, and didn't say a word. Truthfully, everyone there seemed nice enough but they are incredibly sloppy and careless.

BYW, please don't tell Sasha she's a c-a-t.  Sasha was adopted from All Creatures 12 yrs ago as a 6 wk old when Dr. Allen held the reins and my son was a lab tech.\n\nWith the arrival of Dr. Hankes (and my son was gone to college), as you can imagine there were questions about the changes coming.  I have been so very pleased with the continuation of great services and getting to know another vet who is not only a well trained physician but truly loves all the pets that come in and wants the very best for them and their guardians.  The big bonus is that Denise (Sr. Lab Tech), who Sasha usually sees - and Sasha's very shy, has won over my baby and even has her choosing to stay with Ms. Denise instead of me after injections and exams some days.  That says A LOT for the caring ways of the team at All Creatures and who they are as crew members/care givers not just employees..\n\nRecently, Sasha had a period of rapid weight loss after getting a kidney issue under control and Dr. Hankes found that she had a growth on her thyroid as well as fluid around her heart causing breathing issues.  She was a very sick little girl.  Dr. Hankes treated her heart and brought it under control and within a period of weeks.  Dr. Hankes, teamed with Dr. Hall, was then able to remove the problematic portion of the thyroid and the growth.  Now 4 wks after surgery, her heart is doing well - she's gaining weight and running round the house like a wild 4 yr old instead of a 12 yr old.  Dr. Hankes and Dr. Hall did a great job with the surgery, the staff let Sasha recouperate in her basket with a blanket from home and are now keeping a tabs on her for a while to make sure her remaining thyroid is functioning properly.  Thanks to their great care, we're looking forward to many more years together.\n\nI have recommended All Creatures to my family, friends and new neighbors who are in need of a vet and have for years and hope you'll see them, too.  I don't know of any Pet Hospital around where you can get the top quality care PLUS the Super Care Givers that are on the team with Dr. Hankes at All Creatures Pet Hospital.  You'll be glad you've found one of the gems of not only Gardendale but the Greater Birmingham/Jefferson Area.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889046cf4f5b825:0x6863f15c86bf3033"}

Michelle is the office manager, and even more than being a professional, she has always proven to be a compassionate individual with a house full of her own pets. Again, I have to assume that there was a miscommunication problem.\n\nI hope that others with medical emergencies or those looking for a safe, compassionate practice to take care of their pets will give Weatherly a chance.

All our fur babies loved her and the dogs were laying at her feet not long after being seen and the cats were at ease too. They got their shots and blood draws, she diagnosed and prescribed meds for a yeast infection in one of our cat's ears that was previously undetected for years and found a hernia and a tumor in our newest dog\u2019s abdomen. A week or so later she repaired the hernia and removed the tumor, spayed her and pulled four broken/bad teeth and now she\u2019s doing just fine.

Overall it\u2019s a sad place and I appreciate the little help that they try to give to these animals but something better needs to be done with this facility", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88926e90213ee515:0xcd53de7821acc2b8"}

The office manager helped me with getting out 3 dogs records from our previous vet and arranged our pets visits. During the vet visit the Doctor was on the phone with me the entire time (during COVID) - explained everything including the cost for each test and medication. She answered all of my questions honestly and was great to explain everything. My dog suffers from allergies and previously we were not taken very seriously and told to give large doses of Benadryl even though I explained that does not work for her anymore- it never really did. The most vital part was that she helped me with a treatment plan for my dog. At the end of the visit #1 I was not surprised by the bill- she discussed all that with me as we spoke and #2 I knew the all of the next steps. That was a big deal because where we were before I never had a treatment plan and basically we started over every time we came in. The next day Lucy\u2019s skin was not red, hot, and irritated, she wasn\u2019t chewing on her paws and shaking her head, she wasn\u2019t panting and stressing her and everyone around her out. she was relaxed and calm, and sleeping so peacefully- that hasn\u2019t happened in 8 years for her. The doctor even called me back to go over all of her blood work results. I have never been more impressed with a veterinarian clinic. I am actually a little embarrassed that I continued taking my dogs to the previous vet all these years- had I known the level of service that we were missing and the expertise these doctors offer in comparison to what we had grown accustomed to, I would have moved them many years ago.

They brought it to my attention that he was not being cooperative and would need to be sedated. We passed on this at the moment to discuss the $150 fee they were asking.\n\nThey did let me know they were able to get his back paws trimmed. Upon returning home, we found that they completely broke one of our dog's back nails. Not just broke, but practically tore it out of the nail bed. It's sitting 90 degrees from where it's supposed to be.\n\nIt doesn't take a genius to think this through...if this was the first nail they tried to cut...then of course he acted out the rest of the time. He was hurt!\n\nIf it was the last nail they tried to cut and he had been acting so bad to begin with, why didn't they stop?\n\nAnd...you're telling me you didn't know you hurt him that badly??? How can this happen and you not see it?\n\nToday, he is at another vet who was able to examine him without any sort of sedation. The nail that was injured by Helena Veterinary Clinic will now cost me $200 to fix.\n\nHelena Veterinary Clinic's response to this...it's my fault. I should have practiced with him daily to get him used to having his nails trimmed.

I don't expect anyone to stop everything when something happens to one of my animals but when an animal is very old and becomes short of breath and semi responsive, you'd at least think the vet office that you call would at least sound like they care even if they don't. In a brief phone call, it was obvious that the person who answered was not concerned, sympathetic, or compassionate. Luckily, there is another office that we were able to contact, be seen, and send our sweet angel to Heaven within an hour. She was almost gone when we called your office and were told you could see us in about 2 hours like it was just some routine vet visit.

A situation arose where our youngest and smallest dog was having some apparent GI distress and we called the clinic and Dr. Goodwin took our call and discussed the situation and had us come in. That is a level of customer service you don't ordinarily see from professional-level providers like doctors, lawyers, dentists and veterinarians.  We were greeted by kind and caring front office and technical staff and our pet's issues were addressed in a caring and professional manner. The approach was also conservative rather than a rush to run a litany of tests and get x-rays that might not have been warranted. And it turns out they weren't. After an overnight stay for our pet, we were promptly followed up with by Dr. Goodwin even though it was his day off. We were discharged under the care of Dr. Sterenberg with the same caring and thoroughness of Dr. Goodwin.

He was seen by Dr. Goodwin. I was told he was blocked and had to have a surgery that would basically open up his urethra. So he had the surgery and he came home. He wasn\u2019t getting better. Still in complete pain, losing weight, and straining horribly to use the bathroom. Not only that but he now has a gaping hole in his rear that is exposed to outside air and bacteria and causing infection. We went back to Goodwin in December for them to redo the surgery. Still not successful. At this point he\u2019s being boarded at the Chantilly facility for constant observation. Looking back I\u2019m assuming because they knew they had messed my baby up. So January rolls around and he\u2019s not better. Weight loss, no appetite, and clearly in pain constantly. Dr. Sermon(?) decided to take over and redid the surgery AGAIN.  At this point my cat has been boarded there for over a month and has had THREE SURGERIES. Now I have a cat with constant issues at this point. They said the surgery was effective. WRONG IT WAS NOT. I\u2019ll put a pic in the comments of his rear on the regular due to this complication. He couldn\u2019t even sit down comfortably. He couldn\u2019t walk like a normal cat. And he was constantly crying out in pain and straining. I switched vets at the point and had to spend the next three years of his life at routine visits every 2-3 months to have him sedated and antibiotics and his rear cleaned up. This constant pain eventually took a toll on him. I paid hundreds for prescription food and frequent vet visits and all Goodwin did for me was take a couple grand off my bill and left me with still around a $2k bill for them ruining my cats life. He recently died at only 6 years of age due to his poor quality of life and constant pain and infection caused by this surgery. I\u2019ve investigated this with an attorney and I\u2019m regretful I waited this long as it is outside of the statute of limitations for malpractice or Goodwin would have a lawsuit on their hands. I truly believe they single-handedly ruined my cats life and caused him to be taken from me way too soon.

You can tell the staff have been through extensive sales training from the way they push the Wellness plan (starting at $500 per year per pet).  They avoid answering questions about how much the items covered in the wellness plan actually cost, which is why I politely told them no each time they brought it up (on average 3 times per visit).\n\nWhat has made me decide to NOT use them again is the number of follow up exams they required (beyond the industry standard according to 3 other vetinarians).  Each of these follow up exams was another $30 (not including medication, scrapings, etc).  All 3 of the other vets said that the follow up exam is included in the initial exam costs.  When this was brought to their attention, their response was \"Well, YOU chose to bring her back to us.....you didn't have to.\"   HUH?  You told me it was necessary.  And now that you have my money, you are telling me I was the sucker for bringing her back?  Well, kudos to you.

Dr. Farmer is a wonderful vet and I have used him for years. However recently we saw Dr. Bearden. I cannot recommend her under any circumstances. My dog had an obvious deformation in her leg after an accident. Dr. Bearden put her in a splint, took X-rays and told us she would send them to a surgeon. Each week we went back and the treatment plan/diagnosis/story changed. The staff would tell me something different than she did each time. She never sent the X-rays to a surgeon. 6 weeks this went on. (Shame on me for letting it go on so long) On the last visit the dog was dropped off 7am, at her request, for observation without the splint. She didn\u2019t look at the dog or remove the splint until I called at 1:30 for an update. At 3:30 she claimed the dog only had \u201cliganitis\u201d but was still not putting weight on the leg. When I asked about the \u201cdent\u201d she claimed I had never told her about it. Not true, and it was easy to see on the dog\u2019s leg. She wanted to give the dog back without a splint. I had the staff splint the leg and took the dog to another vet. She had to have a metal plate surgically implanted to fix the damage. Because of Dr Bearden\u2019s poor diagnostic skills, I cannot recommend PC Animal Hospital unless you see Dr. Farmer.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888962c804fbec89:0x71ba20c35393e330"}

He regretted that his staff did not let me know that. People get busy and forget. I do not hold them responsible.

She came back happy and clean (all pets are required to leave with a bath) which was lovely.\n\nHowever, there were a few problems.\n\nFirst, there is a gray cat that wanders around in the lobby. I might be a bit more understanding if the cat was relaxed and calm, but it clearly doesn\u2019t like dogs (hissed at ours as soon as it walked in). It was walking all over the counter and floors when we dropped off and picked up, and was actively rubbing itself on the items owners were leaving for their dogs. Everyone in my household has cat allergies, so this was very unwelcome for us. Additionally, not all dogs can handle being around a cat or their scent, and with leashes coming off and on there is way too much opportunity for an attack to happen. That puts people\u2019s dogs AND the cat in danger, which just seems so irresponsible for a clinic/boarding facility.  As we were picking up, we also witnessed this cat suddenly scratch a woman that had been petting it. I know cats can be finicky but what if that had been a child?\n\nOur second issue was that we had to ask where the rest of her items were when we came to pick her up as they weren\u2019t with her bag. Their boarding paperwork requires you list all the items you will be leaving with your pet, so what was the point of filling it out if it doesn\u2019t matter?\n\nThird, we left exactly enough food for our dog to be fed for 6 mornings and 6 nights when we dropped her off Monday morning, so you can imagine our surprise when we saw 2 bags of food left. When we asked the receptionist why she still had food left over, she directed us to someone who might have been feeding her for the time she was there. He said that he and one other person were responsible, yet when we asked he couldn\u2019t explain why there were 2 bags left. First he said he didn\u2019t know, then he said she ate everyday. Which means she either ate someone else\u2019s food or someone didn\u2019t feed her. Either way he clearly didn\u2019t know and didn\u2019t want to get in trouble. We label her food bags because she has to take a fish pill for constipation in the morning(which we leave in the bag) and both bags were morning bags, so that\u2019s 2 days of her stay where she didn\u2019t get her food OR her pill. It\u2019s unacceptable that no one could answer whether or not she had been fed. If she had just not eaten on those days I would understand, but they didn\u2019t even know the answer to that.\n\nI will say that our dog was clearly much calmer and happier at the end of her stay than she has been at other dog boarding facilities, but sadly the other issues will likely keep us from using this facility in the future.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a8008a431853:0x54e11952ed42bc8f"}

I met Jonathan, Vet Tech at Emergivet and was so impressed with his manner that when I found out he also works full time for Dr. Phillip Smith I made a follow up appointment for both cats to be seen.  They changed their topical flea Rx, gave them combination cocktail injections and within a week problems resolved and stayed resolved all summer.  Before we could get our 12 yr old standard dachshund in for a geriatric evaluation as planned, he had to be seen following a first time acute pancreatitis episode that came on when we were traveling. His treatment by Dr.Smith and staff was thorough, compassionate, and confidence inspiring to anxious owners with a very ill dog.  We are happy to have found him and everyone who works there to deliver the vet care we expected but had been unable to find.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a8008a431853:0x54e11952ed42bc8f"}

This woman does not get far enough recognition for her work in my opinion. Contacted Dr. Champion through email to do a farm call a week before Christmas. It was on suspected foundering. Answered each email with urgency, very late in that evening with concern for an animal she had never encountered. Detailed what to do and not do before she was able to come out for the farm call visit. Worked her in the day before Christmas Eve. Most vets would be on vacation, not taking on new clients during the holidays. Emailed me an estimation of what my visit would cost for her to drive from Abbeville to Dothan to do an exam, blood draw, blood test, xrays and her suspicions on causes my horse was having. De. Champions suspicions were correct on diagnosis also. This woman has saved my horse from going down a very dangerous, miserable rode she may have not been able to recover from. I can not thank this woman enough for her care, experience, knowledge and compassion with my first experience with Abbie Creek Animal Hospital. You have definitely gained a new customer and will be using Dr. Champion for all of June's care from now on.

When I took my animal inside, the stench of litter box odor filled the air.  There was a cat on the receptionist's counter, one on a bench in the waiting room, one behind the receptionist's desk, and I think another cat was present.  I was too shocked to really remember.  When we walked towards the exam room, the smell seemed to be stronger and I noticed things appeared to be dirty.  I declined service and stated we were leaving because it was too dirty and smelly.\n\nI had phoned around for prices on vaccinations, and this place was one of the cheapest.  We recently moved to the area and our small-town vet back home had a building that wasn\u2019t fancy or anything special to look at from the outside.  However, the outside was always clean and maintained, and the inside was spotless.  I hate to judge a book by its cover, but in this case the outside spoke for the inside.  I highly recommend taking your pet elsewhere.  When I left the Colbert Animal Clinic I phoned the Tennessee Valley Animal Clinic, which is located up the highway about a mile.  They offered to work my pet in and were only a few dollars higher.  It was money well spent to have my pet cared for in a clean and well maintained facility.\n\nThe staff at the Colbert Animal Clinic seemed friendly and nice, but I was only in there for a couple of minutes.  On the phone the receptionist mentioned they offered kennel services; but after seeing the office, I can only imagine the condition of the garage where they kennel pets.  Do yourself and your pet a favor, spend a few bucks more and drive up the highway to the Tennessee Valley Animal Clinic or another local vet.

The staff was nice and friendly, but the place could use some picking up. As far as first impressions go, many bad ones were made right off the bat.

Upon entering the facility, I also smelled the litter boxes and the smell was so strong that when I left I had to roll my car windows down to air out a bit. There were at least 5 cats on the counter, two of which kept getting in my way to fill out my paperwork and another swatted at me in an aggressive manner for no reason.\n\nThe place employs nice people, but they REALLY need to clean up a bit.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d4e567d57ee1f:0x5c629f86ef7c2d4"}

The entry way is very messy and the establishment itself was a bit of an eye sore. Arriving I was extremely surprised and almost confused. After entering it was quite a mess. The establishment reaked with the overwhelming smell of ammonia I assume from all of the cats that were running around. It was so bad that I couldn't breathe and my head began to hurt. I was counting the seconds until I could leave because of this... Behind the counter where you could see while filling out paper work was disgusting and unclean to say the least. There were also cracks between the floor and wall caked with dirt and debris as well. There is duct tape holding their scale wires to the wall and numerous random food items and personal items scattered though the shelves of the weight intake area. I was worried to leave my dog here because of the conditions, immediately after leaving I wanted to turn around and bring him home. Though the staff was nice and courteous I will be sure to take my business to a more clean and sterile environment from here on out.

Two weeks ago, our 12 year old Maltese suddenly could not walk on his hind legs. Due to it being a weekend, we could not reach our vet and our neighbor, who is also a vet, was out of town but we were able to speak to him and he warned us it was probably a slipped disc which would require prednisone and crate rest for several weeks. Several people recommended taking him to Med Vet, which we did so promptly and the acting vet, Dr. Rehm, did diagnose him with slipped disc and said he was a candidate for surgery. She wanted to keep him at the facility until Monday when the surgeon would be in and wanted to administer IV fluids, wanted him to have a colostomy bag, etc. We were just not comfortable with this seemingly very aggressive treatment (especially when our neighbor had told us he would probably just need meds and rest) before speaking to our dog's vet he has seen his whole life and who we trust and having him examine him personally. When I told Dr. Rehm we weren't comfortable with keeping him there overnight and especially with surgery, she told me that \"euthanasia would be a reasonable option.\" I immediately told my husband who was the one that took our dog to Med Vet and was waiting in the parking lot due to Covid restrictions  (I was home with our young children) to get him out of that place immediately. The nurse tried to persuade him to keep him there and quoted a price of $1500 for the 2 day stay until Monday when the surgeon could look at him (not for the surgery itself, mandatory MRI before surgery, etc - that would all be additional). When my husband asked her to just give him medicine and prepare him to be taken home that night, she asked \"what were we willing to pay?\" which did not sit well with us at all and made it seem like, to them, everything was about how much money they could make off of our dog. The cost was absolutely not a factor for us. We were simply not comfortable with the facility, the treatment, and especially the acting vet, who had been so callous. I am so glad we took him home with us that night. We followed up with our personal vet and after crate rest for 2 weeks (which we will continue for another few weeks), our sweet pup is walking normally. He never lost the ability to eat, drink, urinate, or defecate independently and honestly never acted like he was even in pain. I feel like Med Vet tried to take complete advantage of our situation and our beloved pet and we could have potentially spent thousands of dollars unnecessarily if we had not followed our intuition and taken him from this facility as quickly as possible. If you are looking for a compassionate vet, conservative treatment unless absolutely warranted, and professionals who care about your pet and your family, I would absolutely not recommend Med Vet in Mobile under any circumstance.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1609347625301, "text": "Hi, Amanda.

We called on the way to let them know the situation. He was barely hanging on. We didn\u2019t know if he got bit or what happened. They were super professional and let me know up front the Initial expense without knowing if he\u2019d make it or how long he\u2019d be there. They did their best.\nOur dog ended up having Addison\u2019s disease where they collapse in a crisis state. They went above and beyond to diagnose, treat and save little McDuff\u2019s life. I couldn\u2019t be happier with a job well done by all who touch my baby. I would like to say please be a little easier on these guys. They do the best they can. They have to ask up front about money because in a tragic situation many people just expect service. They come in frantically needing help. I would imagine they are like everyone else and can\u2019t run a business off of charity even though every one of them would if they could. They are really caring Doctors and staff, it really is an emergency situation facility.Big Shout out to B for being his buddy, cleaning him when he didn\u2019t have his dignity.

She began to exhibit labor symptoms and eventually her water broke. After several hours of watching her and taking her on short walks we were not seeing any puppies. She did not appear to be in distress but was obviously tired and acted as though her labor was stopping. Our vet referred us here and we arrived around midnight on Friday. The staff was very friendly and caring and presented us with options for X-ray/Ultrasounds to check status/health of unborn puppies and then go from there. The tests identified a problem with the pup in birth canal and suggested c-section to get pups out. We left her in their care to prep for surgery etc. The doctor and staff kept us posted over the next 4 very long hours and we received good news that Momma came through surgery fine with two healthy male pups. We were very sad that the pup in birth canal did not make it along with a smaller female. But considering the urgency of the situation and the quick and thorough response from the MedVet team, we focused on the very positive (Momma with two boys) and able to bring them home a couple hours later. They are all doing very well and Momma loves and cares for her two sweet boys. It certainly was not an inexpensive experience but no surprises as the team relayed estimated costs (low to high) along the way and we were right in the middle. And Google search confirmed the costs to be fair and reasonable when compared to other emergency vets (especially for a Fri midnight).

Our normal vet checked out our dog and had a feeling her issues were probably a cancerous spleen given the hard lumps location. We didn\u2019t want to wait for a closer surgeon to come back from vacation so we went to MedVet. Dr Bufkin was very knowledgeable about dog cancers and the options available. He knows his dog cancers and sat and talked with us quite a while. I felt much better about leaving her there after talking with him. After reviewing her info and checking her out on an quick ultrasound he agreed with our vet that our dog maybe had a few months if surgical procedures went well and we got chemo. But could be as short as a few weeks or possibly not even a successful surgery due to how large the spleen was and standard surgery risks. He was very helpful though and explained the risks and different types of cancers it could be. We decided to do surgery given our dog was obviously not comfortable (enlarged spleen), stopped eating, and we wanted to do anything to help her for the last few months. A burst spleen is a painful way to go and taking them to a vet after it bursts, well they probably wouldn\u2019t last the car ride. I said my goodbyes like it was maybe the last time I\u2019d see her and we left her there that day and he had free time later and did the surgery same day. It went well for the spleen but he discovered numerous other small internal tumors that couldn\u2019t be removed. He said after looking inside she maybe had a few weeks max. They were all over everything in her abdomen. We got her back a few days later and started trying to nurse her back to health. We planned to start chemo in about two weeks. Unfortunately she just couldn\u2019t recover. She was weak prior to surgery and hadn\u2019t been eating right for a while so she just didn\u2019t have the strength to heal. Her belly started filling out the loose skin she had from the large spleen removal which was concerning. So we took her to our vet. She apparently started to have internal bleeding and fluid build up in her abdomen. They used a syringe to do a puncture and confirmed it. Our normal vet had some options but estimated it may just give her another week. We didn\u2019t want to put her through any more pills or vet stays (she always hated vet visits) or further surgery\u2019s. There was just too much cancer going on to ever successfully get rid of it. So we ended up putting her down at that appointment before things could get any worse. It was peaceful and she wasn\u2019t going to suffer any more.\n\nThat\u2019s the story. But since this is a review I do want to say MedVet was very helpful and upfront about everything. The risks were well explained and cost estimates were pretty much spot on with what they said and what we expected from any other place. Emergency dog care or surgery is going to be expensive. Not like some normal vet visit. People shouldn\u2019t be surprised about that. And yeah it\u2019s a business, so expect them to talk about payments. The price was a llittle bit higher than the bottom estimate because our dog stayed an extra day there and we had samples sent off to a lab, but it was still lower than the high side. It\u2019s hard to be thankful to anyone when you lose a pet. And spending thousands on your dog only to have to put her down a week later is rough. I wish we didn\u2019t do the surgery and put her through it but we didn\u2019t know how bad things were. But I\u2019m glad we had MedVet as an option and at least made an attempt to save her. I had no problems with the way they handled everything and I don\u2019t blame them. We knew from multiple vets that things were bad and surgery was risky. But Dr Bufkin seems to be very good at what he does. I have a 24/7 vet significantly closer to me (5 min vs 45 min to MedVet). But the surgeon there was on vacation and no one else could see our dog. So again, I\u2019m just glad MedVet was available and was able to get her surgery done so quick. I hope to never have to go again of course. But specifically MedVet itself, I had no issues with.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4dc480c2bab3:0x2734880a94e125f3"}

Our fees are based on our own costs to provide what we feel is exceptional care. Making sure your pet has the best and most current diagnostics, surgical equipment, and experienced staff ultimately pays off in the long run, because it results in fewer tests and procedures as well as healthier animals. Our policy regarding checks is one we arrived at after long experience and is not intended to be punitive or insulting, but one we had to adopt as a business because checks are no longer a reliable form of payment. We do pass along a small processing fee for credit and debit card use to avoid raising the cost of our veterinary services to cover them. As always, the health and well-being of your pets is our priority, and we hope to have the opportunity to provide care for them in the future. We would also welcome the opportunity to discuss your concerns personally and invite you to contact us at the hospital at (205) 486-4500 if you wish to do so."}, "gmap_id": "0x8887e696888377d7:0x4e0b0434c7e4624e"}

I dropped them down to two stars, and I would like to only give them one star but I'm upset right now so I won't do that.   We gave one dog away a couple years ago and mentioned it when we took the others in, and the new owner mentioned it too (a relative) and they still put it on our account.  That's ok, it's a mistake and everybody makes them, easy to fix.  I've been there twice I believe since then and both times I was told about the money owed for the dog I no longer have nor brought there for that service, and I told them that it's not my bill and made sure they had the contact info for the owner who brought him.  Again, that's not a problem . What is the problem though is when they won't neuter my two male cats for payment at the time of service until someone pays this bill, which they have been told over and over again, is not ours.  So yeah, give me my stars back.\n\nThey do good work and I do trust them and he will work with me on prices for multiple pets but it does me absolutely no good when I can't bring my pets in because someone else hasn't paid a bill that the vet's office has been told time and again is not mine .\n\nIt's not like I haven't told them and she hasn't . She has even told them and told them it's her bill.\n\nAnybody want one of the kittens we will likely have in a few months since we can't get the males fixed right now?", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888f316f0ce84823:0xe085f06cfda014fc"}

They were supposed to call me after her procedure they didn't call so I called them to check on her they said she did well. On Friday when I called to tell them I was on my way to pick her up that's when the young lady told me that she had a couple raw spots on her face from rubbing her face on the cage needless to say when I got there and saw her I was very upset it looked very bad I asked if I needed to put medicine on it the vet told me no that they had put cream on it that it would be fine. She also had a bump the size of my knuckle in between her eyes. Well 3 days later it got progressively worse so I contacted them and I asked them what should I do she said bring her in for a checkup. I asked if there was a charge she said yes 50.00 I said I didn't feel that I should be charged since this happened to my baby on their watch so she said let me ask the vet she came back said no charge I then told her i didn't appreciate the way my kitten was treated that I was going to take her else where.  Her response was oh ok. Today I took Gracie to another vet and they said it's a bacterial infection and gave her antibiotics for a week then want to see her again in a week.

My wife and I had our 2 dogs boarded with Madison Animal Care Hospital over Memorial Day weekend. One thing that bothered me is that even though we were back in town on Monday they were closed so we couldn't pick them up. They still charged us for the day they were closed, but refused to let us pick them up. First red flag. When I picked them up Tuesday I noticed they had a green/yellow discharge coming from their eyes. I took them back to Madison Animal Care Hospital to get them looked at. Turns out they both had eye infections. Best part is they charged me full price for the examinations, tests, and medicine. No discount at all even though the most likely cause was from something they got into while being boarded by the same facility.

I've never had an issue with them, yet I don't know if the owners change or if it's just the staff.\n\nI took my dog in to get an annual procedure. With the Covid19, everything is curbside now. The person came to the door and asked is this all we're doing or did I want to do blood work as well. I asked how much the blood work was and how much the full total was going to be. She estimated around $250. So I signed off and all was good. I had the vet come out and talk to me about my dogs health and it was all good. She told me someone would call me shortly so I could pay the bill over the phone. When they called, they said I owned $480.80. I asked her what happened to the $250 I was quoted? I completely understand an estimate is just that, an estimate. Yet when you're jumping over 100% over it's ridiculous. She told me someone would call me the next day to discuss.\n\nI get a call from Christy who then tries to inform me that I was quoted $250 for the blood work only. She was very condescending and tried to pin this on me. Lucky for me, I keep a dash cam for insurance reasons and was able to send her the video of the whole conversation.\n\nAfter they reviewed she calls me back and the first thing she says is \"You win, we lose. $250 is the total.\" She proceeded to speak in a very condescending manner to me. This wasn't about winning or losing. She then tried to tell me that me recording on public property was illegal with a bit more rude attitude. I wonder how'd she feel to know I also record all my phone calls as well.\n\nI say all this to state that I wouldn't go back her.

Dr. Grider has gone above and beyond with a very sick dog and other animals as well. The staff is always friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. I have always been very aware of my options with regard to treatments and costs. I have no idea why anyone has negative remarks or comments regarding this clinic.

She was not friendly or sympathetic.  Did not say thank you or you're welcome.\n\nAfter declining all these unnecessary tests, I was handed prescription pills and a cream to squirt into the mouth.  The doctor left the room.  I asked the nurse how to administer the cream, she had no clue.  I had to read the instructions on the package.\n\nWithout even handing a bill, the receptionist said today's visit is $170. I asked for a bill to see the charges.  I was charged $110 just for the medication.  I came home and googled the prices, amazon has all the meds for $40 total.
