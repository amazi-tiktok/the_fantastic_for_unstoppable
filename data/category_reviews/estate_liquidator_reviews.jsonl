We put it in layaway as our 10th anniversary was in December(this happened in June). I forgot to snap a picture of it while we were there so I called Stephanie and she happily got it out of the safe and put it on her own finger and sent me pictures via text message. She went above and beyond! We were shopping with our kids and they offered them chocolates and water. We called to have my diamond placed in the new ring on Wednesday of this week and they placed it on the same day we called and overnighted the ring to me for free. I live 6 hours from Gulf Shores. It was at my door the next morning. It is so beautiful! I am so thankful we went there to see about getting my original ring repaired and ended up with a gorgeous new ring that has special meaning since it was purchased at one of my favorite vacation spots.
