Shoe dept is way to cramped. Too many shoes packed in too small area to even look at shoes. Purse selection is limited & pricey to me. I can get similar purse at another large store & even name brand cheaper. Also the 1 thing I went for which I love CATOs for carrying is matching bra & panty sets. They were slim pickings plus had larger quality of panties with no match bra... theirs always have a match unless sold out. Now the pros: 2 female employees that spoke & asked if I needed assistance & when I didn't they kindly went to do something else. This I like. I know I can get them if I need to. I like the Spread of sizes from 2 to 20w or higher maybe. Also carry their bra sets in all these sizes. Same with accessories in S-2x belts W shoes... However since they took out the girls clothing I can no longer no longer buy pants from them. Use to get L-XL in girls and fit perfect. They've started carrying \"some\" petites but not many especially in Jean's & casual pants. 2p are extremely hard to find in there. Since Fall 2017 whoever was the buyer ... Missed it! The clothing this period is cheap fabric, style is almost All big, unfitted tops that a small could fit someone who wears a large. The fabrics are old lady designs & styles. Big flowers, wide wide leg pants, double knit jackets & the prices are high. You use to could come in CATOs & leave with a complete head to toe outfit that was adorable & affordable. Even their mark down  clearance is too high. This store is neat, clean, well organized & good displays. I didn't see clothes on floor or placed in wrong place. They are in a great location... CATOs just needs to get a buyer who knows what folks the age store is adapted for like & would wear. There's many items even on clearance that I would not want it was free. Reminds me of clothes I once made in Homeconomics in jr high. But I do love to shop CATOs anywhere I see 1 I stop in... thanks for carrying the bra sets that are pretty much affordable. Wished you'd bring back the lingerie, cute/sexy , sweet short gowns, teddies, corsets, stockings...\nOh & I think that they still have LayAWay", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNo23WjhCWClvGmVHfPitxtT31yUB5NoCPjbW-4=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8PUg05engPB_nhSu4cGf1EvzGSnnlPY64zUhL=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMd-tvK1mjt1NJa5UpIWTe3dYTJtR7NETiWivj=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmD7wklIJoKab3PYqw-OWwvvJegWKFi-eejKyD=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIm0TZeNEUW70B3SXoqRfJDaObZ8K3Jh_gcK-6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e8561cf1ac2b5:0x190337c70e7b144c"}

I\u2019ve done this time and time before we always eat at the local restaurant connected to the strip mall. I was quickly told NO sorry we can\u2019t hold anything. I was a little shocked and explained she was two doors down and I wanted to make sure they were a good fit due to them being final sale. The two looked at each other and said sorry because you can go online 24 hours and order we aren\u2019t allowed to hold anything. Now if I\u2019d previously not held something before maybe I\u2019d believe them. One proceeded to say I\u2019ll put it in the fitting room and we can just say she\u2019s waiting on the fitting room!! Which means YOUR HOLDING IT. I smiled and told them that was ok and walked out needless to say I will only order from online or if I see the manager ( can\u2019t remeber her name but she\u2019s awesome) I\u2019ll only shop then. These two youngsters possible need a lesson on customer service!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cb171d4f769:0xad3f59ee2c264cd2"}

Every item I\u2019ve bought is hand wash only and even with hand washing they only last a couple wears for me. I\u2019ve left previous comments that I wish they would specify if something is hand wash only and they said they can\u2019t because they don\u2019t always know. They can do fit videos but can\u2019t tell you if it is hw only. The prices are higher than most retailers I shop at so \u201cdiscount\u201d is misleading. Overall the clothes are not worth the price", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626c90bc99284b:0x168fe5abcd816b33"}

But if I\u2019m about to buy something & I\u2019m trying it on why is the staff asking how long I got in the dressing room she knocked on door more than once , like was there a time limit or something? she kept asking me other people need to try on stuff I\u2019m thinking like it\u2019s about 4 other rooms & then they told me once I go in I can\u2019t go in but once.  With that being said I made sure that I took in all what I could & wanted to purchase. Like don\u2019t rush I\u2019m trying multiple pieces, come out it\u2019s like one person with two other people sitting including a man, which he is not trying on stuff waiting. Manager kept making small comments to staff hardly spoke when I came in....I wanted to give them a piece of my mind but wasn\u2019t worth my time,  hence store was only open about 45 mins when I arrived so I don\u2019t want to hear anything about a long day. Would have never went into store but shop online but I needed something I didn\u2019t want to wait To ship only to arrive with limited selection.

My daughter tried on several gowns and the salesgirl held the train on each dress as I took a photo of my daughter in it - never one time did she ever ask us not to take photos of the gowns. After my daughter had tried on about 4-5 dresses, one of the other salesgirls commented \"we don't really like for y'all to take photos of the tags\", to which I said I was sorry and we stopped taking photos of the tags on the gowns. I was unsure why, but I assume it is because their gowns are marked up well over retail. After my daughter tried on 1-2 more gowns, an older lady walked over to us and very rudely yelled at my daughter if she was taking pictures she would have to delete all of them before leaving the store. She also said \"I know two of my girls have already told you to stop taking pictures\". This is untrue, as the only person who had previously said anything was the salesgirl (not ours) that said not to take photos of the tags. I could see my daughter was very visibly upset, so we said thank you and left the store. They lost my business forever, as well as everyone I know that I can tell about our experience.

Very snippy, she said \"our bathroom is not open to the public try The Children's Place\".  I said thank you and she begin to talk very sternly to another customer about a coupon that she could NOT accept.  So I left to head to the Children's place, and returned to hear this lady now talking to another customer about the mis-placement of a blouse/shirt.  I was eavesdropping, but I didn't have to try hard because the cashier has a loud, stern, firm voice and it echoed thru the building.  She pretty much was telling the patron that she would not give her a shirt for a price just because it was located in an area that had a sign for a less expensive cost. The message she conveyed may have been true, but again, her TONE and ATTITUDE were horrible.  The customer left quielty.  But that was not the end of the convo for your cashier.  Two other cashiers were talking in whispered voices with the young lady and they seemed to be trying to calm her down.  In her overly loud voice the cashier (again I think her name is Shelby but I do not recall), this young lady repeatedly yelled \"she doesnt know who I AM!  I could be the regional manager!  I could have really shown her who I was, but I'm trying to be professional.  She and her mother...and she is this, and she is that....\"  I was shopping in your store and there were at least 4 other customers inside the store at the time.  So her tone definitely disturbed our shopping experience. I just needed this to be known because it appears that this young lady thinks that her behavior is appropriate.   I was happy to see her go because I did not want her to check me out at the cash register. I hope the lady she was rude to reports her as well. It was inappropriate and lacked professionalism.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890dc81b7d769f:0x1410983c41984a82"}

The girls got me right back. Shelby was my stylist & she was awesome. I told her exactly what I wanted; which was a dress with sleeves.  I showed her pictures from online & she found all the dresses. I'm a plus size bride so I was scared; I wouldn't have a lot of selections. I was very wrong; they had dresses in stock for any size bride. Shelby found me three great dresses. There was a dress online that had short sleeves. Shelby let me try on the same dress in strapless & told me she could order it for me with sleeves. Shelby explained payment arrangements & credit options to pay for the dress. Shelby broke everything down in detail for me. Which was very helpful for a new bride with a budget. I was very close to ordering that dress. But, I really wanted to try it on with the sleeves. I was so impressed with David's Bridal in Tuscaloosa; I made an appointment the same day at the David's Bridal in Hoover. I was thinking Hoover would have more dresses with sleeves & possibly have that dress with sleeves to try on. That was the worst idea ever. The store in Hoover is a huge disappointment for David's Bridal. The customer service needs to be reviewed at the Hoover store. The employees at that store are very unprofessional. After the bad experience at the Hoover store; I started reading reviews & asking friends. Apparently that is common for the David's Bridal in Hoover. If I decide to order through David's Bridal, it will definitely be with the Tuscaloosa David's Bridal. Great job David's Bridal in Tuscaloosa.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a8363211ca3b:0xc839cac2cd80b238"}

Had a hard time finding ammo before I arrived, but they happened to have a couple boxes of ammo i could use.\n\nThe staff is friendly, courteous, and very informative. They take the time to explain what it takes to fire at the range with ease, and have a cushy waiting area to view a quick training video. The whole process was smooth and easy.\n\nThe range safety officers are well on their game. I felt safe the entire time on the range, and they were able to quickly explain the touch screen track interface, and further explaining that safety is a top priority.\n\nI signed on for 30 minutes, and decided to fire my .40 before testing the shotgun. The touch screen interface has me sold on coming back to bullet and barrel. With just a click, the target goes the exact distance. Takes all the guesswork out of the experience.\n\nI fired my pistol, and was pleased with the range itself. The design is new and clean. And with the RSOs keeping an eye on everything, it's a great environment to enjoy your firearms.\n\nI tried the 88, and it performed beautifully. I added some extra cushion due to a shoulder injury. For those that would ask, you can't shoot bird shot here. But you can fire buck shot and slugs. But I'll tell you, it's fun firing a shotgun at this range.\n\nAfterward I wandered around and struck up conversations with some of the staff, and showed me a selection for sale. I was impressed with the inventory, as well as pricing. I see myself buying my next firearm from here.\n\nFor me, it's a bit of a drive from Madison. But good business is where you find it, and Bullet and Barrel is my newest one stop shop for all things firearms. Plus, open on Sunday!\n\nDont take my word for it, stop in and check them out today!

Rude, rude, rude!!!!!!\n\nUpdate:\nBusiness owner reached out to my daughter to apologize about incident. I appreciate her stating she was wrong. She assured my daughter that she would be crediting her for the price of the lip gloss.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e81ba69db8e27:0xef5fa3ade29ba37e"}

It\u2019s not too prophetic on my part to now state what the obvious will be. Once the store manager comes upon this review, mark my words, ( As an agent of the company and for the companies behalf, and by proxy for their own self preservation) she will surely state how she did tell me that their was a position open but it wasn\u2019t very many hours, and that I am welcome to file an application because it is an all inclusive company that does not discriminate.

She had shopped everywhere and had come up short and was discouraged. I met her at The Clothes Tree and what a fantastic experience it was! Mandy was so helpful and encouraging. She alone is reason to shop here! She could not have been more patient or helpful and gave us her undivided attention. My sister-in-law tried on about 40 dresses. The selection at this store is amazing and vast. A couple of the dresses she tried on were from the clearance rack that were marked down 80%. She tried on dresses up to almost $1000. Mandy and the other girl who was helping other customers both agreed that one of the dresses from the clearance rack was best suited for her. It was true and we were both so impressed that they weren't just interested in making the most money they could but were honest about which dress looked the best on her. It was the best dress shopping experience either of us had ever experienced. I highly recommend this shop to anyone in need of a formal dress and I plan to go there when my daughter gets engaged to find my own MOB dress.

Uptown is bar none, the best place in Dothan, or the tri-county area, to buy men's clothing.

After going to Plato's several times in a 90 day time period and never finding anything of merit, a co-worker took me to Uptown Cheapskate one day before work. That's when it all made sense. The reason Plato's Closet was completely barren was because everybody went to Uptown, and I'm all for it because their price is easily half of what Plato's would charge and their selection is vastly superior.\n\nI would also like to point out that the owner of Uptown has never been anything but extremely accommodating, courteous, and immensely helpful. If you don't like the value she gives you're clothing or accessories the solution is quite simple, shop elsewhere!

I literally did not see one piece of paper or similar debris on the floor. Shelves were nicely organized with price tags, clearance racks and store personel easy to find. Everyone (employees and customers alike) was wearing their masks and following social distancing guidelines which made the whole experience even more pleasant since I was shopping with several friends including my one year old great niece and a lifelong friend who has an extremely compromised  immune system from struggles with Crohn's disease. Scored a ton of bargains on name brands and designer's fashions. Seriously, I got my great niece a pair of sneakers and a pair of adorable boots for only $2 each. By the way, they were made by none other than the legendary JUICY COUTURE. I would have had to shell out another $45-$65 if I had purchased these designer's labels from elsewhere.  I felt practically criminal after swiping a game carrying case plus a glass screen protector (two separate items) for my son's NINTENDO SWITCH. I paid $5 for both which saved me about $15 and earned me HUGE POINTS with my son. How about this bit of awesomeness: $3 for Beyonce Pulse perfume, 3.4 ounce bottle, normally $15 or more. I also grabbed 2 hoodies for $1 each. And whatever you do, do NOT get me started on the huge savings and discounts I racked up on for the rest of the clothing that I bought as an early birthday present to myself.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPh-JwVbttSU_UDY3q8YvBckEzoQNgc5guW7kR=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7oeZ_RbCBJaA1-YmwHkdg9HjN2AU-y4UQKJXK=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbTBLhspSL_-iJPSZO2eXwx2CEdats_V7wW_GG=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d4f323c4b171f:0x8a6f965bf1492cdb"}

I suggested that they check the time on the receipt since I couldn't have worn them, but they just pointed to a very small sign near the checkout that said masks were not returnable.

He didn't offer to order it in or to order it on-line. I was willing to do either.\nThe boat and ATV guy lost a sale  since they could not break free from their conversation to help me. I hate pushy sales people but at least acknowledge me after you see me taking pictures and returning to the same area 3 times.\nI never saw anyone in the clothing departments so I didn't get the items that I wanted  to stock up on.\nI return to Bass Pro because of the quality of the products and it is normally easy to get help. I did not find that at this store.\nIt was a surprise to find the outside water features seemed neglected too.  I  didn't see any fish and the fountains and falls that are normally seen were not there either.\nLuckily I can find another store close by to get what I'm looking for.\nI spent FAR less than I normally do at THIS Bass Pro store and I still need to do my spring shopping.\nI will not return to this store if I can another one close by.\n\nPlease understand that this store is not exactly bad, it just doesn't have the warm welcoming flow and energy that I have grown fond to.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a430e72ad1fc5:0xde568058c6022035"}

It took 3 strangers and myself to find the working dispenser and get paper towels out of it, it was a team effort.\nThere were far less people in the store than previous years, so I'm not sure what their excuse would be. Most of the children's attractions were broken or half working as well. The kids were practically bored to tears. We only stayed for pictures with Santa. Our wait was 2 hours. And by all means it should have been half that time. There really weren't many people in the store. Crafts that were supposed to start at noon didn't begin till around 12:30 and the craft person was stale and thoroughly uninterested in their job. Before when we had come there was quite a bit of interaction and Mrs. Clause even came over to help.\nIt was a total waste of time coming out here. Their restaurant isn't even open anymore.

They were marked down from $44.99. I went and did about 15 more minutes of shopping and went to check out (at 0925 AM). At check out the item showed up as $44.99 and I said I would take it over to refund for them to research the price further. The associate at the refund desk stated the price was never $17.99 and there was no sign there showing it was ever that price. My wife walked back there and could you imaging the signs mysteriously vanished from the time I picked up the item at the rack to the time I went to check out. I was made to look like a liar and a cheat by the refund associate and Bass Pro. The only thing they had to say was they had mistakenly left the sales signs up from the weekend and I would have been okay with that. Instead I had to listen to the other refund associate say I was in the right and the signs were removed late but she could not make the other associate listen to her. Funny how they want to thank you for your military service one minute and then make you out to be a liar in front of other customers the next. I will no longer be shopping at the Bass Pro Spanish Fort location and I would suggest that all customers take photos of sales prices on the racks for they are to be susceptible removed at a moments notice to prove the customer is wrong and vendor is in the right.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a430e72ad1fc5:0xde568058c6022035"}

It had been a while since I was last in there.  I have never had an issue before but this time I was there to spend some money.  I went up to look at a  rifle scope that I had been looking at online.  I went upstairs and took the long way to get there.  We were greeted properly walking in so didn't see any reason to think anything else.  We walked through the bows, then walked past the rifle racks to the scopes.  The guys working the counter were working with other customers so I looked around, I found the one I wanted to see.  In that process, I found another that I was interested in I looked up to see the status of the salespeople and they were over on the other side talking to each other and what looked to be looking at a phone behind the counter.  I left the counter went to check on kids who were by the aquarium.  We walked around and I decided I was going to get both of the scopes I found.  I went back and both salespeople were talking to one person.  So while I was waiting, I found a third scope I wanted.  The lady they were talking to left and they went back to the other end of the counter and did what they were doing before.  Now I don't like when a salesperson hovers over me, but I have worked in retail enough to at least let a customer know I am there to help.  I couldn't even get that out of them, so we walked away.  They missed a out a $4K sale.  I am not going to beg for them to help me.  They weren't busy.  The way I see it is they were just busy ignoring me.  Walking to the exit, I found a gear bag for a decent price and decided to buy it.  The man at the cash register was awesome.  If the guys at the gun counter were, Bass Pro would have sold me a lot more than a $12.99 bag.  I will go back again.

He went into the tracker boat section, spoke with two elderly gentlemen, he doesnt rememeber his name but the gentleman that let him back in the building after looking at the boats outside didnt say anything to him, just opened the door and walked away. So he approached another gentleman sitting at the desk, asked about one of the boats they had outside and about financing, the gentleman\u2019s response was if you dont have a 700 or better they wont finance you and they wont finance anything under $5000.00. Assuming because of how my husband looked that his score was under a 700. So my husband went inside and started looking at kayaks, he was up there for close to an hour and was not approached one time by a sales associate to see if he needed help, at that point he left the store. So not only did you lose a possible sale on a boat you also lost out on the sale of a kayak.

The paper work that you signed at the beginning of your service, explains that if you are unsatisfied with your hair, your stylist will be more than happy to come up with an arrangement to get your hair where you would like it to be. We truly wish you would have come to us first so we could evaluate your hair and make it right for you without the additional costs of another salon. We have offered for you to come in and have us take a look at your hair to evaluate the situation, and we are sorry that you did not want to come in to work this out. Unfortunately, due to the time your stylist spent with you, product used, and not having the opportunity to evaluate your hair in person, we are unable to refund you for this service. Upon reviewing your paper work, your stylist noted that your hair would need more than one service to achieve the end results that you were wanting. This is due to the fact that your hair was already previously lightened at home before your visit to us. We are always striving for what's best for our clients. In this circumstance, your hair wouldn't be able to handle any further lightening in one visit. It is our understanding that in order to protect the integrity of your hair, you and your stylist decided to go with a darker blonde until your next service.

I had been having problems with finding someone to work on my bike.  I have a \u201995 Honda VT1100c Shadow.  No one wanted to work on it because of it\u2019s age & my regular mechanic had closed up shop.  When I spoke to, Ronnie I explained what I wanted him to do.  I asked him how long would it take to complete the job.  He told him that it would be two weeks.  I agreed to that.  He came out to my house in late July to pick up my bike & take it to his shop.\nI waited the two weeks & gave him al call.  He said that he was still working on another bike & he was waiting for parts to come in.  I said, that was fine, I can wait for a few more weeks.  Two more weeks came about & he still hasn\u2019t gotten to it.  So, I just gave up & bought another bike in September.  I finally got a call from him on October 10th & 12:38 pm.  He said that he got it done.  I called him back & asked him how much it was, he said the total was $865.44.   I told him I would have to pick it up in a month. He agreed.  When I got there on November the 23rd to pick it up, he had flattened the rear tire.  He said  he broke the valve stem.  He told me he was going to charge me $75.00 to replace the stem that he broke.  I then asked him if we could start it, he said again, no.  The bike did have to be bottle fed.  So, I took it home.  When I got home I bottle fed it, it wouldn\u2019t start.  I called him & he said that it ran when he had it.  So, I asked him if he could look at it & see if he could figure out what was wrong.  He said that it would be two weeks & he would get $80.00 an hour to fix it.  Keep in mind, I just gave him the previous day, $865.00 in cash.  So, I took the carbs back off.  The only thing he changed was the diaphragms. The main jets, slow jets all were corroded & stopped up. He had the float heights all off.  He even used rubber hose for fuel line.  I called him back to ask for half a refund on it. I called him out on what he did.  When I told him that the jets were filthy & the carb bodies were filthy he stuttered & then told me that I am not getting sh*t back and hung up.  I wouldn\u2019t let this man work on anything.  The review on here before mine had a bad experience & they were there when I picked up my bike.  If I could give it negative starts if I could. These pictures below show what I got for my money. You can see that the bottom of the carbs are green & the jets are old & stopped up.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOikOY_9uySYZgFYs1yCu1pjr8BZtBxgR0_EOs=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhLhKb5HMQDNeqRvZbtmc8KlHnW95v1eurcwvz=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFfYMTVub6Q4n1Pl1qjaSVW3wzgg-2EQdl5Gce=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOohWrBi_KZuuZs2rloW7fiD3qhVAPjuRE0JFjC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLu6wYyOwVVADFo8rLp4GUUTVDDZj5Ase2sJ2S=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNB8ELRalR_eFBXcm4HlSFtTC2gO2l35PHpvTYa=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOU5e-7LjQrUBNqmroCXFgKbwERuAmEQZdOySBK=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgVwuVEVgOaOQnwAqi7YlwXUGSHFWBUeoRahs-=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnMu7Z4WXFhh-wL7F6MitbO42L2Uzj1C27niZD=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2NUFL7xZB2E2_ba96Ko7Bd0NJFJ8rZ-zubAh6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzMI0yG2lwNxnXx4ddN8XuxyydEnCmQ480LnZK=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPt40-BH5IeCZHmqv2sKSd2wkMdHtAiFDnYzG02=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889bfdd2f410caf:0xf666e3cabfd567f4"}

Big Mistake.  He charged us $3500 plus to fix it.  He was clearly aware that it had set up.  The first time we went to get it, It would not start and the lights wouldn't work.  He ask how long has this gas been in here. My husband said 7 years remember you were supposed to drain the tank for me.  He even wrote it sat up for 7 years on the receipt.  He painted the front  fender with paint that didn't match.  He put a used rear tire on it and called it a new one.  It had dirt and clay mud on it and the bike wouldn't start so where would the mud come from on a new tire? .  We left it with him for obvious reasons.  My husband ask him to replace the bushing in the handle bars since we were leaving it anyway.We paid him in the beginning to change the light covers.  He charged us twice the original one he ordered we found in the saddle bags.    My husband starts home on it today.  The brake light would not go off and the mirror was just spinning. You would think he would have saw that when replacing the bushing in the handlebars. My husband gets to Arab while driving the brand new war bonnet on the fender fell off.  Oil is leaking from a bike that he supposedly changed the oil and fixed the clutch on it.  We paid this man 3700 plus and he didn't take enough pride in his work to even wipe the dust off the bike.  I was using his shop rag to do that while we were waiting to get it running last week.  He literally took it out of my hand.  When I first met him i told my husband he seems like a good Christian person.  Boy was I wrong he might be a Christian.  I have no Idea but good is far from the truth.  We are very upset with the way we were ripped off.\nWe took our bike to another shop because it was obvious that Ronnie did not change the tires, the battery, fix the carburetor or anything we ask him and paid him to do. They could not believe that anyone would say the changed tires when they were literally rotten around the rim because it had set up for 7 years. He really screwed us out of 3700.00 He is a dishonest man. The Battery was 7 years old yet he said it was new.

No big deal, you run that risk when you order online. I called to see if I could get a refund for the dress since they didn't have it in the next size up, and after being on hold for about 20 minutes I was told that I needed to email their customer service. After explaining that I probably would not be ordering from their site again, and I wanted a refund instead of a store credit. They issued a code. About a week after I sent the dress back, I received an email today saying that my return had been processed and attached was my gift card code. So I went ahead and tried to call their customer service team to try to get the refund they told me I'd get. I waited on hold for another 15 minutes before I gave up and called their store in Auburn. I asked if the associate at the store could try to transfer me over to customer service, because I wasn't getting through. She tried three separate times, and eventually came on the line suggesting that CS had left early from the office. I called at 4:07 and they were supposed to be there until 4:30. Ultimately, the customer service team has been a nightmare to deal with, and since I had to pay for shipping both ways, I've lost money from ordering with them. Needless to say, I won't be shopping with them again. I ordered a new graduation dress from Red Dress Boutique and they were delightful to deal with.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1527014414799, "text": "Hi Danika!
