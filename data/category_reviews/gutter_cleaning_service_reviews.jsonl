They keep their appointment time and date, they did not forget that we were penciled in or have an excuse as to why they could not be on time; or worse just fail to show up at all with no return calls as to why they were MIA like many other contractors in the area. 3.) His sincere joy and gratitude to retain our business was immediately obvious and refreshing. He never put off an air that he was too busy or heavily sought after that our job was less valuable than other customers. 4.) His team worked well together and no one left trash (product debris/cans/cigarettes/etc) in our yard. They were all respectful to one another and of the property. 5.) The product itself is beyond expectations! Perfectly matched color for this home, impressively clean lines and actually an attractive addition to the home (which who says that about gutters ever). 6.) The crew were in an out within three to four hours, and without compromising the quality of their service. 7.) The value for what we paid is unbelievable! For a custom job like this, on a house this size, we still cannot believe what a great deal we received........ Everything that we read in reviews before retaining Ryan and his company, was spot on. We are so thankful that he is a part of this local area and that we did not attempt to buy box store gutters and install them our self.

There were some things about the installation process that I had to question  which was them wanting to install it in the pouring rain. I insisted they wait until it was dry to seal the gutters. The technicians installing the gutters were fast but not as detailed as I was hoping and as I was told during the sales presentation. They did not clear the downspouts prior to installation and I found out  the hard way  after the first good rain. I did not see them check  the drop of the gutters as well but that wasn't really a big problem in my case.\nMy areas of disappointment with this system is that the flashing that was  installed at the base of the valleys does not allow any debris from leaves, small twigs etc to drop off the gutters so it thus causes build up. When it rains, the water routes around the flashing and debris and runs directly over the gutters instead of into the gutter and on to the down spouts. When the technician came out he stated that there is no way to prevent the build up at those locations and that someone would have to get on the roof to clear the debris from time to time to prevent it from happening. This is in direct contradiction to the advertisement shown on TV that states that, \"once installed you wont have to get on the roof again.\" I feel  that is very deceptive, dishonest advertising. Granted you wont have to clean out the actual gutters but you will have to get on the roof, nonetheless, to clear the debris from behind the flashing in the valleys. I was hoping that I wouldn't ever have to get back on the roof again. I can manage it now but in 10 years I'll be 70 years old and probably not be able to so will have to hire someone. Otherwise, the rain is handled well  by the rest of the gutter system and they don't get clogged up.  I'm now waiting for hurricane season to give them the real test.

It took only 2 days for removal and installation of my new roof which is amazing because mine is very high pitch. Each day they cleaned up their debris (shingles, nails, etc..) and when the dumpster they used leaked hydraulic fluid onto my driveway, they pressure washed the spot. His crew even replaced a board on the side of my home that had a rotten spot. I cant tell you how pleased I am with the aesthetics of my new roof, not to mention how structurally sound it is. 2nd to None had the highest warranty (7 years) of all the companies I was considering which was also a deciding factor for me . Most only have a 5 years warranty and one had only 2 years. When a company can stand behind their workmanship, they deserve my business. Bryan also worked closely with me to make sure I had the right type of shingle (color, functionality). He also imparted valuable advice regarding which shingle manufactures are honoring their warranties. Also..it needs to be mentioned that before they installed the new roof, I had a portion of my old roof tarped but the wind blew it off. Of course heavy rains came and water was leaking in several spots on my roof and into my master bathroom/closet. It was raining and lightening when his crew got on my roof to retarp/stop the leakage. That was also a deciding point for me that I would be using his company for my new roof. I can tell you most companies would not have done that. Also Bryan worked diligently with my Allstate adjuster explaining the cost of the roof which they had initially underestimated.

Please stay far away if you want an honest assessment and accountability. I will explain the events and you can judge for yourself.  The experience started off quite well, Christian was quick to come out for a consult, where he made the assessment that flying squirrels were the cause of our attic sound.  He then proceeded to hand my husband a contract for $2400 without explaining charges.  My husband questioned the cost and he quickly removed the multi year warranty which lowered the price to $1400. He was then told it would be a week before any exclusion work would be done.  He agreed and waited. The company placed barriers on roof and a one way door to allow squirrels to leave on their own (work happened on a Tuesday).  So we waited some more.  The next Monday.  A week later we were still continuing to hear the SAME noise.  I called the company (twice) before someone named Greg came out to do a check.  He only checked the roof and not the interior of the attic where the sound was, said everything looked good and was working correctly.  We voiced our concerns and he said sometimes they take 3 weeks to leave but that there is a possibility that since the excrement looks similar it could be mice instead but if that was the case it would require a different company. He said they could set traps but would just wait until the follow up the following week. Mind you the amount you pay up front is not refundable AT ALL. so that Monday night once again we hear the noise (2 weeks into the process now and the sound is right above the master bedroom so two weeks with no sleep).  The next day I go to Home Depot and get traps myself.  Place the traps after work (about 7pm) and by 10 pm the have a heart had caught something! But to our surprise.  It was not a squirrel but a mouse.  We release it the next day and reset the trap as well as two old school back cracker style traps, the next morning we\u2019ve caught another.  Still no squirrels.  I call the company obviously irritated (once again takes two calls to get a call back). Greg calls back and is super defensive won\u2019t admit there is a chance that they did not assess the full situation correctly (house was built in the 70\u2019s so sure maybe there was a chance there was old poop up there from something else).  Once again extremely defensive, belittling, opposite of good customer service.  Says he is the boss there is no one above him to discuss my concerns with.  They are currently still supposed to come do a recheck and spray some sort of an enzyme mix to stop squirrels from coming back (that we\u2019ve already paid for at this point) but if Squirrels were not the problem what good is that?? I think even an admission that the initial assessment could have been wrong would have gone a long way but no.  they basically said there is no way to prove that squirrels didn\u2019t leave...even though the sound is still present so the situation is obviously not resolved oh and the icing on the cake, the company does not trap mice.  If your in the Vestavia, AL area please pick a different company if you don\u2019t know for sure the specific animal you have a problem with because this company will be honest upfront.  If Christian had told my husband..look here is what I think but there is a chance 50/50, 75/25 whatever you want to call it that this won\u2019t work to solve your problem because you may have a different problem or two problems...then we would be looking at a different review.  I\u2019m not unreasonable I just expect accountability.  I still have a phone call in to someone at a higher level at the company hoping for some answers  or resolution before taking further action but my hopes are not high.   Best thing I can do is to warn my fellow neighbors and friends.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1608460632653, "text": "Mrs. Wilger,\n\nWe appreciate your review although there needs to be some clarification.

When Richard came to our home on 9/6/19 to pick up the check and contract he said we would receive a call on 9/9/19 to schedule because the service had to be paid in advance before the job could be scheduled. Which we never did receive a call so my husband called on Tuesday and we were scheduled for 9/19/19 between 8-1. We tried to cancel because that seemed too far out to allow the squirrel to remain in our home to keep causing damage, but we were quickly reminded of the No Refund Policy. At 12:30 on 9/19 we received a call saying no one would be able to come do the job that day because of a delay in his schedule (eventhough we had rearranged our schedule to make sure someone would be at home) and that he had to come on Sunday morning 9/22/19.\nYou may want to retrain your staff to give complete information upfront   and double check your information before responding.\nThank you!\n\nUpdate: It's September 2020 and they won't answer our calls and still have not fixed our ceiling!\nStay away from these scammers!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1569586765251, "text": "Mrs. Akinsanya,\n\nThe job was scheduled for 9/24/19 as agreed upon when the contract was executed.

The interaction that you have detailed is very contrary to what our records indicate. While our technician did arrive late due to some issue with our equipment, he in fact communicated same.  At the time, you indicated that, that was in fact ok.\nWhenever we engage prospective customers whether over the phone or in person we always go over their expectations i.e. what they want cleaned and how they would like to see it look. We are then able to guide their expectations based on our own expertise. In your interaction with our technician, Martez, he indicated that your home was in fact badly oxidized and that with pressure washing it may become more evident in some parts than others. He further explained that oxidation is not caused by pressure washing  but in your case it was because of aging paint.  At the end of the service, you indicated that everything was in fact 5 star quality and you did leave a 5 star review to indicate such. It is therefore, quite unsettling that weeks later, you would call making such accusations about our professionalism and conduct thus purposely defaming our company.\nWith that said, we cannot stand responsibility for an issue for which our workman was not culpable. We are truly sorry that we were not able to come to an amicable resolution."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889216488f741b5:0xae1f6de8dd01618d"}

His crew removed all the shingles and then said he had to put plywood down in order to install the shingles. (A large section of roof was uncovered so it isn't like he wouldn't have known something like this ahead of time). He wanted over $6k (I had it done for under $2k paying help) to do this and I had to make a decision before the next time it rained. During the whole process he wasn't helping and was down right rude in his treatment of me. After all was said and done and we were waiting on the insurance company to make the final payment, he sent my bill to collections with additional fees. Mind you the bill would have been paid in under 30 days if he didn't try to scam me out of even more money. Now, I tried to reach out because I needed to get matching shingles for a section of the roof that needs repaired and he sends me another overdue bill and lets me know he won't bother helping me because of all the hassle he had to go through to get paid and threatens me with harassment.

The more estimates I got the more I began to get extremely panicked. The prices that I got were unbelievable. Doing a google search I found Kelbie Roofing. After speaking with Mike he took his time and did a thorough inspection of my roof, chimney and the ceilings inside that had water damage. Mike gave me several options from a patch to a full replacement and the price was really fair and reasonable. Talking to Mike I could tell he was extremely qualified and knew exactly what he was talking about. There was no pressure he even advised if I wanted to get more estimates he would expect no less never go with just one or two estimates. Mike sat down with me and completely went through the entire process that would take place to replace the roof from start to finish.  After speaking with Mike we decided that his knowledge and courtesy was the way we wanted to go.  After signing the contract we set up a start date, the crew he sent showed up on that date on time ready to work. The crew was very courteous and professional, when they began to tear off the roof the crew made sure that my property on the side of the house where they were tossing the trash off and my wife's flower beds were protected. If I ever had a question during this process Mike and the crew never hesitated to answer the question being as this was my first time with such a large repair. The crew went above and beyond to make sure the job was completed properly and that it looked very good. From the tear off to the minor finishing touches I am completely satisfied with the job Kelbie roofing did for me and I will not hesitate to use them in the future.

Slightly unprofessional, but whatever, I went ahead and did what he asked. The next day arrives and it's 2:30pm and we have heard nothing from Kelbie. I text the guy and ask for an update wondering when we can expect them. I get told they will be there after the crew finishes another job near by. 6:00 rolls around and no one showed up. I call this morning to cancel the job and the guy who has been communicating with me the entire time has no clue what job I'm even talking about!

You should see the proposal, it really wow'd me because I knew she cared enough to put some work into it. It was so professionally done!   I received over 6 other proposals for gutters and by far Veronica's was the best.  Everything they were going to do was clearly drawn and described.  I knew exactly what to expect.

SInce then I have had multiple leaks and cannot get them to return my phone calls or come out and look at it. I have hired another company after trying to get several roofers to come out because no one wants to touch someone else's work. FInally I got a highly rated company to come out and they took pictures and showed me where the metal was cut short in several places and patched, most all of the screws are halfway or more out, the edges are patched together causing leaks and overall the work after seeing pictures is very poor. What is really sad is that the original company is not willing to look or stand by their work. so after spending the money and putting a metal roof I now am going to have to replace the whole thing not to mention the wood in several places from the leak. They put screws in the flat part of the metal instead of in the ridges which means water is constantly running over them and slowly leaking into my house. I could understand the metal needing to be rescrewed but because they did not screw it on properly the first time in order for it to be correctly done it will have to be replaced. This company has been around a long time which is one of the reasons we chose to use them in the first place but apparently they have so much business they no longer care about the quality of their work. So sad that  a company would take advantage of people and their hard earned money.

So I called Charles this morning and asked if he came out and looked at the roof.  He said the took a ride out and then said that they were covered up and could not get to my repair.

Ryan came out and was great and presented information well and the process.  He told me step by step the process of the gutter system and how it is installed.  Installation happened very soon after.  Install personnel came and spent 3.5 hours doing the job; rather quickly in my opinion.  Part of the process was to clean out the gutters; they sure did need to be cleaned out.  The remnants of what was in the gutters was just dropped onto whatever was beneath; ground, deck, overhangs, tools, anything that was beneath the gutters.  The problem I have with that:  the mess should have been cleaned up.  Why?  Because that is what I was told; that the installation personnel would clean up the mess. THEY DIDNT DO IT!!  My gutters are pretty high, but I was able to view one gutter from my bathroom window.  There were gaps in the gutter system, and things didn\u2019t look right.  So naturally, I freaked out and called them to voice my concerns.  They told me in a weeks time someone would be out to inspect the entire installation job to make sure everything was good to go.  Surprisingly, someone showed up next day.  They explained that they were going to inspect everything; however they could not inspect 2 out of 4 sides of my home; didn\u2019t have 40ft ladder (not prepared).  So based off of front and back of my home, I was ensured the system was properly installed for the entire home even though only 50 percent was inspected.  The garbage from the gutters is still laying all around my house; don\u2019t worry leaf filter, I\u2019ll pick it up.  Additionally, I found self tap screws (1.5 inches long) that were used from the installation littered on my driveway; haven\u2019t checked the yard yet. Don\u2019t know the operational status of the system yet; waiting for the rains.  Bottom line, I paid top dollar for the system but don\u2019t feel like I received top service.

Ricardo was able to present the display book and explain the benefits of their product compared to competitors.  He was able to measure the length of each gutter and provide an estimate which we were able to negotiate on after expressing concerns on the overall cost.  I was appreciative of the quick response by the add services to schedule the home inspection/estimate and am considering HomeCraft as a finalist to cover my gutters.  The quality of their diamond pattern is visibly superior to the selection that can be found at large home service warehouse stores. The superior design does have a patent on it which adds to the higher price range for the product+service installation.\n\nHomeCraft inspector mentioned that they would install extra support braces inside the gutter every 12 inches.

He presented a range of options and helped us pick the ones that best fit our needs. We're working on scheduling installation. EDIT AFTER GOOGLE ALERTED ME PEOPLE ARE READING THIS REVIEW: Although Chad was very polite in our first meeting, I later reflected on the experience of what turned out to be more a sales pitch than a free estimate. The price quoted at the meeting was around $7k for approx. 100 feet of gutters, brought down closer to $4k after \"discounts\" for posting a positive review online, for allowing the company to place signs in our yard, and for signing a contract within about an hour of meeting the company's representative. I signed the contract when my husband wasn't home (unwise, I know) and was told I had \"plenty of time\" to confer with him. After reading the fine print on the contract, though, I learned I had 3 business days to cancel the contract or we would owe a substantial portion of the quoted price (25%, I believe) to the company, whether or not work on the gutters was completed. I texted the company's representative that my husband and I weren't sure we wanted to go through with the project. He did text me back quickly. But he continued to follow up with several messages until rather late at night on a holiday, insisting that I needed this product to \"protect the investment\" in my home. Although he knew I was considering canceling the contract, a truck loaded with materials still showed up at our house while we weren't home, ready to unload. I ended up canceling the contract in writing within the 3 business days allotted, and I was able to find another company who did work we're happy with for a much lower price.\n\ntl;dr - If you have a lot of money and want good, expensive gutters installed before you have a chance to doubt your decision, this is the company for you.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1617996717061, "text": "Thank you so much for your review!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888923e2945077bb:0xbda7877ccdafff17"}

We were expecting a quick walk through and a quote within a few days. To our surprise, Victoria showed up ready to walk our property and informed us of the product and services offered. To be honest, I didn\u2019t have the slightest clue about anything gutter related, but by the end of our conversation I felt more knowledgeable about the importance of gutters, the various types of gutter protection and why Homecraft is the best. It\u2019s also worth noting that Victoria didn\u2019t discount other competitors, but simply told us why Homecraft is the better option.

After checking our attic and seeing that the squirrel had not yet made an entrance into our house, they told us there was nothing they could do.  The guy didn\u2019t even have a ladder to check our gutters!\n\nSo we call Jim from Exclusive Wildlife & Pest Control.  He laughed when I told him the previous encounter with the Critter Capture company and then proceeded to get his ladder (that he brought himself!) and take a look at our gutters and ensure that the squirrel had not damaged our roof yet and also took the time to double check our attic. No damage was noted except for the fire pit cover we caught the squirrel tearing up the previous weekend.\n\nJim gave me two options on how to get rid of our furry new houseguest; we could capture him alive and release him elsewhere or set a trap similar to a rat trap that should kill him instantly. After much discussion my husband and I decided on the rat trap since the evenings here have been very cold and the poor squirrel may freeze to death in a live trap. Jim was so very patient as we weighed our options and was able to give me the pros and cons on both methods.\n\nAfter one failed attempt to trap him (the trap caught his tail instead of his neck) Jim text me throughout the evening to reassure me that he would get him the next day and that all would be OK. Jim returned promptly the next morning, set the trap again and was able to get the squirrel instantly. He disposed of everything and cleaned the nest out of the gutter.\n\nJim was so very pleasant to work with I will definitely be calling again if any other squirrel decides to make his home here!\nI would recommend Jim and Exclusive Wildlife to anyone who is looking for good, quality, and prompt service.\n\nThank you Jim!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBbVC-1NoRZZKkz46lqwpMR0kKMUXVSo0HNWyH=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpMImbqi6WT6TFmbGFntrWu9R1ePdVJL0QITRP=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1548888877159, "text": "Thank you Mike & Stephanie Freeman, it was my pleasure helping you rid your home of your unwelcomed guest and it was nice meeting you."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a1b2dea85547d:0x4c0bde02d4614206"}

This review is coming at the end of the only season where I used Superior. Throughout the year I wasn't impressed with the invasive weeds that continued to sprawl in the back yard. Normally I was not home when the service was rendered, but one time I stop the person doing the application. He was rather dismissive and said they would get taken care in the future weed control applications. I am not a professional lawn person(hence the reason I pay them)so I had to assume he was telling the truth.\n\nToday, I was home when he came to do the final application. The truck was out front for less than 10 minutes. I have a reasonable sized lawn, front and back and a very difficult gate latch to contend with. There is a zero percent chance that he would have been able to disembark the truck, prep his application material, mange the gate, do a proper back yard treatment, latch the finicky gate latch, do the front and tag my door in that amount of time.  Suddenly then it clicked, this is likely why the back looks terrible - other than the one time I was here with the gate open, the work has never actually been done. (Included below crab grass photos taken today - after $432 in applications you should not see an increase in the amount of weeds - these patches are 2x what they were in the spring.)\n\nIt is evident that Superior does not instill in their employees a sense of pride in their work. I've had the same person so all the applications and a reputable business would develop a culture of doing the right thing. The application person should be invested enough to actually correct the problems a customer and ask for support if needed. Clearly this is not the case with Superior. The operations manager had the approach of blaming me for not bringing it to their attention at an earlier time and after consideration, I believe he couldn't be more wrong. If the applications aren't effective, his employee should be responsible and proactive enough to address this internally and find a solution for the customer.  Obviously these are not priorities for their organization.\n\nCaveat emptor.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMy4-LTuRrGXDNNTQpAp8cJeGNZM6R6wv4XCW6a=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMho-gmsg-5oiMvEhcU7dZYQQf60m_tBAUnM0Gp=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88882b00ada4e425:0xca3738802127df8b"}
