I was getting my car ready to sell so I got the complete detail. The vacuuming was very nice. The only places I saw any kind of debris were some spots under the seats that would require removing the seat in order to clean and that is unrealistic. The wash, wax, and wipe down of everything was nicely done. The seats were shampooed and the cleaning of the seats were great but I would suggest getting a plastic film to put on the seats in case they are still damp. Mine were slightly moist (which I understand they won't completely dry in 4 hours) and when I got home my clothes were also a little moist but this isn't a rating breaker for me. I have a white dog that sheds a lot so I was impressed that they were able to clean the car well enough to where I only saw a couple of straggler hairs around the car. The only thing I did not like was when I got there at 7:00 am, I was greeted by an employee that had no idea about my appointment so I had to re-explain everything and that wasn't a professional first impression in my eyes.
