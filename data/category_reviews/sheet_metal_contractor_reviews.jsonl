It took only 2 days for removal and installation of my new roof which is amazing because mine is very high pitch. Each day they cleaned up their debris (shingles, nails, etc..) and when the dumpster they used leaked hydraulic fluid onto my driveway, they pressure washed the spot. His crew even replaced a board on the side of my home that had a rotten spot. I cant tell you how pleased I am with the aesthetics of my new roof, not to mention how structurally sound it is. 2nd to None had the highest warranty (7 years) of all the companies I was considering which was also a deciding factor for me . Most only have a 5 years warranty and one had only 2 years. When a company can stand behind their workmanship, they deserve my business. Bryan also worked closely with me to make sure I had the right type of shingle (color, functionality). He also imparted valuable advice regarding which shingle manufactures are honoring their warranties. Also..it needs to be mentioned that before they installed the new roof, I had a portion of my old roof tarped but the wind blew it off. Of course heavy rains came and water was leaking in several spots on my roof and into my master bathroom/closet. It was raining and lightening when his crew got on my roof to retarp/stop the leakage. That was also a deciding point for me that I would be using his company for my new roof. I can tell you most companies would not have done that. Also Bryan worked diligently with my Allstate adjuster explaining the cost of the roof which they had initially underestimated. I highly recommend 2nd to None and I have been telling my coworkers/friends about his company as well.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1618276998499, "text": "Thank you so much for your business and this wonderful review!!!\nBryan"}, "gmap_id": "0x886216427e162285:0x5bf81f36acf4143e"}

I was transferred to a salesman. After I explained what I needed, he repeated three times: we have (name of product). No more, no less. I was not encouraged to ask any more questions about the product he named. He then advised me to check Google, and after I did that, to call back and tell them whether what they had was what I needed.\nI was driving, so I pulled over and Googled the product he mentioned. It looked good, so I called back. He was on the phone so I drove over to the business.\nA gentleman with a radio met me outside and was very cordial. He called the same salesman on the radio and, per my request, asked what the price was. I could clearly overhear the salesman on the other end.\nHe said \"we have to get these customers to start calling in.\" He stated the price, then asked for my name and I gave it. He asked if it would be cash and I relayed that it would be my debit card. He could not find my name in the system (I have done light business there in the past and last time my name was in the system.) He then told the gentleman on the radio that I was not in the system and would have to call in my order and credit card information, then I could come back and buy the single item that I needed.\nI left and found the product I needed at a steel supply in Montgomery.\nI'm not a huge commercial contractor, and I don't represent much money to these businesses. But I'm still a prospective customer. I have always had a great and pleasant experience at Alabama Steel, pre-Covid and during Covid. Today was .not typical but it sure made me feel that it didn't matter if I took my money elsewhere. Kudos to the outside sales guy, though.\nBut there is a silver lining: because of this negative experience,  I found an alternate steel business which displays professionalism, great customer skills and makes me feel valued, no matter how small my purchase may be. I spent my career in customer-oriented businesses, and if I have to drive a few more miles to receive good customer service, then that is where my money will go.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e86f54ff1fe41:0x865e6f375d4d1962"}
