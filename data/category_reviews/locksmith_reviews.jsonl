I didn't really want to go and deal with Lowe's or Walmart because frankly Walmart scares me right now. The kiosk was in the front of the store. I never had to directly interact with anyone which was a plus. It was simple put the key in like you're putting it in the door and pick out which key you want and I was going to get two keys and it said that I could get a key for free so I ended up getting three keys for everything included around $20. It didn't take that long. They all worked in my door and I made sure that I did the fingerprint in case I ever get locked out of my apartment. All I have to do is go to the kiosk and do the fingerprint and get another key. That's worth its weight in gold.

When the owners learned this, they called and said they were coming in from out of town but could get to work for us right when they got back into town at 1 or 2 AM or first thing in the morning. Knowing we were planning on leaving early, they made it clear it was no problem for them to come as soon as they got into town, and they did! They suggested we leave the fobs on our front seat and they would program our fobs while we slept. Sure enough, when I woke up this morning at 7 AM I had a text from them saying they\u2019d got it done and were on their way to bring me the reprogrammed fobs. Totally above and beyond.

Andy was the only one that answered the phone all the other companies that claim to offer 24 Hour services didn\u2019t answer and I called several times before trying another company to call. I told him I was located in the Eastdale Mall parking lot and he told me he would be there in 15 minutes. He was there in 10 minutes. He was friendly, prompt, professional, & his services was completed before I could even blink an eye. Although, I was bummed out I had to spend $75 to get my car unlocked I was thankful that Andy was able to come to my rescue and that I was able to get back on the road and home safely. I have saved this company number and although I hope I won\u2019t have to use the services again I will keep his number saved to have on standby just in case if I or anyone of my loved ones run into a similar situation like I did.
