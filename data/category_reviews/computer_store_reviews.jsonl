I was blown away at the price so I decided to think on it. Shawn told me the part alone cost 50 dollars. I told him I would rather look around for another computer and I would like to pick up my computer. He told me come on by and pick it up the following day. A few days later I decided to pull it apart and see how detailed the work was. As I took it apart I noticed there was no hard drive in it. I called Shawn as he proceeded to say that that happens sometimes and his kid must have forgot to put it back in when they were looking for the issue. Additionally I found the part on eBay new for less than 20 dolllars. Not to mention the fact that the diagnoses when they originally took it apart would have been an extra screw to replace the DC jack which he tried charging me another 100 bucks.

They did no work to the computer. I found this shady to say the least given the fact they did no work. I called and after being passed off to four different people I questioned the deposit. I was told by all four people that the deposit was necessary because people bring their computers there and never come to pick them up. I pointed out that was not the case here. I then asked if I could come there and purchase the power supply for $80 minus the $35 that had already been paid. At first the answer was yes you can do that but we won\u2019t guarantee the part. I said I was fine with that. As the conversation progressed and I pressed for a solid answer on the purchase person number four (apparently the top of the ladder there) he began to to fish tail. He said power supplies can range in price. I reminded him the technician actually showed the power supply to my son that was needed for his computer. The price tag said $80. He said you can bring the computer back and we will look at it before the EOB today. At this point I wouldn\u2019t trust these people to hold a penny. Person number four hung up me. It\u2019s a scam.

This did not satisfy you either.  Services have been offered multiple times.  The bench fee is clearly covered at drop off and with signs on the counter at drop off.

He proceeded to give me an estimate of up to $300 and told me he would ship it off to a company in San Diego he works with and they could fix it and it should be ready in two weeks.  He also told me my computer was under warranty which i was aware of but clearly spilling water on your computer is a breach of warranty so he told me if money was an issue to lie to dell and try to get them to fix it for free, i told him i did not want to do that so i gave it to him to fix. He made me put down a $100 deposit which he said consisted of $30 of shipping each way, which immediately confused me because my laptop weighs maybe 2 pounds, and $40 of labor on his part.  Reluctantly i did.\n\n2 weeks later\nI get a call from dell telling me to go pick up my laptop from the technician and ship it to them to fix it  for free.  So i go to Dan and he tells me he never sent my laptop off (so he has been sitting on it for 2 weeks and didn't tell me anything about a change of plans) and he looked at the back and saw it was under warranty (Duh, i know. but i breached the warranty).  He then proceeded to tell me he tried to call dell and get them to fix it and talked to them about it and they told him it was a bad motherboard.  They wouldn't let him ship it to them because he doesn't own the laptop.  I tell him to just give me the laptop and ill ship it to them (because i don't want it back in the slow ass amount of time he does things in). He gives me the laptop and i ask about the $100 deposit.  He says he has already spent wayyy to much time on it and says i'm lucky he didn't charge me more.  !!!( He charged me $100 to look at my computer for 20 minutes and then talk to dell on the phone for 1 hour, which i did not pay him to do, nor did he ask me before he did)!!! so i get my laptop and leave hoping to never deal with this individual again.\n\n!!Read This!!\nI give my laptop to dell and get it fixed for less than he quoted me and they get it back to me in 10 days.

Actually at no point did they predict any problems.

I got my laptop second hand at a great discount, because it was a model made with weak hinges, causing the previous owner to have the screen replaced after an accident.  After I dropped it a short distance on its hinge, the display ceased to work, even though the rest of the laptop's functionality was normal.  I figured that it was a pretty open-and-shut loose wire problem, and that it would help to tell Dan these things when I arrived.\n\nHowever, when I brought the laptop in, I accidentally grabbed the wrong, but near identical charger.  After he learned I brought the wrong charger, he treated me like a complete idiot, and disputed most anything I had to say.  The laptop's power button was flashing the 'low battery' pattern that I recognize, because Alienware laptops have highly customize-able lights.  Dan insisted that he couldn't do anything until I brought the proper charger in, because the laptop could have been flashing an error code, possibly indicating a software issue.  I was ready to fetch the proper charger, but wanted to leave the laptop with him while I did, explaining that I recognized the pattern and it was probably a hardware issue similar to the one it had before.  However, he pressed upon me that it was likely a software issue, 'proving' this by hooking it up to a monitor by VGA, and getting no response.  My laptop has never allowed the shortcut keys on my laptop to reroute the display until I got past the login screen, which we obviously couldn't do without a display, so this was a pretty irritating response.\n\nHe then repeated his point about the potential of an error code in the flashing power button light several times, using increasingly smaller words each time, and gave me a little diatribe on the importance of bringing a charger with you when you get a laptop repaired, a point that I had already raised, apologized for, and was so blindsightingly obvious as to be insulting.  After the fifth iteration of the 'error code' talk, we left.\n\nTLDR;\nThe problem was a loose connection, and took another business less than half an hour to fix.  In the same amount of time, Dan had unsuccessfully plugged in a VGA cable, explained to me the importance of chargers and batteries, misidentified the problem, and ignored anything I had to say about the origin of the problem and the way my laptop worked.

We were closed on this Saturday so I made a special trip just to meet him for pick  up.  I can provide receipts as proof of the time frame.  Mr Garcia had fallen for a scam artist and had allowed the person access to his computer. The laptop was terribly infected. I cleaned the system of the infections, tools, and changes made to his computer, which I cleaned and worked through midnight on Friday night to ensure he would have it back on Saturday.  To work on the computer I had to set the desktop magnifier back to normal 100% rather than 150% magnification. On opening Monday morning, 12/18, he came back into the shop very angry and abusive, complaining he couldn't see his desktop.  I set the desktop magnification back to 150%, and he told me about the password problem.  I tried to go through the 2 step verification with him to retrieve his password, but since he had previously done this multiple times at home , he had been put into \"time out\" by Google, telling him to come back and try again in a few hours.  He demanded that I call google and get it fixed, which google doesn't do (to my knowledge).  I asked him to be patient and try again later, but he continued to be abusive.  We did receive a message that the password was changed 6 days before, which would have been December 12.  He stated he thought he knew the password, but it didn't work.  I tried tell the customer that these safeguards were in place for the safety of his account and information, but he refused to believe that I couldn't just pick up the phone and call Google and get this problem fixed.  All other work was performed to his specifications."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a0e3a2dbe1471:0x56a3a2e40492802a"}

Don't buy your equipment ANYWHERE else whether you are a company or an individual in West Alabama.

Do not take your iPhone, iPad, Macbook Pro, Macbook Air to anyone else because if that company messes up your equipment a certified service provider CANNOT fix it legally. Just because the company has Iphone or Mac in its name, does mean that company is legally allowed to work on Mac products. Don't be fooled!\n\nThey troubleshot my Mac (for free) and uploaded my software and files to my new Mac for the same price as buying the computer. As my business grows, I will buy EVERYTHING from them. Run, don't walk, and sign up with these guys if you own a business, small or big. You will save so much money and headaches as you grow.

I got it home and....well let's just say it IMMEDIATELY went back. It came with FREE bugs. They told me it would be a few days before they would be able to get me another. So I waited. Finally they called and said they had a brand new one in. I went to pick it up and turns out it was brand new but it had more storage. They said that the whole thing was their fault so they wouldnt charge me anymore and gave me an extra controller. Turns out THEY LIED! BECAUSE THEY GAVE ME A PS4 FILLED WITH BUGS, THEY CHARGED ME FOR THE EXTRA SPACE AND THE EXTRA CONTROLLER THEY TOLD ME WOULDNT COST ME ANY EXTRA! So at this point I'm already aggravated. It gets much worse. I'm standing in line to pay one day, and the 2 customer reps were speaking to each other. The one lady said \"Weve got people that haven't paid  in almost 4 weeks. If they would just pay on time we wouldnt have to go repossess their things\". Okay no big deal. Every now and then I get a week behind. BUT I ALWAYS CALL AND LET THEM KNOW AND I ALWAYS PAY FOR 2 WEEKS PLUS THE EXTRA FEES THEY TAK ON!!!! ALWAYS! The most recent week I was 5 days late. I called them and told them. And they had the audacity to tell me they would have to come and take it if I didn't come pay it within 2 days.

To give my company 3 stars just because we are not sitting around waiting on your arrival is not fair. Has it ever dawned on you that we are not sitting around twiddling our thumbs, we are not at the bowling alley having fun, we are not at a social party ,  we are working even when we are not at the store location. It's called out on a service call.\n\nWe have a sign permanently posted to the front door that states if we are not at the store please call the number listed and a rep will arrive to assist you within 15 minutes.  We have been at this location for 10 years, during that 10-year tenure my records show that we have service your computer needs just two times once in 2013 and once in 2014. Here it is 2018 that you show up and leave a negative review because you arrive one or two times and there's no one at the store to assist you. During our 10-year tenure there have been computer stores that have come and gone however we have survived, and the reason why we survived is because we do good work and most people obey the sign that is posted on the door.\n\nIf they come and we're not present they follow the instructions they simply pick up their cell phone dial the number listed and Presto a representative arrives within 15 minutes just as stated. You have been most unfair in your review, has it ever dawned on you that we are the only full service retail computer store that's in operation in Wetumpka also within a 20 to 30 mile radius? Shouldn't that alone tell you that we are busy and there will be times when we're not at the store?  You do know that we have a telephone number that most people call, even to make appointments.\n\nDid you pick up the phone and call us to inquire about where we are what we're doing? All of the previous years that we've service you, you've never taken the time to say anything good let alone take the time to leave a positive review.  But here it is after 10 years of service you choose to leave a 3 star review not in regard to our work or the quality of work,  but you leave a 3 star review all because you arrived and no one was at the location, and you failed to pick up the phone call call.\n\nWe service residental and business customers alike, and we provide house calls and onsite service to both. When a business calls us and states there main business computer is down, we setup an onsite service call leave the store even at times when no one will be left to service the store. Why do we do this?  Its not personal its just business.  There is more money to be made in one business service call then there is for us to sit in the store waiting on residential customers to find the time to bring there computer in.   For you to reply to our absence as thow we are out on lake martin fishing rather than taking care of business is certianly not fair judgment. The good book says \"Judge not lest you be judged, for the same measure in which you judge others, you will be judged\".\n\nMaybe the next time a solicitor comes to your residential door in an attempt to sell you a product and you're not home, maybe that's solicitor should log on to Google and leave you a negative review. Not based on the fact that you didn't buy his product, but a negative review based solely on the fact that you were not even home.\n\nIn closing, I would like for you to exercise your right to choose another store to do business with.  Best Buy would be the closest and is only 45 miles away from your residence.  I just can't see the logic in us continuing to service someone who has Judged us so unfairly. If you would like to discuss this matter further, our phone number has been the same now for 10 years. I hope you have a better day."}, "gmap_id": "0x888c2694964e20c1:0x7e27f6a2f3473c19"}

He was not giving up, he had the knowledge to see the phone had potential to restore from the computer by the way it was trying to reconnect .

Take the gas from the guy's paycheck (if you're paying guys who think UPGRADABLE RAM is soldered to the board, anyway. And processors and graphics cards for that matter) for so politely convincing me to bring it all out there after being given models and brands.  Everything I could do to maintain some class before I left. Nothing worse than going out of your way to ensure its not a fruitless trip, only to get there and find some genius has given you bad info...and then instead of owning it....lying through his teeth ever so easily with a smile on his face. Aparently my cloths from a day under my cars hood, disguised my occupation as an aerospace engineer.... and I looked like someone who believed hard drives require soldering. In the parking lot now trying to figure gasoline vs. Dive distance.\n\nRESPONSE TO BUSINESS: No, I'm passing. At this point, I believe ive done what's necessary to prevent this happening to someone else. I've made them aware. You know who screwed the pooch, you know what they did...and for that matter, the african American young man who provides the quotes (according to the Liar) knew, and yet hid in the back and let the guy I dealt with do his thing. I'm wondering if THAT is in the fact Cosmo you speak of. In which case, he didnt do anything then, so I dont believe hed do anything NOW. I dont believe your store would have poated a response at all, if not for the star by my name.\n\nYou intentionally ignored my suggestion of gas compensation, and while your words are very well put together to give the impression of being amicable....the previous young mans words were pretty enough to get me out there. Fool me once, sir....yet not twice.\n\nA whole paragraph you've written in response that says essentially... Nothing.\n\n2 weeks Later: See folks? Still no response... Just ran and hid.

(i have leased with this company on a previous occasion, my experience at that time was very sub par. the delivery was late and the dryer power cord  was damaged to the point of causing property damage to my wall plug in my home.) A red headed woman approached the counter with no mask and asked me \"how can i help you?\", i replied i am looking to lease a laptop. she then told me \"i have the desktop over there\" i stated then what kind of laptops do you have \" the kind that turn on!\" she stated. so i disregarded her unprofessional remark still uneasy about both employees not having on a face covering, and asked to know my options of computer choices. she then with an attitude that i was an inconvenience to her began putting laptop boxes on the counter. i read the specifications and made my choice. she asked if i had leased with them before, i stated yes. it had been more than 30 days since my last lease so i was directed to fill out another lease application. during this time of filling out the application i came to find out the employee that was behaving in this manner was the general manager. she then informed me while i was filling out the rental application that she \"hated these mask\" and that i did not have to wear mine while in the store. i was now fully uncomfortable from a collection of lack of safety procedure during a pandemic. i continued to wear my mask. once the application was complete another employee then took a copy of my drivers license. the general manager took another 10 minutes to ask me to please come into her office. she was pulling up things on her computer. she then turned to me and rolled her eyes and said\" so you have rented from us before huh? \" i said yes i have multiple times. she then proceeded to question why i was late on my rental payment. i told this brute of a woman that i had financial hardship and lost my job at the time. i got behind on the lease and once i realized i could no longer afford to get the payments from these loan sharks up to date due to exorbitant late fees and penalties i returned the leased merchandise. she then stated that she \"believed in giving second chances\". i  acknowledged the comment but did not rebut to the comment. she then looked over more information on her computer. and turned to me and said \" being late im ok with, but people keeping merchandise that is not theirs im not ok with!!\" at this point i have become very uncomfortable and feel as if my visit to the store this day has become a humiliation session for the store manager. i stopped the woman and told her i felt degraded and would no longer like to do business with this establishment. she then laughed at me and said \" fine then\". i contacted the corporate office for this company and was informed they condone this behavior. a few notes if you intend to rent from this establishment, you may be exposed to covid 19 by employees or other patrons due to lack of adherence of mask mandate while in this location or lease merchandise that has not been sanitized properly. you will be belittled by the staff if you ever have financial hardship while in a lease agreement with this company as well. i hope this review is helpful to those thinking of leasing from this company. i would recommend the better competitor YOURWAY RENT TO OWN which is located at 2547 Bob Wallace ave. when i left this establishment i went to your way and was able to lease a laptop computer in less than 15 minutes without being belittled or shamed. (quick your way rent to own history) they do not charge daily late fees(best ways policy is built to extort with late fees)  when a payment may be late and will work with you if you hit financial hardship. also the merchandise is of higher quality, the facility is cleaner, with more inviting more professional staff. stay safe out there in this pandemic!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626c968658c4e5:0xe253ce2faeb99938"}

I built my PC and I know what I'm doing, I only took it to them because i hoped the actual professionals could find the problem. I dropped it off and told them a little about the problem and they told me they shoot for 24-48hr repairs and there was a $30 minimum diagnostics fee. I agreed and left. They did the same troubleshooting things that I did and came to the same conclusion I did: a new motherboard would fix the problem. I accepted my fate. That was on Friday. On Monday I called and asked if there were anymore developments. They said the motherboard was the issue and that I could pick it up. I asked if the 30 dollars included tax. They said because it was an extended diagnostics period that the fee was now 45, to which I never agreed. I paid it anyway and when I got home I realized a fan was disconnected and so was my RGB LED strip. They didnt put them back the way I left it. On top of that, the pin header for the strip was bent and it snapped off when I tried putting it back in. I booted my system up using a different CPU and it worked fine, only I kept getting some error that wasn't there before. The broken pin and the error wasn't their fault, but they should've plugged the fan and strip back in and properly informed me  about the price hike from 30 to 45 dollars before I agreed to their terms. 3 stars because of the problems mentioned but I wont drop it down worse because I dont know how they could have fixed my computer.

Ordered a battery from Amazon and they couldn't get the back of the phone off.  So they call the Verizon retail store in hazel green and the girl told her to take it to ch pc repair and he would do it.  My mothers phone worked FINE when she took it in there.  She could do anything and everything on her phone.  When she went to pick it up the phone would not even turn on.   He said he tried both old and new battery and it still wouldn't come on.  So he took the screen off and put it on another phone and the screen works.  So he is saying that the mother board is messed up.  He can check it out BUT he'd have to charge her to do it.  Momma said he really messed the back up,  like it was melted!!  I met her up there and his attitude is  basically \"screw you \".  He insisted that the phone was not working when she took it in.  I asked him why he didn't call her and tell her and he said because she didnt leave a number.  To which my reply is \"when you work in customer service like this it is your responsibility to get a number so you can get in touch with the person\". He is a total jerk!!  He takes ZERO responsibility for his screw ups.  Said he was not going to make it right.  But he did tell her that he'd buy the phone from her when she bought a new one.  Then he threatened to call the cops on us \"because it was after hours, he was closed and we wouldn't leave\".  He never asked us to leave, period.  He brags about how much money he makes per year and all of his vehicles and house is paid for.  Good for him.  I dont give a \ud83d\udc01but what he has and doesn't have.

You came into my office, clearly disgruntled. You then continued to talk over me without giving me a chance to respond or explain the situation.\n\nPam visited my store with her device, which she believed to have a battery issue. She provided an aftermarket battery and had explained that an attempt was made, using a hairdryer, to open the casing and replace the battery, prior to me looking at the device. When the device was dropped off, I was in the middle of an extensive repair, as well as having a conversation with a different client. Not only that, but the device was dropped off quickly, without any contact information, and with very few details.\n\nI replaced the battery with the after-market battery she provided and then attempted to boot up the device, but to no avail. I investigated further but was unable to find a solution. Pam then arrived to pick up her device, and she was, understandably, very upset to find it not working. She wanted it in working order right then and there, and while I understand her sentiments, I can only do so much so quickly. I needed more time to troubleshoot and determine the problem and possible solution, but she would not allow it. I was even willing to reimburse her with a fair value for her device.\n\nI have been in business for more than 10 years now. I work hard every day, and I like to think that I am very good at what I do. I manage hundreds of computers monthly, and I repair and fix many devices daily (thousands of devices yearly). I can remove a device's back/screen in a few minutes with simply a bit of heat and some playing cards, and I have never had any issues. I would never damage a device intentionally. I treat all repairs as if they were my own. That being said, mistakes can (and do) happen as there are many risks involved with these repairs, but I do my best to make things right. To me, it's not just about collecting payment for the services I provide\u2014although that is necessary for me to stay in business and provide for my family. It's about building long-term relationships with my clients, and I deeply enjoy helping and providing knowledge to my clients.\n\nThis is the first complaint I have received with the BBB, and I would truly like to resolve the issue, and have the opportunity to change your outlook on me and your experience with my business. CH PC Repair is my business\u2014it has my name in it, a fact that I am proud of and would never change.\n\nSincerely,\nChad Harbin\nCH PC Repair"}, "gmap_id": "0x88623f52db6fed93:0x398f7a17a9216be3"}

She puts my order in the bag and walks off before I can take my card out of the chip reader and back into my wallet.  Didn't even get a thank you for shopping.

Acceptance now calls you constantly the day your payment is due until you pay it. There is not even one day grace period. It took me three hours for them to put the paperwork together for a $1k purchase. Now all they do is harass me. I am a federally licensed banker and I can tell you their business model is based on intimidation and scare tactics and they are very very un professional.  I have reported them to the State for their mafia like tactics - BEWARE! Buy furniture locally at one of the locally owned furniture store for a better buying experience. UPDATE 7/22/19 SO my Payment was due Friday. They called all weekend and left mean messages saying there is no grace period and they will be coming for the furniture if the whole account isn't paid by Monday - today.
