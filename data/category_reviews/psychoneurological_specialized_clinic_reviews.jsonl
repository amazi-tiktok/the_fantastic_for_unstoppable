To be clear, I have not been to their office... This practice was recommended by my child\u2019s pediatrician for comprehensive developmental testing. Once I finally spoke to someone, I was informed that they only accept BCBS or cash. For the low, low price of $2500-3000, you can have 3-4 appointments (that is for testing only, no treatment).\n\nWhile their website presents this image that they aim to treat a wide array of conditions, including those individuals with disabilities and handicaps, it appears that their primary interest is taking advantage of those most in need. In many instances, those with handicaps and disabilities are unable to work with little to no income to support themselves or rely on their families for support; families in these situations are already under intense financial strain. Additionally, based on my conversation, test results are not given until a year long payment plan concludes (imagine an oncologist having this policy). A year, when it comes to a child\u2019s development, is a long time to wait.\n\nAfter hearing the pricing, I had no interest in further details or clarification; however, I suppose it\u2019s a good thing they offer a payment plan, if you\u2019re willing to pay their high fees and do not want to take out a personal loan. It is likely they do not contract with Medicaid because the state will not pay anywhere close to their high fees.\n\nI have no interest in supporting a clinic more interested in lining their pockets than genuinely helping the community in which they aim to serve. I would not recommend this clinic to anyone and I will be contacting my pediatrician\u2019s office to advocate removing this office from their list of recommendations.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1600811761271, "text": "Terin,\n\nI am very sorry for the communication difficulties. I am afraid that there were some miscommunications regarding insurance coverage and cost of testing.
