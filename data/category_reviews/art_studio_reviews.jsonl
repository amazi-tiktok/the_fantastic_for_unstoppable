You also have the option to \"upgrade\" your painting by purchasing a larger canvas.\nAnother thing that most of these places do is sell the paintings that the instructors do during every class. I wish I could say that they're affordable and worth the price, but that definitely is not the case. When I inquired about which paintings were for sale and about the general cost, the woman got snarky with me. After paying well over $100 to for little to no instruction and having an overall bland experience, I did not want to give this place any more of my money.\nPAINTER'S TIP:\nI would suggest stopping by Walmart (or ordering off Amazon) and getting a cheap variety pack of paintbrushes (I posted a photo of the pack I purchased).

Nothing held back; Stacy is invested in her students having as much success as possible in the process. She was accommodating to my flight schedule and carry-on restrictions and worked with me on the things I could not bring on the plane. The class was fun and I got to meet and make new friends with a great bunch of clay folk. And, I made a crazy octopus bowl to boot!\n\nLater in the summer, I was able to take another class, Slip Trailing, on my way to a work seminar. This was a tremendous compliment to the octopus work, and will have applications in a lot of my other work. It adds a dimension (literally) that is not available through glaze or underglaze. She was detailed enough in the chemistry that I was hooked, but not so much that the class was lost. The demos and slip play go a super long way in understanding the intricasies of the process.\n\nNow to the area. Alabama is just lovely! The hot sticky weather that they were having was perfect for my cold northern blood. The flora in Alabama is completely different to mine, and I enjoyed driving around to take it all in. The Mills are an amazing space dedicated to the arts and I could have spent days wandering the booths. And!! Anyone visiting Stacy who is gluten free or paleo; I found the most delightful bakery and eatery. Their dedicated gluten free facility has some of the best stuff, and that includes BEFORE my diagnosis. Try the jalapeno cheddar scones at Mason Dixon Bakery, you\u2019ll never want to leave.\n\nSo seriously, if the opportunity comes to have class with Stacy and S.P.Morgan Studios, take it; you will have no regrets.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIe6G8pfkAKvVmaeVWdTqCVFZ-KmMOg_B6chwA=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOv4tW9XFJaxXLyvtizsXfGb3AaEk10zOiKZ9RQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5voVbbuE5ouJtKV0l6OBBXkc-PMB3pbehYnDF=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cbcca324b2d:0x6d862a64a6cb230d"}

I went back to show them the tattoo and the first thing that was asked was \u201cdid you get it here\u201d .... KNOWING that they had JUST seen me.!! Then I was directed to another artist there who DID NOT do my tattoos and wasn\u2019t even there the day i had got them and he clearly knew that something wasn\u2019t right because he asked \u201cwhat have you put on it.?!?\u201d And I replied \u201caquaphor\u201d because that\u2019s what they recommended and that\u2019s also what I used for my other previous tattoos. And then he tried to get smart saying how long he\u2019s been in \u201cthe chair\u201d and they couldn\u2019t do anything until it \u201chealed\u201d But the thing is when this heals they wouldn\u2019t be able to put ink on the spots that are MISSING SKIN and they KNOW IT. I was extremely polite until they tried to pass it off like they didn\u2019t see my skin and the colored FLESH that was showing because the artist dug wayyy too deep. I was even okay with the artist not making the tattoo the color i wanted because he claimed he \u201ccouldn\u2019t see well\u201d that night so i went with a whole nother tattoo look than i was going for.& I thought it still turned out nicely until things took a turn for the worst.  I know how tattoos are supposed to heal because I have them and have went to MULTIPLE ARTISTS so It\u2019s not me being \u201cpicky\u201d or rude . I at least wanted them to be more concerned but I couldn\u2019t get an apology, an offer to make things right, or even my money back. But I have contacted my lawyer and I will have to make the necessary steps.!! Like I said the man who did the tatt was  NICE as ever but he dug too deep and it left permanent damage on both tats and it could\u2019ve went differently had they at least acknowledged what was wrong. Truly sad the way things were handled/not handled.!! No one wants to have messed up skin especially in a place where it\u2019s visible to people. I trusted them with my skin and the art but got done horribly.. this is why I believe with some places you need to just pay half or pay after the work is done and even if you pay before hand, if something goes wrong because of THEM and you go to them in a polite manner even though this is your body so you have a reason to be alarm and HEATED ....then they should at least do everything in their power to make it right and pay you back and try to fix it. But like I said there\u2019s no fixing this and they knew it that\u2019s why I had to take legal action. Not trying to bash their business or anything because my first initial thought was \u201cthey\u2019re pretty nice people and it\u2019s a cool space\u201d when i first walked in to set the appointment but as far as my experience and things .... I definitely won\u2019t be going there again and the way they handled my situation.. I highly wouldn\u2019t recommend and that\u2019s just me.!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1593571746452, "text": "Looked through all paperwork\u2019s was not ever tattooed at my shop..."}, "gmap_id": "0x888bb172c55c3801:0x63d2bf04b66beb89"}
