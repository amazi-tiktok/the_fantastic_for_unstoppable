She was kicked out for being gay, she was told to get her heart right or get out.  While I do not agree with her lifestyle, I do know that Jesus came for the sinners and He came out of love and tells us to do ALL things out of love.  The actions and words that were spoke to my niece by the man that calls himself the preacher was not acts of love, compassion, or trying to draw sinner to Christ.  His sermon could of been what God used to reach her, but instead he let his flesh influence his actions pushing her farther from not only a recovery, but from Jesus as well.
