I brought the car back in on Monday the 4th and told them the service engine light came on and something under the car was rattling. I was told by the owners son that he didnt know anything about standard shift cars and they would not be responsible for anything wrong with it. Almost 3 weeks later the car starts running hot. When my husband got to me to check it out he opened up the radiator to find that it is full of J.B block seal he runs over 80 gallons of water through the radiator trying to clean it out to no avail. We replaced the thermostat that was so coroded with block seal it was rusted up. I called and left a message with Pierce auto sales telling them that the car was running hot and because someone was trying to cover up a cracked block or blown head gasket and there was so much block seal in the radiator and engine that I didn't know if the car was going to make it home and that I really needed someone to call me back because I had no way to get it home. I never recieved a call back.It cost me $60 to rent a car dolly to drag it home. Now the car came with an outside warranty but because \"whoever\" filled the motor up with block seal to hide a major problem until they could find an idiot \"me\" to take the car off of there hands the warranty will not cover the car. So now I have a blown up car sitting in my yard that I drove less then a month and repo men knocking on my door because they want there car back and still after all this time I have yet to recieve a call from anyone at Pierce Auto Sales.  I recieved more help and sympathy from the repo man in 10 minutes then I have from Pierce in 2 months. I paid $1500 down for a car that didn't even last until the first payment was due. I dont bash people or businesses but i have tried every other way to get them to talk to me. I just want my money back so I can get a car that runs and won't leave me on the side of the road less then a month after purchase.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a56497104639d:0x842e60c3c94517bb"}

I was told 89 cents a lbs and that I should have a 20 or 30 lbs tank on my RV. I should have known better than to choose Bankston at this time since the manager on the phone acted like it was such a hassle to give me the total price for both tanks. (After all the trouble he went through for the total.) I was told it was 19.28 for a 20lbs tank and 28.32 for a 30lbs tank. Which sounds reasonable, so I didn't bother to check anywhere else in town. When I arrived today, I was greeted by a professionally dressed man asking if I needed any help. I responded I need to get my propane tank filled and to get my brakes checked. I then pulled around to get my tank filled and was told it would be next week before they could get to my brakes. No big deal I thought. so I go inside to pay and the total came to 53 and some change. I confronted him about the quote I was gave over the phone and he immediately got defensive and started to explain why I was being charged more. Since I was interested in doing more business with them with my brake problem, you would assume that he would do what was necessary to make things right. He might have took a small loss on the propane but would have simply made it up in the outstanding labor charges. When you quote someone a price you stick with that price to make your customer feel valued. I really felt like I was nothing but in the way and a hassle to them as soon as I pulled onto the lot. Bankston Motor homes is less than a mile from my house. However I will make the drive to Coldwater RV center in Muscle shoals for any future service or maintenance I need for my RV. Last time I was there before I made my RV purchase they were very helpful and took the time that was needed to explain to me the different types of water systems I Inquired about and what would better suit my needs.

We were given a vehicle to drive and was under the impression that they were going to do everything they could to make it \"right\". We sought legal advise. We were advised not to accept the vehicle after they had their mechanics look at it, but give them two options... either find us one that was comparable, or buy it back from us. About a week later, one of the owners contacted us to let us know the Tahoe was fixed...it was just a coil spring that needed to be repaired.  Once we explained that we did NOT want this Tahoe, and this was not we had paid all this money for, we were told they would find us one comparable. So once again, we were under the impression they were going to make it right. When they found us another one, it had over 36,000 miles which meant no warranty....BUT we decided to go ahead and purchase it and put it all behind us (after having it looked at by our own mechanics). They agreed to pay the first one off (as a trade-in), and turn around and finance the second one. They did. However,  a couple weeks later, we got a call from the owner letting us know that a payment was late on the first Tahoe (that we traded back in to them BEFORE the first payment was due) and that he didn't want it to damage our credit. We needed to pay it and he would pay the rest of the Tahoe off. Once again, we had to threaten to get a lawyer. We had to contact the credit union to explain what was happening and that we didn't want our credit ruined. It has been a long, drawn out mess! Instead of doing the right thing to begin with, we had to continuously fight with these people to get anything done.  Now they have this very same Tahoe listed on their website.I am warning you...if you do not want a headache, I would look elsewhere. I have since peeled their name off of my vehicle and want no part of anything to do with these people anymore!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1511896498857, "text": "Ms Waite, I am so sorry that we could not offer you a satisfying experience.  Once I found out you were unhappy, I did all that I could do to make it right for you; took the original SUV back, gave you a free loaner car, and purchased a new Tahoe for you.  We post a free Carfax on our website on every vehicle offered for sale, for our customers convenience.  We even discounted the price of the new Tahoe to keep your payments the same, after your credit score dropped almost 80 points, which equaled a loss of $2,800 to us.   Once again, I am sorry that we were not able to exceed your expectations...."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a43a219021e6b:0x7a6975c66ac67eaa"}

We purchased a brand new 2021 toy hauler in January and have had big issues with it since the first night we hooked up immediately after picking it up. I have it all documented on film and paper with the manufacturer and camping world where the rv is still at being repaired. I will share this information with anyone interested. From water leaks from furnace hoses to bubbled  up roof and water intrusion to ac not working to sparking usb charging ports on the wall. Now I understand why they never hooked it up for us to show us. My mistake for not turning on the ac when temps were in the 30s and my mistake for not climbing on the roof considering it was a brand new 2021 model. To make things worst I called service the same night, yes a little irritated, and they just hung up on me. Nevertheless I\u2019m grateful for the lesson and this won\u2019t happen again. And by the way my name is Ivan and bought the 2021 XLR Micro Boost, sales guy was Matt, no complaints on him unless we was aware he was a selling a defective unit and he did help us arrange for help on the interior water leak the next day after pick up during our trip.\n\nIn response to yours:\nI called your sales rep immediately the next morning after leaving your facility as well as your service dept. your sales rep said you don\u2019t do comprehensive service there and your service person hung up on me. If you just became aware of this ongoing issue that required your sales rep to coordinate a repair for us at another dealer then you clearly have no quality measures in place or else you would know. This review is more that fair and accurate and it\u2019s on you because I didnt buy it from else where I bought it from you and you need to inspect and know what you are selling and you need to back it up instead of saying you don\u2019t do that service or have ignorant service people hang up on a customer who drove hours to do business with you.

Please understand the dealer does not build Campers, they buy them like any other retail store does any product sold from a supplier or factory.

They kept it until the next day so they could make sure everything was checked out and ready for us to take possession the next day including, supposedly, cleaning it inside and out. Well when we got it home the next day, it was definitely not cleaned. There were stains on the sink, tub and shower, ceiling, etc. Dirt and dust. Windows were not clean. I am not sure what all was included in the supposed to be cleaned but  nothing looked clean. So I spent the next day, which was a Saturday, cleaning it before I started storing items in it to go camping. We went on our first camping trip in November for a week. Had a wonderful time. We noticed the first day that the shower leaked from the sprayer. We had not used it, nor have we yet. We used bath houses at the camp site. We had to lay the sprayer in the floor of the shower so we didn't have to listen to the drip all night. The awning was missing screws where it is attached to the outside of the camper. So when we got back from our trip, my husband called to let them know about the issues. They told us to just make an appointment and we could take it up there for repair. So in December my husband called to make an appointment. They gave us January 19th to bring it so my husband loaded it up and took it to them. When he got there they said it would be 4-6 weeks before it was ready. We didn't understand since we had made an appointment as told. He said there were 4 or 5 ahead of us. He was very upset but went ahead and left it and called to talk to the guy we purchased it from. He has since talked to a so called manager and got no help. 2 weeks ago, he got a call saying they were about to start working on it and would call him back that evening when it was ready. Still haven't heard back from them yet. We are about to make the 2nd payment on it while it has been held hostage at the repair shop. We were planning a trip this month but can't because we have no camper. Buyer beware. Sucker you in by the great sales deals and no wonder it has warranty for life, you never get to use it when you have to have it worked on.

My husband and I bought a new StarCraft that came with the RV Warranty for Life. Due to the current pandemic and several family members with life threatening illness that we could not risk exposing to Covid, we had to prolong scheduling the warranty inspection. I spoke to Ethan the first week in Jan., who told me the first available date they had for drop off was Jan. 18th, he said it takes a couple of weeks, but a min. of 5 days. On Friday, Jan. 15th I called to confirm the drop off date & to see if we need to remove any of our personal items. The person who answered the phone said it was not necessary to remove any items as the inspection on takes 2 hrs. So my husband & I take off work and make the 3 hour trip. Upon arriving we inquire with Ethan as to how long they anticipated having the camper because the person we spoke to on Fri. gave us a completely different time frame. He said their current turn around time was 4-6 weeks!! My husband explained to him that is not what we had been told and even when we spoke to HIM he said 2 wks, but at least 5 days. (keep in mind it takes 2 hours) So my husband asked to see a manager. Blake Gardner comes out and my husband explained the situation and his response was that due to Covid they were behind and that 4-6 weeks was their turn around time. He also said that 2 days prior he had 2 service technicians test positive for Covid and they were running on a \"skeleton crew\". We told him that he understood that, but our frustration was the lack of communication we received about how long it would actually take and that I had just called on Friday and was told 2 hrs. He said it does only take 2 hrs once they got to it, but they had many other campers in ahead of ours and were running behind.  Blake said he understood our frustration and that they would try to get it done as soon as possible. At this point although not happy, we agreed to leave it. As we're finishing up unhooking, Blake comes back on a UTV with some man, assuming it's the one responding to these reviews as he never introduced himself. He was not friendly, never got off of the UTV and starting asking what the problem was. We explained to him the situation. He said the 4-6 week time frame was if they had to order parts, I said what parts, it's practically brand new and that is not what Blake had just told us, he said the time frame was because of Covid. So again, we're getting different story. He very rudely says, \"ma'am I don't need your attitude\"! In effort to keep the situation from escalading further, I do not respond and we ask Ethan if they're going to lock it up. They say no we keep it unlocked, my husband said I'm not leaving the camper unless you lock it, you have several people walking around unsupervised looking at campers, we're not leaving it unlocked. So this unnamed man, starts saying we never said we weren't going to lock it we said we don't lock the deadbolt because our key doesn't work for that. (we have one key that locks both btw). I said that is not at all what you just said. I specifically asked if you were going to lock it and you said no. So Ethan and Blake try to lock it and none of their \"master keys\" work. So my husband and I are having a private conversation about taking it somewhere else and again this man chimes from behind us (still on his UTV) and says \"that's exactly what you need to do\". Needless to say we did not leave it. Yes, we were very frustrated, as anyone else would have been after taking time off work and driving 3 hours to get the runaround about how long they needed to keep it and not only getting poor customer service, but a very rude person who just pops up AFTER Blake had already handled the situation. There was no reason for him to even come out! The best thing about the whole situation is as we're hooking back up they decide to bring keys out and lock all the existing campers that were already there. So if you have a camper there for service, I sincerely hope all of your belongings are still there.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1611108578866, "text": "Like every story there are 2 sides to every story 1. we do not have guys out for covid we had 3 guys getting tested for covid because one of the guys said his mother had Covid and they where in close contact with each other at work so we had them sent home for  3 days and then they got tested to be sure and not one of them had Covid  2. Mr and Mrs Garrett was rude to our employee's from the second they arrived at our dealership which no employee should take 3 . during a Warranty for life inspection there might be a issue and we have to order parts which could take 4-6 weeks to get parts from the factory right now due to covid in the us and parts are getting hard to get. 4. We did not lock any doors on other campers while Mr and Mrs Garrett was hooking back up to their Camper because our campers are locked while on the lot because we have pass keys for all locks except dead bolts but we did ride around the lot checking for packets left in campers that had been delivered from the factory the night before ( Buyers who treat employee's like the Garretts do are not welcome at any of ours stores or any other store with good employee's working there so when they  said they where leaving to go up the road to trade the Camper in we said that would be a great idea ..........

Johnny and Paul made sure all systems on my RV were operational and performing optimally.\n\nUnfortunately, when I got my RV hooked up and went to pull off the lot I had some mechanical issues on my truck.  Johnny was there to help me get turned around and back on the lot.  Being late in the evening and after closing they allowed me to set up my RV on the lot and spend the night until I could get a tow truck the next morning and find a rental truck to pull my RV home.  Johnny was very helpful during the whole ordeal.  They made sure I had the necessities I needed to get through the night.  The next morning Johnny came to me and offered to take me to get breakfast if I wanted.  Daryl personally stopped what he was doing to give me a ride to pick up my rental truck.\n\nThe entire experience at Bankston Motor Homes of Warrior was top notch!  I left feeling like family.  I left the lot to go spend the weekend camping to break in my new RV.  Johnny called me Sunday evening to check on me and make sure I made it home safe and that I didn't have any issues with my RV.\n\nI cannot say thank you enough, nor say enough good things about these folks!

This takes the better part of the day but insures that the customer can leave with confidence that everything is in working order. ( the prospective buyer  does not have the option to waive the inspection, it is required by the Manufacturer and Paradise RV Sales) We also like to walk thru the camper with the customer  after the pre delivery inspection to make sure the customer is satisfied before departing with their new camper.  ( this ensures that the customer has no surprises when they get home) As with any business we ask for earnest money to engage into a transaction and start the process, taking the camper off the market for sale, doing a pre delivery inspection and ordering Loan Contracts from a Bank. If  a prospective buyer refuses to sign an agreement to purchase with a minimum deposit for earnest money then we cannot move forward with a purchase.As a Company whose goal is Customer Satisfaction we Reserve The Right Not To Sale to any Prospective Buyer that Refuse to abide by our Company Policies.\nSo to all of our Customers and Non Customers Paradise RV Sales would like to take this opportunity to wish  you good luck in all of your camping adventures."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889046c6bd8ab1b:0x11963b5991c52291"}

Kay in the office was extremely knowledgeable and efficient, and had the paperwork done in a matter of minutes. I was disappointed that it was going to take at least a week to get it ready for me to pick up, but since this is our first new RV, thought maybe that's normal.\nWe scheduled to pick it up on a Saturday morning, even though that's very inconvenient according to the salesman,  planning to head off with the grand-kids on our first trip. That did not happen. It was not ready, to say the least. So much for the excitement of buying a new camper.\nIt was dirty, inside and out. Mildew streaks and a grimy film outside, cobwebs in the corners and dirt on the floors and countertops inside. Nobody even really tried to clean it up. Aside from being told repeatedly how inconvenient it is to do a delivery demo on a Saturday,  my biggest frustration at the time was the screen for the back ramp door.\nAt some point while it was sitting on the lot, the velcro adhesive had failed, so they pulled it down. That's pretty common, so I didn't think much of it when I first looked at the camper, because I assumed they'd fix that sort of thing during PDI before we picked it up. Somebody must have noticed the adhesive blobs around the doorway, because they had been peeled off to hide the mess, but the screen was wadded up and stuffed in the bottom of the closet.\nWe also found a damaged blind in the front window, the sewage cap was missing, the tongue jack handle was missing, and the the right speaker channel on the radio didn't work inside or out. The salesman tried to get me to go ahead and take it, promising to order parts, but I decided to leave it with them instead. Kudos again at this point to Kay, who  got involved and tried to find the parts we needed in other new campers on the lot so we wouldn't have to come back. No such luck, but I appreciate the effort. Disappointed, we left in hopes of picking it up the following week. That did not happen.\nThe salesman finally called me yesterday to tell me it was all fixed up and ready to go, so I took off from work early, and drove an hour back over there to pick it up. I didn't want my wife there in case there were problems, and certainly didn't want to bother the busy man on a Saturday.\nWhen I got there, we went inside to check out the new radio, etc... and nothing worked. No 12 volt power inside the camper at all. I lost every bit of my religion for a minute, but held my temper. That's a bigger deal than you may realize. They had apparently checked everything with shore power, but not the battery. After half hour or so, the tech told me he'd replaced a main wiring connector and fuse, and everything seemed to work. Cool. Maybe this customer service nightmare is over.\nI finally got my new camper home for the first time, three weeks to the day after I bought it, and decided to set it up in the yard for the wife and kids to play with, to regain some of that \"new toy\" excitement. That did not happen. What I got instead was two more hours of frustration and disappointment.\nThe remotes for the radio and outside LED light strip don't work. Another item for the long list of things somebody should have checked. A fresh battery fixed the radio remote, but the LED bar still doesn't work. All we get is the multi-color disco flashing demo mode, with no way to make it stop. I am not proud of what I had to say about that. I'll probably just put in an aftermarket strip. Or take it to Gander in Oxford.\nI have no idea what they did for last three weeks, but PDI wasn't on the schedule. That stands for Pre Delivery Inspection, by the way.\n\nYou can't give a 0 star rating, so the one gold star is for Kay. She did a great job, and seemed genuinely frustrated that things were handled so badly after the sale. To the salesman, and the owner who knew the troubles we were having and did nothing, I offer nothing but utter contempt.\n\nI do not recommend this dealer.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889b4f779ebcdd9:0xcc3f1e25165a0d70"}

I would check with them as to how old an RV they will work on.\nThey are careless of your belongings, RV, keys, etc. They put the things you want checked out in their computer but that is the last time they look at it, you have to go by and keep reminding them what they are supposed to be doing. In a bad neighborhood, they have multiple signs declaring \"Not responsible for theft or loss\". Hint. A business must do their due diligence to prevent theft and these guys do not, except for locking a fence. We simply needed some minor maintenance things done and the H2O tank & generator looked at, since we had just returned from a 3 day trip. The RV was driven on the trip without problems, and to the establishment. I went by there to check on it almost 3 weeks later because we had not heard from anyone in 10 days. RV wasn't running. Kept it over 5 weeks total & got it home - not running.\nChris and Chad separately but both immediately jump to conclusion it must be a bad alternator as the reason it is not running.  Chad owns an alternator shop. Hmmm.\nWe needed new covers & caulking done on roof. They slopped on some clear thin liquid over rotted caulk. See pictures of this. Waited on covers that had to be ordered, so Chad said. Then they had to wait on propane valve, - I found for $25 +/- online or about $65 for replacement tank & valve combo locally which is what I will be doing, and the covers $15-20 each online. They have no parts supplier, obviously. I had my son go on top to check things out as soon as we got home. Then I went up there because I thought he was mistaken. Omg. Busted covers and a new cover that had only 2 screws holding it down instead of 6! Found the other 4 stuck in the clear liquid that was slopped down the middle. Also a cigarette butt stuck in it as well.  When confronted Chris claimed he fired the guy that did it (Idk) and said he didn't know they were to replace all the covers (Idk).The inside was a mess and there was no reason, the entire RV needs cleaning!! I will never patronize the business again. We will still have to get the things on the list fixed, and prob have to repair things this placed \"fixed\".

All it needed was siding replaced on one side from some slight hail damage.  We didn\u2019t expect it to be repaired in a month - but THREE months later he had not  even ordered all the supplies!  Every time we called for the status, we got one excuse after another.   The reason we took it in January is because we figured it would take 2 or 3 months.  But when we called the other day (April 4), he said he needed to order some more siding and had no idea how long it would take!!  That was the final straw!  Maybe if he had ordered ALL the siding within a few weeks of us bringing it in JANUARY, he could have had the supplies within a month or two and we could have had our camper back by April (a VERY reasonable amount of time!). At the rate he was going, we wouldn\u2019t have had our camper back for another 3 months!!  So needless to say, we went and picked our camper up and have somebody that can have it fixed in a few weeks.   And this person is ordering the supplies and we won\u2019t even have to bring our camper until they have the supplies there and we can have it back 2 weeks later.  Wish we would have used them to begin with!!  Not only was Shafer\u2019s awful, the owner was extremely rude and unprofessional.  He never apologized, but just rudely offered excuse after excuse!!

It was a overall pleasant experience and after some haggling I feel that we got a fair price.\n\nI had found the listing through Facebook market place and drove up to Mobile to look at it. The listing stated that the only problem with the camper was that the awning needed to be replaced... easy enough fix. Before waking though the camper I did ask again if there was anything that may need to be repaired or replaced. I was assured that everything (lights, water, sewage, A/C) was in proper working order. While going through the camper and doing a full inspection I did note a few things else that needed to be fixed like an outer seal on one of the pop outs and then when the camper was hooked it up to our truck, the back right blinker was not working. When these problems were brought to their attention, it was clear that they knew about them. They were not forthcoming with the issues until I found them.\n\nThe outer seal is an easy fix, the inner seal was completely intact, and there was no water damage noted. I also plan on replacing the lights with LEDS so neither of those were dealbreakers for me. I do wish that I had been informed about it before I did my own inspection.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend going there for a fair deal, just be certain to check everything to make sure nothing was overlooked.\n\nJoe himself is younger and very kind. Him and his uncle are willing to work a good price for you. They do most of the work themselves and are quite knowledgeable on all things RV. It does seem to be a family run business and so we worked with his uncle and aunt while Joe was busy.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a536049264f15:0x2dddd9d3f3cd4669"}
