Well the radio came in with wrong parts as they had reorder that was fine.  Finally they had all they needed although they kept calling saying you need this and that we said ok.  We took my car to them and they had it 4 days.  Finally after a lot of phone calls they said it was done.  It tried to sync my phone and it did but no sound out of the speakers.  They couldn't figure out the problem so the installer promised he'd call the manufacturer Monday morning and call me.  No phone call.  I called him and got his voice mail.  No return call.  I called the shop and was told they would call as soon as he got in .  No call.  I also called Sirus to have that transferred from my other radio but they didn't hook it up.  So here I sit with a very expensive radio and CD player.  At this point the ball is in their court and I'm waiting to see what they do.

The guys truly go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied with your visit.  I've read some negative reviews, but I can't imagine anyone would be dissatisfied with going here.  I would keep in mind that this is a busy shop, and if you're wanting something installed there, you're probably going to have to make an appointment, especially on a Saturday.\n\nThe radio I bought for my S2000 was not able to be installed that day, but it was a Saturday so I was not surprised.  I ended up making an appointment for the following Saturday.  When I arrived for my appointment, we went over exactly what I ordered and they gave me an estimated time the car would be completed.  Then they called me when it was time to pick up the car.  The radio looked great and the even the dash controls worked as they were supposed to.\n\nThe first time I had window tint applied the car was a BRZ. The second car I took to them was my S2000.  Both times the tint jobs were spot on.  No bubbles could be seen when they were finished and they didn't put some random sticker under the tint for advertising.\n\nI just moved to town last year, and the shop was recommended to me by a local dealership, as they used them to tint some of their cars, and I'm glad they did.
