I asked them to clean inside the ac vents where the mold was but they didn\u2019t get cleaned  the guys said they another job to go do. I was told the air scrubber we bought was to eliminate the mold that was still in the vents and prevent new mold from growing completely. I stayed away 24 hours cause I\u2019m  sensitive to chemicals and especially mold I\u2019ve dealt with mold before and became very ill and stayed in hospital. The night I did return home I woke up at 2 am with tightness in my chest and throat irritation and was very uncomfortable had fire dept to check me out was upset about it. I googled more about the air scrubber and found some people don\u2019t do well with it and I feel I\u2019m one of them and the side effects were what I was experiencing. It\u2019s been two days and I will not stay at home. I called one of the owners David and asked them to please remove the air scrubber system it was the weekend so they were gonna charge me service call which wasn\u2019t a big deal but I wasn\u2019t even told when they did mold treatment what kind of treatment or was there mold in the ducts I feel like I\u2019m scared to be in my own home. I don\u2019t want to upset anyone But I would have liked to known. I talked to one of the owners David he was trying to make me feel better about the situation but I\u2019m thinking the air scrubber is not for us.  which was very nice but I feel like im not going to do well with a system that isn\u2019t helping me and I want to be comfortable in my home. I hope this company will make this right for us. They are very professional and have helped us in the past.

These came with a 10 year parts/labor warranty.  In 13 months, Unit A stopped cooling 3 times over several months and Climatemp was unable to effect permanent repairs.  The last time Climatemp repaired unit A, it stopped working within 18 hours.  This was after several days of disruption, no AC, and probably 10 hours of attempts to fix it.  Unit B stopped cooling at the 7-month mark and the air handler had to be replaced.  They broke the condensate pump which leaked water everywhere and didn't seal the discharge side into the main duct during the install.  In addition, I have seen several misdiagnosed issues,  unterminated wires, holes in return box, and uninsulated freon lines to name just a few issues.  My favorite was the condensate pump installed so that it blocked the door from closing to the air handler room.  The customer service is awful.  Nobody will call you back.  You have to follow up on everything yourself.  I had a no show on more than one occasion and when I called to ask where the tech was, \u201coh he\u2019s not going to be able to make it.\u201d  After unit A stopped cooling, yet again, and nearly immediately after the last attempt to fix it, I attempted to reach a final resolution with the GM David, but he never called me back.  He told me he would speak to the owner and let me know what they decided, but no call.  It would be laughable if I hadn\u2019t spent 14k on two units and was one year into a 10 year parts/labor warranty.  In the end, I never heard from him again, all while unit A was not cooling.  Ultimately, I had to get Carrier involved who thankfully switched my parts and labor warranty to another local factory authorized dealer, who has been amazing.  The new dealer fixed unit A on the first attempt, in about two hours, which was over pressurized with freon, and had been incorrectly diagnosed by Climatemp.  They provided updates through the whole process.  Then, they reconfigured unit A and B, which were never set up properly and were running inefficiently on factory default settings.  I would give anything to be able to go back and avoid ever using Climatemp, but they had such good reviews.  I discovered that A LOT of them are from their own employees.  Even the techs told me, they\u2019re told to leave five-star reviews on google and have their friends and family do the same.  Look through the reviews and you will see the same names that you hear when you call dispatch or receive an email.  The owners, and the GM leave them, as well as their family.  You will see the same names leaving reviews across every location.  Normal customers don\u2019t do that.  When bad reviews are left, you will see threats of litigation and claims of fake reviews.  Folks this company is shameful.  Please save yourself and use any number of available HVAC companies in Baldwin county.  If you have a part/labor warranty with them and you feel trapped, call Carrier.  They can and will help you.\n\n** In response to the owner's claim - the last time your technician was in my home, he was there for nearly six hours.  I loaned him my extension cords and fed him dinner.

My unit, which I\u2019ll admit is old, but it still works\u2026 Was not cooling as well as usual. This has happened previously and it needed Freon. So I called  Climatemp to come out\u2026 I knew they like to try to upsell your unit but I had them come out anyway. I had called and they told me there was an $89 service/diagnostic fee. So long story short\u2026 The guy came out opened the unit and within 10 minutes told my husband we needed a brand new unit that it would cost @ $3000 just to fix the leak. I told him no thank you we would get another opinion that I was not spending $10,000 today on a new unit. He then asked me \u201c What\u2019s the right price to get you to say yes to a new unit today?\u201d Climatemp keeps your credit card on file and within 45 minutes charged my account $189\u2026 For nothing! Within that same amount of time I had had another local company come out they had already fixed my unit, my house was cool and only charged me $150. Climatetemp does not tell you that they charge you $25 per 15 minutes they are there\u2026 If you do the math that is $1.66 PER MINUTE!! We would definitely not have let the technician take his 10 minute cigarette  break in our front yard if we had known we were paying that per minute!! They were there for 15 minutes, just wanted to sell us a new $8000 unit and told us ours could not be fixed for less than $3000, did not give us accurate information on charges, never left us an invoice and still won\u2019t give us one, just charged my card. Terrible way to do business!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1576124876471, "text": "Jessica, we are sorry you feel that way after further investigation yes your unit was very old and had multiple R22 Freon leaks in it. The laws require us to fix and repair the leak before we put r-22 Freon back in this is a costly repair especially in your case where a whole coil was going to have to be replaced to fix your unit. So yes a coil plus recharging your unit with r-22 is a very costly repair. You say you paid 150.00 and you were cool again by another company but did they actually do you justice by putting some Freon in knowing its going to leak back out and you will be calling them right back out. We also noticed you said you already had them out once before. So as you can see your having to call someone out every few months to charge your unit mean while when it is running low on Freon it is working double time and costing you double time just to operate the system. It sounds like as much as you are having to pay for a very inefficient  system in your home with multiple service calls a year you could have purchased a new efficient system with just the savings you would have on your utilities each month not to mention all the 150.00 dollar service call. So did Climatemp really do a dis justice or where you just putting a band aid on something that really needed stitches to buy you more time. Climatemp charges by the quarter hr. Which can save you tons of money many other companies charge a 1hr minimum and flat rate prices that would have cost you much more. We are truly sorry for any inconvenience to you or your family but in the same note here at Climatemp we believe in fixing things right and not putting a band on something that will end up costing you much more in the long run.

That's where my good opinion ends. The sales person said the new unit would be eligible for an energy rebate - turned out it wasn't. When I brought the issue up with the owner, he was unhelpful and arrogant.  A few months later, they missed the included maintenance appointment because they claimed not to have my phone number (which was clearly on the paperwork) and when I brought it to their attention, they said it expired and wouldn't honor it. From the start, my summer bills have average about $50 more despite being a bigger more efficient unit. When I had another company service it, they discovered the electrical wiring was not done properly and needed to be redone plus the unit was short 2.5lbs of refrigerant.  Since there were no leaks, it probably hadn't been filled properly from the start (which explains the higher bills). I give them two stars because they came out on a weekend but I would never trust them to install a new HVAC.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1588791243282, "text": "Please give us a call we would love to help 251-968-6006"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a1b95dfc08dd9:0x46ab285987648b9a"}

My husband found this business through the Internet and he contacted them, and they quickly responded. Jacob, one of their technicians, showed up at our house 30 minutes later!  He was able to repair it by replacing a part. He was honest and professional. And, it was affordable to get it repaired!  We were very pleased!  \ud83d\ude00", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1622662415149, "text": "We appreciate your 5-star rating!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888915bfffffffff:0x62a3539e3e6fd484"}

My wife met with Cason and we went into wanting multiple options which i thought were all fairly presented and well explained without any pressure of which to go with. I have a close friend who worked for many years for both Trane and Carrier with many of the dealers throughout Birmingham. He gave me a list of 3 companies he would have out to his home personally. Skelton was one of those, another company that i liked very much, and then one we didnt have a great experience on the quote with. Between Skelton and the other competitor, although Skeltons price was higher we were sold by the labor warranty and some of the other written guarantees, along with the rec from our friend. Installation - I believe it was Mark, my wife was the one on site - went way better than i could have imagined. We arranged last minute to have the unit moved to a new location. All of the work was very well done. I had an idea in my head of what \"the aftermath\" should have looked like and the equipment involved in the move and all that, and i probably would have been satisfied with a lot less. Its obviously a lot of money for most families, so I was bound to have some mix of buyers remorse and hesitation about whether or not we'd gone with the right people However, when i got home and saw the quality of the work, how neatly and efficiently and professionally everything was done, i immediately felt entirely confident in our decision and knew we had some true professionals out at the house. I think its the first time in my life ive spent that much money on something and dont have any regrets or second guessing about who we chose to spend it with. Kudos to both Cason and Mark's teams.

This was my first time to have to call out on the weekend because my AC went out. It was this past weekend in the middle of a storm with extremely heavy winds and rain. I could not believe that I was able to get someone the same day but was even more amazed that they responded in about an hour. They are always polite, extremely careful of surroundings by wearing shoe covers,etc. after checking my inside unit he went out in the storm, I offered an umbrella but he didn\u2019t need it. In a few minutes I saw him walk to his truck. I thought he was writing a bill so I asked how much. He came to the door and showed me that my breaker was burned up and how much hot it was. It would burn your hand if you held it. I was surprised he had a breaker for my unit and was able to install it so quickly. The charge for the service call, travel, weekend inconvenience, repair and parts was less than I paid for a service call in my last state. Donnie was so knowledgeable, professional and fast that I couldn\u2019t begin to give him enough stars. I said the first time I used Hansen that I would never use anyone else. This was definitely a great find. Hsnsen\u2019s Is by far the best company I have dealt with. I have already began advertising to my community how great they are. I am definitely a customer for life.

Our building contractor recommended Island Air-Air Conditioning and Heating, Gulf Shores, AL. My husband and I previously lived in several homes with HVAC problems stemming from poor design and installations. We knew we wanted to avoid those with new construction.\n\nI initially met with Rob Barnas of Island Air to explain our HVAC desires. Rob and Chris designed a plan to address the \"wants & needs\" of our system. It's very easy to install flexible ducts improperly, but Eddie and the men ran the ducts and attached the air handlers with great care.\n\nNew HVAC systems are very expensive. I did not want to buy a new system and suffer the same issues that we had to pay to have repaired in previous houses. So, throughout the construction process I asked dozens of questions.  I'm sure this was tiresome for Island Air, but they were very patient with me. Honestly, how can anyone be expected to properly operate and care for a system unless they understand how it's supposed to work? Hahahaha. Also, I wanted to understand the system while I could still see the components. Our drywall is not up yet. We are now 4 months into construction, so not far enough along to have thermostats installed or have the system turned on. However, we are enough along for me to say I am happy this far with the work done by Island Air of Gulf Shores, AL. I will try to post again after we move in to give everyone a final report on how it feels to live in an HVAC system built by Island Air.\n\nPS. In case you are wondering. I am not related by blood or personal connections to anyone at Island Air and have received no discounts or other incentives for posting this review.\nD.

The initial job was well done.  I was happy with the work that I entered a service agreement for my upstairs unit. In 2016 my trust with the company was severely damaged when the AC tech charged me for the part that was still under warranty and I had to call them on it.  To the company credit, they did \"refund\" me with the credit on the next repair job in the spring of 2017.  I paid the invoice without examining it carefully as I should have done.  Two months in late May of 2017, I received a letter from the Baldwin County small claim court saying that Island  Air is suing me for nonpayment.  I called them and the manager told me that all this can go away if I pay them at that point.  I went home and dug up all my paperwork and found out that they overcharged me once again on the visit in spring 2017.  I faxed them my receipts and called them the next day and advised them not to go ahead with the lawsuit because they will not win in court.  They rescinded the the court claim and offered me a six month maintenance complimentary service for my inconvenience,  but after all the shenanigans I have to walk away.  The trust factor is no longer there.  I waited for four months to write this review to make sure that my emotion is in check and to give them a fair review about my experience with the company.   Take home points?  Save your receipts and you need to know about the warranty your AC system.  Always go check the charges line by line and make sure to keep this company honest.

I have actually had service workers tell me directly that they would not service one of my clients\u2019 homes due to their address.  It is heartbreaking.

They went so far as to tell us they don't money in warranty repairs, even when we had an extended warranty for 13 years. They told me to call someone else to come and do the repairs. The catch in all this was that our extended warranty covered both parts and labor. If we had to go to a different Trane dealer they would not cover the labor costs, but the parts were at no charge. I read several good reviews about Carden and decided to go with them. Our repairman was by far one of the most professional, kind and courteous people we have ever had the pleasure of working with. They gave us an estimate before hand and I had already checked the average labor costs to change the compressor out and their rate was very reasonable. Upon finishing the job and it came time to settle up with and to my amazement they came over five hundred dollars cheaper than the original estimate. HVAC has been running around the clock to keep our house at 62 degrees around the clock. I can't tolerate heat due to a medical condition. They called us a few days later to just in in to make sure it's still running great.\n\nIt's now over a month since they fixed and I got an email just to check on us, which I truly appreciated.

Once again we are sorry for not being able to return your call during this hectic time and are happy that you were able to solve your issue. Please accept a free maintenance check up on us.

The smell was intermittent so I wasn't sure if there was an issue. The first time Sonny came out & took care of the downstairs gas smell.  A few hours after he left the air purifier wasn't working.  Eddie came to our house and fixed and also noticed the \"dryer\" was installed backwards on the both units.

Luckily, we had a warranty through Old Republic, which paid for a replacement unit. Unfortunately, however, the company that Old Republic required us to use for installation was 5 Star Heating and Air Conditioning out of Foley, AL.\n\nOver the past year, we have experienced several issues with our new unit not cooling the house properly. About two months ago, we came home to soggy carpet and buckled wood floors due to the drain pipe for our unit overflowing. My father came by to take a look at the unit and noticed that the \"Safe-T-Switch float valve\", which cuts the unit off if the drain pipe clogs and fills up, was installed ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE UNIT, rendering it completely useless.\n\nWe called 5 Star and they did come out to the house and move the valve to the correct side without charging us, which we felt was the least they could do since their poor workmanship was the cause of this incident. Over the past few weeks, we noticed that our outside unit would randomly cut off during the day, making the house unbearable to be inside. We called 5 Star, and they let us know that it would be $100 to come out and take a look at it. At this point, I decided to call another company to come look at it rather than paying 5 Star.\n\nThe other Service Man came out and took a look at it and noticed that the inside of the pipe that the float valve was attached to was clogged with sealant, preventing the flow of water. (See attached photos) I'm no plumber, but I can tell you that when you put sealant inside the female coupling, and push the male part in, the sealant has nowhere to go but inside the pipe, which prevents the drain pipe from being able to drain water. He replaced the drain pipe, and put the float valve in the correct place, and amazingly, our A/C unit works like new!\n\nI will be sure to let everyone know how much money my \"no-cost warranty replacement\" A/C unit has cost me thanks to 5 Star's sub-par work.\n\nPhoto 1 - Crazy Straw like drain pipe from 5 Star\nPhoto 2 - Sealant inside pipe (photo taken after I punched a large portion of the sealant out of the pipe)\nPhoto 3 - New drain pipe installed by another {competent} A/C Repair company", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfTmZE3Bd42fClrv34oV45AuBHNZQe-gBb-dcw=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1534874112513, "text": "Dane, we are sorry to hear that you were not satisfied with our options for maintenance.
