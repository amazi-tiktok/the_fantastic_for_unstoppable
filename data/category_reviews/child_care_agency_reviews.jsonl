She was bed ridden for a couple of months due to the pain, and after the fracture healed remained bed ridden and on oxygen due to progressing congestive heart failure.  This lasted almost 6 months until she passed, with the last 4 months under in-home hospice care.  My mom lived with me, since she (and the rest of the family) did not want her last days to be in a nursing home.  I am a single man and with the constant care my mom required, I could not handle it on my own, I needed caregiving help.  I contracted out 60 hours every week for caregiving and I took the other 128 hours myself.\n\nI contracted with BrightStar based on recommendations from friends, and I was not disappointed.   BrightStar provided qualified care givers, and if mom and/or did not relate well with a particular care giver, BrightStar would provide a different one.  We eventually evolved to a core set of 2 regular care givers, loved by my mom and I,  covering all 60 hours per week.  I don\u2019t know if other companies would be this flexible and supportive.  If a regular caregiver could not come, BrightStar would notify me and fill the gap, so that I could always count on a caregiver at my home at the planned schedule.  Knowing that a caregiver will be there, rain or shine, is a major consideration when determining if you want to hire a known private individual or a company with lots of caregivers.  Additionally, BrightStar schedulers, nurse, business office personnel were always a pleasure to work with and very supportive of mom and I during these trying time.  BrightStar may not be the cheapest, but you can count on them, so you just set your hours to what you can afford.  I highly recommend BrightStar, and if the need for caregiving arises for me in the future, I will be calling them.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862691000000001:0x6ce406a91cbe1e64"}

In the beginning, it was great! It was what I as a single mother desperately needed. It went downhill fast.\n\nThere were many times that the meal I sent with her was not used and they started charging me for the extra meal. I had to work at putting a stop to this. The meals, at least in the beginning, were told to me as being \"organically catered\" but that was clearly not true or had fallen away pretty quickly.\n\nAt the time, we were vegetarian - which was on her paperwork and discussed with the owner. But I learned from my reluctant daughter, who was worried she would be in trouble, that there were many times she would be required to finish her whole meal to get dessert, which included chicken nuggets. That is a ridiculous position to put a small child in.\n\nWhen I reached out via email to discuss the issue, one of the co-owners - Joey - essentially said I was lying and said no child is ever forced to eat something they don't want and did not investigate it or properly address the issue. Funny, because he wasn't even there most of the time. I still have those emails to this day.\n\nThere was also the issue of her meds not being given to her and being routinely \"forgotten.\"\n\nDebra-someone rose to being in charge and she was a very cold and rude person. Despite always paying my bill on time and being one of the original customers, she began requiring me to prepay - something which other parents I spoke with did not have to do. But interestingly enough, it was after I had raised concerns about the food issue and then the medicine issue.\n\nAt one point, I had to be out of work for a month because my daughter had caught from the daycare strains of influenza, strep, staph, and had a full blown case of MONO. I had never heard of anyone having mono younger than a high-schooler! It was made obvious then that they do not clean well enough.\n\nThe last and final straw was the lack of care and protection from the teachers. Despite being the older kid most of the time, she would get hit a bunch by the younger ones. She would tell the teachers who in turn wouldn't do anything, or she would be the one who got in trouble. I tried coaching her on how to protect herself and what to say, but she had a huge fear around doing anything and getting in trouble. No matter what she did, she said she got in trouble when she tried to stop from being hit or complained about it.\n\nI pulled her out and never took her back. She's almost 13 and still talks about how glad and relieved she is to never have to be at daycare. And sometimes I learn new things about her time there, and I overall regret that she spent any time there since it has been such a shadow in her mind.\n\nThis place can't even do the basics.
