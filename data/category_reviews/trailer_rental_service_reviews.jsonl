I scheduled an appointment and dropped my vehicle off at 7:00 am on my way to work and was assured that it would be completed by 4:00 pm when I came back.  It was almost 7:00 pm before they were complete, so I sat there for 3 hours waiting.  When they were complete they told me that I would need to come back and get a ball for the hitch since they didn't have an that fit the hitch in stock.  This defeated the purpose of needing a hitch before the weekend, but I borrowed a ball from a neighbor.  When I hooked the trailer up, I noticed the lights were not coming on. Something was wrong with the electrical.\n\n3 days later I called and they said to come in and pick up the ball.  When I arrived they said that they were mistaken and did not have one.  I mentioned that the electrical was faulty, but they could not look at it that day since the trailer hitch guy was not there.\n\n1 month later I called(they never called me back) and was told they had a ball that fit and I picked it up.  Once again, they said no one was there to look at my electrical issue.\n\nA few months later I called to make an appointment to have the hitch fixed.  Their phone disconnected me three times and I gave up after wasting 30 minutes on hold.\n\nWhen I go by the location and finally make an appointment, i'm told it will cost me upwards of $100 to have it repaired since it only had a 30 day warranty.  They said there was no record of me having ever mentioned the issue before.\n\nOverall, this location has awful customer service.

The first time when I moved to this area I dropped off my UHaul equipment here and a middle aged Army Veteran greeted me and helped with the process of the return. He also helped me to figure out the area and gave me some local information which was very helpful. Now when I moved from this area I picked up my UHaul from Quality Used Automotive and I would not recommend picking up from that location but I had to unfortunately and the UHaul equipment dolly and pads were not in the truck and it was incredibly dirty. So I took the truck and drove only 4 minutes back to this initial UHaul location where I had another amazing experience. The General Manager, Clay Reed JR, met me in the store and I told him what was going on. He helped me get a dolly and pads as well as offered to clean my truck for me free of charge. His kindness, professionalism, and overall customer care is the entire reason UHaul still has my business.

It was such a bad experience that I will never use U-Haul again.  On Dec. 30, 2015 I reserved a pickup truck for rental the following day at the location at 3713 Governor's Drive in Huntsville.  I was scheduled to pick this vehicle up at 11:30am.  I showed up a few minutes early and the location was empty.  A few minutes later, Tammy, the General Manager comes in from the back and informs me that my reservation has been moved to the location across town at 4400 University Drive in Huntsville.  I needed to have the truck in a certain location to pick up some furniture by noon of that day and this was already placing me behind schedule considering that I was never notified in advance of this change.  A few minutes later I arrive at the location on University Drive to attempt my pick up.  While waiting in a line of 5 people, I start to become stressed because it is already 11:45am.  The General Manager at this location, Paulette Boehlke, informs me that it doesn't matter when I was scheduled to pick up this truck.  She states, that I will have to wait in line while she continues taking peoples orders and then going outside to fit them for their truck.  I am a bit in a panic because this is not what I expected considering that I had reserved the truck for a specific pick up time for a reason.  I finally left the location because I could not see it fit to pay U-Haul for the poor job they had done with having my reservation ready for pick up that morning.  All this especially considering they have a sign in office guaranteeing that they will have the truck you order at the right location at the right time available for you.  I cancelled my order with U-Haul and was able to reserve a truck with another moving company.  Tammy, from the first location called while I was on the way to pick up the new truck and tried to get me to come by and pick up a truck that was now there at her location on Governor's Drive.  She claimed that the reason I couldn't pick up the truck at the scheduled time and scheduled location was because the call center had double booked that time.  The pick up that was sitting outside her location when I was their earlier, she said, had been left by someone that had not left their keys with her.  Either way, the whole thing was crap.

I got to my appointment 30 minutes early to give plenty of time for a 90 minute install. I had to call and get someone at 1:30 to pick me up after the installation couldn't be completed in time and had to get another ride back to your establishment. During the install a bracket was removed that was not part of the written instructions. Three factory bolts were removed from that bracket and only one was reinstalled. I picked the bolts up off the floor. The manager Mr. Hall ended up giving me $50 off the price but, made sure the shop got the full install money thus rewarding themselves for a job poorly done. He accused me of raising my voice and I apologized telling him I am hard or hearing and wear hearing aids showing him one. He then stated he was done talking with me and tried to charge me for priority shipping when another clerk had removed the shipping because of late delivery. I informed him of that and he decided he'd best call his employee at home to verify. So, more time waiting... I am very unhappy with your operation. It took an hour and a half to finally settle with Mr. Hall and get out the door with him going into his office and refusing to come out after it had been finished and was waiting on me to pick it up...   Finally, at the end of the transaction I thanked him and stretched out my hand and he refused to shake it. Mr. Hall has a chip on his shoulder that needs to be challenged. I remain unhappy with your service. In the past I have rented storage space for 6 months, rented vehicles to move but that business will go elsewhere. I will be needing storage again but another company that can do the job correctly, that doesn't have an attitude that they were doing me a favor by poor quality work...that other company will get my business.

It was such a bad experience that I will never use U-Haul again.  On Dec. 30, 2015 I reserved a pickup truck for rental the following day at the location at 3713 Governor's Drive in Huntsville.  I was scheduled to pick this vehicle up at 11:30am.  I showed up a few minutes early and the location was empty.  A few minutes later, Tammy, the General Manager comes in from the back and informs me that my reservation has been moved to the location across town at 4400 University Drive in Huntsville.  I needed to have the truck in a certain location to pick up some furniture by noon of that day and this was already placing me behind schedule considering that I was never notified in advance of this change.  A few minutes later I arrive at the location on University Drive to attempt my pick up.  While waiting in a line of 5 people, I start to become stressed because it is already 11:45am.  The General Manager at this location, Paulette Boehlke, informs me that it doesn't matter when I was scheduled to pick up this truck.  She states, that I will have to wait in line while she continues taking peoples orders and then going outside to fit them for their truck.  I am a bit in a panic because this is not what I expected considering that I had reserved the truck for a specific pick up time for a reason.  I finally left the location because I could not see it fit to pay U-Haul for the poor job they had done with having my reservation ready for pick up that morning.  All this especially considering they have a sign in office guaranteeing that they will have the truck you order at the right location at the right time available for you.  I cancelled my order with U-Haul and was able to reserve a truck with another moving company.  Tammy, from the first location called while I was on the way to pick up the new truck and tried to get me to come by and pick up a truck that was now there at her location on Governor's Drive.  She claimed that the reason I couldn't pick up the truck at the scheduled time and scheduled location was because the call center had double booked that time.  The pick up that was sitting outside her location when I was their earlier, she said, had been left by someone that had not left their keys with her.  Either way, the whole thing was crap.  I intend to never use U-Haul's services again and will inform people of this issue in the Huntsville locations.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b6847403349:0x2e03344eb6e6a43e"}

Today, I took my vehicle in for a tow hitch at 8am.  It was only supposed to take a few hours.  It ended up taking them until 2pm to finish it, because they kept taking the installer off the job to handle the crowd.  You should have a separation of concerns when running a business.  That installer should've been able to focus on his work instead of having constant distractions.  In that time, he managed to somehow run my battery dead.  After I finally hooked a 5x8 trailer up, I found out that the hitch was slanted towards the ground, making it impossible to use a trailer.  I ended up having to have the movers who were moving most of my stuff take everything, but the stuff they couldn't take (i.e. aerosols, propane, gas cans, etc) which caused my move to take longer and cost more.  My muffler also was rattling against the hitch which was very annoying.  I finally got to my destination and had the hitch uninstalled, and and a full refund was made.  However, the installer at my new destination found damages made to my vehicle from the initial install.  So, now I\"m going to have to take it to my dealership for repairs, which will be getting paid for by UHaul's claim agency.  If only all the time that I put into this whole ordeal could be compensated too!\n\nMy 2nd issue was that my calls to check the status were being routed to their corporate office who kept claiming they were unable to give any status on my install, and they discouraged me from directing my call to the location, claiming they probably wouldn't answer.  Corporate customer service sucks basically.  What they should've done was figure out what was going on with it instead of just leaving me out in the dark, which basically forced me to drive back down there and wait on it.\n\nAlso, don't buy boxes from these people.  In order to get the \"discounted\" rate, you have to buy them by the bundle.  I put quotes on \"discounted\", because Home Depot sells them individually for the same price...actually, cheaper.

Still haven't spoke with the manager at this facility and I thinks it's because they know they messed up. So for 3 weeks I have been given the run around and still no district manager or nothing. I will say this how ever it turn out from thus point I WILL NOT NOR WILL I RECOMMEND THIS UHAUL COMPANY TO ANYONE! Now the lie is it's only if you are moving one way (BUT WHO MOVES OUT OF STATE AND PUT THERE THINGS IN A STORAGE IT MAKES NO DENSE AT ALL!!!!!) Save your time and money and go to another place. The manager at the location up the street is worse his name is Antonio. Don't know why any of these people got into customer service cause clearly they are not cut out for this job. They say you pay for what you get so buyer beware this is what I got lesson learned that's for sure!!!!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918eb1f009cb7:0x3d26fcb7b86b46e9"}

Hours stated that they close at 4pm and I had called earlier to notify them that I was dropping the truck off that day and to verify that they had room for the dropoff of the big trunk. The app wouldn't locate the location of the uhaul place so we were unable to checkout through the app. We dropped the keys off in the 24 hour box and drove back to a northern state to finish packing up what didn't fit in the 26 foot. We got a 15 foot truck, loaded it up and returned back down south. I noticed that the 26 foot reservation did not close out online. I called and talked with guy over the phone. He said that he had closed it out, but I told him that it wasn't showing as closed out. They closed out the 26 foot uhaul on the last day of reservation at  the exact hour that it was due back. The store isn't even open that day.  I received a notification for tolls for the 26 uhaul yet I picked up a 15 foot uhaul the same day in Virginia. There is no way to be in two places at once. I mileage on both trucks should have been the same as they were driven to the same location.  The 26 foot uhaul had additional mileage on it from somewhere else, but because the date that the reservation was closed out on I had to pay for the tolls. The whole reason I made a big deal about constantly calling uhaul was because I needed a copy of the receipt so that I can get reimbursed for the move due to work.

DO NOT BUY!\nWe purchased a shed 3 yrs ago. You can even call the business directly and their hold messages promise top quality craftsmenship. We told them the day we bought it that we were purchasing this to pay floor, put walls, heating and air, and create an apartment type space for my son. We were reassured and \u201csold\u201d on the quality promised and the guarantee of it they stood by with their warranty. Since buying the building for $10,000 cash 3 yrs ago, we have had two leaking doors everytime it rains for 3 straight yrs. we have utilized the warranty each time. After the 4th or 5th time of having them try and fix it (we were promised a FIX not an attempt at a fix) we said we wanted our money back. We cannot lay floor over wet floor to be ruined. The entire operation has been halted for three whole YEARS waiting on this promised fixed. We were told to give them one more chance by completely replacing the inward swinging doors with outward swinging doors. If they did not fix it, they promised they would discuss with me a possible refund or partial refund. Even a 50% refund would allow us to have a porch made. At this point however, a 50% refund keeps me connected to a crooked company. They replaced the doors and the next rain came and it was still leaking. We took pictures each time of course. So I called in about the promised conversation about a refund. I was transferred to a lady who took my number and would call me back, and I never heard from her. In the mean time they were sending out (same repair man each time) the repair man to \u201cfix\u201d it for the 5th ish time. So he did, well I just went out there and it\u2019s a soggy soaking wet mess again. This will be the SECOND time since what they called their \u201clast resort\u201d by replacing the doors. They basically told me if that didn\u2019t fix it nothing would. So I have a 10,000 box in my yard. Even the mattresses we placed out there are now ruined from the leaking doors and had to be thrown away. I\u2019m unable to use it. I called again today and they wanted to come \u201cfix\u201d it even tho they told me they had done everything they can. These floors in my opinion need to be replaced now by the doors if they\u2019re going to keep it leaking. I didn\u2019t pay for floors exposed to rain for 3 solid yrs. I asked again anout a refund and was told because the building is as old as it is, they can\u2019t do anything about it. Well, it\u2019s only as old as it is because they kept telling me they\u2019d fix it. I\u2019ve been kind and patient for 3 YRS!

As soon as he handed me the truck, I took a picture of the odometer. On the contract, he had mileage out that was lower than what I saw before I started moving. The mileage out should be the odometer mileage when the truck is handed to the customer, not the mileage that may be on their records when the truck was returned by a previous customer.\n\nAlso, unknown to me, there was a dolly in the back that I had not even reserved.  I saw it only when I opened the back to load my stuff.  I was surprised, to say the least and wondered if I will be billed for it. Guess what?  I was billed for it even though I had not used it. And how did he know that I had used it? When I called this morning, he told me that the plastic tab that was attached to the dolly was broken. When I try to assure him that I had not even touched the dolly, his response was rude and something like \"we have a lot of customers who say they didn't use the dolly but they actually did.\" In short, he had just accused me of lying!  My question is: why was the dolly even there in the first place? I had not reserved it!  And if there was something in the back of the truck, he should have opened the back and shown it to me.  I would have asked for the dolly to be taken out. Further, how do I know that tab wasn't broken before the truck keys were handed to me? So, this was a clear case of an attempt to cheat a customer.

My sister went into the store to complete the very routine process of accessing her storage unit. However, unbeknownst to her or anyone else, they were full and instead rerouted her reservation to Georgia. This information was not even gathered until they second attempt to receive help from the desk, for the first time we spoke to their general manager, Tavon Scott, who was at the moment in no mood to do his job. As soon as he saw that our last name did not come up in the computer, he looked at us as if we were crazy and then proceeded to profusely rid himself of all blame (\"it was the call center\") and yelled at us for becoming frustrated at the fact that we seemingly had no storage. He was completely unwilling to make up for the fault of his company in any capacity and did nothing but sit there and act annoyed at our frustration. I dropped by one last time to use the restroom and I could hear them quoting us and laughing at our situation until they saw I had come in. I was so disgusted at their attitude about their job that I marched up to the desk to get Mr. Scott's full name to write in this report, to which he replied, laughing \"You can just look up my name if you need it.\" I replied \"take care\" and he replied \"oh I will take care\" and continued to murmur something under his breath to the amusement of his coworkers. I've never held an official job to this date, but if I talked half as rudely to any customer as they did to us, I'd expect to be canned on the spot, and that's exactly what I wish upon this man, Mr. Scott. I'd equate this crew to a group of shiftless, gawky teenagers who are too immature to own up to their own shortcomings. Simply put, these insolent fools don't know how to represent a company and don't appreciate the name stitched onto their shirt. They've made a decision to be bad at what they do.

It is climate controlled and therefore is always a nice escape from the terrible heat during the summer, as well as a guarantee that the items in your unit will never be exposed to unsuitable temperatures regardless of the outside weather. Additionally, they have implemented a motion detection system connected to their lights in an effort to conserve energy.

After a period of time during which the system detects no movement, the lights turn off and the building goes dark.

Due to demand, we've tried to include a few more options to choose from at different price points and conditions. I went over the options and pros and cons of each. Unlike our competitors, we list our prices on our website in full disclosure for everyone to see. We do not always have the fiberglass containers available, and in turn, are not on the website; however, if we do have them available, they will have the price on a tag on it, in our Prattville yard. The fiberglass container you were viewing on the yard had the price tag on it, in yellow. We're being more transparent than most companies that are open to haggling. As a family owned business, we do all of the deliveries and answer the phones in the field, under whatever the conditions are at the time. While we do try to explain what we have; unfortunately, we're not always in an office setting for a comprehensive run down for every call we take. While we do sell some of the containers we have, the majority of our business is commercial rental. We know you have options to purchase containers elsewhere and completely respect that. I'm sorry that we were unable to do business, but wish you the best ahead."}, "gmap_id": "0x888e8e3f938f5abd:0xfb8dc7c14229a9a3"}

Not sure what prices you are comparing ours to or what Upperhand is in Montgomery. Unlike our competitors, our prices for the containers is clearly marked on the website and are not near $4000 each for standard 20' or 40' units. Other companies typically don't advertise the sales price online. Unlike national chains, since this is a family business, there is a lot of work that goes into maintaining our units--including repainting, repairing rust or damage, ensuring the decking inside is intact and so on. Others may sell you whatever they have on the lot in whatever condition it may be in from numerous construction job sites. We try to explain all of that over the phone. Because we are owner operators, in many cases, we answer the phone in the field while delivering units. As far as monthly rental goes, we're on par and in many cases cheaper than most companies in this business, including factoring in delivery cost to the site. When shopping for containers to own, make sure whoever you call, gives you full detail on delivery cost, as well as an assessment of the condition of the unit you will be purchasing, including how long it has been since it has been serviced, and what type of maintenance they do on their containers. We'd be more than happy to show you or anyone else the containers we have in person for a complete walkthrough of what you are getting to understand what it is like to own one of these units and what maintenance you will be looking at while owning one. If anyone is interested in renting the units, which is the majority of our business, our containers speak for themselves when put next to other units. Once again, sorry for your experience. We take a lot of pride in our business and our product and sorry if that didn't translate on our call. We wish you all the best ahead."}, "gmap_id": "0x888e8e3f938f5abd:0xfb8dc7c14229a9a3"}
