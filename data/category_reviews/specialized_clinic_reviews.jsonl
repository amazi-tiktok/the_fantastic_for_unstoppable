Personally, if you are considering this place, I would just run like H3LL.  I had symptoms of acid reflux and had an ENT confirm what I thought it was.  I asked to get an endo done just to ensure my throat did not have Barrett's.  They referred me for the procedure and one of the female doctor's performed the endo.  Prior to this I had never met this doctor.  I explained my acid reflux and she said it could be my gallbladder since I had a child 1.5 years prior.  She recommended an ultrasound and hyda scan.  I went in for both and it was found that I did have a gallstone.  The hyda scan was normal.  The gastro doc immediately referred me to a surgeon to have my gallbladder removed.  I was blown away!  I had never had any typical gallbladder attacks or pain.  After doing more research I found out that having your gallbladder removed can actually cause bile reflux due to the constant free flow of bile into your system once the gallbladder is removed and the bile has no where else to go.  This doctor could not even read details of my ultra sound so I had to rely on some random doctor (over the phone) to tell me that yes, I have a rather large stone.  This female gastro doc never made any follow up appointment with me.  I immediately canceled the surgery.  I have since discussed this decision with other doctors (ENT and family doctor) and they agree with my decision.  My one gallstone while big is not currently causing typical symptoms.  There is absolutely no guarantee that removal of my gallbladder will fix the acid reflux.  And, recently, my acid reflux has been manageable with a proper clean (and green) diet. Folks, after doing much research, I am convinced that probably millions of Americans have gallstones.  Why?  Diet, it's that simple.  Our diet is just too high in fat, salt, and sugar amongst other things.  A lot of people have gallstones without even knowing UNLESS they have a gallbladder attack that lands them in the ER (or in my case was found just by chance).  In my opinion, gallbladder pain and recurrent attacks are reasons to remove the gallbladder.  Yes, you can live without your gallbladder but you can also live without your arm.  Your body functions better with both so unless you are having issues, think really hard about whether it's worth losing an organ.  In very rare cases, gallbladder disease in the form of stones can lead to major illnesses like cancer.  However, IF you drastically improve your diet, I do believe you can control your destiny.  Remember, everything begins in the gut!  Obviously, I am not a medical doctor, so these opinions are my own.  My last words of advice: get 2 or 3 opinions and remember that doctors are in the business to make money.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a680bf0c7d7:0x1d6cad2459ca0d12"}

This is, without question- the WORST patient care experience I have ever had! The doctor is completely detached from the patient care process. She is a condescending narcissistic clock watcher. There was no information about my supplies prescription given to me. I am ashamed to say that I waited 6 weeks to reach out to the sleep center to find out where my supplies were-but then I was told who the supplier was and that I had to make contact with them and go get the supplies.
