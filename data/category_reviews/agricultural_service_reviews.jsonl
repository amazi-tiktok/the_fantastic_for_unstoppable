His sons Zachary, Miles and Cole play a major part in this well oiled machine as they each have a part in most every install.

I really didn\u2019t know what to do, so I called DSLD and asked if they could come by and get this monster back on the pedestal.

When I called Zach Sharp, ( a great young man by the way) to ask what I owed them, he absolutely refused to take a cent, saying it only took a few minutes and I could not get them to take anything for their time and trouble.

Working with DSLD owner David Sharp was a pleasure. He responded to my inquiry within a day and met with me within a week to discuss options for landscape and drainage work on my Highland Lakes home--the $100 up-front consult fee was a worthwhile investment, and was applied to to the cost of my project. Work included expanding, grading, and sodding (Zoiysa) the backyard, which included construction of a 70 foot concave curved/step-graduated wall, installing a new drainage system along and under the driveway, and adding an external sump pump well and pump to move water from a tied-in roof downspout and overhead deck drain. DSLD completed the project in approx. 2 weeks.  Good communications throughout, with detail breakdown of proposal costs.  Definately recommend.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88893e19213388e5:0xeb3f3999b720c596"}

The lady was hard of hearing so I took a deep breath and repeated it slowly. She didn't understand what I was asking so I tried to reword it. I am a teacher so I am used to having to repeat myself a dozen or so times without it phasing my tone which I was trying my best to keep calm. After the fifth or sixth time of restating she hanged up.  Today I called again to ask what happens to the plants at retailers such as Walmart. I figured it was a straight ford question easier than the last time I called but no I was wrong. I was asking because one of my local retailers had a person who said they just throw them away if no one takes them home. I wanted to ask a follow-up question but when I called the same lady pickup at first I didn't recognize the voice I figured it was a wrong number the way she was talking but when I started my name I asked if it's Connie plants. The lady is older but her tone is disrespectful. She talks the way someone rolls there eyes and I am sure she did when I asked the way she replied. I didn't even want to finish my asking a question the way she talked not to mention the drivers are careless.
