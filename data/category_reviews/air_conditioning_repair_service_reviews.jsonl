I asked them to clean inside the ac vents where the mold was but they didn\u2019t get cleaned  the guys said they another job to go do. I was told the air scrubber we bought was to eliminate the mold that was still in the vents and prevent new mold from growing completely. I stayed away 24 hours cause I\u2019m  sensitive to chemicals and especially mold I\u2019ve dealt with mold before and became very ill and stayed in hospital. The night I did return home I woke up at 2 am with tightness in my chest and throat irritation and was very uncomfortable had fire dept to check me out was upset about it. I googled more about the air scrubber and found some people don\u2019t do well with it and I feel I\u2019m one of them and the side effects were what I was experiencing. It\u2019s been two days and I will not stay at home. I called one of the owners David and asked them to please remove the air scrubber system it was the weekend so they were gonna charge me service call which wasn\u2019t a big deal but I wasn\u2019t even told when they did mold treatment what kind of treatment or was there mold in the ducts I feel like I\u2019m scared to be in my own home. I don\u2019t want to upset anyone But I would have liked to known. I talked to one of the owners David he was trying to make me feel better about the situation but I\u2019m thinking the air scrubber is not for us.  which was very nice but I feel like im not going to do well with a system that isn\u2019t helping me and I want to be comfortable in my home. I hope this company will make this right for us. They are very professional and have helped us in the past. I didn\u2019t know how I would react to the air scrubber and I\u2019m not doing well I would like to fix it please thanks so much.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1607128462686, "text": "This is fantastic thank you so much for choosing Climatemp Cooling & Heating inc. as your Heating and air conditioning provider."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a1b95dfc08dd9:0x46ab285987648b9a"}

These came with a 10 year parts/labor warranty.  In 13 months, Unit A stopped cooling 3 times over several months and Climatemp was unable to effect permanent repairs.  The last time Climatemp repaired unit A, it stopped working within 18 hours.  This was after several days of disruption, no AC, and probably 10 hours of attempts to fix it.  Unit B stopped cooling at the 7-month mark and the air handler had to be replaced.  They broke the condensate pump which leaked water everywhere and didn't seal the discharge side into the main duct during the install.  In addition, I have seen several misdiagnosed issues,  unterminated wires, holes in return box, and uninsulated freon lines to name just a few issues.  My favorite was the condensate pump installed so that it blocked the door from closing to the air handler room.  The customer service is awful.  Nobody will call you back.  You have to follow up on everything yourself.  I had a no show on more than one occasion and when I called to ask where the tech was, \u201coh he\u2019s not going to be able to make it.\u201d  After unit A stopped cooling, yet again, and nearly immediately after the last attempt to fix it, I attempted to reach a final resolution with the GM David, but he never called me back.  He told me he would speak to the owner and let me know what they decided, but no call.  It would be laughable if I hadn\u2019t spent 14k on two units and was one year into a 10 year parts/labor warranty.  In the end, I never heard from him again, all while unit A was not cooling.  Ultimately, I had to get Carrier involved who thankfully switched my parts and labor warranty to another local factory authorized dealer, who has been amazing.  The new dealer fixed unit A on the first attempt, in about two hours, which was over pressurized with freon, and had been incorrectly diagnosed by Climatemp.  They provided updates through the whole process.  Then, they reconfigured unit A and B, which were never set up properly and were running inefficiently on factory default settings.  I would give anything to be able to go back and avoid ever using Climatemp, but they had such good reviews.  I discovered that A LOT of them are from their own employees.  Even the techs told me, they\u2019re told to leave five-star reviews on google and have their friends and family do the same.  Look through the reviews and you will see the same names that you hear when you call dispatch or receive an email.  The owners, and the GM leave them, as well as their family.  You will see the same names leaving reviews across every location.  Normal customers don\u2019t do that.  When bad reviews are left, you will see threats of litigation and claims of fake reviews.  Folks this company is shameful.  Please save yourself and use any number of available HVAC companies in Baldwin county.  If you have a part/labor warranty with them and you feel trapped, call Carrier.  They can and will help you.\n\n** In response to the owner's claim - the last time your technician was in my home, he was there for nearly six hours.  I loaned him my extension cords and fed him dinner.

My unit, which I\u2019ll admit is old, but it still works\u2026 Was not cooling as well as usual. This has happened previously and it needed Freon. So I called  Climatemp to come out\u2026 I knew they like to try to upsell your unit but I had them come out anyway. I had called and they told me there was an $89 service/diagnostic fee. So long story short\u2026 The guy came out opened the unit and within 10 minutes told my husband we needed a brand new unit that it would cost @ $3000 just to fix the leak. I told him no thank you we would get another opinion that I was not spending $10,000 today on a new unit. He then asked me \u201c What\u2019s the right price to get you to say yes to a new unit today?\u201d Climatemp keeps your credit card on file and within 45 minutes charged my account $189\u2026 For nothing! Within that same amount of time I had had another local company come out they had already fixed my unit, my house was cool and only charged me $150. Climatetemp does not tell you that they charge you $25 per 15 minutes they are there\u2026 If you do the math that is $1.66 PER MINUTE!! We would definitely not have let the technician take his 10 minute cigarette  break in our front yard if we had known we were paying that per minute!! They were there for 15 minutes, just wanted to sell us a new $8000 unit and told us ours could not be fixed for less than $3000, did not give us accurate information on charges, never left us an invoice and still won\u2019t give us one, just charged my card. Terrible way to do business!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1576124876471, "text": "Jessica, we are sorry you feel that way after further investigation yes your unit was very old and had multiple R22 Freon leaks in it. The laws require us to fix and repair the leak before we put r-22 Freon back in this is a costly repair especially in your case where a whole coil was going to have to be replaced to fix your unit. So yes a coil plus recharging your unit with r-22 is a very costly repair. You say you paid 150.00 and you were cool again by another company but did they actually do you justice by putting some Freon in knowing its going to leak back out and you will be calling them right back out. We also noticed you said you already had them out once before. So as you can see your having to call someone out every few months to charge your unit mean while when it is running low on Freon it is working double time and costing you double time just to operate the system. It sounds like as much as you are having to pay for a very inefficient  system in your home with multiple service calls a year you could have purchased a new efficient system with just the savings you would have on your utilities each month not to mention all the 150.00 dollar service call. So did Climatemp really do a dis justice or where you just putting a band aid on something that really needed stitches to buy you more time. Climatemp charges by the quarter hr. Which can save you tons of money many other companies charge a 1hr minimum and flat rate prices that would have cost you much more. We are truly sorry for any inconvenience to you or your family but in the same note here at Climatemp we believe in fixing things right and not putting a band on something that will end up costing you much more in the long run.

Well, to my surprise, this time I was told they could send out a serviceman the very next day (which they did). The repairman was very courteous and knowledgeable.....and the dryer has now been repaired.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDid not show up for first service call. Said truck broke down but we never received a call. Sears said they texted us...but upon further investigation, Sears said they transposed our telephone #, so who knows who received the message that said they weren't going to show up. Wasted one day waiting for repair man. Then after almost 2 weeks later, a repairman finally shows up. He was nice enough and seemed to know what he was doing. Said that a part would need to be ordered. Okay, fair enough. Part came in almost two weeks later; however, was told it will be almost another 3 weeks before Sears can send someone out to install the part. Customer service??? I don't think so. Bottom line: Almost 7 weeks without a dryer that's under Sear's Home Warranty program is a very POOR indicator of this company's ability to honor their agreement. Still waiting for June 9th to get here. Hope they show up.

Two weeks later, no parts, no service call.  When I called back to check, the number I was given was not a correct number.  I had to call four times to the service number.  The first time I was transferred four times to get to the correct division for my service contract on my mower.  The fourth person couldn't help me and transferred me back to the third person and they 'dropped' the call.  Two hours 18 minutes... no, I did not call back that day.  Finally got through to the proper division for the mower service contract.  Got the service time set up with my complaint and requested service ordered.\n\nThe serviceman arrives and I tell him what I had asked for and he says he was only told about the broken belt.  No new blades, no new cut grass shield, and NO service.  He starts to replace the belt and I quickly saw he did not have the correct belt.  He had been given the belt that turns the blades, not the drive belt.\n\nSo off to the hardware store to get the correct belt.  Once he gets back, the drive belt repair was completed quickly.  Two days later, a different service tech comes by to look at the mower to get the numbers to order the shield.   He promises me that he will put in the request for the annual service.  A week later, someone comes out to my house and installs the shield on the mower,  No service, no new blades.  My son and I go get some new blades and put them on ourselves.  At least I can cut grass now.\n\nSTILL WAITING ON THE SERVICE.  I would take this back to Sears, but.....", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cce7cdbd0ff65:0x244b0c8bf7d42e3"}

The time before that, someone came out, and didnt bother to look at anything, and said they could get me a new unit and they would have it built on a concrete block to make it nice.  I called someone else and it was the fan motor.

When one of my two HVACs went out in my new home, I called the company that installed it and they said the earliest they could come was three days.  When I called ACS, they were there the next morning.  I have been calling on ACS ever since.  During a heat wave, after Robert explained he would have to charge overtime, ACS fixed my HVAC on a Sunday morning.  Whenever ACS was at my house to fix my HVAC, after analyzing the problem, they were clear on what needed to be done,  how long it would take to fix it, how much it would cost, and why.  If necessary, they also provided a variety of payment options so I could choose what best met my situation.  So when one of my two HVACs needed to be replaced, ACS was one of two companies I called for an estimate.  While the other estimate was flowered with discounts for various reasons, the ACS estimate was clear, concise, and competetive.  Robert Akins spent a lot of time explaining options and whether they were worth the expense.  The unit ACS proposed has a lifetime condenser replacement warranty if the compressor ever fails.  An option ACS had that the other did not was a ten year warranty on the labor for warrantied repairs.  Finally, when the competitor said it would take at least a week for the replacement HVAC to come in, ACS had my new unit installed the next day on December 22, the week of Christmas!  So whether you are looking to replace your current HVAC unit or just repair the one you have, I highly recommend Robert Akins and ACS.  They have always been there when I needed them and taken care of the problem efficiently and professionally.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862657b007200dd:0x7c27a392b36f81dc"}

Unfortunately, occasionally, due to whatever reasons whether by our fault or other circumstances, a customer is dissatisfied.  In this case we did not learn of Mr. Hastie's dissatisfaction until he posted a negative review.  There was no phone call, no inquiry, no attempt to communicate or seek a resolution to his complaint, just a negative review.\nAfter speaking to the technician and reviewing the statements associated with this service I found the following facts to be true:\n\nMr Hastie called to report his house was hot and his air conditioning was not working late in the afternoon.  I diverted a technician to his house after 4:30 pm to help him so that hopefully he would not have to go through another hot night in his house.  (We go on overtime at 5:00 pm).  The technician found the primary problem and responded by installing a part from his truck which was close to what was required but not the correct spec.  The temporary fix allowed the unit to run and cool the house overnight providing immediate relief for Mr. Hastie.  The technician did not charge for the overtime.\n\nThe part required was an odd spec which the technicians and many of our professional vendors do not carry locally (often an order Item).  The next day our technician searched among our vendors until he found a part locally.  He returned to the Hastie residence and exchanged the temporary part for the correct one.  Our technician also inspected the refrigerant charge and found a need to add some refrigerant to achieve the correct cooling specs per his instruments upon this return visit.\n\nMoreover, our technician did not charge Mr. Hastie for the procurement or travel time required to serve his needs.  For the more than 3 hours time involved working exclusively on Mr. Hastie's behalf our technician charge him only for a service call and 1 hour labor.  As far as the cost of the part:  yes we, like most service operations who provide a responsive service, charge a markup on parts.  We do not attempt to compete with internet pricing.  Our pricing structure reflects the convenience of having the part, our vendors supporting us to have a part available, and the network which guarantees and supports the quick response business.\n\nOtherwise, a client is free to diagnose his own problem, order his parts online and wait in the heat until the part arrives (hoping he did not make a mistake or that a wrong part was shipped.)\n\nIn conclusion:  Our technician followed pricing guidelines which have been satisfactory for our extensive client base for more than 40 years.  He waived labor costs in the hopes of establishing Mr. Hastie as a long term satisfied customer.  Mr. Hastie indicated to the technician that he was satisfied and grateful for the prompt service and relief from the heat.\n\nHad Mr. Hastie called to inquire about the charges, we could have explained to him and even offered him a coupon if he was still not happy.  Personally, I see this negative review as simply malicious with the intent of harming our otherwise excellent review status and without any interest in understanding or seeking a resolution with ACS, Inc."}, "gmap_id": "0x8862657b007200dd:0x7c27a392b36f81dc"}

AVOID.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1543417470154, "text": "I remember this caller.  Nathan called and began asking me vague questions about what was wrong with his heating system.  I told him that it sounded like we needed to send a tech out for diagnostics.  He asked me what the charge would be and I told him the minimum cost of a service call and labor for a call out.  He then asked me an unusual question for our industry.  He asked me why we charged for diagnostics.  From having dealt with the public for 40 years I understood that he was not familiar with how service companies operate.  I proceeded to explain to him why a company had to charge to send a tech to a remote location, time, equipment cost, travel, insurance, education and training, overhead and all of the costs associated with a working company.  I explained that the tech, for instance, had to be paid from the moment he clocked in which included the driving time to a residence and back, hence the service call.  Nathan took offense at the explanation and told me that he did not need a \"lecture\".  I asked him then why he asked such a question if he did not expect or want a comprehensive answer, to which he abruptly hung up the phone. There was no profanity.  Moments later this negative review arrived in my email.\n\nPart of the service we provide is educational.  We are a very empirical and logic based company.  We deal with applied science.  When a question is asked we do our best to answer it thoroughly.  I often help clients solve heating and air conditioning issues over the phone at no charge when able.  I have recently successfully instructed non technical house wives in restoring their heat over the phone. My communication skills are very good.  In this circumstance it was very important that the potential client understood the charges and per his questions why there were charges.  If the customer does not understand that he will be charged for a visit and that he has an obligation to pay, or if he protests the value of the service prior to a visit by a tech, then we cannot send a tech to his residence.\n\nUnfortunately, part of the job of dealing with the general public is to screen the potential client to make sure that the interaction with the company and the technician is successful and satisfactory for both parties.  We will not send a technician into a contentious situation.  We would have liked to have helped Nathan but the initial phone interaction and the \"hang up\" indicated that the interaction would not be successful."}, "gmap_id": "0x8862657b007200dd:0x7c27a392b36f81dc"}

My wife met with Cason and we went into wanting multiple options which i thought were all fairly presented and well explained without any pressure of which to go with. I have a close friend who worked for many years for both Trane and Carrier with many of the dealers throughout Birmingham. He gave me a list of 3 companies he would have out to his home personally. Skelton was one of those, another company that i liked very much, and then one we didnt have a great experience on the quote with. Between Skelton and the other competitor, although Skeltons price was higher we were sold by the labor warranty and some of the other written guarantees, along with the rec from our friend. Installation - I believe it was Mark, my wife was the one on site - went way better than i could have imagined. We arranged last minute to have the unit moved to a new location. All of the work was very well done. I had an idea in my head of what \"the aftermath\" should have looked like and the equipment involved in the move and all that, and i probably would have been satisfied with a lot less. Its obviously a lot of money for most families, so I was bound to have some mix of buyers remorse and hesitation about whether or not we'd gone with the right people However, when i got home and saw the quality of the work, how neatly and efficiently and professionally everything was done, i immediately felt entirely confident in our decision and knew we had some true professionals out at the house.

Well, the A C didn't come on so I called American Home Warranty which provided me with my info and called Same Day maintenance (cause I've used them before to install a thermostat in my home), the technician came out flipped the switch on and never went outback to check my unit...naturally I was happy because now I'm knowing I have air. Kept my doors and windows opened and up until around7:30 because it was really hot inside and I didn't want the unit to work as hard cooling the house inside. 3:00 before day Saturday morning; I was drenched in sweat.not understanding what's happened, got up, checked the A C inside..on. Went out back, checked the unit..no fan turning, unit very hot..turned off A C inside, called SameDay around 8:00 that morning, left emergency message..no return called. Called again all day every30 minutes- an hour...no phone call. Same repeat for Sunday. Monday morning I was on the phone calling them from7:30 until the answering machine picked up and I asked them to please call me back..didn't call me, I called back again finally getting someone who told me they would check with the tec. to see when he can come b out( mind you, this is a re-call) so I should have been a priority along with other people who had an emergency over the week-end not wait until Wednesday to try and work me in. I was told Wednesday morning that the Tec. would be out between 1and 5pm. Okay... I'm trying to hold my self in check because now I'm feeling disrespected and ignored. 4:35 no Tech..I called their office back after the 2nd phone call I was told this guy name Andy would give me a call...what???\nIt's already4:55 I said\" call me\" he should be here by now i2don't need him to call me.. She said\" that's what he told me to tell you\" . long story....so he called5:10 said he would look at his schedule and see if he could get to me tomorrow( Thursday)....I'm sooo pissed now, hot and disgusted...called American Residential warranty back, explained this same thing to them and told them I will not use Same Day Maintenance anymore and to place that notation on the computer by my name...so now I'm searching the internet trying to find someone else who will come out asap to get me up and running......I recommend no body uses this service...at all.

But after my experience with them over a new problem I am very disappointed. I wouldn't refer them to a dog house if it needed to be cooled down. My a/c unit stopped working Aug 29th, I called the owner and he was suppose to get back to me within an hour. I called his phone atleast fifty times from my phone and numerous times from my husband and unpublished as well. I finally get in touch with him today and he schedules the appointment for noon- 1pm my time (which is 11a-12p their time). I am sitting here in a hot house waiting on the a/c man... it's almost one pm my time and he calls me just before and tells me that he isn't coming out today I needed to call the warranty company and have them schedule someone else to come out. there are plenty of contractors in Phenix City that could come out today (did he call them and ask to see, hell no), he tells me that there is no way that he can come out he has an emergency at the hospital. that is understandable but why can't you send someone other than yourself to check my unit? He tells me that it isn't that hot outside that it could wait till Monday. This man knows that I have seven month old child as well as a four year old and he has the balls to tell me that it can wait because it isn't hot? The next time my baby throws up on me I will make sure I call him so she can do it to him. she can't be in the heat she has too many problems for it and he is not worth the time of day or the money you will spend.

When we called for our yearly maintenance, no one ever showed up. We did this twice and then gave up on them, and changed out filters out ourselves.\nAfter a few years we started to have issues with the unit not cooling, and blowing fuses and lost power to our thermostat.  Tech came out and checked voltage, and changed a fuse. They charged us 1.5 hours of labor, for a 20 min fix.\nThe issues above persisted and we called to have them come out for repairs again. The techs arrived and  tested voltage and various things but could not find the issue. It was my husband who discovered a wire that was cut and causing a short. The techs fixed that, and also cleaned the coils thoroughly on the unit.\nWe are still having some issues with our unit not cooling properly which were brought up in the first visit, but since the issue hadn\u2019t happened that much over the course of the past 5 years the tech didn\u2019t think it required any further investigating.\nThey will charge you for the techs coming from Opelika, however my husband talked to the tech and they were already in Columbus, had just finished a service call and were heading to our house. When my husband brought this up for Mr. Farnell, he stated that they had to include for fair wear and tear on their vehicles.\nTried to bill extra hours for labor, good thing I noted the time when they arrived and when they left, plus we had a rain storm that stopped all work for the duration of the storm.\nCharged us for fuses, that we provided since the tech didn\u2019t have any.\nMy husband called the office to challenge the charges on the bill and did negotiate them with Mr. Farnell, who agreed that something were charged/done in error.\nAs small business owners, we try to utilize other small business owners when possible. We have spent over $10k with this company (for the new unit and repairs) and after this experience will never use them again.

In Farnell's defense after I first posted this review some attempts were made to rectify the problems we were having. Today when the owner contacted me I attempted to remind him that there was still work they'd promised to do that had never been completed (repainting of a ceiling they damaged in August). Instead of offering to make the repair the owner became extremely rude. Cut me off mid sentence, wouldn't let me finish talking, and talked over me; insisting that he didn't know anything about this issue and that I needed to remove my review.

I could not believe that I was able to get someone the same day but was even more amazed that they responded in about an hour. They are always polite, extremely careful of surroundings by wearing shoe covers,etc. after checking my inside unit he went out in the storm, I offered an umbrella but he didn\u2019t need it. In a few minutes I saw him walk to his truck. I thought he was writing a bill so I asked how much. He came to the door and showed me that my breaker was burned up and how much hot it was. It would burn your hand if you held it. I was surprised he had a breaker for my unit and was able to install it so quickly. The charge for the service call, travel, weekend inconvenience, repair and parts was less than I paid for a service call in my last state. Donnie was so knowledgeable, professional and fast that I couldn\u2019t begin to give him enough stars. I said the first time I used Hansen that I would never use anyone else. This was definitely a great find. Hsnsen\u2019s Is by far the best company I have dealt with. I have already began advertising to my community how great they are. I am definitely a customer for life.

We had him come out a few months ago to repair our HVAC system. He did a wonderful job fixing it after the company who installed it really messed it up. I thought we were having problems with the same system again because water randomly began leaking through our ceiling which is what had happened in the past, so my first thought was, \u201cUh-oh, the air conditioner is malfunctioning again.\u201d So I called Shane to check it out and it turned out to be our hot water heater. First of all, he answered my call on a weekend when he was doing other things on his own time and made our problem a priority to fix, which I truly appreciate. And instead of referring me out to someone else to deal with it since it wasn\u2019t an HVAC issue, he came out and replaced it himself and made modifications to ensure it could never leak through the ceiling again. Also, he discovered in the process that a faulty valve had malfunctioned on the outside of our house and was causing extraordinary water pressure on the inside, which had cost us thousands of dollars in repairs and appliance replacement, (including the water heater!), over the years! No one had ever been so thorough as to investigate something as simple but as impactful as the water pressure in our home, (and we had other big companies come out over the years). But Shane did and he even fixed that issue- spending literally hours digging out and replacing the broken valve in our front yard. We are so thankful that Shane was there to help us out. They really are jacks of all trades at Gipson Heating and Air Conditioning and are truly knowledgeable about many things across the board in terms of repairs. I have since referred others to Shane and Co with full confidence that he and his crew will always do the job right for a fair price, without taking advantage of people in the process, and will go above and beyond in the quality of their product and services.  And that, in and of itself, is worth more than anything to me. I do truly appreciate these fine people and cannot say enough good things about this company.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1608734906457, "text": "Thanks so much for the kind words!

In order to give a better understanding of my situation let me say, without the intent of trashing anyone or their business, that when our system was replaced two years ago by the company that installed it, (who I also called for help yesterday when it stopped working), it malfunctioned quickly and flooded a bedroom ruining drywall and requiring extensive repairs. Eventually it had to be completely replaced as it never functioned properly. The replacement system needed a few tweaks, but eventually it seemed to work consistently and well and did for nearly a year- until yesterday. So, I contacted the company who installed the system and they were unable to come out immediately, nor could they give me a timeframe for their arrival.  It was 80 degrees inside, I have pets, and I needed someone there sooner rather than later. Shane wasted no time in getting to my house to assess the system and set to work immediately. In the process, he educated me on the system and gave me a complete rundown of what exactly was wrong, including a list of issues caused by the installers of the system, which were contributing to the malfunction of it. He also hauled off a large garbage bag of trash that the installers left in my attic! Additionally, his service charges were so reasonable I actually questioned him about it! His reply was basically that he would rather be good to customers, charge reasonably and fairly, and get great reviews and referrals than charge exorbitant amounts of money for his services! I was blown away! Now my air is working beautifully, I didn\u2019t spend a fortune to get it fixed, and he has a customer for LIFE. Try Gipson Heating and Air Conditioning.

I don't even know where to begin because they are so AMAZING.  The owner of this company literally has the key code to my front door because he is so trustworthy.  I wouldn't hesitate to let him babysit my children because he is such a great guy.  His staff as well.  My story is unique because what started with me calling him out to talk about a duct cleaning turned into my husband and I gutting our entire home for a remodel (for other reasons) and we wanted a brand new system.  Shane came out to do a load calculation to help us pick the perfect system.  He was so detailed that he climbed into the smallest, most cringy area underneath a stairway landing in my basement. I felt like I was watching the show Fear Factor because you couldn't have paid me to crawl under there!!  We sat down at the table and he explained with so much detail the system I needed.  What I found to be so funny, is that I have never met a HVAC guy that was so passionate about his work.  I thought I was going to have to kick him out because, at one point, I think he started doing algebra equations based on how many windows I have and insulation in the house and whether the sun rises or sets on backside of my roof...LOL.\n\nAnyways,  this remodel has taken two years and I don't know how many times he came out to my home to help me before I ever paid him a dime.  I have a longer chain of text messages to him than I do to some of my friends.  He has just been there to answer every...single...one of my questions. I have a beautiful new HVAC system now, all new ductwork, gas lines for my hot water heater and two fireplaces and an additional ductless, mini split system installed.

They have Serviced my 15 year old home unit for two years now and have never tried to sell me a new unit. Shane (the owner) always says he can keep it running with routine service and by topping off the freon at the beginning of each summer. He recommends this as it is cheaper for me and the best option with kids in college and a new unit is not needed right now. Previous HVAC companies pitched the need for a new unit based on age before even inspecting it.\n\nBut when it comes time for a new unit, as it was when Gipson replaced the 30+ year old unit in our rental house this summer, it was another positive experience with this company. Shane checked the unit, explained why this unit could not be repaired (it had rusted through in many areas) and recommended the best and most affordable unit for replacement. He even set me up with financing which allowed for payoff in six months with no interest.\n\nIt\u2019s a very vulnerable feeling when you have problems that you don\u2019t fully understand and feel like you are at the mercy of the repair tech\u2019s information. I don\u2019t have this feeling with Gipson as they take the time to explain and actually show you what the problem is before making the repair (Shane sent pictures to me at work when a fan motor needed replacing during last summer\u2019s service).\n\nI cannot recommend this company enough strictly based on their honesty and work ethics.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1591532328925, "text": "Thanks for the review and your trust in us!"}, "gmap_id": "0x8889744abc895555:0x2c0d9d979cb7770"}

I\u2019ve been a homeowner for 26 years and am on my second Trane heat pump system.\nIt would not be an exaggeration to say that Gipson Heating & Air Conditioning gave me the most thorough service I\u2019ve received in those 26 years. They not only performed the seasonal maintenance on my unit, but discovered and remedied additional problems. They even corrected mistakes made by previous contractors which could have led to a malfunction of my unit in the future.\n(One example: I had been dealing with a condensation problem in my air handler and Shane Gipson explained why it was happening and fixed it immediately. By the way, the condensation was caused by the omission of an important step which another company\u2019s rep had not bothered to return my call on, much less offer to remedy.)\nShane Gipson\u2019s knowledge and expertise was surpassed only by his willingness to go above and beyond what he initially came to do. And he patiently answered all my questions (I had many).\nI urge you to give Gipson Heating & Air a call when you next need maintenance work or repair on your heating/air unit, no matter the brand. You will not be disappointed. In fact, you may be amazed that there are still those who have such a work ethic and hold themselves to such a high standard. And you will be left with peace of mind, knowing that no stone was left unturned in the care of your system.

Knowing we had two 20 year old HVAC systems, we were faced with replacing both systems. As a result, we did our due diligence to obtain quotes, which sadly took over a month to get three that were actually apples-to-apples .\n\nWe were nearly ready to pull the trigger when we came across Gipson. Not only did we get a quote FAST, but their quote was incredibly detailed; including sketches of our ductwork. In retrospect, this wasn't a big surprise, since Gipson actually did a full, comprehensive review, well beyond the cursory inspections the others did. Gipson asked questions the others didn't, revealed critical items the others missed, and provided additional details that truly benefited us. Their best suggestion was flipping a horizontal system to vertical. Yhis change gave us a tremendous amount of additional attic space, a genuine bonus!\n\nWe could go on singing Gipson's praises but will wrap up by simply saying all work was performed exactly as quoted, the installation was top notch, was done as promised and on time.

She received a few quotes from companies and although Gibson was not the lowest they were the most professional and were willing and able to do the entire job and not leave a whole in the wall to be fixed by another contractor she would have to pay.\nI agreed to stay at her home so she would not need to take a day off work and we wanted someone at the house incase there was a problem or questions that they needed to check with us before doing.\nThe owner showed up a few minutes before the agreed on time which was before his normal business hours because my sister asked if he could start early so I would not have to say there all day.  By 9 am he had already removed the old unit and started getting the new unit ready to install.  When his employees arrived they immediately came up to me and introduced themselves.  The two employees were clean and neatly dressed.\nWhile working they took the time to clean as they went never leaving a mess or tools laying around.  I watched the entire crew (owner included) and they all worked very well together and each of them seemed to care about the job as the owner.  All would answer any questions I had and were more polite than I can ever get my children to be.  I requested some very minor changes to the was a drain line ran and they immediately agreed and said it would not charge the price.\nWhen they were done all their work looked so neat, clean, and organized.  They went back with my sister and me both explaining everything they did and why they did it.  They went over what she had asked them to do and made sure she was happy with everything.  While working he also found a few other things that were not up to code that he fixed to bring everything around the unit up to the latest codes.  While the owner was doing all this his employees were cleaning everything they were even near.  They vacuumed a carpet that had probably not been vacuumed in a long while and swept out the entire garage.\nWhen it came time to pay he said he already told her the price.  My sister asked about any extra costs and the owner explained that he does not believe in changing the price after agreeing to the job and any extra cost that occurs he absorbs.\nIn my opinion these were some of the very best contractors I have ever been around working in my home or someone else's.  All the employees seemed to enjoy their job and the company they worked for.  Great job all of you.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1573036609536, "text": "Thanks for the kind words!

Our building contractor recommended Island Air-Air Conditioning and Heating, Gulf Shores, AL. My husband and I previously lived in several homes with HVAC problems stemming from poor design and installations. We knew we wanted to avoid those with new construction.\n\nI initially met with Rob Barnas of Island Air to explain our HVAC desires. Rob and Chris designed a plan to address the \"wants & needs\" of our system. It's very easy to install flexible ducts improperly, but Eddie and the men ran the ducts and attached the air handlers with great care.\n\nNew HVAC systems are very expensive. I did not want to buy a new system and suffer the same issues that we had to pay to have repaired in previous houses. So, throughout the construction process I asked dozens of questions.  I'm sure this was tiresome for Island Air, but they were very patient with me. Honestly, how can anyone be expected to properly operate and care for a system unless they understand how it's supposed to work? Hahahaha. Also, I wanted to understand the system while I could still see the components. Our drywall is not up yet. We are now 4 months into construction, so not far enough along to have thermostats installed or have the system turned on. However, we are enough along for me to say I am happy this far with the work done by Island Air of Gulf Shores, AL. I will try to post again after we move in to give everyone a final report on how it feels to live in an HVAC system built by Island Air.\n\nPS. In case you are wondering. I am not related by blood or personal connections to anyone at Island Air and have received no discounts or other incentives for posting this review.\nD.

The initial job was well done.  I was happy with the work that I entered a service agreement for my upstairs unit. In 2016 my trust with the company was severely damaged when the AC tech charged me for the part that was still under warranty and I had to call them on it.  To the company credit, they did \"refund\" me with the credit on the next repair job in the spring of 2017.  I paid the invoice without examining it carefully as I should have done.  Two months in late May of 2017, I received a letter from the Baldwin County small claim court saying that Island  Air is suing me for nonpayment.  I called them and the manager told me that all this can go away if I pay them at that point.  I went home and dug up all my paperwork and found out that they overcharged me once again on the visit in spring 2017.  I faxed them my receipts and called them the next day and advised them not to go ahead with the lawsuit because they will not win in court.  They rescinded the the court claim and offered me a six month maintenance complimentary service for my inconvenience,  but after all the shenanigans I have to walk away.  The trust factor is no longer there.  I waited for four months to write this review to make sure that my emotion is in check and to give them a fair review about my experience with the company.   Take home points?  Save your receipts and you need to know about the warranty your AC system.  Always go check the charges line by line and make sure to keep this company honest.

We are so very happy with our overall experience with this company. In fact (no lie) less than two hours after the final hook-up, there was a sudden storm, the electricity went out and the generator came on. It was seamless!!! We did have a misunderstanding with the salesman but once we brought it to the attention of Steve Dukes, the business owner, he quickly and decisively took care of it. Because we are on the Bay, we wanted the generator elevated so that, should there be flooding, the generator would be safe. That request hadn't been conveyed to the installers. However, when Mr. Dukes was made aware of the oversight, he actually constructed a metal stand for us himself. Plus he did this very quickly so that the delay was minimal. We were thinking they would build us a wooden platform, but the metal one is much better \u2014 both functionally (as it will last longer) and aesthetically. We are from Michigan and we had no intention of being here through hurricane season but we had traveled here with my 94 year old mother and, because of the coronavirus, she couldn\u2019t fly back and she can\u2019t physically tolerate such a long drive.  I was afraid that, because of the misunderstanding, we would be relegated to the bottom of the list and have to wait until they could \u201cget around to it\u201d because they were so busy...not so! There was only a slight delay while the frame was fabricated. So, fast forward to the present time: We had \u201cbugged out\u201d when Hurricane Sally was about 100 miles South of us and just now walked into the door after Sally had passed through. There is no electricity on either side of us but we walked into the door with the generator humming reassuringly beside the house. I don\u2019t have to worry about Moms Bi-Pap or oxygen condenser working. She will be able to sleep comfortably tonight...and so will I. Mr. Dukes made sure we had the generator installed the way we wanted it and in a timely manner, smoothing out the bumps along the way. I definitely recommend getting a whole house (Generac) generator and I highly recommend doing business with Mr. Dukes of Baldwin Heating & Air Conditioning. He knows his business and is a man of integrity.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1604097541449, "text": "Kathy thank you so much.

So we called Baldwin HVAC.  They sent a guy to come out and look at it.  He looked briefly at the unit, walked around the house for a few minutes with a thermometer, and quickly pronounced that there was nothing wrong, and that all we needed was to change our air filters.  So they charged us $39 for the visit (the fee they quote you) plus $50 for \"labor,\" which I guess is that guy's rate for walking around your house for 10 minutes.\n\nObviously, I keep my filters changed, so I was suspicious, but I assumed that he knew what he was talking about.  2 weeks ago, our AC stops working completely.   Before calling anyone, I go into the attic and check it out myself.  The coils were completely frozen.  And not only that - they were clogged with dust and mold.  This was due to our blower motor malfunctioning, which had been happening slowly for some time at that point.\n\nI took a photo to show how bad it was.  Naturally, I called Baldwin HVAC to ask how their guy missed something so obvious.  The manager, Anthony, said that the initial $89 visit \"didn't include\" looking at the coils, even though it took me - an ordinary guy with no HVAC expertise - literally 5 minutes to open up the blower and look in there.\n\nLike an fool, I believed him, and so hired them to come out and fix the blower motor that had gone bad.  Their guy John came and he was nice and did a good job.\n\nBut the next day, the same AC unit goes dead again.  This time, the problem is the outdoor compressor.  So I call them to come check it out.\n\nThey charge us yet another $89 to come and look at the same AC system they'd worked on the very day before.  This time, we resist their high-pressure sales tactics (\"It's 4 PM, so if you want the AC working tomorrow, we need to order the part now! \") and call a different company to work on the compressor.  Baldwin HVAC quoted us $822 to replace the part (which was covered by warranty).  We went to Climatemp instead, and they charged us $550 for the exact same job.  They got the part that same day and had a guy out there the very next morning.\n\nLong story short: I'd recommend someone else first, if only because these people charge more than other companies, and in my experience, the quality of the work just wasn't sufficient to justify the extra cost.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a69f62d949da1:0x9a9bd9e00f87db88"}

After their inspection, they said there was no mechanical issues. They put in 2lbs of Freon because someone hadn\u2019t capped it.  They also mentioned they no one from Adams even took the cover off the unit, which I can attest to because I was standing there, but know nothing about HVAC.

My technicians are very well trained to check over your system and look for any problems with your system. If you had to add 2 lbs of refrigerant to your system, then you have a leak that wouldn't be fixed by simply caps. That is just a short term solution to your problem. We offered the long term fix for around $500, not $800. If the parts weren't under warranty would of cost you over $1500 to repair properly. Unfortunately, Newer units fail all the time.

So I called several HVAC companies, and I quickly found out that the repair cost was high enough that I was better off getting a new air conditioning system. So I did some research, and then I got quotes from 11 different companies. Of the price range of quotes, Xcalibur was among the lowest. So I chose Xcalibur, and the next morning, Ryan, Mark, Jacob and Zachary showed up and installed a new air conditioning system and furnace (I actually didn't need a new furnace, but the extra cost to add a new furnace to the a/c installation job was low.).  The installation guys were professional (for example, they put on shoe covers before entering my house) and knowledgeable.\n\nI'm glad that I chose this company. First, Ben and Ryan are actually honest people. Also, Ben and his employees seem to take pride in doing a good job.  My new a/c system not only comes with the standard 10 year warranty for parts, but also a 10 year warranty for LABOR.  Call other HVAC companies yourself and ask if they include a 10 year labor warranty on a/c installations.  When they say no, ask them what the labor cost is to replace a compressor or an evaporator coil.  Also, Xcalibur installed new line sets with my a/c system. But some HVAC companies cut corners by not installing new line sets.\n\nSince Alabama Power is my electricity company, I can track my electricity usage via Alabama Power's website or their app. My new Bryant a/c system uses about 39% less kilowatts than the American Standard system that it replaced.  In just the first month of using this Bryant a/c system, I saved over $100 on my Alabama Power bill!  I also found out that Bryant equipment and Carrier equipment come out of the same factories because they are sister companies.\n\nIf I could give Xcalibur 6 stars, I would.

By Saturday morning, I had an email from Ben that said he emailed, rather than called, to avoid disrupting my Saturday morning, but that he was available to schedule my service when I was ready. He made my appointment for Tuesday morning, only two business days later.\n\nAs promised, the technician, Zack, called before he headed my way. He arrived at the promised time and was just as efficient throughout the appointment. Zack showed me where my dryer duct ran to and explained what he was going to do. The vent hose on my machine was much longer than necessary, so he offered to trim it to reduce the possibility of it getting bunched up and causing additional issues. Zack was finished within an hour of his arrival and happy to answer my questions.\n\nXcalibur is fairly priced and competent.

Secondly, Turner and Schoel has done nothing, zero, nada in terms of helping me to be a satisfied customer with this piece of crap. After several years and several thousands of dollars (after my intiail investment) they finally said the coils needed to be replaced. This was another $3,600 last June.

I was always treated well by Aubrey and he always made me feel like an important customer no matter how little business I've previously done with them.\n\nThe last job they did for me was a follow up to trying to eliminate a drip sound that could constantly be heard in my bedroom anytime the heat came on. After several attempts, Aubrey felt badly enough that he said he was going to try something so miniscule that it may just work and he said he'd charge me nothing for it since they'd already charged me for a previous visit.\n\nWell, they billed me for it anyway....not a big deal being $75 and given that I've paid them thousands over the last few years. However when I called the owner, Phillip, today he could have cared less about past business or future business and simply said that he was certain I was mistaken and I owed the money, as if I'd try to beat them out of $75.  I thought I was on candid camera based on the way an owner of a company could have cared less about one of his customers and the lecture he tried to give me about business. It was not worth the headache to fight over $75 but the way they made me feel and the fact that they would not honor a prior commitment was truly an unpleasant experience.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88860353d3732697:0x2096dd47c5ee750c"}

You should look it up. With that said here is our reply to your review.\nI am sorry you are having an issue after the repair but an engine replacement is just that, the engine along with any extra parts that we felt were questionable and they are listed on your invoice. There is not an ECM on your invoice. Please keep in mind that there are several other things under the hood of your car that can also cause future problems. Unfortunately we are not able to detect a component such as an ECM, starter, alternator, Oxygen Sensor, Injector and so on that is about to go bad, it is just impossible. Your vehicle is 11 years old and does have 175,000 miles on and usually parts and components will begin to fail and need replacing after 10 years. This ECM is not covered under warranty because we did not replace this part and it does not come with an engine. I have copied and pasted some information for you that came from a site called my mechanic explaining the ECM\u2019s function to your car. We have ordered the ECM, as you know, and as soon as it is installed and the car is test drove we will call you.\nHere is some information that I pulled from the site \"My Mechanic\" that may help you better understand an ECM's function.\nThe engine control module (ECM), also commonly referred to as the engine control unit (ECU) or powertrain control module (PCM), is one of the most important components found on virtually all  vehicles. It essentially functions as the main computer for many of the vehicle\u2019s engine performance and drivability functions. The ECM takes the information from the engine's various sensors and uses that information to calculate and tune engine spark and fuel for maximum power and efficiency. Erratic engine behavior also indicates a bad or failing ECM. A faulty computer may cause the vehicle to intermittently stall or misfire. The symptoms might come and go and not appear to have any sort of pattern to their frequency or severity. The ECM plays a vital role in engine performance. Any issues with it can cause major problems with the overall functionality of the car."}, "gmap_id": "0x8888e1ecf9f042b3:0x2b83686c18294477"}

My P30 Step Van was towed in to get a refreshing and almost had to be towed away. I heard their ad on the radio, gave them a call and found out they service Cintas vans. I spoke to the owner Matt on the phone and he assured me that he was the place to come to and he would take care of me. I told him what I wanted done, I also left a list with the most important to be taken care of first (fuel tank leak and master cylinder replacement) with the receptionist. I mentioned new tires but didn\u2019t decide what to install, but he did, and installed them without my consent. Later he said he thought that\u2019s what I wanted \u201cthe cheap ones.\u201d He decided to do what he wanted and void my concerns (that I spoke of on every visit). I was charged over $400.00 in parts (radiator, v belt and lug nuts) plus labor @ $74/hour added without my consent nor were they spoken of when I made payments in person. I was charged ($35.00) for an air cleaner that he had left from a previous vehicle and promised that he wouldn\u2019t charge me for since I was getting so much work done. That Monday of week three, I stopped by to realize no work had been done over the past 5 days and I immediately stopped the work and told them I would be back in the morning to pick up and pay off balance. Next morning I waited over and hour for the motor to be pressure washed like he promised it would be done yesterday by lunch. While waiting he then decided that he would for free replace the master cylinder and patch the fuel tank leak with a $6.00 putty instead of replacing the tank like I asked on day one. All while repairs being done there were no actual receipt/list of parts and labor but guesstimations made until I made final payment. After I reviewed the receipt just before I paid the remaining $1,400+ balance I had to request that Matt break down and fix the double charges on receipt (I was so angry that I missed a few issues on the receipt). A week turned into a month and if I had not stopped the work there\u2019s no telling how long it would have taken to get the van back. Now I\u2019m weeks behind schedule on preparing for the van for body work and getting it wrapped.   The total cost was $3,863.68 and $1,417.25 of it was labor. I felt robbed and played.

We called around and left messages at a few places.  Steve was the first to call back that same day. We explained the situation.  He advised us to use the unit if we could and wanted to make sure we did still have some heat.  Being that it was a Sunday, it would be Monday until he could send someone out unless it was an absolute emergency.  Come Monday, a technician, Juan, came out to check the problem.\n\nJuan was polite, informative and an all-around great guy.  We were given a quote to repair the unit and replace.  Juan took the time to break down everything for us if we had any questions.  We shopped around and found A1's price to be fair and put the order in for a replacement.  Steve, himself, came by the house the next day to talk with us and clear up any questions we had and help discuss cost options. We decided to go with A1.

I thought this seemed high, and I got Steve's number from a friend at work who recommended A1.  I called and Steve came out and thoroughly examined my system because he was suspicious of the repairs the other company had listed.  Sure enough, he found that almost all of the parts (except for one small heating element, unrelated to the cooling problem) were working fine.  He also completely explained how my system worked to me, he verified that it was working properly, and he was extremely courteous and professional the entire time.  Probably the best experience I have ever had with a service technician.\n\nConsidering that he could have easily \"charged me less\" to fix the non-existent problem, due to my lack of knowledge about HVAC, and considering that he wouldn't let me pay him a service fee because he just wanted to prevent me from getting screwed over, it seems clear that Steve has extremely high integrity.  I would definitely recommend him and will be using him as my HVAC service and installation company for the foreseeable future.

They replaced a portion of our sewer pipe in our basement that we had been having clogging issues with. The new piping looks excellent and the problem seems to have been fixed. However... I had a couple of issues. They charged me an extra $150 for a 2nd visit that only took 10 minutes for him to confirm the issue (I believe this was refunded after I complained). And worst of all, he did not protect the work area and raw sewage dumped all over our washer and dryer, mop sink, basement walls, etc. I did not see this happen and it ended up being much worse than I thought. I asked him if he was going to clean up before he left, he didn't even sweep up the PVC dust from cutting the pipe. He asked me if I had a mop?? All he did was hose down the area and did NOT do a thorough job cleaning up the raw sewage or disinfecting the area. When I called the office to talk to a manager, they told me they have gotten calls before but that it was not standard for their crew to carry cleaning supplies on their trucks. They did not offer to send someone to clean up the mess. The Servpro quote was twice as much as the plumbing quote. I truly cannot believe they would leave someone's home in such a mess. It's a good thing it was in an unfinished basement!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bb9722ee00d:0x5ac09b88522e4b23"}

Linda told me they'd over night it.  Finally received 4 days later.  Went to install the radiator in the truck when I noticed the drain hole and vent hole were wrong.  Called the company back again, explained, sent pics, ect (with the OEM# there should be no mistake).. this company seems to have a problem admitting fault and taking care of the customer.  After the runaround, I had to re-order another radiator from another company, as I had my service truck down and could not depend on this company to do the right thing.  I shipped back the wrong radiator to Brice Thomas and ask Brice Thomas Radiator to give me a full refund.

The Carden Team came in and fixed the entire system and duct work, and her bill has gone down by HUNDREDS of dollars!!\n\nOne final note, and this may make me favorite thing about the Carden family:  I work with a vulnerable, low-income community, and it is often difficult to hire service workers to come into the communities where we need things fixed.  I have actually had service workers tell me directly that they would not service one of my clients\u2019 homes due to their address.  It is heartbreaking.

They went so far as to tell us they don't money in warranty repairs, even when we had an extended warranty for 13 years. They told me to call someone else to come and do the repairs. The catch in all this was that our extended warranty covered both parts and labor. If we had to go to a different Trane dealer they would not cover the labor costs, but the parts were at no charge. I read several good reviews about Carden and decided to go with them. Our repairman was by far one of the most professional, kind and courteous people we have ever had the pleasure of working with. They gave us an estimate before hand and I had already checked the average labor costs to change the compressor out and their rate was very reasonable. Upon finishing the job and it came time to settle up with and to my amazement they came over five hundred dollars cheaper than the original estimate.

The owner, Shane, is very personable and the kind of guy you can trust with your door unlocked. Opie (dead ringer for a younger Ron Howard), his technician, is a relatively young guy (23), but mature beyond his years and a very good HVAC tech. He's also trustworthy and the kind of guy you would want to represent your company. Most importantly, he was able to diagnose my heat pump problem quickly and efficiently...10 to 15 minutes. The HVAC was over amped.\n\nThe company that installed my TRANE XL14 heat pump in 2007, Alabama Climate Control (ACC) of Huntsville, apparently did not notice that the heat pump was rated for max amperage of 40 amps because they did not bother to change the 50 amp circuit breaker in the panel in the garage. One would expect a professional HVAC company to do a basic electrical circuit check/test to ensure the electrical circuit is compatible with your NEW heat pump...right!?!?\n\nAnyway, this oversight by ACC resulted in a fried circuit breaker in the junction box at the heat pump. Opie said we were lucky this situation did not result in a burned up motor or worse a burned down house. After all that, Opie tried to give me a $25 discount because I'm a veteran.\n\nThank you for the sentiment Opie, but also thank you for identifying a problem that has caused me great anguish over the years. I had to replace 3 or 4 compressors on the original heat pump (a Rheem) about 15 years ago when we first started renting out the house.\n\nThe HVAC company (same ACC) kept replacing all those compressors under warranty at $250 to $300 a pop for labor, but just couldn't figure out what was causing all those compressors to burn up (the same 50 amp circuit breaker in the breaker box). Then, I was dumb enough to hire them again to install a new TRANE in 2007. Remeber, the TRANE is rated for a maximum of 40 amps, but ACC left the same old 50 amp circuit breaker in the breaker panel. Voila...we get a fried junction box this time.\n\nIncredible...that it took a young 23 year old tech with a lot less experience (but more common sense and intelligence) to recognize that a 50 amp circuit breaker is going to eventually cause some problems if it is not compatible with the rest of the circuit.\n\nThe cautionary tale here is...be extremely vigilant and careful about who you let work on your electrical systems and watch them like a hawk when they do...until you find a company like SMS that has techs like Opie.. Thank you SMS and Opie for saving my house from a potential fire.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1462206716420, "text": "Thanks Dwight! We are very happy we could take care of your heat pump needs!

The smell was intermittent so I wasn't sure if there was an issue. The first time Sonny came out & took care of the downstairs gas smell.  A few hours after he left the air purifier wasn't working.  Eddie came to our house and fixed and also noticed the \"dryer\" was installed backwards on the both units.

Our AC stopped working and we were advised we need a coil and condensor replaced. The fee for that was $3850. A month later the ac went back to blowing hot air. We called for PB to come back out and the technician stated a part was loose and needed to be replaced from the first service job and we would not be charged. That fixed it for about another month or two. The next technician stated a frog short circuited the system and he removed it and the ac went back to blowing like it should for another couple weeks. Every visit after the alleged frog incident has been one excuse after the other. We're doing renovations and were told the filters needed to be changed more frequently and the house would cool down. We continued to change them weekly and still no luck. We called yet again to advise of the continuing problem only to be charged $79.99 for them to clean the coils and blame the filters. The AC still continued to blow hot air and then the attic began to leak. So ANOTHER call was made. The technician stated the coils were frozen and that the ac needed to be turned off and to change the filter again (at this point we're already changing it weekly and have completed the renovations). The house still didnt cool down and the ac was still leaking. Another call was made the same day (as a leaking attic is urgent and ruining the ceiling) the technician returned and said the coil was shooting out water (ya think!!!! That's why we called in the first place!) had they bothered to look and not blame it on the filter they would have discovered it on the first visit. So the technician fixes the leak and says give it time, the house will cool. Guess what, it's still not cooling!!! So we wait a week (we work and can't keep taking off for someone to come out) and call them back out. The technician now states the roof doesnt have enough vents  and the attic door is off centered and that is what's causing the house not to cool. He said he tweaked something and give it a minute and it will cool. He also states he was advised to charge for coming out. What is there to charge for? The house is still hot, the temperature is steady rising as I type, and the original problem has not been fixed. They're basically grasping  at straws at this point and have run out of probable excuses.  Be prepared to throw away $4000 plus dollars and live in heat if you use this company.

All three men delivered top quality customer service, while also allowing me, as a stay at home mom, a sense of trust and comfort that the service being provided to us was one we needn\u2019t question.

For years our family has \u201cband aided\u201d our AC unit, we knew it would be in the near future to get a new unit, however, Bradberry, and their service workers, still gave us multiple different options to consider.\n\nAfter much deliberation, my husband and I did decide to replace the HVAC UNIT. All diagnostics, financing, and installation were done in 24hrs. (Keep in mind this is also at the end of May, in Alabama, when the heat is unbearable). These gentlemen had a kind smile on their faces the whole time, while also giving clear and concise details on what to expect going forward.\n\nLike I said, I cannot say enough wonderful things about the customer service and products that Bradberry delivered to our family.\nThank you to the three gentlemen and the company of Bradberry for exceeding my expectations.

There is nothing more aggravating than to have your air conditioning unit quit. Although it is mid-October we needed our air conditioning fixed ASAP. Our unit was 17 years old and I knew we needed to replace it if not immediately, within the very near future. I emailed a few companies Saturday night asking for estimates and to please contact me Monday morning. Only Autumn Air and one other company returned my call today. Autumn Air was very pleasant and offered to have someone come out to price the unit immediately. Since I knew I did not want to start throwing money away repairing such an old unit I asked for a quote for a new unit (with and without the furnace). Skip came out and priced the unit with three options and it was clear if I wanted more options he would give them to me. He did not acted putout or frustrated with my request. He did not pressure me to make a decision nor did he push me to buy the most expensive product. Without me asking, he let me know the specials that were being offered. I asked how soon they could install the unit and he said either this afternoon or in the morning. I called my husband and sent him the estimates. My husband was impressed and even showed his fellow employees who were also impressed with the prices. After weighing the pros and cons we decided to replace the entire unit (with furnace). I called Skip back about 2:30 saying we did want to go ahead and replace the unit, he said he would call me right back, that it would be either this afternoon or in the morning. I was floored when he called me back shortly afterwards and asked if it was okay with me if they could install it today. Skip and two other gentlemen came and installed the unit working hard until close to 9:00 pm. We were all extremely grateful to the diligence of these men. In addition, Autumn Air included a 2-year service plan where they will come out to service/clean the unit twice a year. They have earned my trust. I am very thankful to Autumn Air.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSUL9QRFJSPykXqDzrNKpCip6nXxO_y7dxFY68=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2RdAWKk5TI7OZtRl8wgn94aokdQNwgFcu2UXt=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEyoCn2esr-2rrYIf35lCntXDGlIln-damn4kj=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1593532696719, "text": "Thank you!!!!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888924e52224bd39:0x2e611205e661f050"}

{"user_id": "117764367263681419355", "name": "John Hosmer", "time": 1505317915712, "rating": 5.0, "text": "For a long while there have been atmosphere issues in our basement where the previous home owners had never taken care of sealing up the rooms and keeping temps and humidity in check. We had addressed those issues and we had tried using good filters at the returns to prevent as much of any dust, mold spores, etc. from recirculating and spreading, but it ended up being a losing battle for both comfort and our family's health.  Finally, about a month ago I disconnected one of the flexpipes at the end of the trunk run to see just how bad it was and found almost 100% coverage of dust, mold, and nastiness throughout the system. It was in every bit of the trunk, and every flexpipe throughout the house (See pictures). Even a few of the vent registers had started harboring mold growth which was a really bad sign as well.\n\nSo, I did what any good panicking homeowner would do at that point. Went to Google, pulled up nearby HVAC companies with good reviews that could do duct replacement, and called for appointments for onsite inspections. Out of the four highly reviewed and reputable companies (minus individual contractors) in the Pelham area that actually showed up for their appointment, Autumn Air's rep Baker was the only one who showed up on time, actually visually inspected inside the ductwork even after I showed him the initial pictures I took, and then spent a solid amount of time explaining to me options for replacing the entire ductwork system so we could see about what would be right for our budget. In the end, the price that Autumn Air was able to provide for an upgrade to a new round smooth metal interior and outside insulated wrapped system, including new boots and registers, throughout the entire house, plus a new central AprilAire Space Guard filtration and iWave-R GPS ionization system upgrade (per my request) beat out the one other company who actually sent me a quote by almost half. Let me say that again differently...TWO of the four companies NEVER sent back a quote. This told me that two of the highly reputable companies in the Pelham area that have a high amount of favorable reviews simply did not want a job. Pitiful for them.\n\nFast forward to the install a week later...Led by two guys named Javy and Charles, they took care of making sure everything was treated with care when taking out the old ductwork so as to minimize spreading of dirt and mold as much as could be. Then, they proceeded to assemble and install all of the new system on site for custom fitting plus making sure all seams were taped properly and coated with mastic so that the chances of air leaks past the coils is forever kept at a minimum. They arrived early in the morning, and worked until the job was finished that evening (on the day of Harvey storms coming through too!).  Any questions I had concerning anything with the job was answered and explained with no hesitation on their part.  They went beyond expectations with accommodations and I just can't be any happier.\n\nI can't say it enough in this entire description here how great Autumn Air is for an HVAC company. They want someone's business in the best way because they give the work the best service they can at reasonable prices, and offer great financing options too if needed. They understand how to go the extra mile to make sure the customer is being taken care of in the end as well. I can say I have also had the pleasure of meeting Jeff, the owner, later when he came back to look at a minor issue that crept up post install, and he is just as awesome about discussing more than the \"here's what we'll do\". He takes the time to explain the why and how's (if you are interested to know and ask) and will work with you as a customer to do everything he can within reason to make sure you are satisfied with him and his company. Because of all of these things described about everyone at that company and how we were treated, we now not only have clean, sanitized fresh air, but the confidence to know it will stay that way due to the complete service and professionalism we got from Autumn Air.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMabAWy162GH96gyl3m37sUEbn3lZkhH_QMnw5p=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_X0ScvBCZDov4a77tJ8--jNZxa4SLKPRwf7ZQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2_SRCsbshQYMwunCW_Svt09o-TDruxZ8tozW8=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKpjJ6ZJSD3l76fC4DaZ5moDrfqENk5DrC3V5m=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVryaFeSx9Ipmsmn5UNXwMOBC9HZqnM-6Io7MO=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1593532681755, "text": "Thank you for sharing your review of our company!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888924e52224bd39:0x2e611205e661f050"}

I arm impressed with their work, knowledge, professionalism and honesty. Prices are most fair and they come out when they say they will come out.  Thanks to Corey, we now have AC again less than 36 hours after going down. Oh, and their preventive maintenance plan? Heck, you better jump  all over that, $10 a month auto draft to come out 4x yearly and clean and do PM check is unbeatable. Then when you join, no diagnostic charges when you  call them out, but wait, there's more ! You get a discount on all service  after you sign up !\nReally, $120 a year for the PM plan  ?? i thought he misquoted so I jumped on it but its for real ! Great service, great guy. You rock Corey !

She was very patient with me as I explained what was going on with my unit. I later learned that she obviously had taken really good notes based on the phone conversation I had a day later with the technician (wish I'd gotten his name).\nThe unit in question is at my house that is for sale. The buyer's \"inspector\" (loosely used here) said the unit had a serious problem. I had the unit maintained twice per year (it is important to note that this twice yearly maintenance was not done by Ethridge) for each of the 10 years since the unit was installed so I didn't really believe that much could be wrong with it but was required to have it checked out.\nAfter thoroughly inspecting and testing the unit, the Ethridige technician called to let me know the unit was fine, in fact he found no problems at all.\nHe could have easily gone with what the \"inspector\" said and the repairs or replacement could have made them a lot of money. But, this company chooses ethics and honesty and in doing so earned a customer.\nI recommend this company and I plan to contact them for a maintenance contract for my home because I know these folks will not take advantage of me.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888df6f49a4e087:0xc07a7a3126b15675"}

Scheduled for the next day between 8:00-10:00 AM.  I stayed home from work to meet with the repair man.  Recieved a call shortly after 8:00 to inform me that due to an emergency it would be closer to 10:00 AM and maybe a \"tad\" after before he could get there.  This was fine with me.  10:40 AM had come and gone and nobody had showed up or contacted me.  I called 3D Air Services and all circuits were busy.  I left a message and number to call me back and how nobody has showed up or contacted me.  Never got a call back.  I had to go back to work and decided to call on my way at 12:28 PM.  I get in touch with someone, who asks who I am after explaining how nobody showed up or contacted me.  I hear \"oh yeah....the estimate....\".  She apologizes and explains that there was an emergency and they can have somebody out later that evening.  So after work close to 5:00 PM, the original repair man shows up to do the estimate.  I explain what is wrong with my unit and what I THINK might be going on.  He uses no equipment and only goes into the attic and outside to look at both units, with only pen and paper (NO TOOLS).  I believe he recorded the model information and that was it.  He then basically agrees with one on my suggested problems being that it could be the TXV valve on the inside unit.  He says he is \"95 - 100%\" sure that is what it is.  Used no equipment or tools to verify this would be the fix.  He then left and said he would give me a call this morning with an estimate.  It's now 12:30 PM.  No contact from them still.  Will never use this company.  UNPROFESSIONAL!\n\nEdit (After 3D Air responded):  It is really sad that this company is lying about calling me and leaving me a voicemail with a message on the estimate.  This is completely false!  There is only one number that they have from me.  They did not call.  And how gracious of you guys to not charge for a service call, when he literally just walked in the house with a pen and paper.

So, if an auto center changes your brakes in 30 min but the book says it takes 1.5 hours, then the shop charges you for the extra hour as an extra rake. Now, I do not mind paying the extra as long as the quality matches. This shop may do quick work, but it is not at the quality I am paying for. Poor value given, and they would not make it right either.

They fixed both and stuck to fair estimate.\n\nI wouldn't do business with them now after my last experience.\n\nMonth 1 & 2\nOur car needed a new engine. The shop owner wanted to get an engine from his supplying junkyard. He missed one that became available. This process took about 2 weeks before we decided to find an engine ourselves which he was not happy with but agreed to. He said they could have it put in within a 3 day period. The engine company we bought from needed it done in 10 days for warranty purposes. Griffith used all of the 10 days to because other cars came in front of me while we had to wait on engine. They finally got it in and started but had to send to dealership because the car went into anti-theft mode and wouldn't start. We had to actually arrange the drop off to the dealership ourselves. I feel like we were running his business for him because he was almost never there. The employees even mentioned that problem in passing.\n\nMonth 3\nWe become worried after not hearing anything from dealership or Griffin for about 2.5ish weeks. I had to contact dealership for them to tell me that they told Griffin that the car needed a major fuse panel that could be $1200+. I called Griffin to tell him I approved the install because we really needed the car. It's month 3 folks!\n\nIs it Month 4? Getting close anyway.\nWe had to go ourselves to the dealership to confront them about not getting to our car. This should be Griffin's job. The dealership says that the part didn't fix the problem. Car still doesn't work. We decide to give up because the car needed another part for $2400 to \"maybe\" fix. We decide to just give up. Dealership is trying to get more money from us even though they didn't fix the problem. Griffin is trying to put that on us. We said we would pay for his time, but does this seem fair? Griffin himself might be a knowledgable mechanic, but he is a rookie business owner with no organization or management skills of his people.  He wasted a huge amount of our time (3+months), money ($6000+) and stressed my wife and I to no end. We are going to have to scrap our car with a new engine that doesn't run.\n\nThey do good oil changes and put a muffler on another car we brought, but he also made me pay for the part up front which shows bad business to me as well.\n\n* FINAL RESULT\npaid griffin $1400 because the car ended up not working out. He said he made no money and it would have been $2000 if it had worked + whatever it would be to charge AC. When we walked in to pay he didn't even recognize us. My wife and I talked to this guy several times in person and on phone. The waiting area had mice running around too FYI if you are scared of them. After that we went to the dealer shop that had our car and basically gave it to the tech working on it. he paid for the dealer work and gave us a little cash. When we went to clean the car out I noticed that the driver seat leather looked very dirty and worn.

They were not the cheapest but past experience I had with them I got them to do it. On 1/15/21 they sent out a crew of 2 and started it took them till 1/22/21 to finish. This crew did not do as asked to do as far as what I wanted done, I called valley back to get them to fix the issues and they sent the 2 same guys back out, I assumed everything was fine except for the pad until I went under the house to do some more work and I realized that they didn't fix the problems right. I got back ahold of them and let them know. The service manager said that he would send another crew out to resolve the issue's and apologized for the inconvenience. On 4/28/21 4 guys showed up with one mission in mind and that was to make all the repairs necessary to  my satisfaction which they did, I'm going to call them the A Team which consisted of Vance K, Brandon B, C. J. and Clay P.\nIf I ever need to have any other hvac installs or work on my other houses I will still go back to valley even after the bad experience I had with this one, which is the result of someone not wanting to be proud of their workmanship which does not represent the workmanship and ethics of Valley Heating and Cooling.

And I'm so glad I did. Just minutes after I talked with someone in the office, Gerald called and set up an appointment for that afternoon. He was so nice, listened carefully to everything I wanted in a system, and recommended one that I love. The heat pump is very attractive; it's quiet, runs about half as much as my old system, and has already saved me a significant amount of money, while keeping every room in the house at a consistent and comfortable temperature. He could have set up installation for 2 days later, but that didn't work for me, so we scheduled it for the following week. Vance and Blake, who installed the system, were just as nice and professional as Gerald. They did a super job, finished it in 1 day, and did a fantastic clean-up. Someone from my local electric company came to inspect the work so that I could get a rebate from TVA, and told me that they had done an excellent job. Valley knows what rebates are available, and handled setting that up so that I didn't have to do anything. And a few weeks later, I received a check! This is the best experience I've ever had when having major work done on the house. I wouldn't go to anyone but Valley for my heating and air services. Just wish I could give them 10 stars.

My unit is still under warranty but since they were not the ones to install it they informed me I'd have to pay labor. The first person I talked to wouldn't/couldn't tell me what the labor rate was so I told them I couldn't schedule someone not knowing what I am being charged per hr. Someone else called back and their answer was $65 for service charge plus $265 for swapping a fan motor that took all of 30 min the last time it went out. When I asked why so much they basically said because they have to pay shipping on parts and don't get paid back for that and that they have to purchase upfront and get reimbursed by the manufacturer. So, basically, they were charging me for the parts and shipping all in the \"labor price\" even though my warranty covers the parts. That came straight out of the horses mouth so definitely would not recommend for service if they didn't put your unit in. They'll rip you off, or try at least.

Luckily, we had a warranty through Old Republic, which paid for a replacement unit. Unfortunately, however, the company that Old Republic required us to use for installation was 5 Star Heating and Air Conditioning out of Foley, AL.\n\nOver the past year, we have experienced several issues with our new unit not cooling the house properly. About two months ago, we came home to soggy carpet and buckled wood floors due to the drain pipe for our unit overflowing. My father came by to take a look at the unit and noticed that the \"Safe-T-Switch float valve\", which cuts the unit off if the drain pipe clogs and fills up, was installed ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE UNIT, rendering it completely useless.\n\nWe called 5 Star and they did come out to the house and move the valve to the correct side without charging us, which we felt was the least they could do since their poor workmanship was the cause of this incident. Over the past few weeks, we noticed that our outside unit would randomly cut off during the day, making the house unbearable to be inside. We called 5 Star, and they let us know that it would be $100 to come out and take a look at it. At this point, I decided to call another company to come look at it rather than paying 5 Star.\n\nThe other Service Man came out and took a look at it and noticed that the inside of the pipe that the float valve was attached to was clogged with sealant, preventing the flow of water. (See attached photos) I'm no plumber, but I can tell you that when you put sealant inside the female coupling, and push the male part in, the sealant has nowhere to go but inside the pipe, which prevents the drain pipe from being able to drain water. He replaced the drain pipe, and put the float valve in the correct place, and amazingly, our A/C unit works like new!\n\nI will be sure to let everyone know how much money my \"no-cost warranty replacement\" A/C unit has cost me thanks to 5 Star's sub-par work.\n\nPhoto 1 - Crazy Straw like drain pipe from 5 Star\nPhoto 2 - Sealant inside pipe (photo taken after I punched a large portion of the sealant out of the pipe)\nPhoto 3 - New drain pipe installed by another {competent} A/C Repair company", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfTmZE3Bd42fClrv34oV45AuBHNZQe-gBb-dcw=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1534874112513, "text": "Dane, we are sorry to hear that you were not satisfied with our options for maintenance.
