Today I went to Summit Express Care to have a physical done for a form I needed to fill out. There was a question about the way they bill--I asked them to try to bill through my insurance, and they refused. I decided to go ahead with the process anyway. I was called up and told that because of a previous experience I had, they refused to see me. I was shocked, because while I do remember the receptionist being rude in the past, I did not remember any major altercation. Not to mention, even if I had ever gotten frustrated, I would never have been mean or threatening in any way. I said it was shocking that they would refuse care. based on some past frustration. She said it's a private physician-owned clinic and they can see whomever they want. I asked to speak to the person making the decision and was told it was the physician who owns the clinic. Understand, I have also had good experiences there, so I'm not sure why I didn't get credit for those. Anyway, I was told she refused to see me and was told I could leave my contact information, but with no assurance that I would actually be called. The receptionist told me that it was based on a review I had written before. I cannot find any reviews I have ever written. My husband wrote one based on the same kind of deal with the refusal to even try to work with our insurance process because they think they know what will be covered, 19 months ago. I said, \"I'm sorry, but since I can't even remember what the details are that would prompt me to write a bad review, that happened at least 19 months ago, it would seem that you could let by-gones be by-gones.\" I was told once again they could see whomever they wanted. I was not told what I had written, what the issues were, nor where I had written a negative review.  As I left, I did tell the receptionist that since I was not being given the courtesy of an explanation, that I was left with no choice but to leave a bad review, and she agreed that that would be fine. I would much rather have had a conversation.  As a health care professional myself, I cannot imagine not seeing someone just because they got frustrated one time in the past.  Also, it seems that bad reviews would prompt one to address the issues rather than fire the patients.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918ee5db29991:0x9e3448492f815b84"}

I had made two telehealth appointments last week, and neither time were they returned (I see a negative review about this below, so obviously I'm not the only person this happened to).  Finally, the front desk told me yesterday that they couldn't do a telehealth appointment for my prescription refills and that's why I wasn't called.  I was, as you can imagine, a little miffed.  I can understand if they need to see me, but you don't just \"not call.\" - Let the person know why the telehealth appointment won't work so they can schedule to get in.  In any event, Dr. An personally called me this morning and was apologetic.  Their office has been overwhelmed, and I can understand that.  No place is perfect (I certainly am not, and I make mistakes too).  So - the personal apology goes a long way and speaks well of him.  As I had even said in my negative review, I've been seeing him for a while, and always liked him.  And, my experience with his nurses has always been fine, and I have found them pleasant.  One or two of the front desk staff can be off-putting, but most of them are fine too - and it's hard to find good help these days.  So, overall, I'm changing this review.  Yes, the situation last week (not calling me for my telehealth appointments and not even calling to tell me why, so I could get in) was not professional.  But, again, no place is perfect, and I appreciate the apology and the fact that they were overwhelmed.  Probably the front desk staff needs to be a little better trained and make sure to get back to people if a telehealth appointment is not met (by the Dr.).  But, again, overall, I have been very pleased with Dr. An over the years.  I had even said in my review that I would probably still give him/them another chance - and the personal call from him apologizing and then taking care of my needs and basically conducting the telehealth call right then - certainly corrected the matter, and speaks well of him/the place.  I always appreciate when someone cares enough about a complaint to call and try to make it right.  I'll be sticking with him, and can still certainly recommend him (and have recommended numerous people to him who have become his patients and have also generally been very pleased with him).", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2cf6fafcfea7:0x9cd7e100f64d4b6e"}

I have been going to this office for several years now, and each time I go back, I become more and more disappointed in the staff. Not one person smiled at me or asked me how I was doing- I was treated like I was just another body. I brought my ten month old in to see if she had yet another ear infection, as her pediatrician's office was closed due to it being on a Sunday... I was taken to the back with another patient, and given attitude when they realized my ten month old couldn't STAND for a weight check... finally they got her a pad to sit on, then was immediately told to go to a room, in which a gentleman had JUST walked out of. I questioned whether the room was even clean, and an assistant popped out and very rudely announced- \"YES its clean... that is where I just came from... why is there a problem!?\". I responded to her that I just watched someone walk out of the room while we were getting a weight check, and that I was simply asking a question. I do not believe that to be out of line. I have been in the medical field for over 12 years and have NEVER talked to a patient in response to their VALID concerns about whether a room was clean or not. I would have been fired on the spot if I had responded that way to a patient. I should note the room looked dirty...both trash can lids were left up and there was debris on the counter. The tech came back in to get vitals, which was un- successful because my daughter wouldn't sit still long enough for the monitor to work... so instead of changing the approach she just decided she would tell the doctor she couldn't get it done. Dr. An has always been wonderful- but did not offer an apology for the way his staff treated me- even though he witnessed it and made eye contact with me from his desk in the middle of the op floor. I truly believe any office is only as good as the staff they have working for them, and I hate to say I probably will not endure his staff to see him any longer. It doesn't take much effort to be kind and compassionate- two things the practice website claims they compensate their employees for being.

Lakeshore (Birmingham, AL) location. After arriving just on time for my 11am follow-up appointment with Dr. Richard Crittendon, and paying my $30.00 co-pay up-front, I took a seat in their waiting room. After about five minutes, I was escorted to the back patient area by a nurse who proceeded to weigh me, then take my blood pressure and my temperature. She then took me next door to an exam room to await Dr. Crittendon. \"He'll be with you in a few minutes,\" she said. I sat in that exam room for the next 55 minutes, listening to the nurses' and Dr. Crittendon's voices passing outside the door. AT NO TIME did anyone \"check in\" with me or acknowledge the doctor's tardiness. At 12:05pm, I left the room and attempted to speak with one of the four nurses at their station just outside; however, each one was seated and on the telephone. Eventually, I just explained to the receptionist that I could wait no longer (another appointment was pending), and left the building. Now, I understand that physicians are often over-booked or encounter unexpected issues with their patients, however, I do believe that a modicum of professional attention could have been paid during my almost one-hour wait. But, of course, they did have time to process my debit card for the co-pay.

Not what I was expecting for what I thought was a general \"walk-in clinic.\" I called & made an appointment to meet with Dr. Pink Fulmer.\n\nThis place exceeded my expectations. As it took a few minutes for the front clerk to check me in; it didn't take long (maybe 10-15 mins) before I was being called back. (I am a new patient). The lobby to this office is modern, has plenty of seating, and has a neat \"charging station\" for smart phone users who are running on their last fumes. :) I got called back and the young lady who took my blood pressure/weight was really nice. We talked briefly of the symptoms and she got me back into my private waiting room.\n\nIt wasn't long before Dr. Pink was in my room talking to me and asking me about my symptoms and conditions. He has a very calming and relaxing personality which puts a nervous person like me to ease. He truly seemed to care about my concerns and listened to all of my worries about my \"condition.\" He gave me a thorough examination, and even had some tests/xrays done that made me feel a lot better about what I \"thought\" was happening to my body.\n\nHe thoroughly went over my results and overall I was really pleased with he and all of his medical assisting staff. They were all really nice as I was super nervous about even being there. (I rarely go to the doctor). I also ended up getting a flu shot while I was there, and the girl who did it (med assistant) was sweet and did the deed quick and painless.\n\nI was sad to learn that Dr. P. Fulmer will be retiring sometime this year; but I really liked this office and will give their other doctors a shot. Fast and convenient!\n\nI also visited their in-house pharmacy (Rx Pharmacy) and I was thoroughly pleased. They were extremely quick and you can't get any better than picking up your prescriptions up at the same time you saw your doctor. It was cheap and the Pharmacy Owner (can't remember his name) was so down to earth and really pleasant to deal with.\n\nOverall, really pleased with this medical experience and glad to know I have this great place so close to where I live!! :) My husband and I will be using them as our PCP.\n\n**Side note** They also do walk-in's!! So if you are considering this as a walk-in option; try it. It's just as good (in my opinion better!!) than your typical \"American Family Care!\"\n\nThanks MEDHELP LAKESHORE!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888919257e0ece15:0xdc0c6a1e158e008f"}

Prior to that, I had to get a steroid shot and a week after the shot, the spot became infected and growing large and swollen and filled with green puss. I had covered it with bandaid and washed it normal as I always have.

The doctor perscribed two medications without having a diagnosis. The nurses at the checkout were very rude and sent me back in for a doctors excuse for missing work and had to wait 10 minutes while the nurses and Doctor ate their Arby's in front of me for me to get excuse. They were telling each other to make it for me, which I felt like my time was not worth theirs. The doctor said he assumed it was the flu and perscribed me two medications when it was not after further test results at another clinic. The doctors perscribed medications that were not covered by my insurance and also perscribed a medication I did not show symptoms of even needing that drug. The billing associate was also extremely rude after two days of trying to contact the office with no call back. After finally reaching the billing office and paying the bill for tests that were not even able to be useful since they took longer to show results for than the time of being there, hung up on me at the end of the conversation without thanking for even using their clinic. I work in customer service and rate this clinic overall as a one out of five because of the doctors and nurses. The only thing I cared for about this facility is that it was that it was clean.

I showed up to this urgent care to get refills on my medications, because I had moved to Wetumpka a couple days prior. They were not prompt in acknowledging my arrival into the waiting room, but eventually, one of the two ladies stopped gabbing and asked if they could helped me. I explained that I needed medication refills, and they asked what medications I was on in front of all the other patients in the waiting room. I am not shy about the medications I'm on, but some people are, and they should be sensitive to that. I told them, and they informed me that they don't have primary care physicians, and that they generally don't write prescriptions except for things such as sports injuries or general illnesses that pop up in daily life. I understand that, and said that was fine, I could find somewhere else to go, but they seemed upset at that prospect, and said they would ask the doctor on call if he would make an exception and asked me to fill out paperwork while they asked him. I did, and the doctor said he would make an exception, so I waited and filled out the paperwork to be seen. I waited a good while in the exam room, and when the doctor finally came in, he ho-hummed about giving the medicine that he supposedly had told the office staff he would give me with no problem. He finally asked me if I had enough to patch me over, and I informed him that I did not, so he wrote me the prescription (with refills, so he must not have had too much of a problem prescribing it), and sent me on my way. I left on my merry way, said good-bye to the office staff on my way out, and headed to the pharmacy to fill my prescriptions. Upon handing over the prescription, however, it was discovered that the doctor had given me an *unsigned* prescription! I'm fairly certain that could have ended very badly for him, had I chosen to make it, but since I needed those medications, I grumpily brought the prescription back to the now-busy urgent care, waited about fifteen minutes for the office staff to again acknowledge my existence at their window, and then get them to have the doctor sign his own prescription, that he had issued and sent into the world to have done who knows what with without his signature, begging to have fraudulence done in his name. So he signed it, and I filled the prescription, but the nonsense did not end there. Beyond all of that, I got a voicemail, without my phone ever ringing, which I'm sure was not their fault, but the fault of my phone, but the voicemail said something to the effect that they had made me an appointment that I had not asked for that I would be charged for if I did not show up for at an arbitrary date and time, and to call or come by if this was an inconvenience, and leaving no phone number to call back. I then got a letter in the mail, stating the date and time of this arbitrary appointment I had not asked them to make for me, which I was to be charged for if I no-showed on, that had a number to call if I wanted to cancel the appointment. I called the number, and it brought me to a busy signal, which hung up on me after five seconds each time I called (I tried this three times before coming on Google to look up their actual number to call and ream them out). Supposedly, they have cancelled this bogus appointment that they made for me. My question is: why do they make appointments at all, if they do not do primary care, and are supposedly only available for sports injuries and normal day to day illnesses? Do people nowadays schedule their injuries and illnesses? Why on earth would they schedule me an appointment in the first place, let alone without my asking for them to do so? Avoid this establishment at all costs. If you are looking for a place to receive urgent care or primary care, try PriMed that's right next to Walmart, right up the road. They actually respect their customers, do not make you appointments you never asked for, sign their prescription pads, do not ho-hum about writing you life-saving prescriptions, and treat you like a human being.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c27cb64f2a3e7:0xb33b4b7ec9f29b18"}

I never got a call back.....I go to the office again to verify the phone number they had on file and of course it was wrong. I explain about the prescription being called in and the receptionist says I will have to wait on a call back and it may not be until Monday and its a Friday 12/8. I ask her, so you're telling me you know my number was in the system wrong and you can't tell me why I have meds called in?? Then some one comes out and says you have a UTI. She didnt introduce herself, No apology, no empathy.....I have been suffering for 9 days, and the attitude is....oh well.  I will never visit this office again.

The day I was to go they called me and asked me to come the next day which was New Year\u2019s Eve . They said someone didn\u2019t take it out of the freezer. Ok then the next day I went as I was told, it took a while but I was ok with that because it was new. They were nice and apologized because they were \u201c learning\u201d and that\u2019s fine. Well I was suppose to go Thursday the 28 but I told them I work out of town that day but I could get there by 6:00pm. The nurse said just come Friday morning, we are open half a day, ok that\u2019s fine. So today I tried to register just as I was told to do and it didn\u2019t have an option for Covid follow up so I called the office, explained it to the nurse she said let me call you right back. Ok, I waited and waited, finally someone from CORPORATE called me explaining they didn\u2019t have anymore vaccine to give. WHAT?? She started out telling me well you were suppose to be here yesterday. I stopped her and said hold on , I told the nurse I could come but it would be 6:00 and she told me to come the next day,I even called WEDNESDAY and told them again I could come but again I was told to come Friday!  I didn\u2019t do that on my own! She said well she didn\u2019t have the authority to tell you that. After going back and forth she said she was gonna have to find me a vaccine and it would take her a week! So guess what Iam not a happy camper. I told her Iam in healthcare and I am pretty upset for being able to get it because if their mistake. Am I wrong for this??

I actually prefer to go here than to my regular doctor because they are so kind, fast, and thorough. My regular doc may have more equipment at her fingertips. But I feel like these folks care more.\n\n2 years ago: I've been here twice so far. Once for a back injury that could have been serious and they sent me straight to E.R. at no charge for the visit to the clinic telling me to go now. The doc didn't charge because he wanted us to feel less of a financial struggle and resistance to going right then. Second time, my husband had pneumonia and I was with him. Both times, they thoroughly explained what all the potentials were sac answered all of my questions. They even worked with us on pricing the second time. I saw a previous review claiming racism.

However, the doctor there could see there was obviously something wrong with me. So when the test came back negative, she took the time to check a few more things to see what I needed. Just a reminder, we are in the middle of a pandemic, so I was expecting to be shuffled in and out fairly quickly. But the staff kept me there until they narrowed down the problem. My test was negative, but I do have bronchitis with an upper respiratory infection, which is why I was showing similar symptoms to COVID.\nThe called in my prescriptions  to the pharmacy and told me if I didn\u2019t show signs of improvement to come back.\nOverall, yes... there was a wait.

The appointment was for 12:08 today. I arrived at about 12:00 exactly. After checking in, I waited until about 12:40. At that time, I inquired about how much longer the wait would be. The receptionist, in turn, said (with a very outlandish tone), \u201cI don\u2019t determine how long it takes to have a test! Just because you schedule an appointment at 1:00 doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll get seen when you get here!\u201d I asked if there was someone else she could ask. Her response was \u201cNo, we don\u2019t know!\u201d I explained my situation and asked if the wait is usually that long each day. She made a point to tell me that she doesn\u2019t know how long it\u2019ll be each day. I said, \u201cWell thanks didn\u2019t answer my question but ok.\u201d I was led to believe that she wasn\u2019t interested in helping me and didn\u2019t care to display great customer service.

I can\u2019t say the same for this newest company; they left me in just about the same shape as when I went in, and $140.00 poorer.\n\nFirst, I was so sick (flu) that I wasn\u2019t thinking straight and didn\u2019t bring the right purse; I didn\u2019t have my physical insurance card. But I have a pic of it, front and back, and knew (ahem...ASSumed) they had my records from the many past visits. Didn\u2019t think there\u2019d be a problem. WRONG on so many levels. They refused to take the pics of my card\u2026which all they were going to do was take a pic (copy) of a \u201creal\u201d card. They could have verified its authenticity several ways but chose not to.\n\nThen they said they had no records of my past visits!!  They weren\u2019t going to see me at all.!!!!!  I finally told her to just pretend that I didn\u2019t HAVE insurance. \u201cOh.\u201d  Really?!!?  So I paid the $140.00.\n\nMy asthma had my breathing so tight that I could hardly walk the short distance to the room. I had finally got to where I could take enough of a breath to use my inhaler, and that\u2019s what enabled me to get TO the clinic and to the room; I was truly in need of a breathing treatment. Didn\u2019t get one. Doctor said I didn\u2019t need one because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t hear me wheezing\u201d. I reminded him that I had just, in the last 30 minutes, used my inhaler, and THAT is why he didn\u2019t hear me wheezing, but told him I DID need a breathing treatment. Wouldn\u2019t give me one. UNbelievable.\n\nI have had asthma for probably longer than he\u2019s had his MD....I KNOW my body. I KNEW I needed a breathing treatment! So \u201cno shot and no help for my asthma\u201d later, I left with a Rx for the FLU, and a work note for 3 days later (Monday), because I \u201cshould be able to go back to work by then\u201d, which I wasn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t return until Wednesday.\n\nPoor, poor excuse of a doctor\u2019s office.

You'd think if I'm capable of googling this, a nurse practitioner would have certainly recognized the symptoms and learned about it in school. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f  She was actually kind of rude, didn't listen to me (obviously) and seemed more concerned with the little brown flecks I have in my irises. Seriously?! I was given antibiotics but should have gotten an antiviral medicine. Timing is crucial with this, and since I didn\u2019t start the medicine in a timely manner, it\u2019s going to take twice as long to heal, and I could lose vision in my eye. This place is probably okay for kids ear infections, bronchitis, etc., but that\u2019s it. I won\u2019t be going back.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d4f36e9cc2e9d:0x7fa635a9ce0b42b4"}

My MA/Nurse was Ashley and she is incredibly kind. The NP I saw was Sabrina and she in knowledgeable. The only recommendation I have is for the gal up front to wear her mask correctly and be a tad friendly. She\u2019s a little robotic in her voice with every patient (\u201c name? ID and insurance card. Sign here...\u201d with no change in tone). Overall, I now recommend as they have a much better method to the madness still plaguing the world \u263a\ufe0f\n\nI made an appointment online, and when I arrived there was a line of people out the door. I tried to call the office number several times to check if there was a protocol for those who made an appointment. Reluctantly, I just went in to ask if there was another waiting area or if should go back to my care for those who have appointments, I was essentially shoo\u2019d away. I was told to go wait back in line. The receptionist is not very personable. When another person came up and asked why we were all standing outside, we said it was the waiting line and proceeded to ask if we had an appointment - literally all 5 people said no exempt me. It wasn\u2019t until it was my turn to come up, in the line that I was given paperwork. All the people in front of me who I heard say they didn\u2019t have an appointment were seen before me and I didn\u2019t get in the door until 30 minutes after my appointment - online does say it\u2019s only a tentative appointment but I still don\u2019t understand why those with no appointment were seen before me. It was a waste for me to even make an appointment if I was just going to be treated as if I was a walk-in. I\u2019m on day 6 of waiting for results and I\u2019ve called several times  over the last two days (I was told between 3-7 days for results) and left two messages and no one has answered or returned my call. The only two stars I\u2019m giving are because the assistant who did my swap  was super gentle and the nurse practitioner, is kind.\nI\u2019m really not sure what the rave was about this place but I honestly would not recommend.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1618852722455, "text": "Hi Samantha!

My wife and I were traveling to another country and had to have detailed information on a Covid test. We were very specific with what we needed when we were being tested and assured that we would receive this. When we went to pick up our results on Friday, 9/18, we were handed a document that I could have created on Microsoft Word with a faded letter head. When we asked about what we were told being included, the office staff acted incredibly put out and irritated about our request. They hand wrote all of the information on the incredibly unprofessional document and said that was the best they could do. I went back to the office the next day where I found Tara at the front desk. After explaining our situation, Tara empathetically addresses the situation and provided me with the exact document that we had to provide to customs for our trip. I was in the office for less than 5 minutes and got exactly what I needed. Why this required two trips is confusing, but if not for Tara, we would have missed our deadline for travel approval, all because of the laziness and lack of customer service we received from the staff present on 9/18, including the assistant manager. Tara was by far the most professional employee we dealt with from multiple phone calls, to 3 visits at Southern Immediate Care in Anniston. My 5 stars are for Tara.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bb31212b8c569:0xf43ab7013cbaf7a8"}

The cough medicine had absolutely no effect and after finishing to round of antibiotics there was no change in my cough and it has only gotten worse. I called up there to see if they could potentially reexamine me. Unlike every other urgent care that I have ever been to they told me I would be charged a copay to be reexamined. If I had known this was their policy I would have gone to an urgent care in Auburn like I usually do as they care more about me getting better than me paying a copay and don't charge one for reexaminations. They did call in a new cough medicine prescription however it is a decongestant even though I have absolutely no congestion symptoms. It was also not covered by my insurance so I was forced to pay out of pocket. I will not be returning to this urgent care in the future.

Their building is nice and clean. They have complimentary water/juices/coffee. They even have other snack items that you can purchase. The wait time is short.

They accept medicaid unlike most urgent care centers which is caring in itself! But best of all these wonderful people actually do a follow up call to check on you 2 to 3 days after your visit and even if everything is going well they ask you to call back if anything changes. I can honestly say i love them!!! Laneir Hospital sucks (negligent and life threatning misdiagnosis', rude, long wait) -please avoid them and make mainstreet your place for emergency health issues!

I went back to the lobby and sat down. I was in there going on another 30 minutes and asked the receptionist if my meds would be ready soon. She was very rude!!!

I pleaded to her to change my daughters prescription over to what my husband and I were taking which is not against the law nothing illegal and she could have totally made me feel better as mother and understand ultimately I know my daughter best, she is not just a math equation.\nEverything I said to her she used words like \"debunked\", when I am the paying customer.\nI was shocked.\nJust because what I was requesting did not fall into her agenda and I pleaded with her, she chose not to make me assured as a parent my daughter is getting  the right treatment. Not to mention she wrote my daughter for an inhailer and no one even listened to her lungs. Using an inhailer when you don't need it can cause more damage than good.\nAfter I stated that fact, she then listened to my daughters lungs and said she sounded clear.\nI am so appalled by her lack of bedside manner and inability to connect with the concerns and needs of the patients.\nOn our previous visit we were invited to sign the kiosk about our experience. Today Donna Conway made sure to skip that option. When I asked the front desk receptionist to please load the kiosk for me it only allowed me to enter 1 as my satisfaction, when I went type the reason why, someone conveniently shut it off and the receptionist could not reload it.\nSo there's that.\nIf this Donna Conway continues to be employed at your establishment, I will make it my daily mission to make sure through ALL of my media connections that people call first and only visit the Care Center when Troy is working.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889046071922300f:0x23b6c7003fb99cdc"}

I paid the $150 up front, then a couple of months later got a bill for his flu and strep tests, this should be included in the up front fee. My real disagreement is that they charged for both Flu A and Flu B, when i know it is the same test.  When I asked the billing associate to remove the charge she became extremely rude and said the insurance \"required\" her to charge that way.  The insurance told me it is up to their discretion, but they can charge for each to make more money.  After the way the horrid lady spoke to me we will never go back.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0e160192c0e9:0x50027b6ef29e5372"}

This place would never get a dime from him after that.  This place will be out of business soon enough with that kind of business model and price gouging for a simple walk-in exam.

But he had asked me was I feeling better I told him yes and proceeded to ask him about getting a  refill on my pain meds he said that I would  have to see the head doctor  for that I replied ok but asked him if he could write me chantix to stop smoking thn he proceeded to leave the room with a yes reply so I was happy to know I would  soon be a nonsmoker  I was just letting  him know about me needing to  quit , and be for I could say thank you he put his hands up in the air and replyed very hastily and snapped at me with these words I will never for get them either ( I  just cant deal with any of your problems  cause I deal anuff with  mine . ) I stopped so sudden and with shock and embarrassment cause I wasnt telling  him  anything about my problems so I walked to my door of the room I felt my emotions in my throat and I new I was fixing to bust into tears cause this doctor had no clue of what\nI went through weeks prior to  my 2ND.\nVisit   he spoke real loud then at me replying dont leave that room and step into the hall way to the nurses desk  and I wasnt goin to the nurses  station  and it struck me that I would be better off if I left and set up an appointment with  the head doctor!! But B4 i opened up the door to the lobby  area  he spoke loudly and hateful (DON'T  YOU LEAVE, YOU GET BACK HERE , IF YOU DONT YOU WILL NOT GET YOUR PRESCRIPTION ) But I was already embarrassed and felt awful and I told him I will just see the head doctor for my prescription and that he had no right to speak to me that way and I would  make sure I asked who was the doctor on duty  so  I would  never be seen by him ever again.  I never received a  apologie from him still to this day and I never did get to see the head doctor . Cause he put a complaint in  on me and the head doctor had a nurse to serve me with a  disclaimer that I was not to come back to any of the emergency  and urgent  care clinics  in   Tuscaloosa   so I still to this day wonder what his complaint  about me that was so extreme for me to be denied service for ever . All I done was leave because iv been physically, ppl and mentally ,emotionally abused all my life even as a child . And he had abused me mentally and emotionally  that it affected me  physically\" but he never took any blame or owed up to the medical  board about what he done ,and acted towards me and what manner he spoke to me . But iam still punished for  his abuse towards me .so I hope no one else has or have to go through what I did tht day . I NEVER WAS ASKED , OR SPOKEN TO BY ANYONE ABOUT THAT DAY . SO YOU ALL BETTER HOPE THAT YOUR NOT  BEING HATED ON FOR SPEAKIN  ur amendment rights !!!!!!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a80695abb303:0x438a521ad0731224"}

I wanted to get her tested for COVID because her mom was not following any guidelines. We called our doctor and they said they could only test her if she was showing signs. So we asked around and this place was suggested. I do their online sign-up and go up there to get her tested. I called thinking someone would come out to test her like every other place. They asked me to come in. Why would they want to expose their patients and staff to someone who may have COVID. This did not make sense to me. So I asked why they were not doing some of the safety stuff like our doctor's office. The lady at the front desk got mad. Told me I could go find another place if I have a problem. Then she said I must be having a bad day. I told her I was not having a bad day. I was just curious about why they were not doing the drive-by test. She said again if I didn't like it I could go to another place. After that rudeness things went well. A nurse came and got us and showed us to a room. She did the test and I thought that was it. Nope. They wanted her to see the doctor/other nurse. I asked why. They said it was mandatory. She came in and asked a few questions and listened to her chest. I was thinking why would they be doing all of this extra stuff. A lot of unnecessary contact with people. I concluded that it was to get more money out of the visit. My wife got the test done at our doctor's office. She got tested in the parking lot and didn't need to see anyone else. This company needs to be checked for fraud. Do to the receptionist rudeness alone, I would not recommend this place to anyone. I know I will not be going back.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ced8755137c5d:0x7d3e91a6327541d4"}

I saw the female nurse practitioner and she took such good care of me and was very professional during my visit, so I knew I would go back in the future.\nHowever, I went back today after class and work because I've been having difficulty breathing for 2 days, heavy wheezing all day yesterday and last night, dizziness, and bad chest pain which just came on today- so I immediately was worried about my asthma. The doctor who came in (tallish, brunette, male, 30's) just listened to my lungs and said-with the most smug attitude- that I was fine and there was nothing wrong.\nObviously I wouldn't be in there at 6:30 pm if something wasn't wrong; I have better things to do with my time.\nWhen I told him how concerned I was & how I was having trouble breathing he told me just to take my inhaler (which I've been doing for 2 days without much help).\nTHIS WAS WHEN IT GOT RIDICULOUS: when I asked for a chest x-ray (just to be sure/for my own peace of mind) he just stared at me, then LITERALLY threw his hands up, swung the door open and marched out like a 5 year old. I was appalled to have seen a medical physician act so unprofessional AND in front of a patient. Moments later, I could hear him telling another staff member about how some 'stupid patient was asking for a X-ray just because she was having chest pain' and the other staff member saying 'oh my gosh, are you serious??'\nI KNOW, THE NERVE I MUST HAVE TO ACTUALLY WANT TO KNOW WHY IT FEELS LIKE IM SUCKING IN AIR IN THROUGH A STRAW.  -- Someone I grew up with died 2 years ago at the age of 20 from having a blood clot in her chest and that's why I wanted to take extra precautions when I started having difficulties breathing and then chest pain.--\nI was so astounded and felt humiliated to hear them talking about this right outside (keep in mind he had swung the door wide open so I could hear every word they were saying) so I just got up and told him not to worry about it, and that I was sorry for taking away his time and for actually asking him to do his job. I never once had an attitude with this doctor before that moment (I had zero reason to have an attitude towards him beforehand when I actually came in because I had such a good experience in the past). But the entire time he was talking to me it felt like he was just outrageously condescending or like he didn't actually know what the hell he was even talking about. I honestly don't know why he's even a doctor when he hates dealing with worried patients all day. Get a new job. I've had asthma my entire life. I wouldn't have gone in after a 12 hour class/work day & paid a $40 copay just because of chest pain if I wasn't seriously concerned about it. But it seems as though he couldn't care less about the health of his patients.

The doctor came in quickly, asked a few vague questions about my health, listened to my chest, said I had an upper respiratory infection and prescribed a steroid and a cough syrup equivalent to Nyquil and Sudafed that cost $50. Needless to say, I didn't get it filled. I was in and out in 45 minutes, but I won't be back.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ced8755137c5d:0x7d3e91a6327541d4"}

Friday we went to Decatur and on the way back I developed a migraine. I live in Florence, and I didnt think I was going to make it in time to go to my primary so I stopped at Med Plus since I used to go there when I lived in Muscle Shoals. I explained I had a migraine and was starting to feel nauseous, and seen the doctor.  All was going well as I thought, but certainly not feeling it. The doctor said he would send the nurse in and give me something.  But as I found it they didn't give me anything at all. They gave me a placebo.  I learned that after I received my blank shot and I was walking out the door. I heard both nurses talking behind me. One asking 'aren't we supposed to have her wait 15 minutes before leaving'?, and the other shaking her head. On top of that I had to pay for your performance.  I could only assume it was because you had seen the sores on my arms. They were in fact my psoriasis that had been scratching. You see I have a photosensitivity condition that makes me allergic to sun.  Just a few days prior I was out in the sun all afternoon working in the yard, and one day assembling patio furniture.  If you would have only asked, instead of coming to a bad conclusion of your own causing me to suffer even more.  After I left there, I immediately began throwing up, and did so for the next 14 hours.  I threw up atleast 20-25 times, so much so I burned the back of my throat and was unable to eat the next day.  My family begged me through the night to let them take me to the emergency room.  But why would I do something as silly as that? For more top treatment? Because I was under the assumption you had given me something for a migraine, I did not take anything further for pain when I got home.  Although I felt all along you didnt give me anything, I had to be safe and not take anything just in case.  You are a disgrace to doctors.  Instead of not causing more harm, you caused much more harm.  And I hope that my daughter becomes the doctor that you can't achieve to be.  I hope she learns understanding and empathy,...

This confused because it is listed on their site they can treat ingrown toenails.\n\nIt was treated and it was painful.  I was told the proper care,  Ina small dose.  But what really surprised me was the lack thereof of a bandage. No ointment was placed on it after it,  but a guaze and a single bandaid was placed on my big toe.  It did not stay on long and started to peel off after an hour,  thus more infection invitation.\n\nAfter that ordeal,  I go to pay and I am hit with a twenty buck charge for my blood work.

The nurses are instructed to run order tests (technically under the doctor's orders) before the doctor actually speaks to or looks at you -  this happened to me multiple times. Each time, a nurse has told me that the test are \"protocol\" and I can't turn them down - after I signed a patient's bill of rights, containing a clause stating that a patient can refuse any medical care - which is federal law. I had to argue with a nurse to turn down a chest x-ray for a minor sore throat. First, I asked why- she said that it will detect bronchitis. A quick google search told me that it bronchitis shows up on a chest x-ray about 25% of the time. It also informed me that I didn't have any symptoms of bronchitis. Turns out that they also ran a completely unnecessary white blood cell count test, which the doctor told me would not have affected his treatment, regardless of the result (after the fact). The doctor actually looked at me after this ordeal. He was able to tell me that I had an ear infection after a 2-minute physical examination. None of the three protocol tests were in any way necessary.\n\nIn a separate incident, there was another minor sore throat that had persisted for 2 weeks, accompanied by a couple bumps under the tongue. The nurse followed protocol and said they were running 3 tests, including a strep test. I declined this, only to be told in an extremely rude manner - by a different nurse this time -  that it is \"protocol\" and I can't change protocol. I reminded her that her protocol is internal, and it can certainly be deviated from. In fact, it is federal law.\n\nMy insurance company was actually billed for the 2nd incident (I was billed for a small portion as well). I went to the office to request a refund for myself and my insurance company - only to be told by the head nurse that they can't do it. Of course after digging deeper - she literally meant that they can't refund, but their billing company can. This was only the beginning of the battle of semantics. She also told me that she I can't speak to her manager, because she is the head nurse and the manager. After discussing further, I learned that she does have a boss (surprise!). She finally agreed to email him/her and have them contact me the next day. That was a week ago...\n\nPlease understand that this is one of the most important factor in rising health care costs and boycott this place.

Unfortunately, I developed Thrush when I was put on strong Antibiotics. I called when I discovered my tongue was covered in white, and i was told that I didn't need to come in, that they would just phone it in for me. I waited a few hours and nothing.. I called and I was told it was phoned in. I asked them which prescription was phoned in, and when she checked my files, she said \"Oh, it hasn't been done yet..\"  I was assured someone would call me back in 30 minutes, which didn't happen. I then called back in and was again given the run around.. I told her I expected an update ASAP, and if they didn't have one, I'd call back in. Well, needless to say, they didn't give me one. I called back at 4pm - almost 6 hours after my initial call and was told \"it's in the doctors file and they're waiting for him to approve it, which he will in between patients..\" The next day, at 11am, I called back to find out what was going on. I was then told that the doctor that was now there didn't feel comfortable prescribing me an anti-fungal cream because of the legal risk - like I'm going to be freebasing Nystatin?!? They gave me two antibiotics, including Levoquin.. How could I not develop Thrush? All they cared about was getting my $$.. No one bothered to call me once. I had to call them a total of 4 times to eventually be told that they wouldn't help me unless I came in.. The irony is I OFFERED TO COME IN ORIGINALLY AND THEY TOLD ME IT WOULDN'T BE NECESSARY!!!

He is a very caring, kind, and thorough doctor and I couldn't be happier with my choice. I have seen other doctors and nurse practitioners there and have been very impressed with them too. And the entire staff is awesome! I was so happy with them that I sent my sister there and Dr. McVeigh has gone above and beyond to help her when no one else would. I can not say enough good things about him! I have never had longer than a 15 minute wait in the waiting room or exam room but you never feel like they are rushing you in and out like so many doctors offices.

This urgent care center has poor performance across the board. I went to see Dr. McKitty today, because I was suffering from severe nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and cold sweats. I am severely afflicted by GERD, and flare-ups like these occur on a semi-regular basis. It took me over an hour to be seen by the physician, though there were only 2 people in front of me in line. All the while I was vomiting and losing precious fluids. When I finally got to see McKitty, she had a smirk on her face and a terrible attitude from the start. I patiently answered her questions, and then I told her about my history of going to urgent care centers over the years for these flare-ups. I told her that I am usually given a saline IV and a shot of Promethazine when I have these flare-ups. To which she replied, \u201cI will not be giving you Promethazine, and you can leave and have a refund if you don\u2019t like that.\u201d I was appalled by the rudeness of this exchange, but more than that I was in shock that this person claims to be a doctor, yet clearly has no fidelity for the Hippocratic Oath. I spent the rest of the day fighting nausea, dehydration, and cramps all over my entire body. I was able to get Promethazine, which I am prescribed, from my family when I got home, but it took over 9 HOURS for me to stop vomiting and be able to get food down. I needed the Promethazine in shot form, which is why I go to Urgent Care centers across the USA. I\u2019ve been to at least a couple dozen of these centers over the past 7 years for these flare-ups, and I have NEVER been turned down for wanting Promethazine in order to relive my nausea anywhere from South Carolina to California.

And not that long ago my step son came here because some issues with his shoulder and the doctor here at Alexandra had x-rays done and comes back and says nothing is wrong with his shoulder and then she sends him to do therapy. Well his pain got worse so we took him to get another opinion and the other doctor done some x-rays of his shoulder and come back in and said it's pretty clear that a bone in his shoulder was shattered and he needed surgery. This doctors office here in Alexandria is the worst in every way possible and then some. This place should not even be open for business. People come here for help. And with every person that is on this staff does not need to be in this field. I know I've said it but this is the worst place ever.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a4afd39cac8bb:0x15067a8dec573002"}

You would think they could have a little compassion on someone that is disabled and living just off Social Security and has low income!

When they finally called me back at 718 I was told all they would do would be to send me to the ER.  This is after a UAB surgeon told me not to go to the ER.

My first review is still correct for my first visit. My second visit went a lot worse (different doctor treated me). She didn't care what about anything I said relating to what I came in for. She preformed an incision and drainage procedure with very little numbing agent. When I expressed this via my screams in pain , she didn't care. She just had people hold me down to the table. She proceeded to pack the area but i was in to much pain so she stopped and said \"I'm not putting anymore because you don't seem to tolerate this part well (mentioned this part because in my discharge paperwork she said I tolerated everything well & there was no problems).

He also said I deserved an answer for this.\nAbout a half hour went by and Brittany, the office manager called me apologizing for the mistake and said this test never should have been ran. But then she retracted and stated it was protocol when a teenager comes in because \"teenagers won't tell the truth when their parents are there with them!\" This was so alarming to me. Brittany then made an ignorant statement that since my teenage child had pain in her chest that it was just their protocol to test for opiates!  I explained that ALL ages of human beings can do opiates so protocols shouldn't apply \"just\" to teenagers. Let's all keep in mind results were NEGATIVE.\nOverall, I feel this test was ran to get unnecessary funds from the insurance company and what made it worse was Brittany.

My granddaughter had fever, sore throat and body aches.  I had severe headache and body aches as well. I had looked up and noticed AFC was open at 8am and was very thankful. (We arrived around 8:30) Only 2 cars in the parking lot at the time.  As we were signing in,  one person came out that had been seen by the NP that was on call.  I was finally taken back to be triaged and put in a room.  My daughter and granddaughter were still in waiting room for another 10 mins or so before they were taken back to be triaged and put into a room.\n\nOnce in a room, I waited for a little while and the NP came in and saw me.  She was great! She told me someone would be in to swab me for the flu and strep. Head hurting, lying on the bed...all I heard was talking and laughing coming from the nurses station.  Waited for what seemed like forever...still no one shows up to check on me.  I go to the restroom across the hall from my room and came back out to the nurses sitting at the station talking about Thanksgiving, shopping, etc. I then asked if my orders to be swabbed had been sent to them.  They all opened their laptops and said oh yes, here it is. \"Someone will be with you in a moment\".  Then a moment of silence from them and then the chattering back and forth began again.\n\nA couple of minutes later the nurse that came in was Kia, very sweet and kind.  I had not met or even saw her until she came into do the swab. She did apologize for the delay and said that she had previously been in with another patient. I laid my head back down and then texted by daughter a few minutes later and asked her if my granddaughter had been swabbed as well.  She said she had not been.  I then went back outside my door and asked if anyone had been in to swab by granddaughter and was told yes...without even giving them her name at first. My daughter heard them bold face lie to me.  I told them that I knew that no one had been in there to swab her and expected it to be done ASAP because she was very sick. A \"professional\" to lie to my face is repulsive.\n\nAgain Kia, was the nurse sent into the room to do the swab.  After the test came back on me, a totally different nurse came into the room and gave me my shots.  I never saw one of the ones sitting at the desk again.  That is where they stayed.  My granddaughter finally received her diagnosis as strep and was also given a shot.  The shot was given by Kia.\n\nWhere were all the other nurses that had nothing to do but sit around the desk and chit chat all morning?  For us being the only patients there during all of this time, it should not have taken 2 hours. I don't mind waiting at all if there is a good reason but this particular day and location, there was no reason for this to be a 2 hour visit.

Them called in medicine that was wrong. The amount of insulin they called in for me to take would have killed me. Thank goodness the pharmacist caught it, however it took 3 days to get the doctor to fix it. So I went 3 days without insilin. Then he didn't call in the needles for the insulin pens. I called for those and they called in syringes instead of pen needles like I asked for. So again another night without insulin. When they finally got it right I was told to find a primary care doctor to handle all the issues I have. They are supposed to be my primary care doctor now. The issues I have are that they can't get anything right with my prescriptions. I'm not the problem here.

I was told by one of the office personnel that \"for insurance plans with high deductibles we charge $100.\" In my insurance booklet from BCBS it says my Co pay for an urgent care center is $50. After telling her that we have a $300 per person deductible, she told me I was wrong and that my deductible was $7800 or $7900 which isn't true. If I could post photos of our State Employee Insurance Board book from BCBS Alabama it plainly states that we each have a $300 per person deductible per calendar year, I would. We have a $7800 Maximum out of pocket cost for one person and $14500 for a family, but she clearly stated deductible. I'm going to assume they were talking about our maximum out of pocket costs instead of deductible, but even then, that shouldn't be something that urgent care centers even consider.\n\nI went to Eastern Shore Urgent Care Center in November or December and they didn't bill me $100 for seeing the doctor. I paid a $50 copay. I am going to go back to that one even though it is out of my way. Always be sure to look at your insurance booklet and read it every year for updates. There are some doctors offices and urgent care centers that will try to charge you more.\n\nEdit: I went to Eastern Shore Urgent Care center and my co pay was $35. I called and confirmed with BCBS that my deductible isn't in the $7000s. I'm not sure if she misread my insurance or what happened, but I shouldn't have to pay extra for services that my insurance MIGHT not cover. They are basically saying that they are going to charge you extra because you may not pay your bill for services rendered so we will have an account. I would rather go to an urgent care center where I'm billed a Co pay and then sent a bill for extra services that my insurance didn't cover.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1549662264015, "text": "Kelsey Herring, we regret to hear that you had a negative experience with us, but would appreciate the chance to turn your experience around.

Even with long wait times the care was worth it. I don't know what changed but I wish they would undo it.\nMy last visit, I was given a prescription and told at the pharmacy that they do not carry that medicine and I should talk to the clinic about a substitution. Only the clinic would not answer after trying for some time and during the middle of their posted business hours. I finally drove back to the clinic to talk to someone. There was no line or packed waiting room. Absolutely no idea why no there was no answer.\nI read my  instructions when I got home. They were different than the in person instructions. No answer again, so no clarification.\nI understand being busy and sometimes calls and messages get missed but this is just to much.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1616600833478, "text": "Kat, I do apologize for the unanswered telephone. You are correct, sometimes it is very hard for two ladies we have on Saturday to catch all incoming calls. We have 7 incoming lines. During the weekdays there are 4 team members available to tend to the phones and greet and register patients.  An added aspect to this is that we don\u2019t have an open waiting room currently due to COVID. So, we are constantly communicating to patients about their arrival and when to enter the building. No excuses however, we are looking into other options for answering our phones during this high volume covid world in which we find ourselves.   I appreciate your feedback in this matter as it has led to a productive discussion on how to offer better customer service.

I have recommended this Medical Center to many friends and family member. My grandson has been seen by the NP at the Middle Creek in the Promenade due to a virus and we were very well taken care of by Liz and their staff. The lady at front desk was very pleasing and greeted us as we walked in and got our information in a timely manner. Middle Creek is a wonderful place to be seen. Love it Love it!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888dc16a88f9a6d:0xa179f4118f626f81"}

I had to demand and X Ray after I was interrupted several times while attempting to explain. When the \"doctor\" entered the room he asked me which medication I was prescribed in the past. Which I told him. He then rattled off my previous prescription history in a tone less than professional. Apparently I waited the 30 minutes while he reviewed my history to come to a pre determined conclusion. After X Ray he came back into room to apologize by explaining I came in 15 minutes before closing and he needed to leave to go to his son's football event. So, he had time to do research to come to a predetermined conclusion before even seeing me but not time to listen. I worked in the bar and restaurant industry for over 30 yrs, if all I wanted was pills like he thought, it is a lot easier to pick up phone and call around to get what he thought I wanted than to waste time visiting a doctor that has plenty of time to judge and condescend but no time to actually do what he is supposed to.

Yeah, that made me feel really special. So much for family.  Everyone has an off day every now and again, though, right?  But the couple times before that were also mediocre. so this must be the new pattern. Next time we'll go somewhere else. I'm done.\n\n*****\n\nThis place is special.  I've been here several times and  every time I walk in, I'm amazed by how personal the service is.  I feel like a person ... an ailing person ... rather than a number.  From the greeting at the front door to the \"hope you feel better\" as I leave, EVERYONE has always been great.  They don't treat me like I have cooties; they treat me like family.  I would almost say they coddle me a bit (and who couldn't use a little TLC when they're sick?).  They're nice, friendly, caring, personal, and yet, still professional.  Not all cold and clinical.  Other places could learn a lot from Middle Creek.  Can't tell you how many doctors I've left because of poor staff.  I'm sorry for the few people that have had a bad experience here (and yes, some sound really bad), but stuff happens sometimes ... even when you're with family.  I'll be going here again in just a few minutes and, even if I have a bad experience, I won't allow that one time to cloud over all of the other wonderful times.  Thanks, Middle Creek, for being there when I need you and taking care of me in my pathetic, sick (or injured) state.  See you soon.\n\n*****\nI'm back.  For those of you that question wait times, I checked in at 11:22am and out at 12:05pm.  (Web check-in is also available.)  Less than a 45 minute turnaround in the middle of lunch hour qualifies as another outstanding experience.  And ... BTW ... Dr. Flowers is awesome!!

They were in no hurry to help him or acted like they seemed to really care what was wrong.  After he was finally seen and treated he requested a work excuse.  The lady at the desk told him that they had wrote it for that day but if he still wasn't feeling well and needed it extended to just let them know and he could come by Friday and pick one up for Friday.  Of course he wasn't feeling well still Friday and being a coalminer the last place you want to be with a stomach virus is in the mine.

The test used (Abbott ID Now) has a near zero false positive rate when a qualified technician runs the test. The AFC clinician I saw also told me that there was no way it was a false positive. However, I was told by a clinician at one of my follow up tests that the only way to get a false positive on the Abbott now protocol is if the sample is contaminated or if samples are mixed up. From this, I concluded that the AFC clinician/technician made a mistake, one that was quite costly for me both financially (I spent $450 in follow up testing) and emotionally (I feared I had exposed my elderly parents). I would recommend using a different clinic for a rapid test.\n\nI was also disappointed in their safety protocols vis-a-vis Covid. The front office staff's mask compliance is very poor (some without masks, others with it below the nose), and they have all patients congregate at the check in.

I am an active duty service member. Our family is insured with Tricare Prime which covers 100%. My wife goes to this clinic because the location is convenient and the clinicians are great. Two weeks ago we received a letter from American Family Care stating that the amount of $54.66 has been sent to collection. I was shocked. Called the clinic and they give me the number for billing the department. Call the billing department and one of the lady who happened to be super rude picked up the phone after I waited 45 min told me that the amount of $54.66 we owned is the deductible. I tried to explain to her that with Tricare Prime there is no out of pocket cost at all. She told me to call Tricare and ask one of the Tricare representative to give her a call. Called Tricare, the representative from Tricare said that they are a receiving call center only, they don't make call out to other people. Asked Tricare about that $54.66, they explained to me that the billing department from AFC mess up the claim. Instead of filling the claim under my regular PCM, they filed it under another physician who wasn't a primary care physician at that time. That's why Tricare didn't process the entire claim amount. Instead of reprocess the claim, no one from AFC ever go back to take a look at the claim but instead decide to bill me the remaining amount. Tricare advise me to call AFC and make a conference call while everyone is on the line so Tricare rep can walk someone from AFC billing department through how to reprocess the claim to resolve the problem. Called back to AFC billing department and talk to someone name David. I explained the entire process to him again and he said he will make some note and transfer the case over to someone who can resolve the problem and I should expect a call back either later that day or the day after. Guess what, today is 2 weeks later and still haven't heard anything from them. Tried to call the \"patient advocate\" number from whoever gave the number to Carol Peppers on the comment below and just as I expected \"the number you have called can no longer received voice mail\".

Thankfully it was only for a few months because my husband took a different job in NASA and we moved away.  I found myself an Endocrinologist here after being off of all my meds for 6 months and got new labs done.  I gave the Endocrinologist my old labs Dr Campbell did and the new Dr said that Dr Campbell didn't even run the correct tests to determine I had hypothyroidism, low HGH or other low hormones!!!!  I do not have hypothyroidism or low sex hormones.  We have ruled out several things and are still in search of what is going on with me, but at least I am not being given incorrect medications that would cause serious harm had I still been taking them under Dr Campell.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88621353e5d2d78d:0xa892ef2a551e1ac5"}

I can tell you the people at this establishment make it 100% the only place I go for pharmaceutical medicines and advice, as well as treatment. I will have to write a longer testimonial siting some ezamples of why you would want to comr5\ncome to Quick Care Clinic before and Pharmacy instead of the big chains that seem to monopolize your health care. I will do that when I have first taken care of some other business, mainly that I just moved and am looking for steady work. So this is the short version of what I will share at a later date.\n\nYou should give your Healthcare business to this astoundingly responsible, empathic, knowledgeable, well managed, clean, convenient and kind establishment. Did I leave out experienced? Decades in the multitudes.\n\nRespectfully, when I say you should give your business to quick care, I believe it almost to be an automatic misnomer due to the English language & grammatical flows. Truthfully the minute you walk through that door you will find that the people inside earn your business, and you will not be giving anything. You have nothing to lose, and but a world of good to gain. I stake my word on this. Not enough can be said here with the time that I have. Until I have a full testimonial written up explaining how they have changed my life for the better, I suggest that you trust in what I say in \"brevity\"... Cough... *um I'm kind of long winded*... Cough.. I (note: I didn't really cough... But if I were coughing I'd go to the clinic at quick care...) lol\n\nRespectfully, This clinic is not a standard business. They don't treat you like your someone trying to damage their profit margin. It's quite amazing. They treat you like family. Every single employee is vetted by the owner who is there seemingly from open to close. A truly great man who has surrounded himself with employees so capable he could be off sipping margaritas in Rosorita. But he doesn't do that.\n\nThese people get their feel good from helping you and me get well. It's truly remarkable to find such a Gem amongst so much cold and igneous ruffage, splayed out into the deep horizon. Now I said brevity earlier.. And because of how good this place is, it's just hard to say less than you've read here. These people care about health and will care about you. I urge you to go here and see for your self.\n\nStandard info : they take most insurances. They have the best Pharmacy team in town and are license profesionals. They have a walk in clinic, and multiple, highly skilled and experienced doctors. GOOD DOCTORS.( I don't think I've ever seen a pharmaceutical rep trying to sway opinions in the place even once. Every other place I've been it's maddening. Big pharma is there smooozing with the decision makers...

No blonde hair rolling briefcase bombshells messing with your treatment walk these halls. They are with a sense of humor that's quite good. Going in feels like visiting friends. Best bedside and counterside manner I've ever seen. highly interested and driven skilled individuals who are not only the practitioners, but also patients. These are doctors that take their own medicine. That is to say; they would perscribe treatment to themselves or their loved ones exactly as they would to you.  I am 199% convinced of their convictions, and that they know what they are talking, doing and recommending to you about health. And when they don't know something.... They don't prioritize and lean on ego, and brush off your questions, and do a hat and dance show. NO! INSTEAD: I have had a conversation like this while in treatment, \"I don't know about this area of the suggested treatments.. So let me confer with a specialist who is a friend of mine and I'll be right back. Please wait here five minutes. Would you like some water?\".\n\nSo in essence I'm saying...\n\nGO HERE!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88621353e5d2d78d:0xa892ef2a551e1ac5"}

Basically the pharmacy didn't have my prescription. So when I used the telephone to call back into the doctors office, I felt like I wasn't going to be able to be helped properly. Not because of unprofessional staff or them having a desire to not help me. But because its a doctors office during a pandemic on top of already taking care of patients.\nSo I went online and began reading reviews. One response I kept reading was \"did you try messaging us on social media or direct thru our website\"? So that was what I decided to do. Now it was after 6pm when I messaged and just a few hours later I got a response. You may think getting a response at 9pm seems bad, but let me tell you. When your in need of help, getting a response at 9pm let me know that Go medical is taking care of their patients.\nSo now here we are at 930am the following morning and my problem has been resolved.

In the beginning I was heard, I was treated for my conditions, everything was going fine in my life other than one issue.(5\u2b50\ufe0f then) Until my last appointment, I didn\u2019t even see Dr.Go after being told that\u2019s who I would be seeing that day. I seen a Np that knows NOTHING about me or my conditions & who was rude and kept cutting me off, wouldn\u2019t even listen to what I had to say, She was hateful to me both times I was seen by her. She laughed at my concerns the first time. The second time she treated me like a liar and someone just fishing w/out allowing me to talk to inform her on what Dr. Go and I had discussed about MY issues and what actions we had taken so far. She admitted that she didn\u2019t know what my apt was even for. Dr. Go stopped one RX, that is REALLY dangerous to just quit prescribing to a patient \u201cCold Turkey.\u201d It states on the FDA website,& medical professionals that tapering IS necessary, I wasn\u2019t tapered at all. I wasn\u2019t I informed at my previous appointment with Dr. Go that I would no longer receive this RX. I didn\u2019t even get my own choice on which I believed my body/mind needed more to have quality of life. Along with the only testing/imaging that was ever ordered was ultrasound and CT which my disease won\u2019t show up on neither one of those as that has been proven by many other medical experts. Nothing further was even discussed to get an accurate diagnoses. Sent me for a CT with dye knowingly that I have a allergy to contrast dye and I had to be treated at the ER because of this and have my husband come 30 miles away to drive me b/c they didn\u2019t check my chart before ordering the scan. Dr. Go has always treated me w/respect and mostly listened to concerns. There was a few times I felt like he was only concerned about a symptom we\u2019ve already discussed when I had multiple concerns that was never addressed. I paid $70 copay to be seen every time besides once therefore I should see Dr. Go. He did help me for 6+ months, especially with my anxiety, etc, but now that my anxiety meds was removed w/o me even being informed my anxiety is @ it\u2019s worse since I lost my dad & two miscarriages this past year. If I was told last month, I could of tapered myself knowing that you need to safely be tapered from any barbiturate. So I felt reeled in at the start. I didn\u2019t break any rules or anything to cause this, either. My first apt I went I was told I would be seeing DR. Go, I didn\u2019t see him that day either. That day was with another NP, Dr. McDaniel, who I DO recommend if you go and have to see a NP. She truly did listen to my concerns and try her best to treat me in the best way allowed, I\u2019d solely give her a star alone, but again I was told by the front that day I\u2019d be seeing Dr. Go & didn't. Normally most DRs would have you come back in two/four weeks to monitor how the meds are working/if they need to be adjusted/changed, to check on how you\u2019re doing with them.  I was really disappointed in the care I received from the office my last visit. I\u2019ve been referring a lot of people to this office, but now I\u2019m unsure if that\u2019s the right thing to do. I truly hope this was just a mistake on the NP side & when I do go back I can see DR GO HIMSELF & discuss options or I will be looking for a different PCP to receive the help to accommodate me. I truly don\u2019t want to do that, but I don\u2019t want to continue to throw away $70 with nothing accomplished, really. MOST of the staff has good bedside manner,a few that could use more discipline as JOKING ab patients after they leave & their private health info is very unprofessional.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nUpdate: to the response, thank you for replying. I am not meaning my review to be hateful. I\u2019m adding a star since you took the time to look into this for me and replied. I have been satisfied the care I\u2019ve received prior to this day, that\u2019s why I said I didn\u2019t want to change PCP without seeing Dr. Go first to tell him how I am feeling about my last appointment.

At 12:13 PM on December 23rd, 2020 I went to Southern Rapid Care for a swollen eye. There was a sign on the door that said all patients were required to wear masks. The receptionist and another worker accompanying her at the front were not wearing masks. There were no coronavirus protective procedures in place. Nurse practitioner Sheila Stephens came into my room wearing a mask and immediately began to touch my eyebrow, without washing her hands and without gloves. She asked me to lie down on the table. She pulled off my mask and put a blue sheet over my face while the eyebrow was left exposed. Without any numbing medicine she then jammed a needle into the abscess, a very painful process that I groaned through. After using a needle she took her ungloved hands and squeezed at the area, forcing anything inside out. After she finished she told me it would bleed for a while and neglected to give me anything to soak the blood. I had to grab a kleenex for myself in an open, dusty, box to stop the bleeding. As I looked around the room I noticed a dried, smeared, puddle of blood sitting in the middle of the room. The bed sheets were also uncovered and had various dried stains, dog hair, human hair, and dirt covering them. They tried to give me rocephin which I denied, I explained that Rocephin causes terrible lower back pain that leaves me unable to walk. She then told me they would give me two shots of clindamycin instead. To my surprise it had acted the same way to my lower back as rocephin. A nurse came in to hand off paperwork to me and I asked her if it was supposed to feel this painful, she said it could be uncomfortable. She tried to get me to stand and move to the counter to sign paperwork so I attempted and groaned in pain as I couldn\u2019t move. She left as I started crying in pain and another woman came into the room. She was slender, tall, with brown hair and sadly I did not catch her name. She came in and demanded with an aggressive tone I stand up, I told her I could not because of the amount of pain I was in. She told me I would feel better if I stood up so I tried again and fell back on the bed due to the pain. I began crying harder because of the pain and told her once more I could not. Then she got angrier and lowered her tone with clear aggression. She told me \u201cI gave a five year old this shot and he was running around after it.\u201d I began crying even harder due to being belittled and humiliated while sitting with clear pain. She kept demanding I stand up and repeating that children run around after these shots. I told her through my tears to stop talking to me like that and she became angrier and left the room. After I signed some papers and grabbed my medication off the counter I attempted to move to the door and nearly fell to the floor. I sat in one of the chairs in my room while sobbing and heard the angry woman talking about me to the other workers outside. They began laughing after I heard her describe my situation, they laughed the entire time I was sobbing and unable to walk. My mom then texted me wondering why I wasn\u2019t out in the waiting room and told me the receptionist had told her that they were helping me to the waiting room. I texted her that I needed help to walk and she told me she was not allowed in. I then began crawling alongside the wall for support, sobbing openly from pain and humiliation I was being put through. As I was walking there were multiple workers in the main area staring at me and not offering assistance. Halfway down the hall my mother and the receptionist came to grab me as I nearly fell to the floor and helped me walk. As they opened the door the brown haired woman said \u201cMake her open the door herself, she doesn\u2019t need all that.\u201d My mother noted she saw an unused wheelchair that I could have been offered but was not. I was neglected heavily at Southern Rapid Care and will be making formal complaints. Do NOT go here.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a064c38aa97bb:0x19a3abf5bef8bd9b"}

I asked while I was there if I had a co-pay or if they needed any additional insurance information. They said they had everything they needed and I was all set to leave. They never tried to bill my insurance even after I called 3 times to give them the claims information. Dealing with them administratively has been a major headache. Standard of care could also use improvement. I had to remind the nurse and doctor a couple times that I do not have a spleen which effects what type of antibiotic to use.

Neither of us could ever get a receipt (after we would beg) that matched any of our insurance bills. That may be because they listed us as missing appointments (we have never missed an appointment) or as not even having them!

You can\u2019t get them by phone at all so you have to go through the portal for all things. Not a problem unless the staff is as non-responsive as they seem to be.

So frustrating, I may as well have been talking to a robot. You have to pay $60 dollars a year for an online service (that you don\u2019t have to use, because you can still just call if you prefer) and if you opt out of the unnecessary online service then they charge you $10 for every piece of mail they would send you. Ridiculous and unnecessary. I suspect they have too many clients because they don\u2019t do a good job of making new clients feel welcome and taken care of. The CRNP I saw was good, but there are too many layers of unnecessary headache between the client and her. I chose this place because it came highly recommended to me by family, but apparently that was years ago before the new onboarding and client management process, and when I asked why this new process was so terrible, she said it didn\u2019t use to be that way. I was told that my family member was probably \u201cgrandfathered\u201d in to the old system. If the new client management system was truly better, easier, more intuitive, and actually added value for older customers, then why would they not institute it with all their clients?

We are always working for continual improvement at Innova and it is encouraging to hear that you share our frustration with the widespread dependence on unreliable communication methods like fax machines and telephone calls to transfer critical patient information between medical facilities in our community. We strive to avoid paper orders and utilizing faxes, but because so few clinics and hospital facilities locally utilize modern communication methods, we are still forced to send 86% of our communications with other clinics by \"electronic fax.\" This just means that we don't use paper to send the fax, but it's still a picture of a document sent over a phone line as opposed to electronic communication with structured data in a standardized format that increases accuracy and safety.

The have automated a lot of their administrative processes and use technology to their advantage (e.g. having a patient web portal where you can communicate with them, see test results, schedule appointments, etc). The result is that it frees the providers up to focus on the patient rather than paperwork. And their appointment times run like clockwork. Like a 9am appointment is really 9am, and if they are 10 minutes late, they are apologizing profusely.\n\nEvery provider I have dealt with at Innova also gets an \"A\" for bedside manner. Sometimes medical issues aren't easy to discuss, even with medical professionals. However, Innova providers really have a warm interpersonal, friendly demeanor that takes that edge off.\n\nThey also focus on general wellness and health as much as medicine, that is they don't just throw pills at you. They actually have a full time dietician/nutritionist and a wellness program you can enroll in. So if you are looking to lose weight or just not be a generally average unhealthy Alabamian, it's better to do it under medical supervision from people who know what they are doing.\n\nAlso, they take my insurance (Aetna), and their rates/discounts are reasonable, so that's nice too.

These are my reasons behind that. I don\u2019t like coming into a doctor\u2019s office and not be greeted by a friendly face. Instead you\u2019re greeted by a keyosk (however you spell it) walking you through steps to sign in and pay. Next when you are seen, the visits are rushed and I feel that I\u2019m just a number patient on the list,  instead of a person who they are taking their time with to answer any questions or concerns I may have. I have left several times knowing that I did not get the opportunity to address all of my concerns. While I know this is a business, and money has to be exchanged for services, If you are behind on a payment of $10 or whatever, I don\u2019t appreciate being called by a \u201cmafia like\u201d voice message indicating I have 24 hours to pay you, and that I cannot be seen until that is resolved. Lastly, my father was recently scheduled for a procedure. However,  his blood pressure was too high. Stroke level to be exact. Innova was called and they refused to see him at their office even when the nurse where he was called them, hoping that would make a difference.  They claimed there is a balance on his account, which there isn\u2019t. This is very poor judgement on a so called health care professional. Copies of the canceled checks have been shown indicating he was up to date, but they just dropped him as a patient.  I along with the rest family have \u201cDROPPED \u201c Innova as our primary health care facility. Anyone looking for a general practitioner, should never go here. Thanks.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1532654563903, "text": "Diedre, We hope you are able to establish with a new provider with which you have a trusting provider-patient relationship. While we cannot discuss patient cases on a public form as you have brought up, I have certainly enjoyed talking to your father myself several times over the past few weeks and was happy to take care of his medical needs. We look forward to seeing him again soon. Medical billing can be a frustrating and confusing issue especially in this time of increasing deductibles.  We deal with this on behalf of our patients frequently and are happy to discuss these questions or concerns with our patients to get them resolved.\n\nOur current practices at Innova include being open on Saturdays for sick visits and for those who work during the week as a convenience to them.  We do not fully staff the office on Saturdays so you will not see one of my team sitting at the guest reception desk in the lobby. My team needs their weekends too! Otherwise, Christine or one of my other team members is at the guest reception desk to greet you.  I regret you have not felt heard at your office visits.  This is one of our highest priorities at Innova.  We sometimes find that we cannot adequately address all of a patient\u2019s concerns within one office visit and in those instances we will ask you to continue to follow up with us until all has been addressed. Lastly, our billing company will begin calling patients after three statements have been sent out without payment to collect that payment for medical services already rendered. We are always willing to set up a payment plan for any amount. Unfortunately some patients do expect to be able to remain current patients and receive medical services without payment thus we use resources such as the AMA and the AAFP Practice Management recommendations to assist us with how best to address these issues.\n\nAgain, we wish you all the best."}, "gmap_id": "0x8862132e04d8184d:0xb0d4fc8e9fba4586"}

I didn't get the message, as I never dreamed they wouldn't be in direct contact with me. So, nearly a week later, I get a same day appointment at Innova.  I walk in with a cane. They proceed to tell me they cannot do anything for me. I barely made it there and it's late in the day. I insist there must be sonething to do since I couldn't perform basic hygiene or walk.  So they sent in another and another staff member, as I explained myself over and over I became more agitated and more explicit about what I couldn't do as a result of the blindibg pain. They finally arranged a MRI that afternoon at close of day. I went.\nI hear back next day that my hip is shot and that I need  hip replacement.The orthopaedic surgeon said the year plus old xrays were clearly indicative of hip replacement some time ago  One heels of this news,  then I find Innova has deemed me innapropriate to be their patient. They sent person after person to witness my behavior and to justify their getting rid of me, not as I thought, to find someone on their staff who understood me.\nSo, If you are in excruciating pain, or have pressing health issues for a primary care doctor to manage, I would not recommend Innova. They had been my doctor for months at the time of the incident. They had not consulted with specialists who were caring for me. Then at my most vulnerable, they threw me out. I'm  certain I would have been better off at the ER with some random tramua doctor than to go there and be treated / not treated as I was by them.\nThey rely on their portal, messaging, voicemails emails and texts. A bit hands off for me anyway, that was a contributor to my missed communication and frustration, and prolonged pain.

When Dr. Uptagrafft asked if I had anything I would like her to check out, she didn't hesitate to check into it. She ran tests and did an ultrasound and, sure enough my thyroid was enlarged and, my levels were off. I eventually had to have my thyroid removed. I've heard many people have gone years with undiagnosed thyroid issues because, their doctors were so quick to dismiss the issue as something else without testing the levels or doing an ultrasound to rule it out. At innova they listen to your concerns and, they do what they can to get to the bottom of any issues you may have.

I believe there were one or two nurses working, but a woman (albeit a very nice and helpful woman who did her job, or rather someone else's job, well) who's badge said Radiology Tech performed all nurse duties other than blood draw and throat swab. I spent most of the visit wishing I had gone / thinking about going somewhere else. I grew up in Vestavia, and this was one of many poor experiences I've had at that location over the years. About 10 years ago I had a nurse insert the blood draw needle upside down! Meaning, she put it in to where the tip of the needle was pointing towards my wrist. Absurd. I was right near it and looking for a urgent care when I went in this week. It didn't take me long to remember why I stopped going there. Also, I've read multiple negative reviews about Dr. Brentnall, and I'm here to add another. I was there with a cold and an unrelated YI. He asked me, \"Well, about that, we can't still get in to see our lady doctor, right?\" It was very dismissive, rude, and awkward. He really didn't pay any attention to what I had to say. He ordered a step test when I had clearly explained I knew the only reason my throat hurt was sinus drainage. The only thing he did listen to was my self-diagnoses. After much wasted time and unnecessary labs, he came in with a prescription for an upper respiratory infection and a YI - exactly what I told him I thought I had.  Overall, he made me uncomfortable and wishing I'd seen any doctor but him. Spare yourself, don't go to this office!

This was a truly baffling experience, and you should only come here if you want you symptoms ignored or to be immediately referred to an allergy specialist for cold / strep throat symptoms.\n\nHere's a quick list of things that Dr. Brentnall did or said to prevent me from ever coming back here again. I came in after my cold symptoms worsened for 5 days with no sign of improvement plus I had developed a bad sore throat and dizziness:\n\n- He treated me like a child. He grabs the instrument to look in my mouth, ears, and nose. He stares at me for a second then says, \"I can see better if you open your mouth.\" Are you serious?? How about you ask me to open my mouth? For all I know you're going for my nose!\n- \"your nose is red. Looks like you're bothered by the ragweed\". Proceeds to talk about an allergist he recommends and a medication etc. I have had allergies since I was 13, and they are under control. I know what allergies are, and this is not allergies. How about my nose is red because I've had COLD SYMPTOMS FOR 5 DAYS!?\n- He never asks about my symptoms. I had to force them on him by blurting them out when he walks in for the 4th or 5th time he's come in the room (usually to talk about allergies some more). He dismissed them all as either being allergies, my IBS (which is also under control), or a side effect of medication I've been taking for 6 YEARS! I have never had a negative reaction to this medication. I know it can start at any time, but what are the odds of all of these things happening at once rather than I actually have a bad cold, or the flu, or something else?!\n- He sat on the bed with me twice.... I was very uncomfortable. He should have grabbed a chair since there were practically no other patients in the entire office.\n- I cannot count the number of times he talked about allergies or particles in the air.\n- He tried to trick me into taking allergy medication. He vaguely described what it was when he listed the meds, and never said it was for allergies. I only found out when the pharmacist mentioned it. I already take a daily OTC allergy medication. I DO NOT HAVE AN ALLERGY PROBLEM!\n\nI'm really curious to know if he treats all of his patients this way or if it is just the female patients. Also, does he get some kind of kick back from the number of people he refers to this allergist?? My boyfriend and I left that place completely furious. Every time Dr. Brentnall left the room, we would rant to each other. I believe the staff could hear us through the door each time, and I really hope they did.\n\nI will say the only positive was the pharmacist. She was knowledgeable yet eager to learn when I told her I needed gluten free medications due to celiac. And there was no way I was going to get that allergy medication filled.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889220ea1374f87:0xf88c51cd3ebb99d0"}

The pain finally got so bad that it is shooting up his leg and he is having trouble walking so he decided he had to go. The appointment was a little over $180. The nurses didn't know how to use the computer system. They asked him the same questions and what his name was over and over. One of the nurses smelled so badly of body odor that I could smell her as I was following her down the hall. My friend was gagging while she attempted to take his blood pressure. It took several tries. Finally, we got into a room. The doctor (Caroline Feist) came in and asked what the problem was. She seemed skeptical like she did not believe him. I'm sure she sees many people seeking pain meds and is therefore skeptical, but he never asked for pain pills. He described the problem and how it was affecting his job and how it developed. She touched the area of his foot, lightly, with two fingers (no thorough exam) and sent him to get x-rays. Once the x-rays came back, she told him they didn't show anything and that there were many reasons he could be in pain (she didn't say what any of these reasons were). He asked what he should do: sturdy shoes, orthotics, compression, ice? She said to do whatever he would like to do, wrote him a prescription for anti-inflammatories, and said to go see his primary care physician. He can't afford another doctor visit. Now he has lost a day's wages plus $180 for nothing and will not be able to pay his bills. Dr. Feist demonstrated a lack of empathy and professionalism and strong skepticism throughout the visit.

However, I have been seriously disappointed the last few times I've been to this facility. First and foremost, the Friday before Easter, I was ill and needed to come in for antibiotics. My fiance and I arrived at 7:15 only to find them closed. AFC used to be quick- in and out in an hour. As I write this I've been sitting here for an hour in the lobby. Haven't even been called back to triage or a room yet. Not to mention, when I checked in and paid my copay the receptionist tried to discourage me from being seen. \"If you get tired of waiting, we will refund your money.\" I asked if there was a long wait, she stated that the doctor was only seeing seven patients at a time and that there were seven in the back already and \"five thousand\" in the lobby. After this, I watched the same receptionist pseudo turn away three more people, discouraging them to check in because of the \"long wait\". All three left, one a teenage girl with her mother, limping and in tears. If people come here, they obviously have a reason. This is a facility that is designated to help ill and injured people, and if that impedes your off time, then so be it. Most people in the working world have to stay late from time to time. Good workers still do their job. Also, the doctor may only be seeing 7 patients at a time, but there are more than 7 rooms in the facility. Instead of having people that are already unwell sit in the uncomfortable lobby chairs for hours at a time, they could move people to the vacant rooms so they could be more comfortable. Even still, this location always seems to be this busy so why on earth is there only one doctor on staff? Makes no sense. The last few times I have been in this facility for either me or my fiance, we have had to wait for at least two hours. There was one occasion that we didn't get out until almost 10pm, at which point I would have had to drive 25 minutes to get to a pharmacy that would be open and able to fill my scripts. I've been to Shelby ER and have been taken to a room faster than this. More to follow....\n\nUpdate: 1.5 hours. Still in the waiting room. Still with two patients in front of me.\n\nBack in a room. Angelise triaged me. She's a doll. Best part of this experience so far. She has great communication skills and was still upbeat even with it being 8:45 by the time I was triaged.\n\nTook me another hour to see the doctor, Dr. Habert. I could tell what the holdup was when he spent a lot of time chatting with us in the room. I didn't mind that so much. Its better than seing a doctor for less than a minute when you wait for hours. What I did mind was being told that my diagnosis, walking pneumonia, was a result of dairy products. Now, to be clear, I didn't have an issue with this and I heard him out at the time, but by the time I got home, I researched it, and couldn't find any correlation or any research to support his statements... He was very nice and had a great bedside manner. But maybe we shouldn't be misinforming patients?

My grandmother had fell causing her lip to bust open and was in need of stitches, so this medical facility was the closest and hopefully cheapest choice, But on arrival i was treated with such disrespect. I checked her in and give the nurses my grandmothers information and helped her back, but i wasn't allowed any further, so I go to wait in the lobby and waited for an hour. I go to ask how my grandmother is doing but the nurses acted like they didnt know what i was talking about so i ask how much longer was it going to be and they ignored me so i go back to sit and waited for another hour. I go up to ask about my grandmother again only to be given the same response as before, I get frustrated so i go out to check on my car, and as i was trying to come back to the lobby the doors were locked. I was locked out in the cold and had no idea what condition my grandmother was in so I knocked on the door until a nurse noticed and she just stood there staring at me. I wave her over but she ignored me and went back behind her desk.I dont know why i was treated like this but i can only come up with that my skin color wasn't white (all the nurses were white). It was 15 degrees out so i went back and waited in my car. A few minutes go by i see a cop car come by and he parks in front of the building like he got a call, and then i see him looking around the whole building for somebody (im guessing me). But i stay in my vehicle until he leaves. After all that i see my grandmother finally come out after 4 hours of waiting. Again i illiterate: i dont know why they treated me like a second class citizen but i guess its cause im not white.\n\nIn summary: This medical facility locked me out and called the police on me for my skin color. I am humiliated for being treated like this but sadden to know that they might mistreat everybody that isnt white.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1517940337016, "text": "Elsa, we regret to hear that you had this experience with us.

I had what most would call a toothache. I, however,  called it the forces of nature trying to rip out my insides through a small opening in my exposed gum.  Anyway, I am also a Medicare patient who cannot just up and make an appointment with a dentist or oral surgeon like everyone else.  I have to get any dental procedures approved through Medicare, which by the way doesn't happen the same day (usually a 72 hour turn around, even then you are not guaranteed approval).  I had an infection and had eaten an entire bottle of 20 Alleve in about 48 hours.  I entered the facility expecting just average level of concern and kindness.  What I encountered when I got there was anything but that!  The front office staff was so nice and professional!  However, the best was yet to come!  The nurse who called me back and took my vitals was just such a lovely young woman. The EPITOME of professional, kind and sympathetic that one would look for while in pain visiting ANY doctor's office, but often never receiving.   Then, Dr. Pike entered the room.  I have seen Dr. Pike before while I was sick, and he was always professional.  Maybe, I am being swayed by the amount of discomfort I was in, but this doctor acted as if he were a concerned family member!!    I was SO IMPRESSED WITH MY VISIT FROM THE SECOND I ENTERED THE BUILDING UNTIL I LEFT!  I do have a PCP who practices several cities away.  Whenever I cannot get into his office (AND NOT RECEIVE THE KIND OF CARE LIKE I DID AT AFC-ALABASTER) I will more than definitely return here and also WOULD HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!  I PROMISE, YOU WILL BE SATISFIED.  If not, you might want to check out the Brookwood Hospital..........PSYCHE UNIT that is!!!  :-)  :-)   :-)        I also ready the review below by a Miss Cheyenne.......JUST REMEMBER some folks come in with a bad attitude or being rude or just looking for pain pills............Those types of people make it rough on everyone.......even the other patients waiting to see the doctor.........If you have once ounce of decency in your body, there is no way you would get treated in such a manner.  Her comment is disgusting and sounds like she did not get what she was after.

The nurse and the medical assisant run this place!\nNow, The NP was barely even in the room with me.  The medical assistant was still checking my bp and had not taken any labs yet and then another one came in with a steroid shot and antibiotic shot. So I was being given two shots as treatment YET NO LABS HAD BEEN DONE. SO what exactly what she treating me for? Strange to recieve shots before labs....and then she never even came back in the room...the medical assistant walked in and mumbled something about take your meds and went to leave. I had to stop him and ask him what medications I was given and what my test results were. He then had to go and ask the NP and try to get an answer and came back and mumbled ok follow me...next thing i knew i was being pushed out the door and i had no idea what meds i was given or where to pick them up. I stopped him and he had to go back and ask the NP AGAIN....all of this could have been prevented had she seen me and given me the results to begin with like a dr should. he comes back 20 min later and tells me that my meds got sent to calera and they got them changed to alabaster. only thing i was given was a Zpack. i was miserable for several days and could not sleep so i finally went to another urgent care and recieved the care i needed. I was also told I had a raging UTI and that zpac would not touch it....so they gave me Bactrim....so the NP ran all these tests on me and even my urine but didnt follow through.  I will not be back. After Dr G & Dr Pike left it has just been awful. I tried to continue to use AFC alabaster but after this experience...i WILL NOT. and I will be putting this review on google.\n\nDecided to give them one more shot....went to visit last week because I was extremely sick....i mean EXTREMELY......imagine my surprise when the same NP came in ...and provided the SAME horrible service...talked down to me like I was an idiot....same responses as my last visit.....same meds....no blood drawn....left me in the room for over 2 hours for two simple tests and then nothing.....just came back in, gave me a shot, and pushed me out the door. I am done with this place. I will never be back and it looks like that is the same for alot of people because there was no one in the waiting room...never saw another patient while i was there... I wont be surprised if the place shuts down before long. You can only treat people like idiots for so long before they return the favor. Sorry not sorry.

The receptionist said an hour-it was a little longer than that. The lady that called me back was probably the best part of this visit. She was very nice. Once the dr finally came into my room, I learned more about his family and such then I did about what was wrong with me. I like for them to be personable, but I had been waiting in the waiting room and actual room so long that I was kinda over it. I was told that they would call in my prescription to the pharmacy of my choice (Walmart). I got there and nothing had ever been called in. I called the drs office and she said usually they ask for 30mins in time to call in. Sounds legit. I then proceeded to give the sweet girl at Walmart my phone number so she could call me when it got there. I had been sick all morning and hadn\u2019t ate anything all day so I figured it would have been a good time to go get something to eat. I returned to Walmart, ate some food in my car, went inside and waiting for a while longer. Finally the girl at Walmart said they had checked voicemails and all and had NOT received anything for me yet. I called the dr office once again and told them that I had been waiting a while and that the girl said they had yet to send anything over on me. She put me on hold and came back very quickly and said the nurse was working on it. This had been almost 2 hours since I had left!!!! I came to see them bc I wasn\u2019t feeling well-  needless to say I didn\u2019t feel like waiting as long as I have today. I left home at probably around 1ish and got home about 520-ish.

A few days later, I was exposed to Covid through a coworker and begrudgingly went through the online process. When it failed, it told me to register at the office. Upon returning to the office, I was told that I cannot schedule an appointment for Covid testing multiple days into the future, and if I wanted a specific day, I would have to return to the office and register using their devices on that day.\n\nI don't understand why a) I can't schedule a test ahead of time, knowing that I am currently in the incubation period, and b) why they are entirely unable to process a returning patient using existing information. Trying to schedule this appointment has been a nightmare and wasted an hour and half, at which point I still do not have an appointment. They have had nearly a year to figure out the best way to handle testing, and I find it hard to believe that this is the best solution.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889720b640b63b7:0x1cf108dfca715bd3"}

Normally, if I end up leaving a review it is because I have experienced a dissatisfaction on numerous of occasions. Which, in this instance, is accurate yet again. Main Street is considerably close to my home and therefore mine and my families first stop. However, over the passed several months I have been very ill on-and-off. After being sick for nearly a week, I finally decided to make a trip to just try to get better. I was tested for both the strep and flu. However, both came back negative. This is a typical situation result when I come here. The last several visits I have been diagnosed with a \u201csinus infection\u201d, upper respiratory infection etc. When their PA told me last night I was negative again for flu and strep, with full knowledge knowing I 100% have both, I got incredibly frustrated. I told their PA, after she said it was probably just a sinus infection, that every time I come here that is what they diagnose me with. I have had to pay multiple doctors bills because of their misdiagnoses and having to seek out another doctor to properly diagnose me. To which each time, when I get tested elsewhere, it comes back positive. They said they gave me a \u201cshot\u201d to help speed the pain in my throat, and it is 5:30 in the morning and the pain in my throat is so severe there is ringing in my ear now which has woken me up in even more pain. So, once again I will have to pay ANOTHER doctor to diagnose me with what I know I have. This is incredibly exhausting. I don\u2019t know if it is malfunctioning testing machines or the lack of actual experienced doctors, but the fact that I have been awaken in such severe pain and body aches let\u2019s me know I once again did not receive the treatment I needed. With all of that said, the PA who was there did call me in a prescription for both the flu and strep after I complained I was tired of their diagnosis's continuously being that of a \u201csinus infection\u201d. I know if I let a good 48-72 hours of these medication stay in my system I will get better. The problem is, I am in so much pain and the shot they \u201cgave\u201d me might have well been water.\n\nSincerely,\nA extremely tired sick person", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1582566404885, "text": "Hi Shannon,\n\nThank you so much for reaching out.

I also knew that I was dehydrated. The only thing that I didn\u2019t know was that my blood pressure was elevated probably because of the flu.  I also had a severe headache which I assumed was associated with the dehydration and flu. I am quite sure the nurse practitioner could hear the rattling in my back whenever she listen to me breathe, however, she did not order an x-ray to see if I had pneumonia or walking pneumonia. I have been running 102 to 103 fever for the fourth day as well. The fever had gone down when I went in because I had just taken Tylenol before going. She gave me a prescription for some little pill for my throat and a pill for nausea.  She did nothing for my dehydration. I should\u2019ve had an x-ray to see if I have pneumonia so that I could\u2019ve been given an antibiotic. I feel like it was a complete waste of my time and money. I had to sit and wait a long time very sick in a waiting room full of sick people basically be told nothing more than I already knew and left there was nothing to make me feel better. I told her that I did not want to leave there under those conditions; however, that is what happened. Now, tomorrow I am probably going to have to go to another urgent care or emergency room to get the care and attention I need.  The receptionist was continuously sending people away telling everyone that came in after I was there that it was just too long of a wait so everybody would leave and say they would come back later. Possibly, they might\u2019ve been overwhelmed by the amount of people they had, however, when I got there I asked how long the wait would be and she told me there was only four people ahead of me.

In March, I fell down the stairs and badly injured my ankle. It was to the point that I actually had to cut my sandal off because of the swelling. Since it was after hours, and I did not want to wait hours in the emergency room, I decided to go to the Urgent Care Twilight on Opelika Rd. Upon checking into the location, the receptionist and staff were very short to answer any questions I was having. On top of that, their bedside manner was terrible. I could not even walk on my own because of the swelling and pain, to the point where I was leaning on a friend. Seeing us struggling, they did not have the decency to offer to help my friend who was trying to support me. They actually made me stand at the counter and fill out paperwork, instead of letting me sit down to finish filling everything out in the EMPTY waiting room. The staff did not offer any wheelchairs/crutches/anything to steady myself, forcing me to walk from the check in, to triage, then to a room.  Once I was FINALLY sitting on an exam table, they had taken X-rays and arrived back shortly saying it was \"just a sprain\" and it \"should be fine in two weeks.\" Then they wrapped my ankle in an ACE bandage, charged me $150 (w insurance), and STILL did not offer any assistance in my mobility. On top of all of that? Months later, it is still swollen and I am still having difficulty with my ankle. I went to go see another doctor, and turns out, my ankle was fractured, not sprained. Definitely do NOT recommend wasting your time or money just to have your well being jepordized by an unfriendly staff that seemed to be there just to make a paycheck.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c92d31ea1cd6f:0x7982ae4dc9ba821b"}

Because of their error, I was billed $200 extra. After long waits on the phone with BCBS, I found out the story above.\n\nAt 9:30 am today I called Stopwatch to ask about how we could have been charged if we confirmed at the front desk that we were covered. They told me they would contact billing and return my call. When I didn't hear back from them in 30 min, I stopped by the office to ask in person about the error. After waiting for 20 minutes in the waiting room, I ended up calling the billing office myself and actually having to pass my phone to the receptionist to get their error fixed. After all that, they admitted fault and adjusted my bill.\n\nMy kid was sick when I went in to talk about billing, so I thought I might as well have him seen now that the billing issue was worked out.\n\nWe waited a reasonable 20 min, they did a flu test, and released us with an RX called in to CVS.\n\nI had to call twice, but they finally said they were resenting my RX. I assumed it'd be ready in an hour.\n\nWrong again. After trusting them to call in my prescription twice now, I went to Walgreens around 12:30, only to have them tell me that it hadn't been called in. So I had to call the office a FOURTH time now, and get them to actually call my prescription in.\n\nStopwatch forgot to cancel the RX at CVS, so I had to call CVS for them and ask them to cancel that prescription so that my finally called in RX could be filled at Walgreens. I got my kid's medicine at 1:30, after sitting in Walgreens for an hour for a prescription that was supposed to be called in and picked up. My sick kid fell asleep sitting up because of how long we had to wait.\n\nDragging my sick kid all over town and having to wait multiple hours because of Stopwatch's errors makes me positive that I'll never use this Urgent Care again.

I tried our primary care provider first who didn\u2019t have any openings that afternoon and upon their referral I called Urgent Care for Children on 280.  I was informed I could be a walk in our schedule an appointment time online so I opted to schedule a time because general that means you don\u2019t have to wait as long.  I arrived for my daughter\u2019s appointment early to complete any necessary paperwork since we\u2019d not been there before.  I signed in told reception we had an appointment he looked and confirmed but then said this: \u201cI know you have an appointment but....\u201d. Wait what?  Why would you say that to a mom, who took the time to fill the forms in online and make an appointment?  \u201cI know you have an appointment but\u201d there is a walk in, \ud83e\udd14 yes there is but I made an appointment for which I showed up on time.  So NO, it is not acceptable to say this to a mom and who has a kid with fever in your waiting room with who know what the others in the waiting room have.  We are in the middle of flu season and multiple other viruses and I made an appointment and those with an appointment come first especially when I walked in at the same time as said \u201cwalk-ins\u201d.  Needless to say he was not apologetic for dismissing the fact I called ahead and made an appointment and came at that time.  And for that I would give 1 \u2b50\ufe0f, the nurse and Nurse practitioner were what drove the rating up.  They were pleasant and helpful, my daughter thankfully only had a virus so we didn\u2019t end up with meds and thankfully nothing else she may have been exposed to by not being taken back when she should have been.  But that\u2019s my rating for all it\u2019s worth.

She also did a chest X-ray, something I would have thought that Childrens would do. He had developed atypical pneumonia! Her intelligence, kindness, and the time put into thinking about what else the viral meningitis could develop was incredible. She obviously made sure we followed up with his regular pediatrician the next day.

It was so wonderful to find an urgent care facility that is strictly for children! Many ER\u2019s are ill equipped to deal with children so it was so reassuring to know we\u2019d be seeing a Dr whose primary focus was pediatrics. The waiting room was very clean & colorful, it had two big screen TVs with children\u2019s programs playing, smaller tables and chairs for the children, and well lit with large windows. The receptionist was extremely helpful and kind (which is rare these days) and answered each and every question I had enthusiastically,and not as though I was an intrusion on her time. She offered a pack of goldfish crackers and Gatorade to my grandson & I noticed many other varieties of snacks and even pedia-Light that was available for the waiting patients. Including check in, paperwork, & waiting to be seen we sat maybe 15 minutes total. An added plus was they informed us that my grandsons records for his visit that day would be faxed to his regular pediatrician in our hometown so they\u2019d be aware of his visit. The nurse who called us back and took vitals was very kind and gentle and listened to all our concerns without interrupting. The physician we saw was very informative and thorough and answered each and every question slowly and completely. They have a lab on site so we were able to confirm, during our visit, that he had the flu. It was very nice that all paperwork and co-pays were done beforehand so we could leave immediately following the examination. I highly recommend this facility and hope they continue to offer the same service in the future. I\u2019m very thankful to know they are there as I visit the area quite often.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1515032453744, "text": "Thanks for the review and thank you for choosing Urgent Care for Children."}, "gmap_id": "0x888917ae78be94c9:0xad8267a044a80fac"}

Upon arrival there was no one at the front desk. I had to ring the bell and wait several minutes until I actually saw a worker. Once a worker finally appeared she asked us to sign in and have a sit. She came back and got us checked in. We waited to be called back. Once we were  called back we sat in the exam room for over an hour. No one ever came back to check on us. I stuck my head out the door to see the nurse/front desk receptionist had left to get what look like a prescription & was just returning. She told us the physician would be in shortly, but that never happened. We ended up leaving without being seen. Common courtesy is everything. If a patient has been waiting for awhile it doesn't hurt to check in on them from time time. It helps with letting them know they haven't been forgotten.\nSigned,\nA disappointed mom", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1539710490183, "text": "We\u2019re sorry to hear that you had a less than positive experience during your last visit to our Trussville location, Johnisha.

If you're sick, don't bother going here. I went in at about 11:00 and I was the only patient in the lobby. I signed in and paid my $20 copay the woman at the desk insisted I had to pay, even though my insurance card (which I handed her to look at) says \"copay $0\"). I am brought back pretty quickly by a nurse who takes my vitals and I have a low grade fever. I get seated and the doctor comes in decently quick, but she is cold and seems to be standoffish. I tell her my symptoms and she looks at my ears, throat, and listens to my breathing. She quickly orders the flu test and walks out. The nurse student says that the test will take about 15 minutes and she swabs my nose. I wait for a total of 48 minutes until some other nurse walks in, hands me a paper that says Influenza Type A on it and tells me to read it. She then walks right back out without seeing if I had questions (which I did!). While I waited, I could hear the nurses and doctors sitting there talking about their lunch plans and weekend plans, not doing their jobs. Also, after about 20 minutes of sitting in the room, I hear the nurses start talking about how my flu test was positive, and they were being super loud about it. That is a HIPPA violation! I then wait another 15 minutes for the student nurse to walk back in and give me my perscriptions and school excuse. Not once did anyone bother to come in and tell me I had the flu and bronchitis or to see if I had any questions. On top of it all, I heard the doctors outside my door arguing about whether or not I could continue to take the Tamiflu with my iron pills, and they still never told me if I should or should not take the Tamiflu and my iron pills. These doctors couldn't even tell me if my medications would conflict or react with the perscriptions they gave me! Overall, my experience was unprofessional, excessively long, and completely rubbish.

I was quickly taken back as very few people were there.  Once in the back I was swabbed for strep.  When the doctor came, he stated I did not have strep.  He Check my ears, nose, and lungs and told me I had drainage that was making my throat hurt.  He never looked in my throat.  He gave me a steroid shot and a week of amoxicillin. Over the next days I got worse.  After visiting another doctor, it was determined  that I had a bacteria in my esophagus and needed to be treated with a different class of an antibiotic.  Here is my review:  after a $50 co-pay, the doctor spent less than 2 minutes with me, doing a very poor job of considering all the possibilities for my sore throats and just treating me like I had a sinus problem.  He never looked at the back of my throat to see that it was not inflamed and the problem with further down in my esophagus.  I will never go back.

Don\u2019t park in the lot in front of the building, drive around back to where there\u2019s a drive through (the building used to be a bank)\n2. Get there fifteen minutes early (like recommended) and be prepared for it to take at least an hour. After getting the test, the nurse came back out after twenty minutes with both me and my partner\u2019s results. From checking in on the mobile app to getting our results took a total of 1.5 hours.\n\nWe went for a scheduled COVID testing appointment in the evening during a weekday. Paying out of pocket for both the PCR and rapid test was a total of $129 (significantly cheaper than other urgent cares have them listed). It did take much longer than the scheduled appointment time and part of that might\u2019ve been because there weren\u2019t signs making it clear on where to go (at least none that I could see in the dark), and when we tried calling multiple times no one ever picked up (perhaps they should have a prerecorded message on their answering machine for curbside testing instructions?), but the person who gave us our tests was very friendly and the process was very clear and felt safe.

Only rating it this well because of the wonderful reception staff and physician assistant that I saw on the day of my visit.  The lack of covid-19 precautionary measures is alarming.  The waiting room is packed full of people (many coughing) waiting for covid testing (walk-in appointments). There should be some kind of wait in your car if you're there for covid testing available, entry through another door, make an appointment to be tested, etc, to limit the amount of contact between potentially infected patients and people who are there for things like a sprain or a bite wound. On top of that there was no cleaning of seats in the waiting room going on between patients.\nThey failed to ask for my pharmacy during the triage process, so when they told me I was ready to go, I asked where to pick up my meds as I noticed a pharmacy in the waiting room.  They told me my meds were ready to go at the pharmacy I was asked for in triage.  When I said there was no pharmacy asked for in triage, they asked me for my pharmacy, which then never sent my meds to.  They conveniently closed a few minutes after I left (I was in the waiting room for 2 hours).  When I called the next morning, I was on hold for 45 minutes constantly having my call transferred to the back staff who would never pick up only to be told they were too busy to deal with sending my call to the back again and that I could come to their pharmacy to get the prescriptions.  Which if they had told me that the night before I would have already had 2 doses of much needed medication.\nBasically this place is pure chaos.  I understand that things are hard with covid and healthcare workers are stretched thin, but this clinic is likely creating more cases by their poor planning and crowding of those exposed to covid with uninfected people.

You see, I came in Saturday for urgent care, and they told me is need to get a referral from my doctor in 72 hours, and my primary care doctor gave me a paper to bring to your front desk. I tried to take care of it over the phone, seeing as my PCP submitted the referral through the internet, but the front desk girl had \"no idea what to do here\" and kept putting me on hold to speak to someone named Erica. The first time was 20 minutes, then I hung up and called back, because this is something front desk ladies have been able to do at other medical offices. The second time, the front desk girl got snappy with me, explaining that there was a waiting room full of people waiting JUST for Erica. I explained to her that I'd had to receive COVID-19 testing this morning, and I didn't want to risk bringing the paper in, but this was a time sensitive issue, according to the paper this very office gave me. She told me I needed to stay home and wait on hold. I waited another 10 minutes on hold before I got in my car. I came in wearing a mask and explained to the front desk lady that I needed to give her the paper, which took all of like 20 seconds. I asked her if this could have been done over the phone, and she told me OF COURSE. I showed her where I was still on hold on my cell phone, making it over an hour on hold to get to Erica.

The nurses station was a shambles, you couldn\u2019t see her desk for all the papers, charts, fast food, makeup covering it. The \u201cDr\u201d Price actually said he was paid by Work Comp NOT to recommend keeping me off work so I could heal properly.\nGod help those Dr. Price treats. I HAD to go to Go Now Dr\u2019s via Work Comp, but once I got to a REAL Dr. He said that Dr. Price did me harm and caused my injury to be worse.\nGo Now has a new name on the outside. Maybe they went out of business. But if the same QUACK is the Dr. Inside...go now quickly to another Dr!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888e12ba2a632bf:0x4a17aa5485eb4573"}
