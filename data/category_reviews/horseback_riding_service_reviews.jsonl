The team of staff and volunteers have been kind and compassionate from day one, but they have also been up for the challenge of making the children work towards their goals.

It's a cash only location so you have to drive up the road to an ATM, if like me you only carry your card. We only wanted to go for a half hour but after being pushed we paid for an hour which I was ok with because I love horseback riding. I had 2 big issues and really the second one is why I am writing this review. To start, it was not until we were in the horses outside we saw a sign that said we could not even trot with the horses and we had to stay with the guide. Typically I understand but after signing a waiver (which I know you do at every location) and paying the $70 I come to find that the full expirience is walking a trail around the perimeter of the property. Be aware that if you are looking for a self riding nature tour this is not it, the best explanation for this place is pony rides on horses. My issue of complaint is half way through the walk we see a tractor spraying what I thought was water until we turned and the guide tells us he is spraying insecticide mixed with fertilizer. That is completely unsafe and should have been advised. I will not go back because of this, plus we started at 20 after and finished at 00 our hour was only 40 minutes.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0deca36264d3:0x66d39907fef961e1"}
