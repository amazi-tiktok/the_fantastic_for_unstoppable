That would have saved us a wasted 23 mile trip both ways. Waterloo is a beautiful place, but I would rather stay on the free TVA land than at this so-called campground. The campground is actually a trailer park with some spots for camping. We stay in many campgrounds, some better than others, but this is the first time we have driven through a campground and left. I could not even find the camp office to begin with and everybody at the trailer park was staring us down when we drove through.\n\nWhen I couldn't find the office, I called the owner back to tell her we had changed our minds. She did not answer her phone. I got a phone call later on from a different number and it was the owner. I let her know that her park was not what we expected and that we had changed our minds. She got an attitude with me and said, \"Thanks for letting me know. I waited for you for over an hour.\" I then informed her that I had tried to call and she didn't answer. I did not bother to mention that she wasted an hour of my time and the gas that I used to drive to her disappointment of a trailer park that she is trying to pass off as a campground. If you do decide to camp in Waterloo, I would suggest that you turn right on the road before you cross the bridge into town and stay on the TVA land. It is well maintained, peaceful and it is free.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1596388937393, "text": "I am sorry that our campground was not what you expected. Our property is 2 businesses, a small campground on the water with bathhouse, boat launch, fishing dock. The main portion are Lake lots that we lease yearly for vacation sites. It's not unusual for people to turn in the wrong drive; I keep meaning to get new signs but since my husband died in March I've been trying to juggle the whole thing alone. After we spoke, I did see that you had called the office number, which is supposed to be transferred to my cell phone. So I called you at 6:10 and we both missed each other. I apologize for my shortness, I have no excuse for that except that 14 hour days, 7 days a week sometimes gets me overwhelmed.   I'm usually pretty nice.  Our campground is usually not full in the fall, and the weather is perfect for camping. If you ever decide to reconsider camping with electric, water , and hot showers, I would be glad to make up to you your \"wasted 23 mile round trip\".
