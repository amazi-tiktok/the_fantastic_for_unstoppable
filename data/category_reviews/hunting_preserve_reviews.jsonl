The staff and hunters who were there was a amazing group of people. Gomez was our main guide, Chad, Zach and Mr Steve were involved. Their excitement about what they do was inspiring. Knowing that I had never harvested a deer, much less a whitetail, they made sure to explain things efficiently. My first morning of observing this amazing land while waiting for the peace to be broken up by deer activity, was only ruffled by a huge Gobbler. It made its way from the woods to a sunny spot and opened its majestic wings and tail. What a picture I will never forget. It was about 28 degrees that morning. Then we went back to the lodge and ate some warm breakfast, hot coffee and great hospitality. While engaged with conversation of Mr. Chad he informed me that at the location of my evening shoot there is a buck hanging out by the crossed pine trees. The buck was strange, as one antler was taller than the other and not a normal looking rack. He said good luck. This really impressed me as I realized these guides must study the land so they are better equipped to guide us properly.\nWith the morning finished we returned to a great house across from the lodge. Full kitchen, more coffee, very comfortable bed , heaters, clean bathroom, hot-hot water. My buddy went back out early, I was picked up buy Mr. Gomez. He said Mr. Bob you don't shoot anything on the couch. So I got my butt up got dressed and jumped in the truck. Mr. Gomez talking to me , answering my questions (Probably heard the same questions 1000 x's) . We arrive to the green field at a shooting house. As usual Mr Gomez opens it and ask for my gear , places my gear safely in the box. Then he looks at me and say's \"your going to see a lot of doe's, WAIT for the buck\". For some reason that stuck in my head. Now i am no spring chicken. But I do know when it comes to hunting I am a novice, uneducated beginner! Very willing to learn. This learning is made easier when you trust the teachers. Believe me all the guides and the outfitter are men of virtue. So I climb in the stand 1:30 in the afternoon, first day. The peace and quiet is unforgettable! the picturesque beauty of it all is worth the event. Between 4:10 and 6:00 4 doe and a buck. Yes Sir the same buck  Mr. Chad told me about and Mr Gomez guided me on. The first 2 doe arrived on the far end of the green field then the other 2 doe's popped up 50-60 yards to the right followed by the buck. I put the buck in my sight as it moved in on the back side of the 2 doe's.  I moved my cross hairs to the front of the 2nd doe and waited as the buck moved into the cross hairs and BAM! I 1. waited for the buck. 2. stalked it (Kind of). 3 clean drop shot... Then I lit up like a hooked Dolphin:) . Damn I hit it! I'm so excited What do i do. So i grab the phone thinking I'm calling Gomez. Hey Gomez I got a buck, they reply No Gomez here! I look at phone and found Gomez so i texted him \" Got a buck, I did it I waited for a buck! Gomez says where did he go, I said nowhere he dropped where i shot him. He said don't move we will be there. Then Gomez, Mr Steve and the dog show up and are smiling bigger than I am (Not Really). Mr Steve had me get behind the buck and pose for a picture. They loaded it up and the rest is history. The guides and some very patient guest all heard this story, i think i told it 10-15 times today/:).\nThis title should be \"waited for the buck!\" Thank you! Mr Steve and your team. Please say thanks to the entire staff you are truly the best. Hopefully I will get to hunt there again. God Bless!\n\nPS.

The group saw a lot of deer and everybody else in the group harvested bucks and does.  Ken was sitting in some of the best stands and was still getting shut out or seeing just a few deer.  I felt bad for him.  We hate to have hunters not seeing many deer.  It is one thing if the movement is slow and every hunter is struggling.  It is a whole different story when the hunters around you are seeing piles of deer and having a great harvest.  Some people apparently need to find another hobby.\n\nIt troubles me to respond like this but this is flat pathetic.  Ken Huebert didn't even finish his hunt.  Half way through his trip he got discouraged and left in the middle of the night without even saying bye.  He left a great note on his door that read \"Thanks for the food\".  Wow.  I will tell you though, the other hunters in the truck were glad he left.  World Wide Web?  Its a great place to spew propaganda.  No lodge is perfect.  No human is perfect and whitetails don't move all the time.  I would advise everybody to take a moment and absorb Gods creation not just in the woods but everywhere everyday.

Our only complaint is that Steve was not able to adjust weather conditions for two of those days.\n\nMy son saw 11 does one day and several during the trip. I saw five. I didn\u2019t get to kill a buck, but my son did get his first one. This was all that I really cared about. I saw a hog and a bobcat during the last hour of my hunt. We\u2019d all love to come home with state records. However, a lot of kids came home excited about getting their first deer. None of them were anything to be ashamed of. One kid shot his first deer and got a very nice bobcat, too. There are some solid bucks in those woods and the guides are highly motivated to get their clients a shot at taking one home.\n\nSome of the negative reviews were harsh. I couldn\u2019t believe that there was some negative feedback regarding the food. I\u2019m 6\u2019 3\u201d 270 and I like to eat. I never left the table feeling hungry. Every person that I spoke with was also very pleased with the food. Master Rack Lodge isn\u2019t Ruth\u2019s Criss Steakhouse. If you don\u2019t like Southern food, you aren\u2019t going to be happy. However, all the hunters did look forward to two very good hot meals when we came back from hunting. Cold cereal, coffee, and fruit is available before the first hunt of the day. If you need more to get you going first thing in the morning, bring a few protein bars.\n\nI was particularly miffed at the comments about the guides. These guys aren\u2019t just chauffeurs. If they aren\u2019t in a tree stand with a client, they aren\u2019t sitting around watching TV all day. They are scouting and prepping for the hunts. My son and I have limited experience, so I paid Morgan to serve as a guide for my son\u2019s hunts. He was the difference between success and failure. He served as a good instructor for my son\u2019s class in whitetails 101. I highly recommend utilizing these guys especially if you or your partner aren\u2019t a seasoned hunter. My son\u2019s first ever buck was a nice 130 pounds. We had to leave right after the hunt and Morgan quickly prepped the deer and handled the inexpensive European mount with the local taxidermist. Tip these guys!\n\nThe rooms were comfortable, but we didn\u2019t spend much time there. They have DirecTV in all the rooms, but we tended to socialize in the lodge area until we went to sleep. When we were in there, the entire staff was constantly making sure that our glasses were full. Socializing was easy and I quickly made three friends for life.\n\nI would suggest that you make sure that your gear is adequate for rainy conditions. Precipitation is unpredictable in Alabama, but it tends to occur in windows. If your guide thinks that the weather permits a woods hunt, you may end up miserable if you get hit with a short shower. A lot of us thought that we had \u201cwaterproof\u201d raingear. We didn\u2019t. The first half of day one was miserable. Also, I like to shoot a .45-70. Using something that kills bears was probably a mistake. On my last day, I saw a bobcat. I would have taken it, but I\u2019m not a taxidermist and I wasn\u2019t sure how much of it would be left for a full body mount. Next time, I\u2019ll bring a .243.\n\nIn summary, this hunt provided what I wanted. My son will probably take many deer home, but he will never forget this experience or what he learned from his guide. I\u2019ll be back in a couple of years, but next time I\u2019ll come during the rut.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1584635807748, "text": "Steve.

This was discussed upon booking.  We don't usually get a lot of complaints about this but here we are.  It is different than our normal set up.\nAs far as the food goes.  We offer a continental style breakfast early which is a light meal.  Yes it does include cereal.  The same layout for everyone.  Lunch is a brunch with typical traditional southern breakfast options.  Supper the same traditional southern style cooking.  Obviously our menu is not for everyone but rarely do we ever get a complaint and if we do we can offer a different selection of meals with out issue.\nWe don't guarantee any hunt.  We are fair chase and more and more it seems fair chase is not the way to go for everybody.  You can usually tell when the deer are not moving good based on reviews.  If movement is good and a nice buck is harvested, a review is usually avoided.\nWe do appreciate giving us an opportunity and are sorry to hear we did not perform to your standards."}, "gmap_id": "0x888dbb77f4b8761f:0xf2ca06acf8f95936"}

They were excited about that so that gave me some relief of stress.  Well it turned out that they both had bucks that were in range that would have been 140 class bucks.  One had about 5 or 6 racked bucks in front of him and a really nice 10 that stayed where he couldnt get a clean shot.  He ethically passed on the opp.  The next morning took a nice 8.  The father of the group missed a nice 10 point on his last sit at the absolute last minute.  Turned out to be a really nice hunt for the group.\n\nYou never know how a hunt will turn out.

I planned a 3 day hunting trip for 7 guys to MasterRack Lodge.  This was the first hunting trip like this that I had ever planned.  It was my idea to put the group together so I did the leg work.  My fear in taking the lead was not delivering when it came to our lodge.   I called several places looking for an opening.  When I spoke to Steve at MasterRack, he said all the right things.  10,000 acres of land, over 300 stands, deer populations of 90-110 deer per sq mile, 3 great home cooked meals per day.  It all sound good.  We were coming with a big group so we would be staying in a house off site, just our group.  So hey, it all sounded good.\nHere is what I learned after we booked and arrived at the house:  There would be 22-25 hunters hunting at the same time as our group.  There was a group of 22-25 hunter in for the 3 days before us and a group of 22-25 before them and so on.  The goal for Steve and his group is to put as many hunters as possible through his woods.  This is great if you don\u2019t care about seeing deer!\nWe hunted Jan 31 thru Feb 3 so we were at the end of the season.  Our group of 7 killed 1 small doe, 1 smaller buck (spike horn) and a pig.  We saw a few deer, but very few for a place that was supposed to have 90-110 deer per sq mile.  The food we were served was great, the only problem, we we served 2 meals a day not 3?  When it came to our guides, they were great young guys, not great guides.  They served the role of taxi driver.  We tried to talk to them about stand, trail cam pics and deer overall.  Mum was the word.  10,000 acres of land and we were posted in stand a couple hundred yards apart?  We are expected to tip a guy $300 for a ride to a tree stand???  And then there was Steve, we never one time saw him.  We sent our guides to go pay him several thousand dollars in cash and he never saw it necessary to stop by the house 1/4 mile from the lodge to check in and say HI!  I guess they do things in the South a little different than we do in the North.\nAs a group, I never thought we would shot 7 big buck, but I did think one or two of our crew would at least see a nice buck........ I understand that they call it hunting, not shooting.\nAs a bunch of guys we had fun.  We joke, laughed, drank some beer and made memories that will last a life time.  As a group of hunters, we will hunt again, just not at MastRack!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1554225418336, "text": "Thank you for the review.  This is one review that was deserved to a degree.  I have felt regret for some time over not stopping by to visit with this group of hunters during their stay.  I like to take time to get to know our hunters as much as possible.  A lot of time it can be limited for the amount of time our hunters spend in the woods.  But on this occasion it is definitely one that I dropped the ball on.  I am sorry for allowing this to happen.  It is not normal and I do apologize.\n\nThere is one thing that bothers me though and that is the number of hunters that is claimed to be running through our operation.  This group booked late (around Christmas).  At the time we were booked for the month of January and had been booked for a while.  I noticed that the private house was not being used that weekend.  The end of January is normally a very good time to be hunting our area.  We have taken a lot of big deer in late January to early February.  So, I offered this option to the group and didn\u2019t see it being much of a problem to go a little heavy for those days.  However, these are not normal numbers.  We usually average around 20 hunters in camp during the rut.  We run 2 teams and split the property so it puts around 10 hunters hunting approximately 4500-5000 acres each.  The dates prior to this hunt we had a total of 21 hunters in camp with 4 of those guys staying at the private house.  The dates after this hunt we had 10 hunters in camp and nobody staying in the private house.  We don\u2019t overhunt our place.  The perception is always misconstrued when we have a heavy group and the deer do not cooperate.\n\nOur population is very healthy and is between 90 and 110 per square mile.  We are also located in the #1 county in the state of Alabama and have a consistent harvest rate of 50+ bucks per season.  We run population counts each year to calculate management policies.  Sometimes you can hunt and it seems like we have 130 per square mile and sometimes you can hunt and it seems like there are only 40 per square mile.  Deer movement is always going to be up and down.  It is always unfortunate when our hunters experience a slow movement pattern.\n\nI have been here 22 years and we have always done our meals the same.  We offer a light continental style breakfast (cereal, muffins coffee etc) a breakfast after morning hunt and a country style supper after the evening hunt.\n\nOne more point to note is one of the guides that was assigned to the group was in training and the other a season guide.  Although it was his first year at Master Rack, we were assigning his stands for him during this trip.  We were giving him first choice on areas.  His knowledge base as far as stands and what direction the deer were coming from and what had been seen in the area was, for sure, limited.  This is not normally a problem but with me not taking the time to visit with Jacob and his group and explain all of this to them, I can see where this turned out to be an issue.  Once again, this could have all been resolved if I wouldn\u2019t have dropped the ball on visiting with the group.  I take responsibility for that.  I just didn\u2019t want it to be misleading and our entire guide staff being misjudged.  I truly regret that I didn\u2019t do a better job with this group, especially a group that was traveling all the way from Vermont.  Although it will not fix this one, I can assure you this will not happen again.  God Bless."}, "gmap_id": "0x888dbb77f4b8761f:0xf2ca06acf8f95936"}

We had a group of 9 experienced hunters go on a 3 day hunt from Jan.13-16.  This is prime pre rut/rut activity for deer hunting in Alabama.  The weather was low 30\u2019s and the high in the low 50\u2019s, moon phase was excellent for deer activity. There were 2 legal bucks seen and one killed. One of our hunters did not see a deer during our 3 day hunt, the more disappointing part is our guide did not seem to care that he wasn\u2019t seeing any deer. I saw 8 deer during our stay, one spike and the rest does. Almost every tree stand we were sent to is about 30 yards off the main road over looking a food plot, and there is generally another stand and food plot no more than a couple hundred yards away. I feel MasterRack Lodge is designed for first time hunters, not experienced hunters. The food was good. The private cabin we stayed in was nice but one bathroom is difficult with 9 guys. MasterRack Lodge offers a hunting experience but lacks the quality buck hunting we thought we were paying for.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1552410502178, "text": "This review is sad.  A one star rating basically says the place was terrible on all levels.  Mr. Mullis... what a shame.  This is the type of stuff that makes an outfitter shake his head.  Since the dialogue was opened up I will voice my reply.\nTHE HOUSE SITUATION:  Your group booked knowing there was only one bathroom.  It was made VERY clear on several occasions. We opened up another bathroom downstairs by ME moving out of my lower level quarters just for your group and you never used it.\nTHE HUNTING:  Overall, deer movement was pretty descent.  We recorded over 500 does and close to 100 bucks seen. We harvested 9 bucks and a bunch of does and saw a couple of bobcats including 4 misses and a wound over the three days they were at the lodge.  I think that is pretty good seeing the deer were still NOT Moving spectacular at all stands.  Mr. Mullis was correct with the number of deer he saw. ??  Their group saw a little over 100 does and around 20 bucks, most bucks young.  The bucks they harvested were all immature bucks.  The one buck we let slide was a 2 year old 8 point.  To be 9 \"experienced hunters\" They sure paid a lot of money in fines as well as breaking rules.  This usually stimulates a ONE star review.\n\nTHE ROADS:  Our place has a very good road structure throughout the property.  Between the roads and the firebreaks It makes everything accessible for the most part.    These are the only roads I can think of that he would be talking about.\nTHE GUIDES:  Our guides take very good care of our customers.  It can be a little embarrassing if one of the guys in a group is not seeing any deer.  However, there is never a time when the guide does not care.  And if there is, bring it to my attention and I will send him packing.  We are all about customer service.\nMY RATING:  Since outfitters never get a chance to review their hunters, I will take the time to review this group:  I rate this group as a 2 star. (Generous huh)  Seemed like a nice group.  However after breaking rules by shooting at deer on the way to the stand, that me and the guide and Luke ( the trail dog) had to chase down and finish off just to find out it was illegal too.  Then be accused of swapping the deer to make them pay more money in fines, shooting deer that they knew would not qualify and wounding and missing does, racking up fines of around $1700, it sure makes you question what someone means by \"experienced hunters\".  I would like to think that all people are good and fair and honest.  However, going online and leaving a one star review for a lodge that obviously does not deserve it proves to me that some just are not.  Now if you want to rate whitetails on how they move, that would be more understandable.  What has the world come to???????"}, "gmap_id": "0x888dbb77f4b8761f:0xf2ca06acf8f95936"}

Weather was not right moon but that is why it is called hunting. I hunt all over the country my main place is Fredonia ks where I have harvest some 190 and up. I am a bow hunter also. I have stayed at the bat house which I am positive steve told you a head of time that there is only 1bath room. I am willing to bet you all wanted to be together so that was the best option. As for the stands almost all of there stands are in the woods with some by the Rd but Definitely not 30yds away more like 100 or better. After seeing your review I would have to say you or someone in your group probably got fined for shooting a small buck or a button happens to the best of us but master rack is a family style hunting lodge and you had to know what you were getting into when you called because steve explains everything Straight up. As for the right being on the road still is an on right now and probably won\u2019t kick in till the end of January maybe the first week of February so no alabama wasn\u2019t in the middle of the peak right yet.

Our guide Clay was excellent, always had a positive attitude and clearly knows about hunting Alabama Whitetails. The other guides and staff, Larry, Chad, Gomez and the rest, really made an effort to look after you in the field, the lodge and the skinning shack (if you were lucky enough). The outfitter Steve was great to talk to and accommodating with a last minute addition to our group. All the meals were great, prepared by Miss Robermto??, she accommodated everyone\u2019s special requests. The lodging was fine, we were in the separate house, which our group preferred. It was quiet and all you could ask for when hunting.\n\nTraveling, from Naples, FL and upstate, NY, we had 5 hunters in the group ranging in experience and age (mid 30\u2019s \u2013 70\u2019s). Though we arrived right on the cusp of the rut, the weather shut everything down. Nice weather the first day, the second day turned below 20F, winds 15-20mph, and 100% humidity. The third day more of the same but with 1-2 inches of snow on the ground, the snow improved visibility but didn\u2019t help with the deer moving.\n\nTwo does were taken in our group the second day. I saw eight deer that day and probably missed others, at least three were bucks, but none with four points on one side. The last 20 minutes of the last day, saw a nice buck but could only count three points (need a better scope). My brother was on a big buck for three days but couldn\u2019t get a shot. This is not hunting in fenced areas or over bait, so don\u2019t expect it to be like that.\n\nSome in our group might not give as high a rating, but we all had a really good time (some didn\u2019t see deer, lodging switches, long drive times, lack of sleep and bad weather were contributing factors). Bringing home meat always improves the ride home. Had the feeling the hunting was really good here, but it is all about timing.

I have my own properties I manage and also take several hunts a year ,with experienced guides, in many different regions of the country. Masterrack Lodge is hands down the best money I have ever spent on a hunting experience. This includes some of the high end guides in the Dakota's, Texas and even Illinois.\n\nThe first trip was a shot in the dark. It was late season, my property in Georgia was spent and I wanted to try and catch the rut one more time. My hunting partner and I chose Masterrack just because we had the opportunity at 2 Bucks. Going in blind is not my style but this by far was the best 'Hail Mary' call I have made in life to date.\n\nAnytime I enter a new environment I like to sit back and see how everyone is treated and grab a feel for the 'culture' of my surroundings. From the moment we arrived we were treated with respect and warmth. The entire crew were very courteous and everyone worked to make you feel comfortable.\n\nI will get to the hunting in a moment but one of the best moments I witnessed is when the Owner, Steve, was approached with a situation I think I was not supposed to hear. Another guest had brought his 12 year old son to try and get his first buck. He had an opportunity that morning and took it. When they brought the animal to the lodge he was about an inch short on his inside spread. You could see the young boys body language change as he heard the news, shoulders dropped, head down and that wonderful smile erased from his face. Steve whispered in the fathers ear, what was said I didn't hear, but the next thing I heard was Steve telling the boy about how that was a fine first deer and it was better than his first. He spent the next 15 minutes cheering the boy up and when he was done the boy was back to walking on air again. Come to find out he waived the fine. Its hard not to respect a man that passed on money to make sure he did not ruin the experience for the father and son. That is something I have seen the exact opposite of in other lodges that give you the feeling it is al about the dollar and not the experience.\n\nAs far as the hunting,  this last year was our 5 year at Masterrack. We have experienced some poor weather from 88 degree January's to freak snow storms. At no point did Steve or his staff hesitate. They dialed up the intensity and worked to get us where we needed to be. Every trip we have had the opportunity. We have not always taken it but the chance was there.\n\nSteve is very passionate about his work, his reputation and the experience his guests have while there. He ensures his staff are experienced hunters, educated on his property, know the characteristics of his heard and understand the importance of Customer Service.  Enjoying the company of the Staff almost makes you take for granted the accommodations. Everything is top notch. The only warning I have is make sure you pack a set of clothes that are one size bigger because you will need them for the ride home after eating Roberta's cooking!! :)\n\nI can't thank Masterrack enough for all the wonderful memories. Every year when I leave Plant City it feels more like I am going to a Family Reunion combined with a great hunting trip.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888dbb77f4b8761f:0xf2ca06acf8f95936"}

There where plenty of stands we went to, they all had food plots and feeders located to give you a average 100-125 yard shot. The opportunity was there for me to harvest a nice deer but I failed to seal the deal. I will definitely be going back to hunt with Keith, Zack and Jamie again. Thanks again guys.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1610422870409, "text": "Thank you Robert.   We enjoyed having you hunt with us.  Hope to see you again.
