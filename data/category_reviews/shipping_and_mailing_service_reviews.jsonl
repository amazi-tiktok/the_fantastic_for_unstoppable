You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry.

Our records indicate that you\u2019ve shipped two packages with us in as many years. One internationally, yes - we must ask questions about your shipment. \u201cWhat are you sending? What is the value?\u201d The details are required, not by us - but by international customs. We would absolutely not ask any \u201cinappropriate\u201d questions.\n\nLast week you came in and wanted to ship a box of \u201cparts\u201d and insure it. Yes, again, we need to know what you are sending and how much it\u2019s worth. Not out of curiosity, but for insurance purposes. Again, not inappropriate questions. You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry. When you bring your items to us to ship, part of our service is ensuring that your item will make it to its destination in perfect shape. Sorry if you find this expertise \u201cnosey\u201d.

I own a small business that I run out of my home in McMullen Cove (and yes, I do have a license with the City of Huntsville).  I mail packages on a daily basis.  Today, I missed my mail pick up and our local post office had already closed so we drove down to this store so that we could ensure our packages would go out today.  My 12 year old went in first and was refused service.  So, I then took the packages and went inside only to be told that, \"I don't receive anything from the Post Office for compensation and am not required to provide service to you.\"   I asked for her to put that in writing, she refused, spewed some other nastiness until 2 other individuals came in and I told her I would be reporting her to the proper authorities and I left.   As I type this, I am still shaken, that this kind of bigotry and hatred can still exist.  That people feel they have the right to treat others with such vile.  I will not be returning to this location ever and would strongly urge others to also find somewhere else to spend your hard earned money.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1533411883334, "text": "Wow, I feel I have to respond to this - this goes beyond misleading and is simply a lie.

We really try hard to make every customers experience here a very good one. As I explained to you when you were here - your postal labels would not scan. I tried on both registers  - your labels were not clear enough to be scanned. You knew they were poor labels beforehand, because you were quick to *demand* that I type the numbers in and give you a receipt. I explained that we do not do this, as the post office may never scan and relabel them and we would be held responsible for shipments not delivered as the location that accepted them. I never refused to scan your items, I scanned them several times. I did refuse to give you a receipt for items that won't scan. Again, I'm sorry that you are not happy, but please don't make a racial issue out of a situation that race simply had no bearing. That is extremely sad.

What is the value?\u201d The details are required, not by us - but by international customs. We would absolutely not ask any \u201cinappropriate\u201d questions.\n\nLast week you came in and wanted to ship a box of \u201cparts\u201d and insure it. Yes, again, we need to know what you are sending and how much it\u2019s worth. Not out of curiosity, but for insurance purposes. Again, not inappropriate questions. You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry. When you bring your items to us to ship, part of our service is ensuring that your item will make it to its destination in perfect shape. Sorry if you find this expertise \u201cnosey\u201d.

I explained that we do not do this, as the post office may never scan and relabel them and we would be held responsible for shipments not delivered as the location that accepted them. I never refused to scan your items, I scanned them several times. I did refuse to give you a receipt for items that won't scan.

What is the value?\u201d The details are required, not by us - but by international customs. We would absolutely not ask any \u201cinappropriate\u201d questions.\n\nLast week you came in and wanted to ship a box of \u201cparts\u201d and insure it. Yes, again, we need to know what you are sending and how much it\u2019s worth. Not out of curiosity, but for insurance purposes. Again, not inappropriate questions. You were very vague about what it was - turned out to be paintball gun equipment, once we ascertained that it wasn\u2019t firearm parts (we aren't licensed to send firearms or HAZMAT) and had no compressed cartridges included (HAZMAT) - we shipped it for you.\n\nYou seemed fine with the transaction at the time - I wish you had had the courage to complain in person instead of leaving a fully misleading review. Some people take these reviews seriously. Truth is, unhappy people write reviews, happy people come back (our customer count is up 30% since we bought the store in October) and we will continue to help our absolutely wonderful customers do what they are trying to do.\n\nOur staff has over 20 years collective experience in the packing and shipping industry. When you bring your items to us to ship, part of our service is ensuring that your item will make it to its destination in perfect shape. Sorry if you find this expertise \u201cnosey\u201d.

I had searched as best as I could online to determine if UPS had a main warehouse in the area to which I could have a package delivered.  I kept getting redirected to the local UPS stores, like this one.  I even called the UPS customer service line to find out if there was a local warehouse, and was placed on hold for 30 mins before I gave up.  I then checked for a local UPS store (again, including this location), went to the location\u2019s website, copied the address, and used it for shipping.\n\n***At no point was there any indication from the primary UPS website or this local UPS store website that any charges may be incurred for using the address for shipping***\n\nSo, as the clerk brought my box to me, they stated there would be a $5 charge.  Surprised, I asked why and was told it was because I used their location as a shipping address.  I was also informed by the clerk the location was not an \u201cactual\u201d UPS location, so there were extra fees that may be incurred. I said I understood, and asked they show me any literature that indicated there was a charge for using the location for my shipping.  They could not produce any literature, documentation, or point out anywhere on their website that this particular service would incur a fee.  However, the clerk did advise if I had simply called the store ahead of time to ask about shipping, they would\u2019ve informed me about the charge.\n\nIn this day and age, who calls for quick info unless it\u2019s a last resort? And why aren\u2019t these charges posted on UPS corporate site or on the local store\u2019s site?  Where\u2019s the transparency?\n\nI tried to give them the benefit of the doubt - I stepped out of line so they could assist other customers and I searched online on my phone for any indication of a charge for this service and found none.  So, really folks, this store - based on their logic - could hold your package ransom for whatever amount they want: $5, $15, $20?  The charge is not posted anywhere, they have your shipment, and won\u2019t release it until you pay.\n\nAfter a fun back-and-forth between me and the manager (?), she finally, out of the \u201cgoodness of her heart\u201d (she essentially spat those words out at me), allowed me to take my shipment without charging me.  She also made certain she made some serious notes near my pick-up signature for her future reference.  Finally, as I was leaving, she made one of those passive-aggressive comments to her colleague, but loud enough to be certain I heard it, something to the extent of: \u201call of this over $5?!\u201d  I responded, \u201cYes. Over $5.\u201d  There have been many times when $5 made or broke my week.\n\nI completely understand and support a business\u2019s right to charge whatever they want for whatever products or services. However, we should not be ransomed into paying some arbitrary, unpublished, hidden charge that we are surprised with at the counter before we can pick up a package. This is the digital age - there is no reason that charge can\u2019t be easily - and prominently - be listed on their website.  Or even printed on one of their many signs behind the counter, or even on a menu of costs/services that they can hand the customer.  Where is the transparency??  But there was nothing other than the word of the clerk.  In this day and age, and in a business that aligns itself with such a large delivery corporation, that lack of information is egregious, especially due to how easy of a fix it is - just update the damned website.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626f0c76816d65:0xbc02540c826f8b7c"}

I mentioned this to her (I was more than willing to buy tape, if needed), but she just scanned the box in and put it to the side without a word.

However, the young associate did admit to punching the holes wrong on Saturday, and tried to the best of her ability to correct the problem. She also told us that she became very nervous after punching the cover page of your book wrong, which may have lead you to believe she was in a hurry. She also told us that you came back a 2nd time on Saturday, because you thought the coil was not installed correctly and replaced the coil for you, even though she felt like there was nothing wrong with coil binding that she had done. You called on Monday morning to complain about your Church -Songs of Inspiration Book. The associate on the phone happily reprinted you a NEW Song Book (that you emailed to the store); rebound your book with a clear cover, blue back cover and a new coil bind at NO CHARGE. The associate on the phone did all of this without even seeing the book that was supposedly not correct. When you came in on Monday the NEW book was ready for you. We do realize that you encountered the same associate again on Monday when you came back into the store. We do wish that you would have asked for a manager to review the book that you felt was not correctly complete.

It\u2019s either mail we ship doesn\u2019t deliver, or packages we ordered don\u2019t come. The only way the packages actually get where they need to be is when we actually have to make a special trip to the post office to sort it out, and even then it takes a while for the mail to get to it\u2019s destination. Whenever you try to call the post office to sort it out you have to spend a while on the phone with confusing recordings, and then on top of that you never even speak to another human. They should do something to fix this, and they should quit having all these confusing recordings, and just have an actual human answer the calls. If someone actually answered the calls instead of a recording, it would save people a lot of wasted time and confusion. Another problem we\u2019ve had constantly is packages being delivered to our house that aren\u2019t ours, and then we have to deliver them to the person they were meant to go to. The only reason I\u2019m giving this post office a two star rating, is because of the excellent work they\u2019ve done in the past.

I place my phone on speaker while it rang 9 minutes before they opened because I was at work. The phone rang for 51 seconds before someone picked up and hung up. I thought it was an honest mistake. I called back, this is when someone picks up immidiately to quickly respond with a long phrase to which is was unintelligible but the end of the sentence was \"we open at 9 okay bye\", with no time to even apologize for not realizing the time difference. I call back at 1001 eastern time now being that it is 901 in alabama, same guy answers. I asked him if he was the gentleman I had recently spoken too? He immidiately gets defensive and says we were not open you need to call back at 9 when we open, to which I replied it is 901. He proceeds to attempt to rush me off the phone to get back to loading packages. He is clearly upset with how the 9 minutes prior to this call has gone. I was calling to ask to have my packages held at the location because of how many will be coming in between now and Friday so as to not inconvenience them with a large amount of packages over a few days. Due to him being immediately cynical of how he assumed I was just being annoying with the phone ringing \"50 times\" in his words,, which when would it ever be justifiable to answer and hang up? I'm just going to call back? Why be so negative? I was trying to do you a favor. My packages left the carrier facility at 647 this morning in abbeville, I live 6 minutes away by car.

Funny thing is is I am the only female working here and I received no calls. I asked Cindy who this persons name was and she couldn't remember apparently. She also said that Bryan said he may have dropped it off at the store beside us that he couldn't remember. I've spoke to the owner the manager and the employees and they all said that they never received our package and that none of them have received a phone call from her. I figured it may have been the mall manager so I called her, nope not her either. I asked for some kind of proof that it was delivered and they could not give me any form of proof, I asked why he documented that it was delivered to a mailbox and he was saying he delivered it to us (why is the documentation off u know) and she said oh well they sometimes accidentally push the wrong button and file it wrong. So on top of them losing two of our packages and lying to us and having false documentation they are now saying that they are not gonna reimburse us for any of our packages they have lost.

My mail is left with my neighbors mail in their boxes at times. Not always, mind you, just sometimes. And Why is it that our carrier will leave 2 out of 3 packages stuffed inside our jumbo box, and take the 3rd back with him causing Amazon to notify me that the carrier COULD NOT MAKE IT TO MY DOOR to leave my package and that I must contact the carrier to track it down?? My front door is about a hundred or so yards from my  mailbox & the carrier has left packages at my front door before numerous times. However,  yesterday he could not. I called the Post Office, spoke with the supervisor on June 11, 2019, tried to find out where my package was like Amazon told me to do, and  after a brief hold was told shortly & quickly the carrier will bring my package out today and the call was disconnected. How rude.  Why was it not left yesterday with the other two packages that WERE delivered?? Were there dragons in my driveway he just could not overcome??  And for over a month now, for some reason when the carrier tries to leave my mail the door on my mailbox decides to attack and tears itself from the box and flings itself into the ditch. My husband has tried to force it to stay by installing new rivets to hold the door on the box on (2) two separate occasions. We have finally stepped up to using bolts to fasten the door to the box. We sincerely hope this will stop our wayward mailbox from acting so rudely to our mail carrier. Hopefully this will help encourage our carrier to know we care about our mail and packages and appreciate him doing the same.

You\u2019ll be the problem be the end of the conversation. Our carrier wasnt delivering packages to our door in our complex for about two or so weeks, and when we complained about never receiving the package we were told that our mailbox wasn\u2019t labeled clearly enough and that he thought our building was abandoned bc of mail being piled up in ONE. Our boxes are labeled by a big bronze number to match our doors.. so they are labeled, but we agreed to pull a little weight despite this clearly not being our fault and the staff being a little rude. There\u2019s four mail slots and only one full from vacancy.. which isn\u2019t our mailbox and it wasnt a month ago when that same mail box was full and ours was being checked regularly. The other two people in our cluster were receiving mail fine and this didn\u2019t become a problem for us until about two weeks ago. We have been here for MONTHS. It\u2019s super easy to get our utility bill, but when it comes to our other mail suddenly our apartment was \u201cabandoned\u201d. There is no place for packages so they would have to walk up the stairs to deliver it anyways like they had done before, and as UPS and FEDex does. Come home today to a package shoved in the mail box. Anytime there\u2019s a flimsy package it gets delivered to me because they\u2019re easier to fold and shove into the mail slot, but if it\u2019s a box heaven forbid. The idea of the carrier being lazy or confused wasn\u2019t even entertained.\n\nThis review was posted in the past but I figured I\u2019d give it a little update since some time has passed. Was 3 stars and I think 1 is sufficient. After the situation above, we had a new mail carrier assigned to us after a month or so. New mail carrier refused to deliver any mail to my part of the complex. I would literally watch her deliver to other buildings. The only thing that set our apart was that there were extra stairs from the parking lot to climb before you got to our boxes. Other buildings got their mail but ours never got delivered. We fought with our landlords and the post office over who\u2019s responsibility it was to fix the mailbox situation. No matter how many times I tried there was not getting in contact with the post master. My landlords went as far as replacing the mail box itself because the first excuse was that the mail boxes weren\u2019t secure.  I started to think that maybe the post master didn\u2019t even exist as it was impossible to get them on the phone or even in front of me when I was at the counter. Again, no one wanted to entertain the idea of the mail carrier not wanting to do their job was even an option. To give you a time frame we started having issues in Aug of 2019. We didn\u2019t get a single piece of mail until January 2020 when we MOVED because we couldn\u2019t get any mail and it was clear no one with the power to fix things was going to do it. and guess who I\u2019ve recently seen in pictures disrupting a public event on the property? The good ole post master.

I was shipping to packages off today, one to my mortgage company and another to At&t.

It was still down so she directed me to the UPS store about 1.2 miles away and I went to go get in the car to call ATT before going to UPS to see if this was a outage all over it just Fedex Kinkos. The ATT representative told me they didn\u2019t have a issue so I go back in the store to see if their system was back up. A older lady that I helped in the store before leaving stopped me and said the Caucasian guy behind me earlier had a package he was shipping back to At&t as well. The representative told him that the system was down but she would hold it for him and ship it when the system came back up. I asked the representative when I walked back in the store was the system back up, she replied no it\u2019s still down. I asked could she hold my package and ship it when it come back up, she replied they aren\u2019t allowed to do this.\n\nI replied but you just did it for the Caucasian man who was sending a package to At&t to.

I even have my own personal Fed Ex account.  However about a year ago Fed Ex must have brought in a new female day manager or supervisor and she behaves like a shrew.  I was believe her name was Helen.  She misquotes Fed Ex's shipping policy and refuses to use \"banker's\" boxes and other good boxes that are actually more sturdy than she sells at that outlet. She says it is FedEx's policy and I have since found out - it is not FedEx policy, but may be the individual store policy.  But she says it is FedEx policy.  However, she is most loud and belligerent and actually refuses to ship unless in boxes \"like she sells\" and pulls off the shelf \"because Fed Ex will no longer accept those boxes\".  Not true.  She won't accept the boxes.  She claims my boxes are not as sturdy (not true) and it is FED EX's policy not to accept those boxes.  Not true.  I've checked Fed Ex's shipping and packing policies and my boxes are very acceptable...and they are more sturdy than the boxes she is trying to force me to buy.  I will no longer ship there but ship through my work and have the charges deducted form my payroll.  Fed Ex is happy to pick up my boxes at my work without trying to make me buy boxes from Fed Ex.  My work place ships many boxes like my boxes (that's where I get my boxes) without any problem.  Someone needs to retrain or terminate the weekday supervisor or manager at this office.  I have read of many complaints about the personnel at FedEx-Kinko locations since Kinko and Fed Ex combined their locations.  I will not go back to this location with Helen there.  When I can't use my work place for shipping (as when the boxes too heavy for me to take in), I have driven 35 miles round trip to drop off my boxes elsewhere instead of dealing with this unpleasant person...what a shrew.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b9130ca25b5:0x5bd40fa6ae8c11d"}

I've called at different times of the day, and I've called multiple times in a row, no one picks up. I had to go by in person just to talk to someone. The first time, I was able to get my package there, but recently I've had 2 separate packages mysteriously not in my mailbox that say they are delivered by USPS to my mailbox, and I have not been able to get anyone to get back to me about this issue.\n\nI contacted USPS Customer Service, who contacted the post office for me and said they would call me. The post office called, asked if I got my package and I said no, so they said they'll call me right back after speaking with the carrier. They did not call back, that was a week ago. I called many times to get back in touch, but like I said - no one picks up. I received an email from USPS customer service saying my issue is resolved, saying my package was in a parcel locker and to check my mailbox for the key. The parcel lockers were empty and there was no key in my mailbox. I tried to call the post office, no answer. After a few days, I went by in person. The clerk took my info and assured me that the carrier will contact me. They did not. I still do not have my packages.\n\nI have reported one of the packages missing to the business I purchased it from because it has been two weeks since it was \"delivered\" and all they could do is start an investigation with USPS. The other, I will wait a few days and if it's not here I will report it missing as well. Currently I'm out about $100 or so with none of the items I purchased, and I can't get any info on what has happened to the packages.

So about 2 weeks ago my wife ordered some very expensive items that were set to be shipped through USPS... Most might assume shipping was the issue, NOT this time... The reason for a 1 star review was all about the DELIVERY... So normally anytime a package is delivered to our home (no matter who the courier is) its placed either at the gate of our courtyard or right at the front door (12 feet from the gate)... NOT this time... Instead who ever management has decided to run our route decided to place the large package on top off not only our mailbox but also on top of our neighbors mailbox (2 mail boxes 2 post). WTH!!! Our mailbox is 2 acres away from the house and by the way even though its personal business im a disabled Veteran, (cant just walk to the mailbox so dont try a think im just lazy) so i had to watch and make sure no one stole this large package until my wife or neighbor came home and checked the mail after work...

I have since gone to 2 other postal locations in an attempt to get assistance with tracking the package. Coincidence is hard to believe at this point.

If your postal inspector general says that your mail is not considered \"mail\" until it has been scanned into the office, but your postal clerks REFUSE to give consumers proof that they submitted a package, it means that the postal service does not have to pay claims to people when they lose their packages, because there is no way to prove that the package was even received by the post office. I think this is a way for the post office to get away with theft and neglect. This is the second time that I have taken my package into a post office and was told that I could not have a receipt. I have not received confirmation that my package was scanned. My last package was stolen and I was informed that I couldn't submit a claim because they never scanned my package in. So even though the clerk told me to leave it there, it ended up being my fault for leaving it, and the post office would not pull the film unless it was a threat. So I lost my money and items, and received a big fat F you from the post office. I know I walked into that office with three packages, and left with none. And my package was never found. The post office is wrong for this and this is exactly why you are loosing money.\n\nUpdate...they did it again! I ordered boxes from the post office...online because you can get them FREE!!! Why did I go into the post office and the lady at the front desk attempted to CHARGE me for the box?!!!! Then said that she wasn\u2019t going to ship my package unless I paid.

They constantly lose mail and packages, and flat out refuse to help when looking for items when I go in. The worst incident happened between 3-12-19 and 3-14-19. Had a phone case from ottorbox sent through  FedEx, and they handed it off to USPS for residential delivery. My tracking # through FedEx said package was undelivered due to incorrect address. Blatant lie from USPS. When to this USPS center to try and retrieve my package. They woman at the customer service desk argued with me I had no package there. When asked to confirm my tracking number, they told me they were \"unauthorized to release the package\" even though I had several forms of prof it was mine. Funny how it was magically there now. I contacted Otterbox about the incident trying to find away to get my package, and even they where confused as to what was going on. They sent me copies of what I needed to have my package released to me from the USPS center, and now its magically not there again. Imagine that... Luckily Otterbox is replacing the case and paid for new shipping so it won't go through USPS this time.\n\nLast time I checked, theft of mail is a federal crime in the U.S. I really don't understand how these employees still have a job, let alone not having charges brought against them.\n\nAVOID THIS CENTER AT ALL COST!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4e2c20c2e645:0xad6ec1c478ddce45"}

We are ten folks from Birmingham who do graphic design and digital and wide-format printing and offer UPS, USPS, and DHL services as a third-party vendor.\n\nYour complaint against the United Parcel Service, Inc is an understandable one, but rating our location 1* won't accomplish any change. We aren't the logistics company based out of Atlanta, and this location isn't owned by them either. Your review is understandably but incorrectly levied at us, and that hurts our business, despite that fact that we don't operate UPS trucks, nor do we maintain UPS drop boxes.\n\nWe know the name \"The UPS Store\" makes us sound like a corporate entity, but we're not, or else we couldn't say that the name \"The UPS Store\" was a stupid choice for loosely-affiliated franchises.\n\nWe would kindly ask that you remove your rating if you are not one of our customers, or that you correct your rating to reflect our service correctly if you have commissioned work from us before. Again, that would really help our locally owned small business thrive. We can also put you in touch with people at UPS who can actually help get your complaint to the right people.

The person I was dealing with was so horrible and incompetent that after 5-6 phone calls over 3 days(and zero of 4 emails responded to, emails with all the pertinent information for items to be picked up, packed and shipped) I asked to speak to a manager, well Bradley WAS the manager.  Great.  I asked if he had a supervisor or the owner and he dismissively told me HE was in charge - this is where the attitude ramped up, before it was somewhat subtle.\n\nHe would not respond to any email asking for quotes or telling me when they would pick up the items (the pickup service they offer).  It was like he didn't want to have record of the quotes or times in email.  He would respond to direct questions in email with \"would you please just call me, how hard is that\" - as if my schedule revolved around him.\n\nAfter 3 weeks of trying to get them to pick up the auction lot, I made arrangements with another UPS store that would pick up the same day.  I called to cancel at the previous store, told Kody (who told Bradley while I was on the phone) and someone else as well and I also emailed the cancellation.  3-4 hours later they used the paperwork from the first email to pick up the items and I was informed by the other UPS store that the items were already picked up (the seller wasn't supposed to release it to them either but that isn't as much their fault)\n\nWhen they packed up the items they used a huge box, about 3x larger than what was actually necessary basically tripling the cost of everything. It was very expensive now.  I knew this wasn't right so I emailed asking for the weight and dimensions of the box he used, and I got a reply of the dimensions and a \"just call us\" response.  This was after I had called 4-5 times that day and they were always too busy to talk.  Now he wanted me to call immediately (6 hours after the my first call) and when I didn't he proceeded to call 6 times in 30 minutes while I was  on the other line (call waiting beeping 40-50 times for each call, he just let it ring harassing me - I couldn't end my call it was important and why I called 6 hours prior and used email).\n\nThis harassment continued 3 more times with about 2-3 calls each time until their closing time (total of about 13-15 calls, ringing non-stop b/c no voicemail turned on).\n\nMy calls the next two days were hung up on, I never knew who answered the phone, but 5 calls were immediately hung up on when they were switched to an employee.\n\nI called the other UPS store I had scheduled and told them what was going on and was going to have them pick up the items to ship.  I was informed of who to ask for at the other store and that they would be helpful.  I called back and got someone I hadn't worked with - Mikee.\n\nThis was a delight. From the very beginning the attitude was like night and day.  Bradley has no business working with customers or in customer service.  Mikee was helpful, promptly returning emails with complete answers and readable sentences, complete quotes, etc.  Included in the emails were the photos of how Bradley wrapped the items and it looked like a 4yr old had done it.\n\nThere were a couple fragile items, noted 3-4 times in previous emails (maybe Bradley can't read, IDK) that were to be wrapped in bubble wrap b/c they were glass.  These were the only things not in bubble wrap.  The large bulky durable plastic items were layered in bubble wrap and I told him they didn't need ANY.  So, Mikee took everything out of Bradley's packaging and re-packaged the items and did an EXCELLENT job.  I would rate that  part 5 stars,  but after 3+ weeks with Bradley, 1 star is too much.\n\nThe final shipping was less than 1/2 what Bradley quoted (and it wasn't $5 vs $10, it was MUCH higher).  The items arrived and everything looks to be in  order.\n\nI just can't understand how this business can make Bradley a manager and deal with customers. I had another problem with  them 1 year ago with bad packaging on a piece of glassware, it looked like a 4yr old wrapped it too.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1553624970087, "text": "Thank you so much for your review.

Every single The UPS Store location is an individual franchise operating under The UPS Store, Inc. brand, a brand that is a wholly owned subsidiary of the United Parcel Service. We are not 'affiliates,' we are a child company that is both wholly owned and legally distinct from UPS, Inc.

We do, however, apologize for the inconvenience this caused you. As you'll recall, when you came in on Friday, November 3rd at around 2pm, our associate did attempt to explain this to you.

And if I would have paid them to print my label he would have done it complimentary.\nSAFE to say I will be using I different location. I have never been to UPS that has treated me this poorly. They are always more than happy to spare a few feet of tape to wrap up my packages. Not to mention Amazon packages. That company brings them so much money it\u2019s unreal.

Now there have been times where a Customer may come in and unintentionally speak out and over other customers while Staff members are already working directly with the customer in front of them so then a speedy response by the Staff to a question may seem short, but our goal is always to provide the information that you may need. To provide a Positive Customer Service Experience is why we train and what we always strive to provide. Again, we appreciate your business and look forward to seeing you again. I will also be glad to personally discuss this further with you at any time. Most Sincerely, Jim Rice, Manager."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4b52e480c703:0x30f18384884524fb"}

Normally I have received AWESOME service at the Brookwood location from the nicest people you can imagine. However, today, Tuesday August 4th 2020, we (husband and I) went to the PO around 9 a.m. to send off a package and the young lady that we dealt with was SO EXTREMELY RUDE...for no reason whatsoever. Just last week my husband had to send off something else and the lady that helped him was SO nice; she helped him seal it correctly and as is normal with NICE and FRIENDLY people/employees, she informed him of when the package should arrive, other details, etc. Today was the complete opposite. I don't know if she was having a bad day or what but she was so rude to us. We realized that the package needed some tape on it (we just come home from the hospital from surgery in the package was in the car and we realized that we should stop by the post office but we saw that it needed to be taped up more...which is usually no big deal) and she literally asked us to pay for the tape....I believe she said \"if it's not Priority Mail then you will have to pay for the tape.\" Which yes of course it was Priority Mail, but she hadn't even bothered to ask at this point. However no worries to you Miss Rude Employee... IF IT HAD NOT BEEN PRIORITY MAIL I/WE WOULD HAVE BEEN WILLING TO PAY THE $0.25 or $5 WORTH OF A FEW PIECES OF TAPE.\n\nAnyway, Little Miss Friendly taped it up herself in a messy way of course because it must have really been putting her out from sitting at her seat drinking her drink that she had to put down to \"help\" us (if that's what you want to call being helped). However with that attitude there was no way we'd dare say anything to her. She flung the receipt and said \"here ya go.\" No, \"have a good day,\" or \"thank you,\" ...nothing.\n\nFolks we're in a different time right now with Covid-19 and there are a lot of people who would like to have a job and having one with the USPS is a very good one so if you don't want to do a job that deals with the public because you're rude and you have an attitude- DON'T DO IT!

Do NOT send valuables through this service. Request UPS or FedEx instead.\n\nI have the unfortunate luck to have this office service our location. My roommates and I have had issues with packages not being delivered before, and the only way of resolving this issue is to go to the office (they will NOT answer the phone). After waiting in line, you will be told something along the lines that you weren't home, or that no one answered the door. This is completely false, as we will usually be waiting for the knock.\n\nI ordered a university class ring from Balfour. They shipped it via USPS. I should mention that they do not have an automated system to email package tracking numbers (really guys?). More than enough time had passed to make and send the ring, so I called to check on its status. They claimed that it had been sent 3 weeks before my call. I was dumbfounded, but asked for them to send me the tracking number so that I could follow up on it. Checked the status of the package: Out for Delivery. They could have \"lost\" the package, but I find that highly improbable if it made it all the way here with no issues.\n\nAttempted calling, to no avail. I then visited their office, only to be told that they couldn't find it. I was also asked repeatedly why I had waited so long to notify them (it had been an hour since I found out). I had to repeatedly explain the situation to each person and it seemed as though they just couldn't grasp it. I finally gave up after some weak promises of finding it. I called Balfour and notified them of the situation so that they could start working on things from their end.\n\nI then called the USPS service number. I was on hold for 55 minutes before speaking to a representative. He was very helpful with setting up a case with the missing package and assigning the task to one of the location supervisors. I requested that they contact me through email so that I would have documentation of our conversations. Long story short, they couldn't find it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a90b855b949f:0xd82c06679a790ddf"}

Our house sits on a hill so if you don\u2019t continue down the road a little you don\u2019t see that the driveway continues all the way up the hill to the other side.

Next day comes and no package, and no updates other than my confirmation email. I called the local office it was being held at and the lady on the phone was extremely rude. She would cut me off mid sentence, and would ask me condescendingly if I had checked all around the house for it. She wouldn\u2019t let me get a word in edgewise. Right as I\u2019m about to give her the tracking number she cuts me off again to say she had people in the lobby and immediately puts me on hold for at least 10 minutes.

The medication was for my sons antidepressants. hes suicidal and nearly did it but not for someone walking it at the last second.. and so you can imagine what happened without his meds.\n\nAll the while, postman driving by and waving like he didnt have anything, while hes the one had it marked as vacant, and returned the mail every day. Three months later he decided the mailbox wasnt suitable and had the address cut off AGAIN. Aparently the VIRGINIA Tech logo on the side of the box wasnt approved (BY nick saban, i guess), so....same issue all over again. Sons BIRTHDAY Presents this time.

So basically, they can take a suicidally depressed 20 year old, and take his medication....steal his christmas presents AND birthday presents (the only reminders he gets of home)....have his lights, gas, and water cut off... cost us nearly $1,000 in cut on fees.....AND DO IT TWICE!   ..but they dont have any responsibility....  and this is the office we had to go through.\n\nTheres a national joke about Alabama being home of really moronic people, and when my son confirmed it and told me stories about his daily adventures, i still thought them exagerated.

From the only employee I\u2019ve ever seen there (Jay?) to the actual customer service online. The employee clearly wasn\u2019t trained on how to properly communicate to customers as there are a couple of issues that I would like to point out from that alone. He speaks in a manner that tells me, \u201cGet out of my face, I don\u2019t want to deal with this,\u201d or \u201cI know what I\u2019m talking about and you don\u2019t,\u201d which seems to not be the case as I\u2019m reading the everlasting one-star ratings. We walk into the store with no one at the front office and him doing whatever that he does. After the wait, he comes out, talking on the phone. I cannot even begin to explain how and why this was extremely disrespectful and even offending. We were having issues with the transaction of our package, however the way handled this was- to say the least- atrocious. He started muttering under his breath in his language, no doubt something less than appropriate in the workforce, directly to our faces. Not to mention the stench of smoke was absolutely putrid in this building. It\u2019s atrocious. I was thankful I had my mask, but it was still so strong that I couldn\u2019t wait to exit the establishment (from both his attitude and the stench). Speaking of masks, he did not have one throughout the entire time I came in. In a pandemic. Do I need to elaborate any further? In case you thought there couldn\u2019t be any more wrong with this situation, I called customer service and got hung up twice. The third time they tell me I have to make an account on their website in order to have any of my questions answered. That is by far the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever heard and if they wasn\u2019t enough, when I actually made an account, they acted as if I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think they actually allow customer service calls at all and this is their way of doing so. This is just for this location because I called customer service for every other UPS near me and they picked up right away. I am 110% sure that Jay is the reason I cannot call, as he was using the phone for his own personal enjoyment.

I have been to two other UPS Stores which can have the print job done in 10-15 mins tops.

You forgot to mention that you walked out to your car, and that is when other customers were helped. You also forgot to mention that the owner was working by himself as his employee was at lunch. A print job that was emailed earlier in the morning was being produced and we have one color machine, so it's impossible to work on 2 print jobs at the same time. So, that order would have been completed first. That's why you were offered to leave your flash drive and come back. We do know that more than one file, 5x5, fits on one page. The owner misspoke because his mind was on the other print job. We produce hundreds of these type of print jobs (invites, note cards, business cards, etc) each year and would be happy to assist you in the future. The best way for us to produce print jobs is when customers email us their files: store0924@theupsstore.com and let us know when they are needed.

I went in yesterday to drop off a package. They were swamped and it was a 45 minute wait. The wait was not the issue. It's December and I expected there to be a wait. The issue was that there was no social distancing encouraged in the small lobby space! There were 13 people crammed in a small area at one point + employees. There was one employee not wearing a mask at all. She kept walking around in the front area and making trips out the front door through the crowds of people. Another had on a 3\" chin visor mask, that let's be honest, wasn't protecting anyone. As someone that is high-risk and being very careful about being around people, this was an incredibly uncomfortable (but unfortunately necessary) trip to the UPS store for me.  The gentleman behind me also expressed how uncomfortable he was with the thought of having to step inside the lobby with so many people. In fact, we both hung back and allowed people to filter out before going inside, only to have many more people cram in behind us just moments after we walked in.\n\nWe've been at this pandemic thing for months. Concern for safety is not new. Why was there no one at this location telling people, \"So sorry guys, only 5 allowed inside at a time so we can keep everyone safe.\"  Not to mention the fact the if I have to wear my mask to enter the building, WHY are employees not required to wear proper masks as well?", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1608217204865, "text": "I am sorry that you had a bad experience.

The first time was for my driver\u2019s License and it was not delivered. The court house had to send it out a second time and thankfully it showed up or else I would\u2019ve had to pay another $60 for a retake. Then, it was my notice for my Medicaid that lets me know I need to refile. I had not received it and so now I don\u2019t have insurance coverage. Now it is my debit card and I had one that was supposed to be here a month ago and it is still not here. So I called my bank so they can send me another one after confirming my address, and I am giving them until tomorrow before I go to extreme measures. I have went up to the post office and filed claim cards and talked to the delivery supervisor myself because the delivery people won\u2019t put my mail on the box. Even my mother has talked to managers and supervisors before me.

The supervisor is saying there is no way the carrier could have broken it and that they are not going to do anything.

No, she was not. I quickly grabbed the package and left the store. I drove over to USPS down the road and went in to have the package shipped. The total cost for priority mail ended up being $32.50.

At first his stance was services were rendered because the dicument has been accepted in the past and its his principles (whatever they were). Finally we agree that he should issue a refund. He soon changed his mind and after I suggested him and his wife get on one accord with the policy and look into new notary standards.

She is correct about people not doing their job because that's the very reason the UPS store stopped taking prepaid USPS packages, because the USPS can't do their job. They lose packages, packages are delayed because they can't do their job and the UPS store should not have to take the blame for the USPS inadequate culture. So guess what?

We told the employee that we wanted the most economical option - the contents were valuable and needed insurance (china, books, birdhouse, rug, etc.), but speed was not a concern.  We were told 3 day residential was the cheapest option.\n\nOne of the five boxes was completely crushed during shipment and several china pieces were broken despite purchasing nearly $100 of bubble wrap and china specific packaging supplies.  I filed a claim with UPS, provided pictures, etc.  Without inspecting the box, UPS ultimately denied the claim because there was a sweater in the package that I'd sent in the box to free up room for stuff in my luggage.  UPS claimed it was inappropriate packaging material even though it was just part of the contents.  UPS would not discuss the denial with me because UPS deemed the UPS Store as the shipper (not me).\n\nDuring the claims process, I found out that ground service was available and would have been ~$200 less expensive.\n\nI called the UPS store and spoke to the manager.  I started by telling her about the insurance denial.  She said it was not their issue since they didn't package the box.  I agreed, but told her UPS will only speak with them (as the shipper) and that they needed to act on my behalf to help resolve the issue.  I next mentioned that we could have shipped the boxes via ground for less money and that staff misled us.  She became INCREDIBLY RUDE and told me the staff just recommended that service - not that it wasn't the cheapest option.  I pushed back and asked if she was present at the time of the transaction - she said no.  With no knowledge of the interaction, she continued to blindly and aggressively tell me what her staff said and did.  It was clear the conversation was going nowhere.\n\nA manager from a different location called later.  She said they'd file an appeal with UPS on our behalf.  No followup occurred.\n\nI rarely get fired up, but this experience was AWFUL!  The staff misled and overcharged us.  UPS denied a claim without ever inspecting the box.  UPS would not speak to me despite my family boxing, shipping, paying for and receiving the boxes.  The manager was incredibly rude.  They were unhelpful and failed to help resolve the claim with UPS.\n\nThis is a great store if this is the service you're looking for.\n\nTo make it even worse, as I was filing the dispute with UPS (which took hours and multiple calls), I contacted the UPS Store to get copies of our receipt.  They were helpful and said they'd send over the receipts.  Instead of sending our receipt, they accidentally emailed me a copy of another customer's DRIVERS LICENSE and SOCIAL SECURITY CARD.  I guess you can add careless to the list too.....\n\nFIND ANOTHER WAY/LOCATION TO SHIP YOUR UPS PACKAGES!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d6271b3defb:0x3377d583ad8084ed"}

Today I am compelled to leave a glowing commendation about a postal employee at the Trussville PO who was a picture of grace & good cheer under fire. His name is Rico. He was apparently working alone. There was a line when I arrived so I had the opportunity to observe him interact with several customers. He patiently answered questions, in one case a gentleman went on and on about junk mail & coupons & forwarding address \u2014 not a hint of frustration from Rico. Another lady left a package on the counter to be mailed. Rico had the presence to ask her to show him the label, which was actually a UPS label, and he gave her directions to the nearest drop-off point. She was visibly relieved by his averting her error. He JOGGED multiple times back & forth to help customers at various stations to attend to them. The electronic payment system was down temporarily \u2014 he was not flustered, and gave full dollar change, rounding up in favor of the customer. An older gentleman asked if he needed to wait in line (several people deep at that point) to ask for forms. Again gracious & adroit, Rico provided the forms to him in the same few second time period it would have taken to explain that he needed to stand in line.  Smiling, pleasant throughout, Rico was giving a clinic on customer service! Rico was so impressive I went back to wait in line again to buy stamps, not because I needed them, but in order to ask his name & compliment him for his excellent service.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObKglf_FhhTn1cCclV04NSPjSnYv7cZ42brkTP=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890d02d6332eaf:0xf77672fffd995050"}

I called USPS waited 5 hours for a call back when it should have taken 1 hour and the person told me he has no idea what this location is doing because the zip code shows the package is there responsibility and NOT the Trustville location.

It happens a lot in the past year.\n\n------------------\nEnd of new review\n------------------\n\nI have read several reviews from this place, and people have rated it low.

As someone who uses the post office a lot I know that the Gulf Shores office is one of the better offices around. They have a high volume of customers and mail. Prices are set by congess. Tax dollars are not used, the post office funds itself. Put yourself in the employees shoes dealing with customers that have messed up addresses or came to complain to them and they had nothing to do with that situation, but they listen and try and help. I know I would be a little frustrated sometimes too. Just a thought. Maybe it will make the experience better if you don't come in blaming everyone and just ask for help instead. Most of the negative comments i have read on here are just people whining because they didn't get exactly what they wanted and chances are they didn't pay to get it either. The post office has premium services for just about everything from special handling to restricted. You just have to be willing to pay for the service or properly wrap the items.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a04d774e72a2f:0xd2712a0f5729d160"}

Will not hand out General delivery mail except on Thursday and Friday between the hours of 2pm till 4pm. Called and talked to Postmaster and he stated that they would rather have you rent a P.O. box instead of using General Delivery. They would rather make the money off of P.O. box instead of the inconvenience of general delivery. Now I understand why the post office is going under. Lack of customer service. I explained to the post master it might be a good idea to post the general delivery rules somewhere so people will know. It sounded like he didn't care.
