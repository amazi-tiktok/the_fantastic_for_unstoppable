My wife had gotten him to roll it out to the car before she purchased it to make sure that it would fit in our vehicle. When I told him that's where the scuff came from he said oh no I took it straight out of the box so that's not possible. The stroller was a display model so there was no box at all.

The owner told my wife the set does not take long to come in, usually a couple of weeks and she will expedite the shipment. Since we purchased the set the customer service has been HORRENDOUS.!! When my wife purchased the set, they advised her a estimated delivery date would be provided on the following week since it was a weekend transaction and the Vendor was closed. Since that date the owner have failed to contact us on the delivery date. We made several attempts to establish a concrete date in which we were told by the owners, \u2018that is not the way they do business\u2019. On last Monday,  November 13, the owner reached out to me and said the crib and dresser would arrive on Thursday (Jax Birthday). After my wife was settled in her hospital room after having Jax, I called Posh Mommy to verify what time the truck was coming in order to pick up. The owner, Lisa told me \u2018the truck had not arrived and she will call back later that day.\u2019 I did not receive a phone call, in which I called the following day to pick up the set. Lisa\u2019s husband (co owner) claims he did not tell me it will arrive on Thursday but he claimed he hoped it would arrive on Thursday. On Friday, November 17th, he stated the shipment will be in on today. As of today, November 21st, we have not received our furniture. The owner now claims it will be in on tomorrow. Please help me share this experience, I have filed a complaint with the BBB and other parents need to know how POSH MOMMY does business. My wife was 9 months pregnant when she purchased the set believing the owner at her word. I guess that means nothing these days.#cribforJAX", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1573752892023, "text": "Mr Jackson, as we discussed on the multiple occasions, as signed in the contract with the store, it can take multiple weeks, worst case up to 16 weeks for furniture to arrive at our store.

My husband and I were having a hard time finding a nursery that we could both agree on for our second child. I suggested Posh Mommy and we went in there last thinking we probably couldn't afford it. When I walked in the owner immediately greeted us and asked what we were looking for. When I told her baby furniture, she wanted to show me her collection that was on sale. It was the Dolce Babi Grazi Crib and the pieces with it. It came in vanilla bean which is a vintage white and I loved it! It was a great deal and very well made. She pretty much had it over 1,000 dollars cheaper than the original prices. She let us look with no pressure. She told us she had already ordered it so if we were interested to let her know because she would hold it for us. We decided a few days later that that is what we wanted and when we called and told her, she also gave us 20% off the conversion kit because it was being ordered all at once. So we waited about a week and a half and our crib was there! (bc it was already ordered it didn't take as long as most orders) My husband and a friend went to pick it up and she was having a Veterans Day sale that weekend and our crib price dropped $100. So she felt sorry for us that we missed the sale and GAVE US A FREE CRIB MATTRESS AND TODDLER RAIL!!! I was blown away by her generosity. I had no idea that the crib price dropped so when she offered us all of that it really meant so much! The items she gave us retail way more than that $100 dollars. I am very impressed and plan on giving them more business in the future. THANKS POSH MOMMY ;)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886268e8fdc4fd2f:0x746533eb9aa4d4df"}

Back in March, I ordered a crib converter to convert my child's crib to a toddler bed. I was told it would take a little over a month for it to come in and they would call me as soon as it did.  The money came out of my account the day I placed the order. About 2 and half months later I still had not heard from them, so I called asking about my order.  They had absolutely no record of my order, however, I told them I had proof because I can show my bank statement where the money came out of my account.  They basically said they would call the company and work on getting it to me ASAP and they were supposed to call me back.  I never heard back from them.  This was just the beginning of many false promises and unreturned phone calls.  After I decided I couldn't deal with them anymore I went on the web and found the exact crib converter kit that I needed for less than half the price they sold it to me for.  At this point, I called and said I wanted my money back.  They agreed to return my money, but said they would have to mail it to me.  It has now been almost 5 months since I placed this order and I have yet to receive a crib converter or my money back.  And they are continuing to blow me off and not return my phone calls.  At this point, I'm at a loss for what to do. I know for sure, I will NEVER shop there again though.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886268e8fdc4fd2f:0x746533eb9aa4d4df"}

My wife bought an umbrella stroller from there about a week ago. We had some unexpected expenses arise and I went there with the receipt to return it. We had it just over a week and had never even taken it out of the car. It still had all the plastic on it and had never even been unfolded. When I walked in, they were not busy at all. There may have been three or four people in the entire store. I walked up to the counter and waited and waited and waited some more until finally going and asking someone to help me. I told him what I was there for and he immediately said they do not give refunds. He said he couldn't take back a used product and he could not be out that money. He was extremely rude and basically called me a liar. He said the stroller was obviously used because one of the wheels had a scuff on it. My wife had gotten him to roll it out to the car before she purchased it to make sure that it would fit in our vehicle. When I told him that's where the scuff came from he said oh no I took it straight out of the box so that's not possible. The stroller was a display model so there was no box at all. When I told him that I knew he was lying to me, he said well our return policy is posted on the counter there so if your wife is literate she could've read it. I wont go on about everything else that was said but I just want to let people know how they do business. He was EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional and I can see by all the other comments that I am not the only one who has experienced this. I will never shop there again and would advise anyone else not to either. I will be filing a report with the BBB and letting everyone I know how they treat people.

The owner told my wife the set does not take long to come in, usually a couple of weeks and she will expedite the shipment. Since we purchased the set the customer service has been HORRENDOUS.!! When my wife purchased the set, they advised her a estimated delivery date would be provided on the following week since it was a weekend transaction and the Vendor was closed. Since that date the owner have failed to contact us on the delivery date. We made several attempts to establish a concrete date in which we were told by the owners, \u2018that is not the way they do business\u2019. On last Monday,  November 13, the owner reached out to me and said the crib and dresser would arrive on Thursday (Jax Birthday). After my wife was settled in her hospital room after having Jax, I called Posh Mommy to verify what time the truck was coming in order to pick up. The owner, Lisa told me \u2018the truck had not arrived and she will call back later that day.\u2019 I did not receive a phone call, in which I called the following day to pick up the set. Lisa\u2019s husband (co owner) claims he did not tell me it will arrive on Thursday but he claimed he hoped it would arrive on Thursday. On Friday, November 17th, he stated the shipment will be in on today. As of today, November 21st, we have not received our furniture. The owner now claims it will be in on tomorrow. Please help me share this experience, I have filed a complaint with the BBB and other parents need to know how POSH MOMMY does business.

My husband and I were having a hard time finding a nursery that we could both agree on for our second child. I suggested Posh Mommy and we went in there last thinking we probably couldn't afford it. When I walked in the owner immediately greeted us and asked what we were looking for. When I told her baby furniture, she wanted to show me her collection that was on sale. It was the Dolce Babi Grazi Crib and the pieces with it. It came in vanilla bean which is a vintage white and I loved it! It was a great deal and very well made. She pretty much had it over 1,000 dollars cheaper than the original prices. She let us look with no pressure. She told us she had already ordered it so if we were interested to let her know because she would hold it for us. We decided a few days later that that is what we wanted and when we called and told her, she also gave us 20% off the conversion kit because it was being ordered all at once. So we waited about a week and a half and our crib was there! (bc it was already ordered it didn't take as long as most orders) My husband and a friend went to pick it up and she was having a Veterans Day sale that weekend and our crib price dropped $100. So she felt sorry for us that we missed the sale and GAVE US A FREE CRIB MATTRESS AND TODDLER RAIL!!! I was blown away by her generosity. I had no idea that the crib price dropped so when she offered us all of that it really meant so much! The items she gave us retail way more than that $100 dollars. I am very impressed and plan on giving them more business in the future. THANKS POSH MOMMY ;)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886268e8fdc4fd2f:0x746533eb9aa4d4df"}

My wife had gotten him to roll it out to the car before she purchased it to make sure that it would fit in our vehicle. When I told him that's where the scuff came from he said oh no I took it straight out of the box so that's not possible. The stroller was a display model so there was no box at all. When I told him that I knew he was lying to me, he said well our return policy is posted on the counter there so if your wife is literate she could've read it.

The owner told my wife the set does not take long to come in, usually a couple of weeks and she will expedite the shipment. Since we purchased the set the customer service has been HORRENDOUS.!! When my wife purchased the set, they advised her a estimated delivery date would be provided on the following week since it was a weekend transaction and the Vendor was closed. Since that date the owner have failed to contact us on the delivery date. We made several attempts to establish a concrete date in which we were told by the owners, \u2018that is not the way they do business\u2019. On last Monday,  November 13, the owner reached out to me and said the crib and dresser would arrive on Thursday (Jax Birthday). After my wife was settled in her hospital room after having Jax, I called Posh Mommy to verify what time the truck was coming in order to pick up. The owner, Lisa told me \u2018the truck had not arrived and she will call back later that day.\u2019 I did not receive a phone call, in which I called the following day to pick up the set. Lisa\u2019s husband (co owner) claims he did not tell me it will arrive on Thursday but he claimed he hoped it would arrive on Thursday. On Friday, November 17th, he stated the shipment will be in on today. As of today, November 21st, we have not received our furniture. The owner now claims it will be in on tomorrow. Please help me share this experience, I have filed a complaint with the BBB and other parents need to know how POSH MOMMY does business. My wife was 9 months pregnant when she purchased the set believing the owner at her word.

My husband and I were having a hard time finding a nursery that we could both agree on for our second child. I suggested Posh Mommy and we went in there last thinking we probably couldn't afford it. When I walked in the owner immediately greeted us and asked what we were looking for. When I told her baby furniture, she wanted to show me her collection that was on sale. It was the Dolce Babi Grazi Crib and the pieces with it. It came in vanilla bean which is a vintage white and I loved it! It was a great deal and very well made. She pretty much had it over 1,000 dollars cheaper than the original prices. She let us look with no pressure. She told us she had already ordered it so if we were interested to let her know because she would hold it for us. We decided a few days later that that is what we wanted and when we called and told her, she also gave us 20% off the conversion kit because it was being ordered all at once. So we waited about a week and a half and our crib was there! (bc it was already ordered it didn't take as long as most orders) My husband and a friend went to pick it up and she was having a Veterans Day sale that weekend and our crib price dropped $100. So she felt sorry for us that we missed the sale and GAVE US A FREE CRIB MATTRESS AND TODDLER RAIL!!! I was blown away by her generosity. I had no idea that the crib price dropped so when she offered us all of that it really meant so much! The items she gave us retail way more than that $100 dollars. I am very impressed and plan on giving them more business in the future. THANKS POSH MOMMY ;)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886268e8fdc4fd2f:0x746533eb9aa4d4df"}

We showed you the contract your sister-in-law signed stating that it could take up to 16 weeks to take delivery of the special ordered furniture.  One week into the order they started contacting us asking us about the status of the furniture delivery and   on every occasion we reminded them that special ordered furniture can take up to sixteen weeks but we hoped it would arrive much sooner.  We kept them abreast of status and put a caveat during each daily call to us that we were forwarding them what we had been told from the manufacturer and shipping company.  WE GOT IT TO YOU IN A MONTH, and during the Christmas shipping backlogs and snow storm at the manufacturer!     We are sorry that you thought your brother and sister-in-law were mistreated.

The money came out of my account the day I placed the order. About 2 and half months later I still had not heard from them, so I called asking about my order.  They had absolutely no record of my order, however, I told them I had proof because I can show my bank statement where the money came out of my account.  They basically said they would call the company and work on getting it to me ASAP and they were supposed to call me back.  I never heard back from them.  This was just the beginning of many false promises and unreturned phone calls.  After I decided I couldn't deal with them anymore I went on the web and found the exact crib converter kit that I needed for less than half the price they sold it to me for.  At this point, I called and said I wanted my money back.  They agreed to return my money, but said they would have to mail it to me.  It has now been almost 5 months since I placed this order and I have yet to receive a crib converter or my money back.  And they are continuing to blow me off and not return my phone calls.

My wife bought an umbrella stroller from there about a week ago. We had some unexpected expenses arise and I went there with the receipt to return it. We had it just over a week and had never even taken it out of the car. It still had all the plastic on it and had never even been unfolded. When I walked in, they were not busy at all.

I told him what I was there for and he immediately said they do not give refunds. He said he couldn't take back a used product and he could not be out that money. He was extremely rude and basically called me a liar. He said the stroller was obviously used because one of the wheels had a scuff on it. My wife had gotten him to roll it out to the car before she purchased it to make sure that it would fit in our vehicle. When I told him that's where the scuff came from he said oh no I took it straight out of the box so that's not possible. The stroller was a display model so there was no box at all. When I told him that I knew he was lying to me, he said well our return policy is posted on the counter there so if your wife is literate she could've read it. I wont go on about everything else that was said but I just want to let people know how they do business. He was EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional and I can see by all the other comments that I am not the only one who has experienced this.

When my wife purchased the set, they advised her a estimated delivery date would be provided on the following week since it was a weekend transaction and the Vendor was closed. Since that date the owner have failed to contact us on the delivery date. We made several attempts to establish a concrete date in which we were told by the owners, \u2018that is not the way they do business\u2019. On last Monday,  November 13, the owner reached out to me and said the crib and dresser would arrive on Thursday (Jax Birthday). After my wife was settled in her hospital room after having Jax, I called Posh Mommy to verify what time the truck was coming in order to pick up. The owner, Lisa told me \u2018the truck had not arrived and she will call back later that day.\u2019 I did not receive a phone call, in which I called the following day to pick up the set.

My husband and I were having a hard time finding a nursery that we could both agree on for our second child. I suggested Posh Mommy and we went in there last thinking we probably couldn't afford it. When I walked in the owner immediately greeted us and asked what we were looking for. When I told her baby furniture, she wanted to show me her collection that was on sale. It was the Dolce Babi Grazi Crib and the pieces with it. It came in vanilla bean which is a vintage white and I loved it! It was a great deal and very well made. She pretty much had it over 1,000 dollars cheaper than the original prices. She let us look with no pressure. She told us she had already ordered it so if we were interested to let her know because she would hold it for us. We decided a few days later that that is what we wanted and when we called and told her, she also gave us 20% off the conversion kit because it was being ordered all at once. So we waited about a week and a half and our crib was there! (bc it was already ordered it didn't take as long as most orders) My husband and a friend went to pick it up and she was having a Veterans Day sale that weekend and our crib price dropped $100. So she felt sorry for us that we missed the sale and GAVE US A FREE CRIB MATTRESS AND TODDLER RAIL!!! I was blown away by her generosity. I had no idea that the crib price dropped so when she offered us all of that it really meant so much! The items she gave us retail way more than that $100 dollars. I am very impressed and plan on giving them more business in the future. THANKS POSH MOMMY ;)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886268e8fdc4fd2f:0x746533eb9aa4d4df"}

The owner is a very kind man who you can tell has been in the business for a very long time. When purchasing something that can cost as much as furniture does now, it is important to purchase from someone who will honor their word. Not only did they offer several ways for us to finance, but delivery quick being recently relocated to this remote area in Alabama and no family to help move furniture was extremely nice. The owner gave us real honest advice not based off purely an income percentage of what he would receive on each piece. Because we were buying a complete living room and bedroom package including a mattress it was a big purchase and he was willing to help with the more that we purchased. I recently have had several back surgeries and the mattress was the most important piece. He personally spent quite a while with us walking through explaining the purpose of each detail on each mattress and again we were first time home buyers so we didn't really know what we were doing with buying a mattress; never had anything besides hand-me-downs. All in all an incredible experience and would recommend anyone who desires longevity with their purchase of something this magnitude to not buy second hand stuff and purchase from Harvey's where they keep their promises!!!!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1578090754019, "text": "Thank you very much for the great review.Sorry so long with reply,systemjust sent to me.Thanks.

I should have picked them up on April 2nd. Since then, I have been told \"they will be on our next truck, call back Tuesday\" \"call back Friday\"  \"I called and verified that they would be in our warehouse the 16th\" I'm leaving my original post, so everyone can see the whole story behind trying to get 2 recliners from your store!\nI live in Sylacauga and went to our local Badcock store. I found the recliner that I had been searching for and asked if it was available in a different color. The sales lady rushed to answer \"No\" without checking their website or trying to verify her answer... I left there and went online, found the lady had lied and it WAS available in the color I wanted. So I drove to a neighboring city store and found a sales lady who was more than eager to help me... so I give the Sylacauga location a 1 Star rating, but the Alexander City location gets 5+ stars!

I completely paid it at the beginning of April 2021. From the time I fully purchased it in April to the end of May. No one had informed me of the status. I would call the store once every other week. When I called the facility they told me that the furniture was not showing delivery date. I showed concern that I have not received any possible delievery date and asked to speak to the store manager about finding another item with tbe same value that is available. Finally the store manager, (after I was concerned) said that it should be here the first week of June. I decided to not find a replacement since the manager seemed to be sure the furniture will be there. I called after the first week of June since I received no contacted in regards to delivery or any issues. Manager than proceeded to say it is now pushed to the first week of July. I received a call last week and the week prior telling me that my furniture was scheduled for first week of July. After first week of July passed, I called them Monday, July 12th, to be informed that it was again pushed to the week of July 26th. I asked the sales associate if I could get a full refund because their poor communication. And customer service makes me uneasy and I do not trust them that they will delivery my item. The manager was not there and the person said he will contact me on Wednesday when he returns. They told me that refund would not be possible because of the 72 hour no cancellation. I proceeded to call cooperate to file a complaint on their store and because it is privately owned they could not help me. They filed a complaint and said they will get in contact with me within 24-48 hours. After I received no response from cooperate and the store, I called cooperate again. During the process of calling cooperate on Friday, July 16th (less than four days since the last conversation with the store) I found out that the corner of my section is in the warehouse but that other pieces will be in august 26th. Again another time pushed and no response. Each time the dates have been undetermined or pushed further. There is no promise of a secure date. They are persistent on telling me cancellations are not possible due to the 72 hours after full purchase but yet this company does not hold themselves accountable to communication and delivery if their items. After long conversation, the sales associate on Friday, July 16th said the manager will issue a request for cancellation to the finance department and I will receive a paper check refund. I called today July 20th to ask about the status. The request was given to the finance department and now waiting for the finance department to contact me about my refund. The sales associate said that it will take up to 14 days. This is ridiculous. I understand that we are in Covid 19 times.

Please refer to Ashley Homestore\u2019s Facebook page to see my review in detail. The sales clerk ordered the wrong item. The delivery team did not honor their delivery time slot and did not have the decency to inform me in a timely manner that they were coming 2 hours early. They left the wrong dresser. I called Emmitt, the store manager, and requested for them to return to pick up the dresser, needless to say the dresser remained in my home for three weeks. I tried to contact the general manager, Nick on two occasions and, Emmitt was of no assistance and he never returned my phone calls either. After finally getting a scheduled pickup a week and a day later, the delivery team was an hour and 15 minutes late with once again no phone call or text. After posting my experience on their Facebook page, Nick called leaving a message with my phone number as the return contact. Also, someone from their management team left an email address that was not accurate. I say all this to say, my concerns have not been resolved and I did not receive the correct dresser that I paid for. Ashley Homestore will NOT admit their mistakes, correct their mistakes, nor treat their customers with respect. I spent right at $6000 and this is how they treat their customers.

Josh and I agreed on a (out the door) price that he stated would included free delivery and would include the best warranty that I could purchase. Once I got to the register to check out I was charged an additional 199.00 that was supposed to have been already applied to our agreed upon total. I didn't notice until after I left and looked over the receipt of this infraction. They told me that the set wasn't in stock and would take 3 weeks to be delivered. I offered several time to pick the set up myself but they insisted that I let them bring it out and set it up for free so I agreed. They told me that the set would come in a different dates and offered me split delivery. I told them I'd prefer if we just wait an get it all delivered at 1 time when it all arrived and they agreed. Fast forward to Thursday April 8th I called and was told that only 2 pieces were in but they were all scheduled to be there the week of the 8th. Friday the 9th I called bk and was told that the set was there. I asked when would it be delivered and was told that I had to come pick it up and that it wouldn't be delivered. Therefore I (rented) a haul and angrily went to to their store to pick it up. Once I got there I was told that it wasn't there and was at the warehouse which contradicted everything that I was told and wasn't where I originally paid for the set. At this point I was furious and Josh wasn't there so I was told. They then called him/Josh and he magically appeared from the back of the store smiling with mischief all over his face. Once he got close enough to see the anger in my eyes he detoured behind me and finally stood behind the counter accompanying the other 2 young ladies. He lied and tried to tell me that I wasn't given or offered free delivery but one of the assistants who also helped me select the set( she in particular was great and very helpful and even apologized) agreed that I was supposed to have free delivery. I then told him about the split delivery in which I knew nothing about until they offered and he dropped his head knowing that I was being honest. At this point I was furious but still needed my set. They then told me that it was at the warehouse and that the warehouse was closed. This is after they told me that it was at their location and I had to come pick it up. So now I'm standing there with a rented uhaul, being double charged for a warranty, furious and still not able to get my furniture. Long story short I still have to go pick it up again today. I would've canceled it all together but your charged a  25% restocking fee and can't return it over 3 days after the original purchase date. Josh continued to try and lie and say he told me this or that and I made him out to be a lie everytime. Josh is a lier so don't let those fb commercials fool you. My set was over 4k and paid upfront. Read over your receips as soon as you get it and make sure everything you agreed upon is stated and accurate. This is my personal experience, hopefully this will detour you from having a disastrous nightmare just as I did. Please shop else where. Hopefully everything goes smooth today once I go to pick it up.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1618330066688, "text": "Hello Mr. Gipson. Firstly, I would like to apologize for any miscommunications or any tribulations experienced with the Ashley Homestore Outlet. From my understanding of the matter, there were many miscommunications on the team's behalf. I am not sure why there was so much confusion with the Customer Service on this particular order, and this will be addressed to them. We are experiencing delays on orders due to covid, and though this is a common response for almost all things furniture nowadays, it is honestly the truth. Again, I would like to apologize for the lack of communication resulting in you prematurely renting a U-haul. Our Warehouse hours differ from the store hours, and this should have been addressed upfront ahead of time. I truly feel that if things had been communicated better, a lot of these issues would have been easily resolved, and that is our fault. On behalf of the company we hope you will accept our apology, and please feel free to discuss this matter further at cescalations@ahsmal.com, and a manager will respond.  With all this said, we want to thank you for shopping with us and appreciate you being a member of our community.

We were greeted by a salesman named Alex. He seemed to be a nice guy well versed and educated in product knowledge of everything they had to showcase and sell. We instructed him that we were just looking but we'd come back if we were interested in doing business. He and his manager promised exceptional customer service. We came back about a month later ready to purchase. We spent almost $7,000 with this salesman and company and was sold several empty promises. We were told that we'd have all of our furniture at the store ready to be delivered to our brand new home that we were building by the first week of December. That didn't happen. We were promised several different customer service calls concerning our furniture. They never happened. In December we were told for 3 weeks straight that our stuff was coming and it didn't come. Finally we got some of our things only to find out that as our stuff was coming off the truck that the delivery guys forgot the mounts to put our mirror up that goes to our dresser. Also that Alex ordered 2 loveseats instead of a sofa and loveseat. When I called to make him aware of his mistake I was told immediately that it was my fault as if I made up the invoice myself. I spoke with the manager Josh he apologized and put in a new invoice for a new sofa. He said that our recliner which we are still waiting on would be here the same time the sofa would, which would be Jan. 15th. I was told that if anything changed that I would receive a call. Guess what? That didn't happen either. After the delivery guys left I noticed that they messed up my front door casing in 2 different places. I called this Thursday to inform them of the damage and check to make sure everything was still on track and yet again I was given the run around by the employees and manager Josh as to when my stuff would arrive. Finally he said that yet again its been pushed back to the first week in February. He gave me Ashley's customer service email to send proof of damage and I was told I would receive a call or email concerning the damages as you might've guessed THAT! DIDN'T! HAPPEN!  Before ending our call he said he was going to give me a call the next day at 9:30 when he starts his customer service calls and you guessed it IT NEVER HAPPENED! Mind you we placed our entire order at one time in OCTOBER!!! We were told that there was a 6-8 week wait to receive our stuff which we were fine with because our home would be finished being built by then. It's now January and still were being given the run around. I have never experienced such unprofessionalism, deplorable customer service, and lies by a company who's standards are supposed to be way above par. I am livid and hate that I ever gave this company my business. They care nothing about their customers only about the quick buck that they can get. I wouldn't advise anyone to ever do business with this establishment. Your just another sale to them and they give you nothing but empty promises. If I could've given no stars I would have!

They are very unprofessional and unorganized. We bought basically a whole house worth of furniture, when it was time for delivery they informed us that our sectional was not in stock and that it\u2019ll be in stock in 2 weeks and that they\u2019ll deliver it out to us with no delivery fee but we could still get our bedroom suite that we ordered.\nIncident #1: On delivery day I had to call and ask what time would the furniture be in because we were out running errands. They forgot to put our furniture on the truck and the delivery people had to come back and get it\ud83d\ude44 (I\u2019m sure if I had not called I would not have known)\nIncident #2:Two weeks later, which was on yesterday (Sunday) at around 12pm I called and spoke with OJay and asked was our furniture in. She told me yes(why didn\u2019t they call?) and that they can deliver it out same day. Okay cool. She then called back and said that we didn\u2019t pay all of our delivery fee which in fact when they delivered our furniture the first time my boyfriend gave them the delivery free PLUS A TIP. She then told me that it was okay and that they would take care of it. Later that day, at 4pm, I called again just checking to see what time they would be coming. The guy I spoke with asked would I be okay with getting it delivered first thing Monday morning. Uhh no. (My problem with this was WHY DIDN\u2019T ANYBODY CALL, I would be okay if they had the common courtesy to inform me of any issues instead of me having to call them.) The guy told me my furniture should be at my house no later than 10:45AM(I didn\u2019t know how if they opened at 11am) I asked was he sure and he said yes.\nSO THIS MORNING MY FURNITURE WAS NOT AT MY HOUSE AT 10:45! I called promptly AT 11am and spoke w/ the manger Rodney and he informed me that a driver was on the way to get my furniture to deliver it. If my furniture was not able to be at my house at 10:45AM they should have communicated that with me. I received my furniture at 12pm after all the mess I had to go through. I appreciate it if you guys would be more professional with your customers and communicated more with your drivers. I should not have to go through this hassle of getting furniture delivered and I WILL NOT shop with you guys again.

DO NOT RECOMMEND.\n\nFull story: I shopped at American Freight on Black Friday 2017 with high expectations after reading these reviews. And the experience in the store was fine. No pressure to buy, but a helpful staff answering any questions my husband or I had. We bought a sectional and ottoman set we liked even though they weren't available for delivery for 2-3 weeks. We were fine with the delay and left looking forward to it arriving in a few weeks (more time to find homes for our old stuff).\n\nThat's when the trouble started. Fast forward 4 weeks, no sectional and no call/news at all. I call the store and was told that my purchase wasn't on the truck as expected, but they would be calling other stores to see of they had it and we should hear something the next week.\n\nLife was busy so I didn't check again for another 3 weeks. This time when I called I was told they didn't know why, but it was on back order. But it would for sure be in the next week. I again expressed by hope that it would arrive as I very much looked forward to using my furniture.\n\n2 weeks later, no furniture.  At this point, 2 months after purchasing the furniture and as my husband and I are both active duty military and didn't have the time to go to deal with it, my mother-in-law visited the store on a Friday. She made a bit of a scene stating the facts in front of other customers, and wouldn't you know it our sectional and ottoman arrived on rush order the following Monday. Corners were scuffed in some areas, and a few tears from packing staples, but at that point we were so glad to have the furniture  and tired of dealing with the company that we accepted it anyway. I will never shop there again  and highly recommend you don't either.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2bce410ad21f:0xb1653e3c3ad41741"}

However the great reviews must be only for furniture that they have in stock. The couch and love seat we really liked was not in stock and we were told it would be two weeks until our furniture would arrive This was 15th of July. It even said August 1st on the sales receipt.  Two weeks go by and we heard nothing. We called American Freight and we were told that they don't have a date that the truck will show up it will just show up one day. Three weeks out we had heard nothing and we're told it would take 2 to 4 weeks. At this point we would of asked for a refund and shopped somewhere else but their policy states you can get a refund after 4 weeks from purchase.  Now four weeks arrives still no furniture still no date a truck will arrive.  We call on Monday with all intentions to ask for a refund and were told there is a truck and the Manger will be in on Thursday for us to get a refund. Thursday comes no phone call from American Freight we call on Friday and we're told oh your couch is here. Alot of effort on our part to find the status on our order. So after 4 weeks and several days of a family of 5 sitting on the floor since we just moved to Montgomery we have our couch and love seat. When we picked them up we told them we were still in the market for furniture and we were told to come back and they will give us a good deal for being so patient  well why not give us a deal while we were there. We won't be back.\nGoing back to the day we purchased the furniture the couch and love seat we wanted they actually had in the back but it was already sold to a customer who was waiting for it to be delivered some sales people were telling our sales person to just give us that one but we would not do that to someone else. So it puts into question did our furniture arrive weeks ago and they sold it to someone else it's possible especially since they could never give us a date our furniture would arrive.\nWe do like the furniture but if you shop here and they don't have it in stock BEWARE you will never know when you will get it.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1471896687656, "text": "We do apologize for the inconvenience, Wes.

When it was delivered, the delivery guy Preston had noticed they sent the wrong chairs but I had noticed the box with the table looked as if it had fallen off of the truck or dropped from a distance. After bringing in the table, they left and came back with the correct chairs. After putting together the chairs, I opened the box containing the table and it had indeed been dropped. It was well after store hours at this point but I still called the delivery guy with my issues. The next morning at 11 sharp, I got a call from the owner. Like he has obviously done before, apologized for it and said that he's send another out by the end of the day. TWO DAYS later, the table finally arrived. They opened the box to make sure that nothing is busted up and I was very pleased with the way it was handled. I was so pleased that we decided to order two more chairs from them. We were told that it took 2 weeks for the chairs to arrive. It was November 27th and we needed them before Christmas. Before they ordered the chairs, we had to pay and that wasn't an issue for us. We paid the full balance of nearly $180 for two Madrid. counter height chairs. Two weeks go by and no chairs. I was told that the truck hasn't come in but I'll definitely have them before Christmas. December 22nd, I gave them another call and I was told that I could pick them up the next day. I was overjoyed to hear that. On the 23rd I got a call from the manager telling me to not come because they wasn't there and he didn't want me to ride there for nothing. He said that he was just have them delivered when they came in. The delivery guy Preston brought to our home at 6pm that night. He told me that they were in a different box because they opened it to make sure that they sent the right chairs because of what happened the first time. Trusting his words, i signed for it then took them upstairs myself. I placed them in a closet, grabbed my things and left home until Saturday night. Christmas morning I pulled out the box, opened it and removed all of its contents. I then took the box to the dumpster. When I returned, I settled myself down to begin assembling the chairs only to find that the chairs HAD ONCE BEEN ASSEMBLED. There were marks on the chairs, the screws were stripped and rusty. and the floor protectors were very worn. There were also four screws missing as well. There were hand smudges all over the wood. There was nothing about those chairs that said NEW. In complete disbelief that Rodney the store manager for charge me full price for two chairs off the showroom floor then have me wait nearly a month to receive them made me a bit irate. Without thinking, I called the store on Christmas morning. After realizing, I messaged the delivery asking for the cell number of the manager and I've yet to receive an response. So as a result, I feel it's very necessary to be waiting in the parking lot with two unassemble Madrid counter height chairs and several questions that gonna require an answer as well as a solution. Until this, I thought very highly of American Freight and its coworkers. Now it's BUYERS BEWARE... there's a reason they say that all sales are finals. For me, I don't want my money back because I do want the chairs. I just want what I paid for and I DID NOT pay for recycled chairs", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1483030131860, "text": "We're very sorry to hear this happened to you, Sylver.

Yes thats right he never showed us anything on sale nor did he bother to ask what our spending limit was so he know what to work with. Instead he just showed us around the store that highlighted\nThe furniture with the 699 and up prices.\nWe spotted a black leather sofa that had 398 price tag on it, sat on it to try it out, and as we began to show insterest in it and began discussing to each other about maybe we should get this or not. Thats when the salesman kinda brushed us away from the actual sofa set that we were sitting on that was 398 and started reverting us back toward that 699 plus tax sofa set. Smh thats not the sofa set we wanted or was discussing.we felt that the salesman wasnt offering us what we wanted but yet offer us what he wanted us to buy.....and we are the customers...its our money not his....we felt like our wants were disreguarded so we decided to check another store, told the guy we were gonna check somewhere else also before we decide. Asked him for a bussiness card and of course he didnt want to give us one and by him doing so gave us even more reason to be absolutely sure that we dont want to shop there now.\nSo as we started to walk out the door the guy then decided to offer us a deal on a sofa set\n...A BETTER PRICE is what he said so im like oh ok he wants to work a deal on the actual leather sofa we were sitting on with the 398 price tax. So im like ok turn around and ask what are you offering...he reply...600 right now walk out..we refused and left and went somewhere else because once agin the guy was still attempting to sale us what he wanted us to buy rather than what we the customer wanted to spend our money on...", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1462553897247, "text": "Hi Byrdie, I am so sorry to hear that you had this experience.

No considerations nor accommodations were made for me regarding my time or gas even though this order was paid in full and this was a mistake he made. As of yesterday, he still could not give me an update on the status of my living room furniture. I finally spoke with the manager who was unaware of this situation and told me that my complaint was one of many and that Marcus had been demoted.

The pricetag was certainly lower than anywhere else we looked, and it looked like OK quality furniture.\nLess than 3 weeks after purchase, the sofa literally fell apart. We're pretty normal sized people and have treated it with care. I turned it over and opened up the upholstery to have a look.  The construction quality is the worst I've ever seen; low grade partical board, half-rotted knotty 1/2\" thick pine, and the whole thing is held together with staples.  I identified 6 separate joints that had come apart inside the couch due to the staples simply slipping out of the wood, and many more that were halfway undone.\nI ended up taking around 3 or 4 hours and meticulously replacing pieces, reinforcing joints with metal brackets and screws, and closing up places in the upholstery which were mysteriously split and leaking stuffing.\n\nThe furniture here is truly of the lowest quality, even if it appears fine on the surface.  If you buy from here, make sure you also purchase their ridiculously expensive warranty (that will tack on $100 - $200 to your purchase), because you're gonna be needing it a whole lot.  If you need cheap furniture, go to the thrift store or use Facebook marketplace.

The middle cushion does not even get used at all and it was the first one to split and fray. See photo for what your couch will look like if you buy it from American Freight.\n\nWe took the cushions into the store thinking they would honor a 1 year warranty.  Unfortunately because the couch was a floor model it was an \u201cas-is\u201dpurchase  and we were out of luck.  American Freight said that there was nothing that they could do.\n\nHere is a warning for you.  If you decide to purchase a floor model, do not be surprised if it does not last one year.  You are buying disposable furniture.  Lesson learned.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJKeG4z2Vt-lSxbX0YnA_rRnXCk9vYlxNWIWYW=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888926e71f395913:0xac5904c3b32b67d7"}

I called 2 days before and they told me to call on Saturday when I wanted to pick up.   So I call on Saturday morning when they opened telling them  I wanted to pick up and 1pm.  They told me to call 30minutes before I came so they could spray it.    Got there and the couch they had ready for me was not even the correct couch.  On top of that it had not been sprayed with the fabric protection.  No one there really knew what was going on or who had done what with the couch.

That is a LOT of money for a box to be dropped off regardless of the location.

Thanks\n\nPlease Be Aware Of This Business\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 SHARE\n\nI purchased a brand new $800 lift chair recliner from this place. I bought it on a Saturday evening and contacted them on Monday to let them know something was wrong with the chair. They would not let me return it. It was under warranty so I had them send some one out to look at it. The guy came week 2. Agreed the whole time that something was wrong with my chair but he wasn\u2019t sure how to fix it. He sent the report to Sabrina\u2019s Furniture Store week 3 and she said nothing was wrong with it. I hung up and called the manufacturer in Mississippi they said the brake for the footrest was not working. Therefore my footrest slowly goes down while sitting in it. They sent me a new motor for it. I contacted Sabrina back and she was gonna send someone out to put it on. So I\u2019ve waited all week and nobody has showed up or called. I contacted Sabrina to find out why nobody has showed up to fix it and she said the system is kicking out the maintenance order. I told her I was tired of waiting because my feet were staying swollen from not staying elevated. I also told her I would bring the chair back tomorrow and swap it out for a new one. She said they were all out of stock. So I said I would bring it back and get my money back. She agreed to it but then wanted to charge me a $200 restocking fee. Mind you this is a brand new $800 chair that has been tore up since I purchased it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862ccc4d6074139:0x7da1f1f052cd206a"}
