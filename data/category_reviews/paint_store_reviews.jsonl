My shipment is a pallet of 33 boxes of porcelain tile., plus 7 additional boxes they put on the same pallet. The right side of the pallet was coming apart due to the immense weight of the tile . The driver could not move the pallet down the truck. He was not going to be able to pull it up the small slope on my driveway. What on earth were they even thinking?They needed a fork lift. I called Home Depot and they got the Transport company on the line while I was on hold. I ended up being told the transport company needed to take care of this and they would contact me in 24 to 48 hours. Which they never did. I had to call them. On 3/5 Friday I called central transport and they told me the shipment would be delivered on Monday between 11 and 12. They never showed. I checked the shipment tracking and found that they changed it to Tuesday 3/9! I got no call, text, or phone call.So Tuesday 3/9 I message them to find out eta. They said the drivers hadn't left yet and to keep checking they will update me. That never happened.

First, the people who are selling the appliances do not know much about them. I was told that for installation of my microwave, I needed an outlet in the wall that it was being installed on. Great. I'm good. WRONG!!! The outlet had to be above the microwave.... Something that would have been nice to know, but they could not communicate that properly.\nThen, the delivery/installation people had no idea what they were doing. They were more of a delivery company, not an installation professional. They could not install my gas range. They damaged my microwave. So, really, they weren't even a good delivery company. Home Depot just subs out delivery to the cheapest company....and you can see the quality when your damaged items arrive!\nAnd I pray for you if you have ANY problems with your delivery or installation!!!\nCount on a couple of things: 1) You will spend hours on the phone getting to talk to the right person. Once you think that you have the right person, they will tell you they have to check on something and they will have to call you back. OR, the right person is \"on lunch\" and they will call you back. After giving them ample time for \"lunch\" (3 hours) when you call them back, you will be told that they were \"off today\" but they will return your call in the morning.\nBasically, it's a game of ping-pong and it takes days to get simple questions answered because, obviously, no one who works there wants to actually do anything.\nI can't believe I dropped over $7K in there and they can't even answer a simple question!!!!\nBuyer beware!!!

Christina not only told me the associate selling me the paint in January sold me the wrong kind but then proceeded to argue with me and not give credit on the exchange. I\u2019m told leaking cans happen (of which the other associate offered) but this apparently very unhappy (never smiled, devoid of social skills) person, Christina, would not credit a longtime customer for a faulty can of paint.
