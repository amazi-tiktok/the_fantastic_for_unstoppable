While we do receive a shipping discount, I can assure you that we pay well more for shipping than what we charge our customers. We lose shipping $$ on every single order we ship out. We do offer samples so our customers can be sure they're happy with a product prior to purchasing yardage so we do everything in our power to make sure you're satisfied before you have to deal with the hassle of a return. We're in the fabric business, not the shipping business and unfortunately we have no control over shipping charges (we wish we did!!). We consume the majority of all shipping costs on the front end when an order is placed. We simply can't afford to cover the shipping for returns on top of that (because remember, we offer samples). I'm very sorry you find this not good business but we would go out of business if we lost on shipping both ways as well paid our employees for fulfilling the original order and then again for restocking the return that we have less than zero profit in at that point. We are a very honest, veteran and family owned business just trying to stay alive among the big boy chain stores. We are real people here and it actually hurts our feelings and our pride when someone posts negatively about us over things we have nothing at all to do with - like shipping costs that we already lost money on ourselves. I feel that your true issue is the amount that FedEx wanted to charge you for return shipping (and we agree that shipping is outrageous these days, we feel your pain!). So this review is for FedEx shipping charges, not because we have a bad product. I'm sure you didn't mean it to be, but this review is very unfair to us.

We stand behind our products and immediately correct any errors. The order this lady is referring to was placed in April 2015, over 2.5 years ago. She called demanding a credit we had no record of. We asked her how much the credit amount was supposed to be and she didn't know. We needed to research the issue but she wanted to use the credit to place an order that very day so she refused to give us any time to investigate and obviously decided she'd rather bash our honest company instead. She placed 4 other orders with us after the date of the order in question and never once mentioned us owing her a credit during any of those times. We're not sure if she just needed fabric and was out of money or what -- because she didn't allow us to research further. We do everything we can to make our customers happy and had she given us a real chance, we're sure we could have made her happy as well. Also as our customers know, we do not have a 30 day time limit on credits. If we issue a credit, it is available until you redeem it. This lady's story is so off and very misleading so please take a moment to read our many positive reviews about our customer service rather than believing this one. If you click on her profile you'll see for yourself that every review she has written about any company has been negative. Not a single positive review to date. She apparently doesn't have anything good to say about anyone. Very sad. She placed several orders with us that she obviously couldn't complain about so she wrote nothing at all. People who post only negative reviews shouldn't be allowed to ruin an honest company's good name. It's a shame she didn't give us the opportunity to help her.
