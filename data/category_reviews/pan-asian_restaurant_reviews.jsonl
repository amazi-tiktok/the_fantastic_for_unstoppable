It was failure after failure, and I have never before been subjected to such poor customer service.  That\u2019s the short version.\n\nThis is the full story. I ordered (and paid for) delivery from Asian Rim through Yelp Eat24 and, after waiting an hour and a half without getting any food or as much as a phone call, I called the restaurant directly to ask when I could expect my meal. I was informed by Colton that there was no order because they don\u2019t associate with Yelp Eat24 at all. Understandably, this freaked me out and lead me to believe I had been scammed. I then called Yelp Eat24 and demanded a refund after telling them what Colton had said. While they did quickly offer a me a refund (which \u2013side note-- I won\u2019t be getting for \u201cup to 5 business days\u201d), they were adamant that they did in fact work with Asian Rim and that their restaurant had actually already confirmed the order before I had called. I was still falsely placing my faith in Asian Rim at this time.\n\nAfter hanging up with Yelp Eat24, I hurriedly called my bank to inform them that I might have falsely been charged. All of this was quite time consuming and anxiety inducing. On a whim, I decided to call Asian Rim back again and relay to them the information I had been given by the representative at Yelp Eat24 for their own benefit. That\u2019s when Colton then informed me that they did actually work with Yelp Eat24 after all. He just hadn\u2019t known a third party, Backdoor, was also involved and it was their name coming up in his system. He unapologetically told me the food I had originally ordered would be at my house shortly.\n\nBut was it? No. So after even more time elapsed, I called Asian Rim a third time to ask what was going on. I was told by a different person that I should \u201cjust try calling Backdoor.\u201d I had to flat out demand to be told if the food had at least left Asian Rim yet. She finally said \u201cyeah.\u201d No apologies were given and I was rushed off the phone.\n\nThen I called Backdoor and was told that they did pick up the food from Asian Rim, but then realized the order had been cancelled. Aside from the refund Yelp Eat24 says they will give me, no other amends have even been attempted to be made. To reiterate-- his whole ordeal lasted about 3 hours from the time I placed and paid for the order to the time I was definitively told that there was no food coming. To say this place, and Colton specifically, handled this poorly is an understatement. I adamantly advise everyone reading this to refrain from ordering from Asian Rim.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889179da3445e5b:0x39c8686e22b7dc4c"}
