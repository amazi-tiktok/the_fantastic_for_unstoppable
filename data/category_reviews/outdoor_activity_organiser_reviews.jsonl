I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll go back just because there is so much else to do, but the scenery really was beautiful. Saw turtles, rock croppings and beautiful trees. Some parts of the area were really littered with cans and bottles, which is very unfortunate, but there was a lot of alcohol consumed by other parties around us the day we went and I guess the trash is a result of lots of that.\n\nTube rental is $10 per tube and $5 per cooler tube. They take you to the river in the back of a pickup truck. You float the river and then end right by where you started by just walking up the hill to your car.\n\nOne bit of advice that we didn\u2019t know before we went the first time is that it is really good to bring your own raft that you can sit on or in. We saw people with small raft type boats and others with floats that you sit in with a protected bottom to them. (I think they come here quite a bit and have the trip down to a science.) Make sure any float you bring is thick and won\u2019t puncture easily by the rocks \u2014 like a ski float or something. You need something that will protect your body from the rocks on the rapids. The rapids would be a whole lot more fun if you didn\u2019t have to worry about rocks getting you from the bottom. We\u2019ve all gotten some skinned knees and bruises from the rocks. (We rented the tubes they had at the place.). If you don\u2019t have a float you can bring, lift your body all the way up in your inner tube as you go down the rapids to try to stay off of the rocks.\n\nThe tube rental area is a campy place with no real place to picnic. They do have a small bathroom, but it was about to overflow while we were there, so we didn\u2019t use it. They also have a hose by the bathrooms that you can use to clean the sand out of your shoes which is very helpful.\n\nA few random thoughts ...\n\nThe first beach is the best. Eat here if you plan to have lunch. The second beach had lots of glass and bugs on it. The last area doesn\u2019t really have a place to eat on it.\n\nYou HAVE TO HAVE WATER SHOES of some kind. Chacos, Tevas, water shoes. Your feet will get cut on rocks and glass on the beaches if you do not.\n\nAnother thought... the rapids can be tough on people that are somewhat fragile. I would recommend that people who are fragile or young be in a boat and not on a tube. The rapids can be just too rough on them.\n\nBring a trash bag for your cans. You\u2019ll need it. Maybe you can help clean up too by picking up a few of the trash items that you see. (Overall, I expected it to be more trashy with some of the comments that I had read on here, but it wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought.)\n\nThis may be one of your favorite places to visit and you come back a lot. Or it may be something you do and say you\u2019ve done it and don\u2019t ever come back. Try it at least once.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888d343975bab87:0xb4cdc1a89670d031"}
