The business model of this place does not cater to customers at all. Their philosophy is to hold items on the slim chance that they appreciate in value to sell online, and the items that decrease in value they hope to sell at MSRP for those who don't realize they could get it for cheaper elsewhere.\n\nEverything in store is MSRP, no discounts.That would make sense if they were selling fresh, just released product, but the store is filled with nothing but old product that can be found for half the price elsewhere. They used to provide a discount when you paid entirely in cash but that seems to have disappeared.\n\nI have no problem paying more to support a store that allows us table space and a nice atmosphere to play, but this store has neither. All table space is catered specifically for miniature wargames (which are better for standing at rather than sitting down) and the one lone table in the back is always filled with a MtG game, leaving no room for anything else.\n\nThe employees have little to no knowledge of anything outside of MtG and consistently complain (under their breath and behind our backs) about the lack of purchases customers make if they just come in to play a game or two, which makes sense considering their greedy practice. Even after bringing in new customers that would've never thought to bring in, as well as setting up events ourselves that the store didn't bother helping with, we as customers are still considered a burden. Their demo shelf is also filled with games they don't carry or are out-of-print, so if you try a game out that you like, you won't even be able to purchase it, nor a copy of it, in the store.\n\nTournaments and events are horribly disorganized. I payed and 'participated' in a Keyforge league and paid to play a couple of games per week, but as it got near the end it turns out that missing a match never mattered and the final tournament with a promised prize support (hence the initial payment) never showed up. The new matchups were ALWAYS late and overall it was a lackluster experience that I could've just played with friends for a better time.\n\nThat's not to say it's been all bad, one employee named Josh was always super helpful and friendly, making space for us and always letting us borrow any of his supplies (like brushes and paints) to help out with beginning miniatures, but he left a while back and haven't seen him since. He was the last saving grace that the store was hanging on and now it's not worth any of my time nor money to bother going.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891087e54e0fdf:0xa7fa043f5f99189c"}

Not only were the staff uninformed of dietary differentiations, but I was told but the server the cook said that \"eggs werent vegetarian\" after I ordered and asked if the buscuits contained lard or other animal fat. I'm already irritated at this point and then she informs me that the buscuits also are not vegetarian safe because they contain eggs! When I asked to speak to the manager (thinking surely she would be more informed on the subject) the server was sent back with a chart of common allergens! I had enough at that point and asked to speak with the store manager concerning my allergies and dietary needs. The manager never arrived. After several minutes we decided to just eat elsewhere.

I gave 4 stars because its always cold and there's a long wait time. However, the service was great, the food was hot, good portions. I don't like their gravy at all-- it's too thick and flourery. Their biscuits and corn bread are  pretty good on the other hand. I totally love their hashbrown casserole (just wish it was a bigger portion. ) my kid always orders the pork chop big country boy breakfast and I always get the pecan pancakes with my main meal.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvoxCn7VVFz4jtU2qvI88WrIguRDnkzZl1kbDG=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNp6iCAS9gU-Jzzgk9bh155GJYSzNS-rUmYOXir=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d49f012494101:0xffd3dd88099cdcba"}

Food was great as always. We have visited thos Cracker Barrel several times and we have never had bad service until tonight. This low rating has nothing to do with the restaurant. It is clean, friendly staff and great food as always, serves breakfast all day too. Waitress gets 3 stars and that's being gracious.

Sorry but all wow is all i can say about this cracker barrel experience.  It started with the hostess, we checked in and was told about a 30 min wait because we had a party of 6.  When i checked back with them 30 mins later i saw our name had a table number 157 attached to our name and was told by the hostess that they were waiting on another table and it would another 10 mins.  After that 10 mins was up, i checked back in with the hostess and noticed the number changed to 214 and the hostess mentioned another 10 mins as they are still waiting for a table to open up.  In the mean time, 10 sets of 2 and 2 sets of 3 were seated while my party waited for this mysterious table to open up.\n\nSecondly, if you have three cash registers open and only one seems to be working on cashing out customers, something is wrong.

Ham is cured with salt and does not need to be sprinkled with more salt when you prepare it for the dish. The smoked sausage had a funny taste and was overly dry, I handed that one over to my boyfriend. Their gravy had a very peculiar sweetness to it, which threw me for a loop.\nThe pancakes were the saving grace though and the sole reason for giving 3 stars. Delicious!

I have shopped at this location for over 8 years, bought countless feeders for my family. Last weekend I was told they had a Fathers Day sale of 20% off on the squirrel proof feeders. I looked online before I made a trip to the store and it said they were sold out. I was sad but decided to give them a call on Monday to see when they would get more in and if they would still honor the discount. I called and the owner answered which was perfect! I told him and he then tells me that the online store is not correct and they had plenty of the feeders...I then asked if i could come by and pick it up. He said \"yes you can come by but it has to be today for me to honor the discount\" He then asked me if he could pull up my rewards account. I gave him my information...he then proceeds to tell me that he looked up my account and saw that I have not purchased any bird seed from his location only the feeders. I told him that is correct as I was not going to lie. He asked me where I got the seed at and I told him it was significantly cheaper at Walmart. He then says that he wont be able to honor the discount anymore since I do not get my bird seed here....I was a bit confused as his attitude totally changed when he found out I did not buy the bird seed from him. He then tells me that he thinks it best that I go to Walmart to purchase the feeder as well....from a store that is independently owned this is horrible business. These feeders are over $100 and he got upset because I did not get the actual bird seed from his location but purchased over $1000 in feeders. You have lost a customer. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because all of my feeders I have purchased have been wonderful, it is the service that you provide that has shown me I will not be returning.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a38ae08021:0xfcb0c7ecb986d6db"}
