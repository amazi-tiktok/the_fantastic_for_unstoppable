Employees recognized it and were quick to grab you a towel and in some cases even dry the car by hand for me as a sign of excellence service .  At the time it was managed by a very nice and professional young lady.  The place was also packed with cars which is a great sign for business .  Out of know were if you asked for a towel to dry the water there dryer missed after spending 18.00 dollars they wanted an extra 5 dollars to simply use a used towel. Not to purchase towel to keep but 5 bucks just to use the towel.  I never came back except one time to wash my company truck in a pinch.    I then noticed they had a towel program you pay monthly and the place clearly had lost a ton of business as its usually not very busy.  So sad an arrogant greedy cheap owner didnt learn the basics of running a business in business school.   1 year later today I took my personal truck that I was going to dry myself at home the same truck that had been through the wash many times before they turned my truck away after paying them.   They informed me they know longer except trucks with oversize aftermarket tires which over 30 percent of trucks these days have .  No other car wash has that policy .  Either tire fits on the track or it doesnt .  Reason for decision was having to replace rollers more often than without trucks with 34 inch tires or bigger going through the wash .  So being a cheap wad which is very common in his culture is resulting in lost business.  Clearly a hard headed person .\n\nA simple paper hand written sign could have been posted but instead I waited 5 minutes for them to refund my money then had to drive through vacuums at a sharp angle which almost resulted in my truck hitting there pole.  Not one person tried to guide me or be on the lookout for what I couldn't see. It's now  Ran by a bunch of high school kids who can give zero ducks about customer service .   I now use Anthony in Pelham but was making exception today as I was in a pinch.   Best wash is mister car wash on 280 but I dont leave on that side of town.  A car wash banning big trucks in Shelby county ?  Wow what an idiot .", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888926e612dfb13f:0xf8814bd473a80282"}

I made the appointment and wednesday was there at 8:30am as scheduled. No one was there. At approximately 9 am employees showed up and took my car. Inwas told that the credit card scanner wasn\u2019t working so I would need to bring cash.\n\nAt 430 i called and was advised my car was done. When i got there I spoke with the man cleaning the exterior of my car. I asked if they cleaned the trunk jambs as I noticed a large deposit of mud when i got groceried the other day. He said yes. I then waited about 10 minutes for my car. I watched the man open the trunk and then wipe the trunk jambs...?\n\nIt was an overcast day and the car looked good... until I got home. My chrome exhaust was still black (i rubbed with my finger and it comes off), the fuel tank door was dirty (once again my finger lifted the dirt there), large spots on the chrome grill looked untouched, large spots on the lower door panels were untouched, smears on the windshield,and spots on the rims were untouched. I paid and their CC machine did work... amazing.\n\nI have pictures and videos of all things I mentioned.\n\nI was going to just leave it alone but knowing I paid $200 for a half a$$ job didn\u2019t sit well with me.\n\nI have to say the interior was GREAT! A little excessive with the oils but you can tell they took their time and got everything looking sharp!\n\nOn Friday i called and got Brittney on the phone again. I asked for a manager and she said she would relay a message for me. I told her I\u2019m calling to complain about the detail I got... she asked for details and i told her everything. She called back a few hours later and advised that the owner/manager said i can bring the car back. I advised that i didnt have all day to leave my car to be washed and waxed again. (I highly doubt it was even waxed as there was so many spots that were unwashed... the wax would have stuck to it). I told her honestly the interior looked great and id be ok with paying for that service but need to be reimbursed for the remainder. She basically told me that wasnt an option and that thisnis how the manager handled things. He doesnt talk to customers and just has her. I explained that im offering to pay for the work that was done correctly... most customers would just want a total refund. However, if she cant authorize that and the manager wont even talk to me to settle the issue, ill just have my CC company cancel the payment.\n\nI feel sad for Brittney as im sure she is put in this situation often.\n\nMy advice, stay away.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88621257eb4fc911:0x30d2bc60e10a06b4"}

My dash and console was all spotty, and covered in a mix of dust and cleaning spray. They did not open my hatch and vacuum the back. The front was vacuumed but not well. There was a tone of very fine loose dirt  on my from floor mats. It looked like it came from the inside of the shopvac they used to vacuum the car. I can't believe they use a shopvac for this. I have leather seats, and they did not so much as wipe them down. My back seat had dirt in it from where I had sat a pair of boots. It's still there. There are little spots all over the outside of my car. I suspect that is from the spray wax they put on. I'm not sure.\n\nThe worst part is, my car has an odor now. It smells like body odor.

I dropped the car off in the morning after making an appointment online. I asked the guy on duty about what time the car would be done. He said \"about 1pm\". I was cool with that. So I left and went to run errands. Around 1:30pm I called the place to find out the status. The woman who answered the phone put me on hold for over 5 min so I hung up and drove to the place to see how things were going. When I got there there was an older woman complaining about a previous job they did to her car. I just remember her saying \"someone owes me 10 bucks to fix this\". Anyway, one worker sees me and says \"would you like to see your car?\" I said yes and followed him into the garage. The car STILL had the dark brown stains on the carpets! Before I can point it out he says \"I couldn't get it out. You should try dying the carpet.\" I was upset because the car also looked like they didn't vacuum well... if at all! Then there were dirt spots on my back window. The door jams were STILL dirty! The tires were dirty and the front bumper!  I ran my finger on both and lifted black dirt from those areas! They uses the wrong cleaning material on my middle console that caused paint to come off. I was very upset and dissatisfied snice I left it there for almost 6 hours already! I asked to speak with the manager. I told him this was no where near a good job for that price. After some deliberation, he agreed to knock off 25.00. This was a bit of a relief, but honestly, that was a 50.00 job (at best). THEN... about 2 hours later, that woman calls me back and says \"your car is ready for pickup\". I told her I already picked it up. She said \"oh I guess I called the wrong person\". I'm so annoyed with this place! They are so unorganized.

WE stayed there to see if maybe he would try to help but instead ate his lunch in front of us.....i believe this place cons you for your money..DO NOT GO!!!

After calling and no one answering for weeks looking for someone to detail both my husbands and my car, we were greated with a gentleman signing \u201cmelllvvvinns\u201d on the phone. That has me immediately happy. He told us to be there by 10:30 this morning. We got there and they were busy but took both our cars, we traded them out, when one was done we brought the other one back. They had my husbands filthy car cleaned in 3 hours and had it looking shiny and brand new. I was shocked for them to get out all the years of stains and grime! I then gave them my car and was also pleased with the work. It was shiny as well and sparkling clean. The prices are truly AMAZING! If I was Melvin, I would UP those prices because it\u2019s almost a steal for all the beautiful work they do. Mr. Melvin I learned is a Pastor and drives some miles to preach on Sunday mornings, he seems so happy and kind! I was very impressed, actually overly impressed with the work and the time it took.
