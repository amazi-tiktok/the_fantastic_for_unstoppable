There was a good flow and good themes to the clues. I did have a couple of issues though.  The first issue I had was that the game host was overseeing multiple games at once so when requesting clues there was a bit of a delay and sometimes we had to request twice.  Secondly, the previous game had not been fully cleaned as a dry erase board found towards the end of the game still had answers on it from the previous group. We confirmed with the game master it was in error and erased it ourselves to keep the spirit of the game but it was a bit unfortunate.

Usually I am not a fan of funnel cakes, but I enjoyed the one I had. They need to take the tickets out and you just get the stamp. Would you rather pay $200 to get on rides, or pay $20 to get on all the rides, forever. The answer presents itself. It's a great place to take your kids, and you'll probably enjoy it yourself, too.

We had nothing but rave reviews with The Captured. Kendalyn is correct, the rooms were small and cramped. There were only a total of approx 10 puzzles to figure out in the entire experience of The Insane Asylum at Xit. The walls of the rooms don't extend to the ceiling so you don't even really feel like you are in a room. FOR SURE there is no spooky element. The puzzles were abstract and did not flow. There may be people who would enjoy this kind of thing but our group of 10 did not. Honestly, I would suggest trying your luck at one of the other escape rooms offered in Gulf Shores as they are at least less expensive though I can not say if they are great or not since we have not tried those yet. Furthermore, after my 14 yr old daughter left her honest opinion while remaining polite, the owner James messaged her privately on FB and asked her to remove her review and told her he could sue her. He also privately messaged me and asked me to tell her to take it down. VERY unprofessional.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0540f02d1cc7:0xf4ca0af1a923ea1b"}

The young ladies were very friendly, knowledgeable and accomadating.\nWe chose to do the Doll Room. We walked in and was very impressed of the set up. They told us we first had to find 6 keys. So we hit the ground running. While we were searching for keys my husband was going through the dresser drawers pulling clues out. We found the 6 keys and quickly became confused as to where the locks were. We checked all the locked chests but they were all combo locks. After a few minutes we noticed the drawers my husband had been going through were supposed to be locked with the key locks. So someone forgot to prep the room properly. The next frustrating thing is it was dark and only a red light on in there, which is fine with the flashlights they have in the drawers, but 2 of the 3 flashlights were dying and were barely usable. And with the letters rubbing off the combo locks it made it hard to see them even with the little lights. We did need help with a clue, called through the walkie talkie....there was soo much noise outside our room I don't think the staff heard us. So I had to wait a few minutes before trying again. We finally made it to the last task and we struggled and never made it out in time. When we asked the girl how we were supposed to do it, it didn't make sense. She showed us these lines/arrows and how we're supposed to line them up, however, the lines on one of the cards does not line up at all. It is drawn on wrong. When we pointed it out, she just said \"well, it's supposed to\". Had they actually lined up maybe we might have made it out, who knows. But when I'm paying $26 a person to do this room, the clues should be legit and not half assed.

The first experience resulted in us being booked over due to being told the wrong information on the phone (1140 at night).  We were booked for the following night at 930 and told to pay for 3 but wed be blocked out for 10.  When we showed up tonight, same story.  We tried to stand our ground and get our slot (again even the employees recognized their mistake) and eventually the owner was called.\n\nI was handed the phone and politely introduced myself and tried to explain our two night issue and was told \"shush im gonna explain this to you\".  (Worth noting this was Brad Egly not the other owner whom I had a great conversation with)  He continued to \"explain\" all his company policies I didn't follow regarding booking procedures as if I was his employee. (He was yelling, people across the room could hear him and he wasn't on speaker)  I waited my turn and asked what I did wrong trusting his employee was telling me accurate statements to which he got even more upset with me.  I put their phone down at this point and bounced around a little full of adrenaline and I apologize if the tenseness I felt translated to a raised voice with the employees not hiding behind a phone.  (Those employees were great btw, no idea how they can work for him.  Seriously, put in for an HR or counselor position with any other company and under experience just write his name, I'll vouch.)\n\nAnyway, those employees did what they could but the owner topped things off with saying no refund.  So Brad can deal with my bank and hopefully this review will keep you from having to deal with Brad.\n\nQuick Edit: Brad earned the 1 star, the experience was lame but wouldn't be worth sharing.\n\nResponse to the owner: We were told we had the room at that time by your employee.  She booked it and we paid for our family with the understanding we could pay for the rest later (once again Im not your employee and not required to know your internal policies).  Maybe you should take responsibility for the fact that YOU (Brad) deleted our reservation without asking a simple question of where the other payments were.  You need to amend your system to require payment before booking or provide pop up warnings to prompt your staff on your policies.  Most of all, don't yell at a paying customer.

I am absolutely appalled at the staffing of this establishment. My son and his friend (both 10) were physically assaulted by a group of teenagers (15). Now I know, kids can be wild but I had several adults that I didnt know run to find me when this happened. My older nephew attempted to intervene as these children were stomping on my sons stomach and forcibly holding him under the ball pit. I was informed by multiple adult witnesses who confirmed this was in fact what was happening. When my nephew tried to tell the boys to leave my 10 year old son alone the boys ADULT father bowed up on my nephew making threats yelling in his face. My nephew is also A CHILD. There were ZERO staff members to be found and when I was finally able to talk to a manager (Tiffany) I was disrespected and cut off mid sentence. She refused to hear my concerns. I was completely rational and calm as I was just trying to speak with someone in charge and have the cameras viewed so I could find out what actions should be taken. When asked to speak to someone above her she refused to give me any name or contact info and WALKED AWAY mid sentence. We have always enjoyed bringing our children here, but if I am paying for a party that large with that many children I would expect my guests to be SAFE. I would love to speak with someone above the managers on staff due to the absolute lack of professionalism they displayed. It is not my intention to be tacky or tasteless but I am shocked at how children being visibly injured was met by \"management\". This establishment should be well staffed for the level of children it sees on a nightly basis and all of the children should feel and BE safe. Staff members do not supervise in any way, like other trampoline parks do. spending close to 500$ for a 2 hour party, my child and his friend were jumped on kicked and bullied by 5 teenage boys and the manager (Tiffany) didn't even offer an apology or ask the children if they were okay.. nothing. My experience was awful. Tiffany would not hear my concerns, would not review the cameras and let me know the severity of the situation. Due to this, 5 kids left my sons party and I was left feeling a HUGE lack of customer service. The chosen manager of this establishment should put children first, listen to the concerns of paying patrons and have solutions. She was the most disrespectful manager I have ever met. I had my  son and his friend upset right in front of her and she barely looked at them, didn't ask if they were okay. She walked away.\n\nafter reaching out to an owner, I was not offered any resolution or an offer of looking at the camera. Simply \"I'll speak to tiffany about this\" and s\"orry this happened\". finally got the apology that should have happened days before but too little too late. what resolution would you expect if this happened at a party you were hosting and it was your children being hurt?\n\ngreat leadership comes from the top. get it together. while I know these specific incidents are isolated, you should know how to handle these situations and so should your staff. view  the cameras, even if the patron cannot. have a resolution.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890db69088959d:0x4332f45319ad0a5e"}

Please do not enter the building while anyone is in the air!!!!!\n\nPLEASE DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS RIDE ANY OF THE AIR ATTRACTIONS HERE WITHOUT BEING ADVISED THAT AN AIR ROPES COURSE RIDER WHO APPEARED TO BE STILL STRAPPED IN THE HARNESS FELL SEVERAL FEET JUST LAST FRIDAY 3/29/19, AND THE COMMUNITY IS NOT AWARE OF THIS.  Don't let it be your kid please!  PEOPLE SITTING DOWN ON THE GROUND BELOW WERE ALSO HARMED!!!!\n\nThis is important!! I'll repeat it.  If you plan to go and play it safe by not riding in the air, then this review is still for you and all of your family  because PEOPLE SITTING DOWN ON THE GROUND BELOW WERE ALSO HARMED!!!!\n\nPlease read on or call to try to find out for yourself before you go.  I don't want it to happen again to anyone!!  I've tried many times for a week now, but I can't reach any local or corporate officials with Urban Air to explain or calm our fears.  Who checks on these things?  Who answers to every parent that takes their kids to Urban Air?\nIt's Friday again and I'm trying not to scream at the thought that Urban Air Trampoline and Adventure Park in Trussville is still open (as far as I know) and still not answering any real questions about last Friday's horrific experience.   This wasn't your average bounce on the trampoline and break an ankle thing. This was a HORRIBLE NIGHTMARE that really happened to innocent people.   Urban Air, what's preventing it from happening again?\n\nHow do you drop a person from the sky?  Why did you drop her on top of a mom who was simply sitting on a bench below? It Was Horrible!!! There is so much more to say, but graphic details are not appropriate or important here.\n\nI don't know if the other visitors there on Friday are just still too shaken up to talk about it.  Or just so relieved like us that their kid didn't fall.  Or maybe like me they hate to write online reviews (especially bad ones).  Well I would give Urban Air Trampoline Adventure Park in Trussville, Alabama negative 5 stars if I could, but I can't, so 1 horrible star.  Our little one has had a difficult time since he saw that horrible event on his last outing for Spring Break.  Thank goodness, he made it out ok.  Still, I'm so very sorry we chose  the Trussville Urban Air, but we knew other kids who enjoyed it there in the past.  I'm sorry to say we even teased a teenager who was too scared to ride, but he was wiser than us I guess.  We researched. We read the google reviews first. Obviously, not enough people write reviews.  We thought it was safe (trampoline park safe anyway).  We were wrong!   It's not even safe to sit on the benches and watch your babies.  And the lack of customer followup and consideration just adds to the mess.\n\nBecause of the layout of this Urban Air in Trussville, people on the ground are always under one of the air rides!  There should be a safety net or some type of separate area to keep kids above and kids and families below safe!!!!!!  We've visited Homewood Urban Air without a big problem. (Of course they don't have the air rope course and racer).\n\nPLEASE DON'T LET ANYONE YOU LOVE (OR HATE) SIT OR WALK AROUND ANYWHERE IN THIS URBAN AIR LOCATION WHEN SOMEONE IS RIDING ANY AIR ATTRACTION (even with a harness)!!!\n\nI hope this helps someone.  If you saw this, please speak up too and let people know.  It's time.  I can't believe the news didn't cover this.  I wish someone else said it sooner than me.  Every customer who was there Friday deserves answers, although not nearly as much as the injured victims.  We hope and pray they are alive and OK.  Every potential customer deserves answers so that it doesn't happen again.\n\nUrban Air in Trussville, I don't see how you are still open and promoting Birthday packages. But since you are, PLEASE PROTECT YOUR PATRONS( that includes kids riding and also includes moms and babies sitting and watching below)!!   I hope you are at least answering and helping the people you seriously hurt last Friday.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1554563277949, "text": "Hi Kim,\r\rThis is Carolyn from the Corporate office.
