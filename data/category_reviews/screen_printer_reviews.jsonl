When I asked them if all five machine broke down at the same time I then received a call back from Carol who said she was the owner and I was told they would not be printing the shirts because they were less than their minimum. Minimum?  I guess that they have no problem with not correcting their mistake. Coincidently I have a copy of there price list and on it states 1 is the minimum so not sure why 22 shirts is less than minimum.
