Nobody said anything to me about it, they just tried to get it back in place but it kept falling down. When I called to report it, they said they would order another one and replace it when I took my car in for its next oil change. When that time came, my husband took the morning off and drove  the car the hour and a half drive it takes to get to this dealership. My husband was told the rear view mirror cover had been replaced but when I got my car back, I noticed it had NOT been replaced. I called the service department and was told that it had indeed been replaced. When I inquired as to how the service tech then managed to break TWO covers and not mention it, I was told they would need to get back to me. When they called me back, I was told the the part had never actually been ordered and that they would order it and ship it to my house so I could replace it myself. This is not the first time I have had issues with dishonesty when dealing with the service department at this dealership. I had issues with them not being honest when I took my former BMW in for service as well. It\u2019s the closest dealership to me and still an hour and a half away. It\u2019s a shame that honesty and integrity mean nothing to them. The fact that they just pushed the cover back up and tried to pass it off as \u201cfixed\u201d tells a lot about the care and pride they put in to their work.

When I got there and tell them the problem they took the tire off and said my valve stem was bad and charged me $20 to replace the valve stem. I thought all was good, woke up Tuesday morning it was flat again. I called & spoke to Chris who told me that it was more than likely a cracked rim and there was nothing he could do about it. Today...FRIDAY, I took off work to take my car to Fortners. They first told me that the tire was the wrong size. Then when they got it off the rim they showed me 4 plugs where the tire had been repaired 4 times, previously.

There were only two employees working at the time an I guess they got overwhelmed because more people were in need of service; mind you I was the first customer an they should have been working on my car, but the guy kept stopping to help other people that had pulled up. So finally I had enough an asked the guy to please finish with my car, because I had to go rest before getting on the road (at that time I had been there close to 2 hours). So he did, an I was on my way. We made it through Montgomery without any problems, an then I was awaken by a loud noise, screeching tire sounds, and the sight of my front driver tire rolling away parallel to my truck, heading towards the grassy median. By the grace of God we were not hurt. The inside of the rim was shredded, the bolts were gone, the studs ate up. All this was caused by the a negligent employee that didn't properly tighten the bolts to secure the tire. I spoke with the owner about getting help, but none was offered, an he even tried placing the blame somewhere else. But I will never give Chris Tires anymore of my money/business nor will I recommend them to anyone. I spent over $600 to have my car fixed. I even checked the other tires an the bolts were not secure on them either. Lesson learned, u can't support everyone.

Here is what happened.  Called got a verbal quote of $139-189 per axle for a brake job with rotor's turned which is fair they are just below the dealer which was $200 per axle.  Went the next day to have services done to my car.  Before they began work they inspected it and determine I needed pads all the way and rotor's on the rear and a brake fluid exchange.  Estimate price was over $700.  I declined the brake fluid exchange and they offered some \"competitive\" discounts brought my total down to about $580.  Still more than it should be.  Asked for a printed estimate when I saw the estimate I knew something was up.  They had part numbers and prices on the estimate.  Quick Google search confirmed the part numbers and prices from a local part supply store that they would be getting the parts from.  They are marking up parts pricing 100+%.  Industry standard is between 10-25%.  Then they told me that the estimate was nearly at cost and if he went any lower he would lose his job.  Nothing but scam and scare tactics were used with me and I didn't take the bait.  Tried to email the address on the general managers card it wouldn't ever go through.  Called the corporate office gave them the info and the pictures I have attached here and they said a regional manager would get back with me still have not heard from that person either.
