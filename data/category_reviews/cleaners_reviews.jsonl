Drew one of the sales guys made up stories about the situation, told my tenant I had told him things when I hadn't even talked to the guy yet and told two different things ones to me and my tenant .I asked Drew why he did this and let him know I would be calling the office and  he proceeded to call my tenant a couple of times and send me a  6 page text over the situation which I found very unprofessional . When I called to complain about this Jacob the owners son took  up for the actions, was rude to me, did not listen to me and acted like I was bothering him.I was told my cabinets needed replaced when they did not. They pulled the vanity out of my master bathroom that did not need pulled out to begin with  without cutting the caulk and when they pulled the vanity it caused the mirror in the bathroom to fall on the sink shattering my mirror and busting my sink in the bathroom and tried to blame it on the heat in the room.I called  David the head of the construction department several times asking a start date and was told no repairs would be started  until they had 18 thousand upfront, Half the cost, and to ask my adjuster to call  his cooperate office and have Fed Ex deliver it to them.I asked my adjuster about it and he said that they did not that money upfront and was beyond shocked I had been told that.They still have their little lock box on my door a week after I told them I will not be using their services anymore, I have called four times to ask to have removed.I have called and asked  three times to speak to the owner of the franchise and got no response.

But then everything got very confusing. We didn't know what was going to happen or when. Then they came in and packed all of our things up, first our clothes and no one told us to keep out any clothes. So we had no clothes blankets or pillows by the time they finished. There was 2 rooms that just had to be cleaned but they threw out our beds and furniture and took out all the carpet. We put notes on two closets and put don't enter.. I found the notes in the floor when we returned. They packed up everything and took it with them but nothing was cleaned it was just in the box they had packed it in.\nThey told us they we're going to clean the duck work, it was not cleaned, the ceiling fans were not cleaned nor were the blinds. We have had to just  about replace everything  we own plus we had use or own  money to eat at the hotel for   for over 2 months. Being nice is great but we had to many people telling us different things..it took a month after we got to come home before they started bring things back. It made difficult to cook. We had to buy new pots just fry an egg.\nWhen they finally brought things back they were very confused about everything because the young guy and 3 woman that packed us up were fired. They didn't seem to know what was ours and what wasn't.  There are quite a few things missing.  Some of the items are antique and can't be replaced.  The thing is these items problem  went to someone else  and they just saw it was old and not there's. Maybe I need to go check the thrift store.  I didn't think this was going to be easy but this has been a nightmare. I have items that have tags on them, but they didn't take them or clean them. My blinds still have soot on them and it is not easy to clean. They we're supposed to clean and check or duct work , not even touched. And we saw the check our insurance sent them and that was way too much for this mess.

For two weeks, we checked every\nday, no workmen.  We were assured we would be back in by Christmas.  We went through three Project Managers, and\nthree different set of drywall and painters.  The first painting crew stood on my washer and dryer to paint the\nceiling in the laundry leaving dents and scratches.  We had stored the liquor from our bar in tubs in the garage,\nas Servpro would not remove alcohol from the home.  Apparently the painters had found it and consumed a great deal\nbefore they were removed from the job by Darin Ingle.  They also got paint all over our floors so Servpro brought\nin commercial scrubbers which removed the finish on all of our floors.\n\nTo shorten this story, I will cut to the return home.  We finally returned to our home in early March with work still\ngoing on, Painting and damaged floors. The first night home the water under the sink of my brand new cabinets\nflooded the kitchen.  They had to send in dryers and a plumber who said it was not hooked up correctly and\nreworked all of the kitchen dishwasher and sink plumbing. They sent in a professional flooring company  to assess\nthe floors. Their solution required us to move back into a hotel for at least a week so they could clean, reseal\nthe tile and recolor the grout.\n\nThe only thing that saved this project was Darin Ingle who arrived on the project in February.  Darin was sent in from another state to resolve the\nproblems at the Montgomery location that included our home.  Darin took the reins, brought in new crews and came\nevery day to ensure the work got back on track and that it was done correctly.  Darin's arrival was months into\nthe project and while we have never sued anyone, we were on the verge of doing just that to get another company\nto come in so we could go home.  I am not sure if Servpro's executives realize that Darin not only saved our project,\nsaved them from a lawsuit but did an amazing job saving their reputation.  I would only call them again if Darin Ingle handled the job.\nBecause of Darin, I am giving Servpro a 2 star rating and Darin a 5.\n\nAn update to my review.  I was contacted by Mr. Bowen, an owner.  Mr. Bowen was determined to do something to do something for All we had been through.  He offered to send in a crew or something.  While his offer was appreciated, we had already fixed many of the issues and did not feel we could ensure another work crew I agreed to think it over and get back with him.  The one thing, as I explained to him, that distressed me everytime I went into the laundry was the dents and scratches on the tops of the washer and dryer which he eagerly agreed to replace.  With much of manufacturing shut down for long periods, appliances are in short supply.  However, Mr. Bowen and Darin Ingle were able to replace order And have new ones installed.  My frustration is no longer renewed when I walk into my laundry room.  My thanks to Mr. Bowen for reaching out and making this a better experience, and to Darin Ingle for making it happen.  It is good to know they cared to make things better.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1600260211243, "text": "Hi Judy, I am one of the owners and I am terribly sorry to hear about your experience.

Paid for tile cleaning and grout sealing. Crew had to come out 3 times in one day to attempt to fix and finish. First, they forgot to seal the shower that we paid $90 for them to do. Then, we noticed a film all over every single tile that would not come up; Technician did NOT allow the tile and grout to dry before spraying grout sealer..Then, did not wipe off the excess grout sealer, just left it all over each and every tile. 3rd trip out of same day to day to try and fix it, they used every chemical, scrubber machine, everything they had to try and get it off, guess what, didn't work. So now, my grout is wet UNDER the sealer, which never had proper curing time, because they did not let the grout dry before applying, and my tiles have giant stains, splotches, blobs all over every single one because they did not remove the sealer from the tile after spraying the grout. And on top of it, one of the technicians decided that no, all of my white grout was actually completely stained before they got here that's why it's dark (Not because it was wet, which was the case)..He ended up arguing with me and cursing at me.

I tried scheduling, thinking they would call and say they needed to set me up at another time.  Instead, I got a call at 8:10AM saying a team was on the way.  Dane and his partner were AWESOME.  They were worried that they would not be able to correct the damage I had done,  so Dane went into great detail about what to expect (he did not want me to be disappointed).  After much discussion, I told him to \"go for it\".  He did a superb job of fixing what I had messed up with his corrective cleaning technique.  He cleaned to rest of the floor sparking clean and fresh.  The results were much better than I expected and I am very happy with his hard work and diligence in making certain I was fully informed about potential upside and downside of the process.  It was quick, convenient and more than lived up to my expectations.
