My original review was a bit critical, due primarily to my lack of experience working with dealers when buying a new bike.   Let me elaborate:\nDealership:  Original review was that this was a typical Harley Dealership,  however after visiting a few others out of the area, I would say it is above average.  Welcoming staff with good selection of bikes and gear, an overall comfortable environment to shop.\nFinance:  They definitely did not mess around with offering a solid interest rate out of the gate.  The finance person was great, explained all the numbers and answered all my questions.  The application process was easy and overall enjoyable.\nPricing:  Spot on pricing with MSRP.  Standard doc, destination fees, however there wasn\u2019t an additional mark up on the price.\nSales:  This is where the deal fell apart. Another dealer offered to include the new riders course ($250) and deliver the bike for free ( a little over 50 miles ).  Being my local Harley dealer and a member of the same owners group,  I thought this might be standard among the three shops. It was not.   When I asked if they would do the same, the answer was \u201cno\u201d.  Asked if that was a deal breaker, I replied yes and that was the end of that until I posted my review here online.\nA different sales person contacted me and tried to make the deal, unfortunately I was still annoyed and never really gave him a chance to try to work it out.\nOverall, I have no reservations giving this dealer a 5 star review after shopping around, the majority of the process was smooth and enjoyable.  After all is said and done would I go back and try again, absolutely.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1621743788893, "text": "Very sorry to hear this, Ropa.

The GM reached out to me quickly and decisively and solved my most recent problem.  I was really impressed with what he said about his commitment to making the quality of service at Heart of Dixie as great as the quality of shopping and sales.\n\nORIGINAL POST on 10/15/2015... Loved the \"bike purchase\" part--5 stars.  Bought a brand new Vrod Muscle in 2011 and a new Road Glide Ultra in 2012.  Unfortunately, like so many other businesses out there, once you buy they forget all about you.  I'm speaking specifically about service--1 star.  The quality of service is fine--4 star, but the speed of service is what kills the rating for me--1 star.  Waiting two weeks on a regular basis to get your bike back is crazy.  That's been my experience on multiple occasions.  Counting today, five times, I've discovered problems as I'm about to go out of town on a ride.  They've been completely unwilling to work me in and help out so that I could make my trips.  Today was a little different.  I tried to get through to service and left messages beginning a 4 pm and now they've closed and still no call back.  I've had much better luck on service with Rider's Harley Davidson in Trussville.  Interesting to me that both stores are owned by the same man.  I've heard it said that the easiest customer to get is the one you already have.  In this particular case, I'll have to decide if the \"joy\" of owning a Harley is worth the aggravation of getting it taken care of!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1445528061992, "text": "Hi Bob, We're very happy that we were able to get this fixed for you.
