They completely ignored the proper protocol for mold removal and had to be let go mid service. They piled mold contaminated items on top of non contaminated items. They did not seal off contaminated rooms from other areas.\nThey took advantage of my elderly in-laws.\nWould give no stars if possible.\n\nIn response to your response. The proper protocol plan that you told my wife you were going to follow was not followed. You set bags of contaminated items on our personal items in a separate room. You stacked contaminated bags against the face of a flatscreen tv. There were pieces of contaminated sheetrock all over the floor in a room that you claimed was clean. Yes, I was upset because of all of this.\nAs my wife explained to you in the beginning,  she is highly allergic to mold. So, when I saw contaminated items drug through our living room and placed on our non contaminated things, it upset me. I even took pictures of it. I'm sorry your feelings got hurt, but you ruined our things and wasted our time.\n\nWe have now discovered that more things were ruined in the bags they carelessly packed. A bottle of shampoo was thrown into a bag where it broke open and poured onto my daughter's $300 camera, the bible she received from us at her Baptism, and many other valuables. That was just one bag. The amount of loss from this company is beyond a money value. Personal, irreplaceable  items were destroyed also.\n\nIn response to what you responded to my wife and her comments. All I can say is that you're shameless.

Our company followed appropriate protocol which included erecting containment barriers.  There was NO cross-contamination, as you stated.  Our company has been in business since 1979 and we are highly reputable.  All was running smoothly until you entered the picture. What you failed to mention was your erratic behavior towards our crew.  You verbally assaulted our crew and even continued yelling after our crew had exited the house.  You displayed a total lack of self control.  We did not create the mold issues in this house but we are well qualified to remediate any mold problem.  It appears that your personal problems boiled over and you chose to take it out on our crew.  That was a cowardly move.  For clarification- While your in-laws are senior citizens, your description of them as \"elderly\" invokes an image of feebleness.  Your in-laws appear to be spry, able bodied and mentally fit.  Furthermore, your assertion that we were taking advantage of your in-laws may well be a projection since you - a grown man, are living in your in-laws basement. Your behavior and attempts to discredit our company are/were immature and reprehensible!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888c9327b068c7fb:0x7e68a4db3203cee2"}

I met with Rick and his wife at the beginning of August for them to run air sample tests on my parents house. They ran the test in 4 rooms, and called me 2 days later with the results.  When Rick called me he said that the levels of Stachybotrys were among some of the highest indoor levels he had seen in his 15 years of experience. In addition to the phone call I received an email from him with the results and a message stating that it was very dangerous for anyone to enter that area without protective gear on. He also insisted that we allow them to come back out and test 2 more rooms in the same area. He and his wife came back the next day, August 11th or 12th, to run the other 2 tests. WE STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE RESULTS FROM THOSE TESTS THAT WE PAID FOR 2 MONTHS AGO. We have asked for the results multiple times and the only answer my Dad got was that the tests came back ok.\n\nBefore Paragon Industrial was hired to do the mold remediation, I spoke with Rick and his wife about their protocol for removing contaminated items as to not cross contaminate the other rooms and items. After talking with them at length about how they would do the job, I felt comfortable with the protocol and encouraged my 80 year old father to go with their company.\n\nThey told my parents that they needed to run the air scrubbers upstairs and clean the air ducts first. Why would you clean upstairs before you remediate the toxic black mold downstairs? That doesn't even make sense. The mold should have been remediated first, then the air ducts, and last the air scrubbers.\n\nWhen they came to start the remediation THEY DID NOT FOLLOW ANY OF THE PROTOCOLS THAT THEY HAD EXPLAINED TO ME IN DETAIL BEFORE BEING HIRED! As far as erecting containment barriers, they put up some plastic sheeting with duck tape that began peeling off of the walls and door the same day they were put up. The air conditioning vents were not sealed off and the unit was not shut off while they were ripping moldy Sheetrock down. Also, they threw everything into black garbage bags from the contaminated room and threw it on top of our furniture in the living room causing CROSS CONTAMINATION. There was also moldy Sheetrock strewn down the hall where they drug it out! They explained to me that the Sheetrock would be taken down in small pieces, bagged and sealed before being removed completely from the house.\n\nMy ELDERLY father called to tell us what was going on at the house and I told my husband to go make sure things were being done like they said they were going to do them. When my husband, Sean, got to the house he found a huge mess! EVERYTHING HAD BEEN CROSS CONTAMINATED! My husband was in shock at how careless they were being because he was concerned about the impact it would have on my health! We had recently found out that I have lesions on my spine, unusual rashes, peripheral neuropathy, daily debilitating migraines, and chronic sinus infections ALL caused by exposure to black mold. My husband had to leave me alone in bed after being released from the hospital to come over to the house to find out what was going on. That is the reason he reacted the way he did, because he is genuinely concerned about the health of his wife! Any man who saw someone doing something that would bring harm to his family would react the same way!\n\nMy father called Rick and released him from the job the next day. He was supposed to return some of the money that my dad had paid upfront, but of course that has not been returned. My parents paid out almost $4000 for them to make a grand mess out of everything!\n\nSince then my parents have had a professional air conditioning company come check the air ducts upstairs that were supposed to be cleaned for $900 and he showed them that they had only been wiped out a couple feet. He inquired about what was paid, and couldn't believe that they paid for the service!!!\n\nI would keep going if google would allow me more characters.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1509138999688, "text": "Like your husband, your recollection of events is inaccurate.\nThe work upstairs was a completely different Indoor Air Quality Issue.  The work upstairs was not mold related.  Because your parents were living in this area, it was the priority.\nThe work downstairs was performed using industry protocol.\nI would like to remind you that we did not cause your mold problem and we did not cause your illness and health problems.\nPlease stop making false accusations against our company.

They left everything cleaned, they cleaned thoroughly and not just around stuff, plus they placed everything back where it was. I'm thoroughly surprised and did not expect them to be able to meet my standard. Donna, Elaine and a third maid (I suspect she was in training) were a dream. Respectful, nice, cordial, thorough and very hard workers. Great communication too to ensure I was satisfied with the work.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1606345475277, "text": "Thank you for the review Carol.

After leaving, unfortunately, I was unimpressed, but because we all have \"bad days\", my first instinct was to give them another chance.\nThe day of my follow-up cleaning (2 weeks later), I sent a text to confirm my appt time - since I did not receive a text reminder - like I did for the initial cleaning.  After a short time had past, with no reply, I called and spoke to Chrissy.  Although I did not call to complain, I did mention that I was not satisfied with my first cleaning - and why, but explained that - because everyone has bad days - I was waiting for this cleaning to see how things went.  I must say, once on the phone, Chrissy was very responsive and willing to make everything right.\nNow to the GOOD stuff...  Whitney and Melissa.  These 2 ladies are THE BOMB!  They came in - WORKED HARD, and had my house \"sparkling\" when they left - so much so - that upon their departure, I immediately sent  Chrissy another text message - PRAISING their work and asking to have these 2 young ladies clean my house from now on.  (Sadly - I am still awaiting a response.)\nIt is women like Whitney and Melissa who make a business look - not just good - but impeccable!!!! - and all the bad bearable.

To clarify, when I entered the information online I was given the price of $140 dollars. I THEN spoke with a representative of the company who clarified the first clean would be a deep clean, but never stated this would result in a higher cost. I was completely misled to believe my fee would be the $140 versus almost $400. When I called to discuss they could not give me a rational for why the price was as expensive as it was and accused me of lying on the internet submission regarding occupancy and square footage even though I told the woman I spoke to on the phone I lived with my boyfriend and two dogs. Completely unprofessional, dishonest and clearly have poor business ethics. Additionally, when I informed them I\u2019ve used cleaning services for a number of years and have never been charged that much for an initial clean (and told them the name of the company I had used in my previous rental), they eluded to the fact that the company in question was not professional or a legitimate business.

As I understand you booked your clean online.  There is some expectation that folks who enter data requested for booking online will provided accurate data.  When booking online you indicated you had 0 pets, 1 occupant, and your square footage was 2200.   My understanding is you have 2 occupants and 2 pets per your phone conversation.    Your clean was actually discounted based on less occupants and no pets.\n\nMy understanding is you had no issues with the service other than price.  Hard to address what you heard or did not hear during the call with our office as it relates to price.  We certainly try to communicate price as part of any booking but your reaction indicates you did not hear it or we failed to communicate it.\n\nLastly, based on your call your position was discount or negative reviews.  Unfortunately we do run into this situation 1 or 2 times per year.   Certainly don't like failing to meet your expectations, but will not be coerced into discounts by threats either.  You bear some responsibility to understand the services you have secured. This would certainly be an exception for one of our customers to invite us into their home to clean and not know what services they will receive and what they will cost.\n\nAny desire to discuss further just call the office and let Chrissy know you want to chat with the owner and she will put us in touch."}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2e8bc654731:0x76a1661ea305ee05"}

In fact, after your Thanksgiving clean you texted \u201cthe girls did a really good job\u201d.\n\nToday you turned our team away and were charged a cancellation fee.  These type fees are always a tough decision as a business owner.   You know a negative review might be coming because you stuck by your cancellation policy.  In most cases it is the right thing to do for the PHC's whose earnings will be impacted by the late cancellation. For 99% of customers this simply is not a problem as we share this policy in our Welcome Packet.\n\nLike most service companies we do utilize computer scheduling.  We offer multiple cleaning packages.  We even offer custom packages.  Cost will vary based on requirements. What we do is complete the clean as defined in the package you purchase.  Most customers prefer to know what they will receive and want it done consistently.\n\nNow let me offer you some feedback as the owner.  I have owned this location since it opened.  We are not perfect but strive to improve every day.  After speaking with multiple members of our team it is clear to me that your goal was to bully your way out of a fee you were fully informed of.  You were extremely abusive and spoke down to all of our team members on the day after Christmas of all days.\n\nWhile I can empathize with your frustration with being charged a cancellation fee I would challenge to treat people with dignity and respect in the future.  If you cannot do that then I suspect most small business owners like myself would prefer you take your business somewhere else.\n\nThank you for your feedback.  Have a Happy New Year and if I can ever be of any assistance call the office and ask for Blue.  They will get us in touch."}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2e8bc654731:0x76a1661ea305ee05"}

We went back to check everything out almost 4 days after the service came through, and found my thermostat (that I had previously turned off since no one was living there) was running and had been running 24/7 on 65 degrees, and my bedroom fan was still running. So now we will be paying the electric bill for those almost 4 days where my air conditioner had been left to run on a very high setting. Opened the closet with the water heater and there was still dog hair all around the floor, the oven had not been cleaned out, there were flecks of dirt in the bathtub that were not there when I moved out, and nothing around the washer/dryers had been cleaned out. We also went through and re-mopped the floors, and there was dirt coming up on the mopping pads as if the floors had barely been touched. When we sent the photos to the manager, she called my mother back to argue with her that the apartment was very dirty and that they don\u2019t touch water heaters. Apparently sweeping up the floor around the water heater is considered messing with it? This also does not explain the dirty oven, the dirt in the tub that was not there before, and the utilities that had been turned on and left on high for days. All she did was half heartedly offer to come help my mom clean (we had already cleaned up after them so we declined), and no apologies or attempts to reconcile for these other issues were made. She literally only called my mom back to argue with her. $200 later for an hour cleaning of a 450 sq foot apartment, and we had to go spend another hour cleaning up all the stuff they left behind.\n\nIf you don\u2019t leave your apartment spotless, which defeats the entire purpose of having a cleaning service come in (I\u2019m not talking leaving it absolutely filthy and covered in trash, but needing reasonable deep cleaning after 2 years of living there), then don\u2019t even bother hiring this service. If you have any complaints or concerns you\u2019ll be argued with and no attempts to reconcile or partially reimburse will be made.

I am not a reckless driver nor would I ever risk lives intentionally, i didn't see you in my blind spot I looked twice and was seeing my lane running out, so when the truck moved over to let me in that's when I proceeded to move over not knowing you were back there.

I waited most of the day on her call.  I emailed her that afternoon.  I expressed my continued interest in the position and asked could we schedule another interview.  Now Thursday I didn't receive any response from Nadia.

She apologized for her not showing up.  I asked her why she couldn't communicate with me after she arrived at the office and realized she missed the interview.

We have had to go to Sam's and Dollar General numerous times recently to get essential supplies that we've paid Cintas for and they have consistently not delivered. The one business we have left doesn't need anywhere close to the amount of stuff we originally signed up for, but apparently the fact that the main business doesn't exist anymore doesn't matter to Cintas.
