As of today 7/21/21, we have been charged yet again, and have now been told that there\u2019s nothing that can be done about it and they we will not be refunded.\n\nEven Walmart has some kind of customer resolution procedure for situations like this. I don\u2019t even see how they stay in business. If you are looking for a good martial arts place for your kids to go to GO SOMEWHERE else. They do not care about their customers, they only care about getting paid and robbing you of your time and money. The biggest mistake I made was signing up with them. If I could take legal action I would, because their policies are about robbery. They didn\u2019t even apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nI will NEVER come here, or recommend this them.

Master Scarsella and his team are very nice and will help you, they offer a free 3 day class and they'll let you try out if you dicide if you want to join taekwondo. They also have events every month like taekwondo championships and movie night. I been both of them and is really fun. Children can go to movie nights without their parents but the instructors will supervise them and is really fun. The championship is for all ages and for all belts. They take place in a school other than theirs because it is small. They are socially distant and if you don't feel safe doing in person, you can do taekwondo in home on zoom. Can't give the zoom code meeting for reasons but if you join, they will tell you the meeting code and instructions.
