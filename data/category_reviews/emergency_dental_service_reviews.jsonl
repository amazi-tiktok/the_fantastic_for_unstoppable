If you don't have lots of money, no worries. They will work with you and allow you to make payments. Jamie, the lady who handles the financial part of the business is a sweetheart.

The dental hygienist, Renae, worked through her lunch break to perform a periodontal treatment on me because I told her it was VERY important that I had it done before the next week. The dentist, listen, you will read reviews saying that she's rude, etc. My goodness, here in the south we tend to be big babies. She isn't rude, at all. She's just very professional and straight to the point. I am sure that she never intended to come across as rude to anyone that's just how she may seem but NOT rude, by any means. I, also, read a lot of reviews where people complained that they tried to force them to buy a toothbrush or only cared to make money. I have a feeling that all of these people, unfortunately, misunderstood a lot. They, too, told me about a certain type of toothbrush and gave me a pamphlet on it. There is nothing wrong with feeling strongly about a toothbrush. Electric toothbrushes clean your teeth and gums far more thoroughly than one that is not. I am sure that the dental hygenist, who recommended the toothbrush to me, doesn't pocket a dime for the people who purchase the toothbrushes. Please don't be misinformed or mislead by other reviews.

I visited this location about a year and a half ago and everything was fine.  Had initial appointment where they did Xrays and evaluation and then had four teeth pulled the next day.  Was way overcharged compared to other dentists in the area, but because they were able to extend a credit line I paid the over priced services for relief from tooth pain with little money out of pocket.  Fast forward to today.  I have severe tooth pain that has had me away all night. I called at 7:30 this morning and the lady that took my call offered me appointments starting at 7:45 (which was the earliest appointment and I took it), and then just about every 15 mins increments after that for the rest of the day.  When we got to my name and information, she stated I was already in their system and would need to call back when the office opened to schedule my appointment.  I just called to schedule the appointment and they can not see me until late afternoon. I asked the lady could they not see me this morning, that I was in a lot of pain and had been up all night and she said no, that 2:30 was the earliest they could see me.  So I questioned why \"new\" patients could be seen as early as 7:45 am and every 15 mins forward, and walk in patients as their website says, can be seen this morning, but existing patients who have already spent a LOT of money with them are not able to be seen until later in the day.  She had no answer other then that is the earliest I could be seen.  Not to mention, even though it has only been a year and a half, I have to do all the exam and Xrays all over again just like a new patient, would not be treated that day for what was hurting and  would have to schedule another appointment to have any work done after the initial appointment.  So this place wants to charge me to complete new patient services, however does not want to give me new patient scheduling times.  I was willing to pay their ridiculous costs because I still have $3000 in credit with their finance company, but I refuse to sit her in pain all day while they schedule new patients in front of me............   Terrible, awful and ungrateful staff and services. Will not recommend and will advise everyone I know against them.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1582667067511, "text": "I certainly understand your frustration.

I looked at the papers they have me and they charged me 3 and 4 times for the same thing, then told me that the teeth cleaning is charged for each quadrant of my teeth. This was never explained to me and I have never been to a dentist that charged that way, they did the same thing that other dentist do, and charged me for each quadrant of my teeth, said I had a gum disease, my gums are pushed up over my enamel on my teeth caused from me over brushing them, and brushing them the wrong way,, I did this when I was a child and brushed my teeth 8 to 10 times a day, because my Mom's teeth were so bad and I have seen her in so much pain from bad teeth, so I was over brushing my teeth. I was told that everything would be charged through Genesis Credit, I got a card from the credit company and never activated it... But they don't tell you that the charges are for your first visit only.. Then get the bill and for the few things they did my bill was $1013 and some change.. I went to only get a filling done on a tooth and the dentist was drilling out my tooth that needed filled and kept bouncing off my tooth he was drilling on and kept bouncing off my tooth and hitting a tooth behind the one he was working on, so now I have the tooth he kept hitting with the drill that has to be filled.. I was suppose to go back to get my 2nd cleaning and I was told I would have to pay them in cash for it, then found out that it had already been charged on the credit company, so there they thought they were going to get paid twice,, so Aspen Dental was going to make you pay 2 times for the same thing, as they did on my bill... I was told that the special mouth rinse and special toothpaste was included with the Oral B toothbrush kit, and looked on my papers and was charged 3 and 4 times each for the mouth rinse and toothpaste.. This is the worse dental place I have ever been to... And I have called the Customers Care line and am told they would have someone call me by tomorrow, I have been told this for several times, and the ones that call me tell me to call back if they haven't called me within 2 days, to call them back.. I have been calling them since right after I had my dental appointment and got the paperwork on all the charges and I almost fell over,, I was lied to by the employees, the dentist, and customer care... This is ridiculous... Aspen Dental is a ripoff.. Everyone I have talked to that has been there has nothing good to say about Aspen Dental in Gadsden Alabama.. I have tried to get this straighten out about being overcharged on what was done, and am always told if you don't hear back from me in 2 days, to call back, I have been doing this for months, and they have done nothing to resolve this problem... So my advice to everyone that is bringing about going to Aaron Dental in Gadsden Alabama DON'T USE THEM, THEY ARE CROOKS!!!!!!!...This is the sorriest place I have ever been to... I'm trying to get this straighten out or I'm going to turn them in to the Better Business Bureau, and see if they can do something about them!!!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a3ecf41307ffb:0x4b5df95bcb483c3f"}

This facility is very new and clearly they need to meet there quota to pay it off. Staff is very nice but when it comes to experience and knowing what they are doing, the lack all of the above. Went to have a simple cleaning and they tell me I have a gum disease. Ok, fair enough I use to smoke so it happens. So I proceed to allow them to do the procedure but wait first I had to pay $180 before I could have any treatment which to my understanding was suppose to cover everything and my insurance cover the rest. Then we go on. They say one of my back teeth js decaying and needs to be uprooted. I allow it to happen because I had bothered me for years. In the most of pulling the tooth the dentist breaks the bone off that holds the tooth in process of pulling it. I told him multiple times before pulling it that I would soon be getting braces and I didn't want that to affect it. Well now that has caused issue with getting braces. So on, I have cavities. A total different dentist is doing this procedure days later. He and the women helping carried on the whole time and was more focused on there conversation than fixing my Cavaties. That being said he didn't fill the tooth the complete way so now I have sensitivity for sweet hot and cold things. The other day I get a bill from them. $172 it was. Going back to the gym disease. I had to \"pay everything up front\" before I could have the procedure done right. At least that's what the lady said. I just got off the phone with them. They begin to tell me the bill is only $126.??? So why did I get billed $50 more than that.

Because of this my pain threshold is high so if I say something hurts it really hurts. My previous dental office was aware of this yet the hygienist chose to ignore the pain I was experiencing. After speaking with the office manager I decided I would not complete my appointment and later called back and canceled any further treatment with that practice. I called my insurance company and located the office of a previous dentist that I loved and I am so glad I did. I called Bryant Dental on Bob Wallace and even the interaction over the phone was pleasant. Whitney was able to schedule me an appointment quickly and educated me on the processes and procedures and what to expect. I could hear her smile through the phone. The day of my appointment, the entire staff was absolutely wonderful! As a new patient for the practice I knew I would have paperwork and would probably be there for a while but as soon as I finished my paperwork my hygienist was waiting for me. Chelsey greeted me with smiling eyes (she had on her mask), explained the process in depth and after reviewing my x-rays she recommended the best next step to help with my issues. She listened and made sure to understand what I was experiencing and throughout my appointment she made sure the process was not causing too much pain. With tender swollen gums pain is to be expected however if the hygienist knows what they are doing the patient will experience minimal pain. Chelsey knows what she is doing! She took a potentially mouth throbbing, tears running uncomfortable situation and made it a pleasant and educational experience. I went in with my mouth feeling awful and because of what Chelsey did my teeth feel so much better. Because I am a cancer warrior my teeth and gums have gone through some major changes. Chemo, radiation and long term medication has caused damage that I thought was going to take radical treatment to repair but Chelsey explained how to minimize further damage and what to do to get me on a path of recovery. She was absolutely amazing! I highly recommend Bryant Dental on Bob Wallace, you will not be disappointed.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1621012488256, "text": "Wow to that wonderful review!

They use Transworld System collection agency when Tonya makes a mistake with your treatment plan and tells you your insurance will pay half and you pay the other half ($560) and then it turns out TONYA read it wrong but expects the patient to pay for her mistake you will get turned over to a collection agency! I liked Dr. Bentley and was very disappointed she let her office manager get away with dirty office practices, so I had no other choice but to find another dentist for my son and I. Tonya wouldn\u2019t let me speak to Dr. Bentley she twisted what happened to fit her narrative and let Dr.Bentley think they were doing me a favor by cutting the bill in half when all along Tonya knows this is on her! And she sent a $240 bill to collections on a procedure that wasn\u2019t even done correctly (we were told my son didn\u2019t need a crown turns out he did but because of Tonyas error reading our policy which is her job by the way we never went back to Dr.Bentley after getting a $500 bill in the mail no phone call Tonya knew I would be upset and she knew exactly what she told me) and the tooth had to be extracted after all of that! So NO  I do not recommend you go there! Not because of Dr. Bentley but because you cannot trust Tonya to do your insurance and billing correctly! Do you have an extra $1000.00  laying around when you get a surprise bill from Tonya? When I asked Tonya why she didn\u2019t catch that the insurance wouldn\u2019t cover that procedure she said to me well neither did you! Wow!! Tonya claimed to have gotten an approval for the procedure when all along root canals weren\u2019t covered within the first year of coverage (so that was a lie to cover her mistake) I would have thought an office manager and the person who is supposed to verify insurance would check that first thing! I have never had this happen before over 30 years of taking myself and 2 kids to the dentist! So there you have it!

Unfortunately with insurance they always have the disclaimer that it is an estimate and not a guarantee of payment.  As a courtesy we strive to help our patients by handling all the dental billing rather than collecting all payments up front for procedures creating the hassle for the patient to handle all billing to his or her own insurance.  It's a partnership where we rely on what the insurance provides us and what the insurance provides to the patient about their own coverage.  We definitely do our best on our end to try to gather all the information about waiting periods, missing tooth clauses and percentages covered.

The visit was to determine what we needed to do with me 71 year old Fabulous Mom. \ud83d\ude09 The office  was patient  and helped us get a bottom denture made and CREATED A PLAN  to work on the top after the bottom  was completed. Now Mom's on hospice care at home\nalong with the influx of Covid 19, we had to cancel many appointments.  Well  all the \"planets were in alignment today\" and I actually got her in to get  the denture. Mr. Kym spoke extremely curtly to her and quite frankly. Afterwards quickly , what I felt to dismiss us. Mr. Kym actually wait for it...........sent us home with this  denture only.\nNothing  else. So fast forward as Iam looking at it sitting on my table \"on a napkin\"  I called the office to inquire as to how to care for it. What to put it in (other than her mouth of course) And remembered her telling him that a tooth on top was sharp and causing pain to her tongue. To which he offered NO assistance. Pretty Inept  is the opinion I have of this guys practice.  He also made it quite clear he would offer no  further assistance with her remaining denture situation. You remember, the \" plan\" he had established prior. At any rate  I am simply at a loss.  Mr. Kym, Kim whatever at the very least owes her an apology for the lack of respect that he obviously felt was OK to show towardmy Mom. And at this point,  perhaps he could have one of his assistants  forward His  initial  \" plan \" if you will,  to a DMD whom can assist us in finishing her needs?

After my first visit I felt something was off about the way they handle things but I thought maybe I was overthinking it so I decided to go to my second appointment .\n\nDuring my first appointment I just needed to get a diagnose to see what I needed to get done . I saw Dr. Tan.  When Dr. Tan came and check my teeth and X-ray said I probably just need a cleaning and I had 2 cavities that need filling. They offered to do the cleaning that day and  I was ok with it. I have insurance so I knew that was cover and didn\u2019t have to pay anything. The hygienist also told me I needed a panoramic x ray and that my insurance doesn\u2019t cover so it was going cost me $92 and handed me this paper to sign it . I get very high anxiety at dentist office so I sign it without thinking any of it . She didn\u2019t explain why I needed she just said it was to check if everything was normal . I\u2019ve never had this done so I went with it. Now after my second visit I realized that panoramic x ray  is just a way to get money out of you and just to makes you pay for something you don\u2019t really need . After I got my teeth cleaning dentist never came to check on hygienist work and they never went over the panoramic X-ray . I went go head and got my second appointment to get my \u201c2 fillings\u201d done . The girl at the desk told me it was going to be $116.\n\nI went to my second appointment and of course I was anxious. The dental assistant tells me I need 3 fillings and it was going to cost me $155 . I asked her why 3 since I was told it was only 2 . She said her chart shows 3 fillings. Being anxious and wanting to get this done I just said ok and sign . Got my fillings done and paid . I went home and checked my teeth I can barely see the \u201c3rd\u201d filling . It makes me wonder if I even had 3rd cavity or was this just made up to get more money out of me ? . I don\u2019t know wether there was a miscommunication or if they\u2019re really just dishonest and taking advantage of people who are anxious ? !!!\n\nI know part of it is my fault for not speaking  up and just sign a paper .

No one came in to check on me and I was in the chair for three hours. Finally, when Dr. Tan came in the second time after she had numbed me, she started working on my tooth. I told her that it was still hurting. She then said that she was not bragging on her numbing technique, but that the area had to be numb. She said that since it was decayed that she might have to dig around down there and if I was feeling pain, she could not do that. She did not offer me nitrous oxide or more lidocane. She sent me home without extracting the tooth. She prescribed antibiotics for a week and then said we would try again.\n\nWhile I was in the chair, I was so cold that my feet were actually shaking.

You have to be good about it, or else your teeth will end up looking like this...\" at which point he gestured to a horrifying picture mounted on the wall featuring blackened and rotting teeth.

People, I have been seeing dentists twice a year throughout my entire life, keeping up with my regular cleanings and x-rays, and no dentist has ever been this critical of me.

We've had to implement this new policy due to the increase in patients who cancel with short notice or don't even bother showing up to their appointment.  On average 20% of our appointments every day do this which inhibits us from scheduling appointments for those patients who want or need them on certain days or times.  We also reserve time and resources for these patients which are lost when appointments are lost.

He will give you an honest estimate before doing the work for your consideration. There is no need to make several appointments for a crown because he uses the latest technology to make your crown right there during your appointment. That is worth a lot to me and my time.

I kept thinking \"What a great question, why have I never been asked that before?!\" I highly recommend!!\nPost surgery update: Dr. Lane corrected a receding gum for me with a gum graft. Dr. Lane asked me how much I wanted to know before giving me too much or not enough detail which was wonderful because I want to know it all and sometimes don't know what to ask. Going into the procedure I knew exactly what to expect and the only thing I expected that didn't happen was the pain. This procedure and recovery was surprisingly painless, I was sore but never enough to require pain medicine. Also, Dr. Lane was very clear that there was no guarantee for total root coverage, but 2 weeks out I have total root coverage and the results look wonderful.

They followed all safety measures against COVID and I felt very safe. Dr. Lane has a great chairside manner. Very caring and does not rush his exams.

She does an extensive cleaning and ensures I am comfortable. Staff is friendly and personable. Insurance filings with my primary and secondary insurance usually go without a hitch.

I recently cracked a tooth, and I was referred to a local dentist, so I decided to give them a try. Folks, just because someone has a fancy office does not mean that they are a reputable business, at least in my experience. It is not typical of me bad mouthing a local business and I will keep their name out of this review, but they are an embarrassment to the noble profession of dentistry. When I was seen by the hygienist, she responded, \"Oh wow that is bad, you will need to have that tooth extracted immediately\". My initial thought was \"I didn't realize that a hygienist was also a doctor of dentistry\". Then when the dental assistant took the x-rays, her response was identical! What made matters worse the doctor backed up what they said and wanted to extract the tooth right there and then!!! I was concerned and confused so I asked what the cost would be. They brought in the \"closer\" with the three options. Just yank it, yank it and create a cap with a bridge like a denture or the option that I would probably have chosen, yank it and have an implant which would have cost over three thousand dollars, oh, by the way they have a company that will finance.\nThanks, but no thanks!\nSo, I walked out and I waited, maybe too long because I got a bad abscess. Now what do I do?\nI researched and talked to many folks. I decided to give Southern dentistry a try and thank God I did. They got me in the next morning. Everyone that I came in contact with was very professional and friendly. From the receptionist to the dentist. The dental assistant took the x-ray and told me that the doctor will be with me shortly. Most of my experiences with doctors or dentists are that if you have an appointment be prepared to wait an hour or two before someone sees you. I was seen within a few minutes. Dr. Jessica Robinson was great, very professional and to the point and explained everything in detail. She recommended against extracting the tooth. She believed that the tooth can be saved. Her recommendation was to perform a root canal with a crown at a cost of less than a third of what the other dentist recommended! Very short and to the point treatment plan. NO FINANCING NEEDED!\nHow refreshing and what a great place. For once a dentist that understands CUSTOMER SERVICE! I highly recommend Southern dentistry.

{"user_id": "112224890650932522378", "name": "Alyssa Stellmaker", "time": 1624936690983, "rating": 3.0, "text": "This review is in response to a request sent to me after a dental procedure and included a side note that a review of less than 5-stars should be called into the office rather than placed online.  Dealing directly with the office was unresponsive. I\u2019ve been a patient at Southern Dentistry, with Dr. Nebrig, for 3+ years, with numerous procedures performed. I don\u2019t expect perfection; but, when a business won\u2019t/can\u2019t get you in to see the dentist for pain related to work that he performed and waiting too long could cause further or more serious damage, those little, previously forgiven imperfections compound.\n\nCons:  scheduling and communication.  Can\u2019t get in to see a dentist; even as an established patient, for a dental emergency, or to get a newly placed crown adjusted. If there is a problem with dental work that was completed there-such as a crown that\u2019s too high, pain/possible tooth infection/root canal needed after dental repair 3 weeks prior but persistent pain when chewing, the office will, literally, tell you that they are \u201ctoo busy\u201d to see you. You have to schedule a regular appt, which is many months out.  Neither pain, facial bruising, nor new pain at the contact tooth will matter. One of the assistants who places crowns will ignore a patient\u2019s cry of pain in hopes of rapidly finishing the crown fitting on a raw tooth. When the crown felt a little high during it\u2019s placement, the assistant didn\u2019t dry the tooth before using the chalk paper and told me to wait until I wasn\u2019t numb and to give the teeth time to adjust; they\u2019d move around a bit and I could easily come back in to get it adjusted. The amalgam fillings have a rough/sandy texture that leaves the tooth constantly feeling dirty.   The wait time before work/cleaning begins is often 45-60 min.  If insurance covers at 50%, you overpay before the work is done at a 40% coverage. This policy is left to the patient to discover. When questioning the math for the estimates and lack of refunds or j completed work, they say they will reimburse the difference after all the insurance claims have paid.  After all of the work that\u2019s been done, I\u2019m aware of only one reimbursement.  Perhaps, the overpayments were applied to other procedures and they forgot to tell me. My insurance claims for one procedure showed that I had overpaid Southern Dentistry by something like $86 and the front office confirmed the same amount a couple months after the claim. When I was at my next procedure and asked to have that $86 reimbursement applied to the current procedure, the office said I had $8 owed to me and my \u201cinsurance must not have paid fully for an X-ray or something.\u201d  (They didn\u2019t apply the $8 toward the current procedure or give me the money back.) Providing patients with a break down receipt that shows the portions the patient and insurance paid, and the refund owed to the patient would enhance trust and clarity.  At one appt, the office was in such a hurry to get patients out the door that they skipped my annual X-rays and said they would do them at the next cleaning, in 6 months.\n\nPros:  Dr. Nebrig has a charismatic and laid back, jubilant personality. He does a great job numbing the area that will receive work and calming an anxious patient.  He takes pride in and enjoys his work, and completes the procedures quickly.  Same day crowns drastically improve an unpleasant and time consuming dental procedure.  The office location is convenient. Silver fillings aren\u2019t used.  The hygienists, assistants, and dentist are friendly and gentle.  The sport-top water bottles provided  after a procedure exemplifies attention to detail and patient needs. The facility is clean. The office accepts a lot of different insurances. The business wants patient feedback.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1626896853017, "text": "Thank you"}, "gmap_id": "0x889a42208bd7a8c1:0x31556a24d6a98934"}

I was a little upset that I had to call to reschedule my appointment, originally for 4/6, (due to COVID)... I guess I just thought that the patients in pain, would at least get a call FIRST to reschedule any important procedures - that didn't happen. Thankfully, I called in late April & was able to get an appt for today, 5/27. I get there at 10:20, my appointment time, let them know I'm there, only to be told, \"You're appointment is scheduled for 11:10\". This was due some type of system issue they were having (understandable, not their fault). BEFORE they take payment, she goes over what they are doing today + how much it would cost. I immediately asked if that price included the nitrous oxide gas (my cost $50). She said no and amended my new payment to include the gas. After waiting for way longer than usual, I was called in and told, \"I'm sorry, the truck hasn't delivered the oxygen\".\nYes, I had about 2-3 panick/anxiety attacks in the chair but after 2 hours of crying, it isfis .... for now.\nNow, I'm in lots of pain and I can't even begin to describe it ... I can't open my mouth + chewing is OUT of the Question!!!!\nI really hope Dr. Nebrig and his staff makes this right bc I thought I FINALLY found a dentist that I can trust + does good work at good prices.\n***********************************************\n(August 2019) Dr. Nebrig and his staff are MARVELOUS. The environment is very relaxing. I was called back as soon as I arrived (literally no wait time in the lobby - not used to such a quick call back once I check in at other facilities I've visited in the past \ud83d\ude43). I was greeted with smiling faces and just felt \"Welcomed\". The girls were the most amazing assistants with my VERY FIRST root canal! They went over + above to ensure I was in as little discomfort as possible. Sidney even brought me a blanket while I waited on my crown to be delivered. Dr. Nebrig has an amazing bedside manner and is very kind and considerate. The staff called me the next morning to check and see how I was doing.

She made me feel comfortable, and she also listened and aided me in my concerns about wanting braces, which no other dentist had done for me before. Summer, my hygienist, soothed my worries when she told me my treatment moving forward would be fairly easy. I was afraid that I hadn't been doing my part completely and that she would find something disastrous, but she said my teeth were great and gave me a few tips moving forward!

I made an appointment for today to get a cleaning and I even made an extra trip before my appointment time for them to verify my insurance and I was told yes they take it. My insurance pays up to $1500.00 per year for dental. I get to my appointment and after waiting 35 minutes past my appointment time they take me back and do the x-ray then put in another room where a woman comes in and does a very brief look around my mouth and I am told I have no cavities but I do have a very bad build up on my teeth which is true. They also say I have mild periodontal disease which is probably true also but here is were it gets crazy. The tell I am going to see another woman to tell me what it will cost me. I said it shouldn't cost me anything my insurance pays up to $1500.00 to which they reply that the insurance will only cover a normal cleaning and since I need a deep cleaning I have to pay. Then they proceed to tell me that even with my insurance my cost for a deep cleaning will be anywhere from $2000.00 to $3500.00 I told them no way and that I thought they were crooks and walked out. After I left I did a Google search for what it should cost to have a deep cleaning done and it comes back the it should cost between $750.00 and $1200.00 meaning my insurance should have covered it. Now I have no idea how much they are gonna bill my insurance for what they did but I would bet it will take a huge chunk out of my $1500.00 of coverage so when I find a reputable dentist I now won't have the full amount available for that dentist.

Im 40 years old and have been going to the dentist every 6 months of my entire life and I have never had such an \"unfeeling\" dental experience.\n\nI have no dentures, partials, cavities and still felt like I was put through the ringer. I was not hurt, prodded, ridiculed or demeaned in anyway but I did not feel safe, comfortable or appreciated. I will not come back and I would never recommend Aspen. That being said I did get xrays and the dentist came in for a few moments to look in my mouth to verify I didnt have anything wrong. I am going back tomorrow to sign a HIPPA release to have the records and the xrays (I paid for!) released in 7-10 business day to the new dentist I chose over Aspen. Sigh.\n\nI also was recommended a procedure that is not and was not necessary, i refused the chemical prescription strength mouthwash and denied the procedure but was told because I did not accept the (unnecessary debridement) gingivitis procedure that they would not clean (polish) my teeth. Appauled! I wish I could upload pictures of my teeth right now, they are perfect, gums and all. Im sorry but if I dont want to give $100 dollars out of pocket for an optional treatment I shouldn't have too.\n\nMe, myself, and my cavity-less mouth won't ever be back and it would take hell or highwater to ever recommend them for anything other then ripping someones teeth out...which I heard one of their dentist talking about while I was there, I shuttered. Ever see the little shop of horrors dentist?!\n\nAspen, I get it youre a chain but going to the dentist sucks for everyone...find your roots, try not to be the Walmart of dentistry and Aspen if you do choose to become a WallyWorld, lower your prices for sh*t we dont need.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1618507524401, "text": "I'm really sorry to hear that, Pelles.

They were very accommodating and got me the first emergency appt they had. When I arrived at the office they checked me in on the phone in the parking lot in adherence to social distancing during this pandemic. They got me in after an extended wait. But bear in mind this was an emergency appt. Once inside they took a full set of xrays. The dentist came in and discussed the options with me all of which included the extraction of the tooth that had cause so much pain over the last few days. I met with the office manager, paid for the extraction, and went back to wait on the dentist to perform the extraction . I was moved to a procedure suite and the extraction was preformed under local anesthesia. I was released about 20 mins later. I was at the office almost 4 hours but again this was an emergency appt. I returned home and continue antibiotics prescribed by the emergency room 48 hours earlier. The swelling in my jaw and face is slowly going down. The pain is being controlled well with tylenol and advil. Give the fact that they made the emergency appt on Saturday for the first thing available and that I had to drive 40 miles to the office, I was grateful to get the appt as even emergency appointments during the pandemic are hard to get. The experience overall was positive and the staff was very friendly and professional. Thank you a gain for your help with this very painful and unexpected event. I will use aspen dental locally as a dental provider and recommend then to anyone whether having a dental crisis or for routine dental care. The treatment plan and cost are explained up front. They offer third party financing should you need it which could have been a viable option had it been necessary. Thanks again Aspen Dental. Great customer service and great dental service.

Most of the other dentists I contacted had about a 3 to 4 week wait. The day I arrived they provided me with x-rays and a quick inspection which included reading a bunch of numbers that were above 5 when they measured my teeth. Shortly thereafter they informed me I needed a deep cleaning procedure and a bunch of other treatments. Of course this procedure was going to be over $1,000 out of my own pocket. It was not covered by my insurance. They also informed me of a cavity that would need a root canal and it would be a separate procedure at an endodontist they recommended that of course would be more. They then tried to get me to go into a small room and sign paperwork to pay for the procedure. I left and figured I would get a second opinion.\n\nI decided to wait and made an appointment with Complete Family Dental also in Phenix City. They were able to do a cleaning for me and also fix my cavity tooth with a filling rather than a root canal and Crown. My insurance also covered almost all of the procedures and total cost out of pocket was only $150.\n\nAlso there was no deep cleaning procedure necessary and the numbers they read when measuring my teeth were all three or less.\n\nIt should be noted that I did not inform Complete Family Dental that I had visited Aspen. I wanted to see what they would say to make sure I wasn't being ripped off and if I indeed needed a deep cleaning procedure or a root canal.  Furthermore the dentist at Complete Family Dentistry fixed another filling free of charge because he noticed some decay building up behind that filling on the same tooth he was fixing already. I had my tooth fixed just this week. Definitely worth the wait.\n\nI recommend getting a second opinion if Aspen tries to get you for their 'deep cleaning' procedures.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ccfcb1912be09:0xbb0a473fcae18582"}

I'm 38 and retiring out the army. So I've had plenty of dentist experiences over the years. First off it's a brand new facility. Yet some how when you walk in you get hit with a horrible smell. Once you get past the smell it wssnt to bad until they wanted 18 xrays of my teeth. Okay not to bad of a idea so they can see everything. Except you will have to listen to the ridiculous joke that the xray tech has patients drool over her all the time. Ok it's a joke I'm ok with that except I had to hear it multiple times. Along with other jokes and comebacks that you may be thinking in your head right now. Then I have to question  how sterile the equipment is. Like I said I had to get 18 xrays. So I had to bit the tools to do so while sitting in a computer chair. There is a plastic sleeve to cover the exposed parts except the metal they want you to bit down on. Then I move to a room and the actual dental experience not so bad and quick. 10 mins to check for cavities. 10 minutes to check my gums. That might be kinda long it was actually very quick. Then I had to sit there and wait for some new employment paper work as I realize I watched 2 episode of daytime TV. I havent seen anyone in a long time. I start to ask my wife via text I wonder if they forgot about me. I go look for someone and finally ask of I'm waiting on something still. I'm told I'm waiting on the facility manager. Who is with a patient hmm. 20 minutes later I get called to their office asked if I had any questions. Then was like no but this was ridiculous and I'll never come back I've been here 2 hours for a check up that i had a appointment for. They said ok thank you. So not even a apology that their service took so long. So I would not recommend this facility to anyone unless you feel like wasting your entire day. Now it's not like it was a ton of paper work it was all filled out it just needed a signature. Which was signed by the dentist when they completed the exam. So I'm not even sure what the facility manager had to do. But if that is the level of management at a new facility they need a new manager immediately.

I am so happy that we were able to work things out with your insurance, so that you can continue your dental treatment. Thank you also for coming in and talking to me. Great to see you again!!\n\nHi Jesse. I am sorry that you are having problems with YOUR insurance company. I have many, many patients with BC/BS insurance whose services are paid for by BC/BS. Please know that with BC/BS there are many, many benefit levels on these individual plans. These plans are elected and paid for by your employer or yourself but reimbursed at different rates. The higher the premium results in better coverage. We have found that some plans pay very well while others cause the patient to pay more in principle than what is actually received as a benefit. Due to the confusion and the large number of insurance plans we call the insurance company as a courtesy to verify coverage for all new patients before seating them for treatment. With the information given to us from an insurance company like BC/BS we quote patient portions and offer advice to maximize benefits, but we can only be as accurate as the information that is given to us. Unfortunately, in this healthcare business there are times that claims are denied. Insurance companies are in business to be profitable for their investors. Usually, with additional patient information, documentation, charting and pictures that we obtain on your first visit, the claim can be refiled once we know why the claim was denied in the first place. If you bring your Explanation of Benefits to the office next week, I personally will help you resolve this so that you may be reimbursed or I will offer a refund that resulted from any error made by my office. I look forward to hearing from you next week. Sincerely, Ren\u00e9 A. Talbot, DDS (256)881-8181"}, "gmap_id": "0x88626cb0df2ccd01:0x8b39f086a9aaa930"}

I'm not one to write bad reviews on businesses but, I think someone needs to say something about this place.\n\nI went to Aspen Dental in Madison with a brown spot on my tooth thinking it was a cavity. I went through their free exam and X-rays. They found that I had periodontal disease as well, which did turn out to be true.\n\nThe dentist, either inexperienced or dishonest, told me that my \"cavity\" was too close to the gum line to drill and that I would need to have a crown put on (roughly $1,200). She also recommended about $6,000 worth of other work.\n\nI have no insurance and the financing person couldn't work with me due to my low income. I left depressed thinking that my mouth was really messed up and that I needed more work than I could ever afford. Thankfully, I got a second opinion.\n\nThe second dentist I went to took an X-ray, and looked at my tooth. He informed me that I did have periodontal disease and needed a deep cleaning but, that the brown spot that \"Doctor A\" wanted to put a $1,200 crown on was not a cavity or even decay. I had my first deep cleaning session and the spot (\"cavity\") came right off. Again, I'm not dentist but, I'm pretty sure cavities don't just come off.\n\nI thought about just letting this go and not saying anything about it but, I wonder how many people have been screwed over by this business.\n\nMy thoughts are that Madison is a fairly wealthy city and most people have insurance or the money for dental work so, they take the recomendations of an \"expert\" without a second thought.

From the moment your name is called until you exit the front door someone in that building is trying to sell you something. I had 4 different people try to sell me a $200 toothbrush with a $30 mail in rebate. Both the hygenist and dentist were talking and selling other dental procedures but did not discuss what I came in for.\n\nI went to Aspen Dental for tooth pain and wanted the tooth extracted. I asked before making the appointment if this was a type of procedure they'd do. They said yes. So I made an appointment. I showed up and everyone had a fake plastic smile as if we were playing We Happy Few (Google it). I felt so out of place. When I was finally seen the dental hygenist looked at my teeth for about 10 to 15 minutes then spent 30 to 45 minutes talking about how deep of a cleaning I needed, how much everything was going to cost, how important doing that there was, then pushed how they could do it now and it was only $93 (which I found out later was NOT true. It was in total $186). I declined and mentioned my pain and tooth extraction. She brought up that tooth brush and rebate and I had to listen to another 10 minute talk. Then the dentist came in. Another 10 minutes of poking and proding my teeth with a huge fake We Happy Few smile followed by a 45 minute conversation about MORE treatments I needed and AGAIN WITH THE DANG TOOTHBRUSH! I mentioned my tooth and pain again and she replied with \"Oh no I have to refer you to an oral surgeon. Sorry.\" Why couldn't you just say that!? Why did you have to talk for over 30 minutes about all this other junk while Im sitting there nearly in tears from pain as you sell?\n\nNow, let's talk billing. After all those sales pitches you're sent to billing where someone talks forever about payment plans and the debt you have in dental work. Mind you, NONE OF THIS COVERED WHY I WAS THERE! They hardly wanted to talk about my pain or the extraction I asked for. Just how they wanna fill and clean and polish all my other teeth. I felt trapped. Not to mention they \"referred me\" to someone in Birmingham with the billing guy \"texting him and taking pics of my xrays\". Felt VERY under the table black market because I asked twice for his information and both times I was told \"Oh if you want an appointment we can do it for you and text you the way to get there and stuff.\" Wouldnt even tell me his name or phone number. VERY sketchy.\n\nLater on, I felt uncomfortable about this \"Birmingham guy\" and the $350 extraction he wanted to do and how he wanted to use gas, which I did not want because Ive heard bad horror stories about it, so I asked for them to send me my xrays because I wanted to show them to my local dentist. That's when the real moods kicked in. The friendly atmosphere was gone. They wanted no part in sharing my medical records with myself. Before they were \"willing to send them anywhere\" and were texting them to strangers I didnt even know! Now they decline. I was told if I wanted them I had to go get them or I could just go get new xrays. I told them I did not want to be exposed to radiation again for no logical reason so I would go get them. So I did. Drove 40 min back and was given ONE of my twelve or so xrays. ONE! No fake smiles or sales pitches this time though! Just a lot of eye rolling and weird stares.\n\nIn conclusion, they are so happy to get you in there and they flood you with information and dental work with very little processing time. Now, Im not afraid of dentists but this place got me nervous and scared. It wasnt the physical look of the place. It wasn't rude treatment. It was the huge fake smiles and how the whole time you felt like a cash cow they just wanted to milk for money.\n\nTL;DR: All fake smiles and the entire process was a sales pitch, didn't care for my actual problem. Just wanted to sell me $1800 in dental work that had nothing to do with my original issue and a $200 tooth brush. Very reluctant to give me my own records and made the process a hassle. Overall, do NOT recommend this place.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886269801f64b7ef:0x9513b99ee93c25a9"}

Even after my procedure, the staff follow-up was incredible. I asked them to follow up one month later to talk about the outstanding treatment plan, and they called exactly 30 days later.

You are kept fully aware through every single step of the procedures so much that they are actually teaching you about your teeth. You are encouraged to ask questions along the way so you can fully understand and deepen your learning for proactive care in the future. Rhonda was fantastic at facilitating this.

Well let me tell you the receptionist is nice and caring she was consistently staying on top of everything. She was making sure the patients that were on the move up list were able to get moved up as soon as there was an opening.\nI had an appointment a month out to get my wisdom tooth pulled, but I was assured if there was an opening available she would call and let me know.

I felt like the entire staff weren't nice to do their \"job\" but they were nice because they are good people. They were also very nice to my baby I brought with me.

I have been hurting. They did the xrays and exam. We went over the cost of my options. One over 8,000 and one to get them pulled over 1,000. They wanted me to get a deep clean before any work was done too that's 265 I think. So this was on Thursday and around Tuesday one of the teeth started hurting so bad ...I can't eat...hard to drink anything. The pain is very bad. I called on Thursday I told them what was going on ...ask if they could at least for now pull it. I could pay for it. I would worry about the others later when my insurance will pay. I was told they couldn't work me in until the 24th now this is the 6...so I said I can't wait that long I am in serve pain. She told me that's best they could do.I said what am I suppose to do? They told me to go to the ER or call around. NOW IS THE WAY THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE ME? NO THIS IS SO WRONG. I GUESS MY CASH ISNT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM. I HAD 3 PEOPLE THAT WANTED TO GO THERE AND ASK ME ABOUT THEM I TOLD THEM DONT GO THERE....GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. I HAVE WRITTEN A LETTER TO MAIN OFFICE. THIS IS DISCRIMINATION IN MY EYES.

Very pleased that I was able to get in three weeks ahead of when I had initially scheduled on the 28th, but not so pleased about the wait. I also liked how I was able to come in later rather than first thing in the morning. I read the other reviews before posting this and do not understand the last review about Mrs. Jessica having an awful attitude. She went above and beyond to make me comfortable with bringing me water, helping fill out paperwork on the Apple as I forgot my glasses, and even getting me a blanket once we were in the room as they keep it frigid inside. We had a lovely chat and she even let me show her pictures and made me feel at ease as I told her I have an awful fear of the dentist. I did not like when they took my xray as they kept jamming it into my mouth and the girl doing it seemed very annoyed and like she would rather be elsewhere. I heard her talking negative about other patients with another girl in scrubs while she was doing my xrays as well which makes me wonder what they said about me and my silly fears. She left me in the room for over an hour waiting for the dentist, and the girl at the front came and checked on me more than the xray girl in scrubs did. I enjoyed meeting with the hygienist I belive her name was Miranda as she explained everything I needed done and was very understanding about my fears. She even spoke to me about possibly numbing it before she did any work which definitely makes me feel like I found the right place. The dentist Dr. Ebby was very kind and had kind eyes. He seemed to genuinely care and made jokes to make me feel more at ease once we were in the room. I\u2019m sure he has a nice smile but I couldn\u2019t see with the mask on. He was definitely better than my last dentist who didn\u2019t care about people of my age and only want money. He seemed to want to help me get what was best for me and not drain the little savings I have left. When i spoke about the money to man at the end named Austin he was an absolute sweetheart. I have never met someone so understanding and kind, and he even went out of his way to give me more adorable options and let me take up so much of his time just to make sure I would be able to afford what I need. He gave me his personal office number and told me to call him with any questions. I learned later from the front girl he was the office manager and I find it so refreshing that an office manager is willing to spend that much time with a woman like me to make sure I\u2019m taken care of. The level of care I received was unbelievable and I truly feel like I found a place where I am cared for and taken care of financially and healthily.

They were right on top of serious issues and I could not be more thrilled!!  They have a lifelong patient\n\nMy first review (above) still stands.  It is now months later and I have my final dentures. Dr. Abtin Iranmanesh is the consummate professional with a very big heart and compassionate  side. When I first net him, I had been the victim of extreme dental malpractice from another local so-called dental franchise. I was in dire shape. Dr. Iranmanesh 'took me under his wing' and today I am finished with my treatment plan, out of pain and have a beautiful smile. I could not be more pleased with my outcome. Many others in that office have been very kind and helpful as well. When I first started treatment at this office, it was brand new and barely established. I received a lot of personal attention and there was no issue getting the needed appointments. I do miss that part. Their popularity has grown along with the number of patients. That is a great thing for the business but not so for the patients unfortunately. I guess I was spoiled in the beginning.  However, Dr. Iranmanesh has always made sure I was well taken care of and given the best treatment available.

The pain persisted after placing the permanent crown (on the second try, and it still did not look great on the X-ray).  I gave up on you as a dentist after the third or fourth bite-adjustment that did not solve the problem.  On the most recent visit (after my new dentist told me to go back to the person who placed the crown to get it re-done), you said that this crown is \"perfect\" and told me to go to an endodontist.  You also mentioned that you had told me before that the root could be damaged from previous tooth decay - you had not told me this about this specific tooth in the past, only a different tooth on which you had already performed a root canal.  According to the endodontist that did perform a root canal, the roots were in good shape - there is a crack in my tooth underneath the crown, which was the source of pain whenever debris got in the crack and irritated the root.  Whether this crack was because of a poor bite when I first got the crown or something else, I guess I'll never know.\n\nZero Stars: You lied to me.  I am listing several instances here, in no particular order:\n\n1.  As I already mentioned, you did not discuss this tooth and its root with me in the past as you stated at the most recent visit.  The assistant at that visit even looked for it in the chart notes and could not find it .\n\n2.  After the insurance claim for the crown was denied the final time, I asked you about the dentist's narrative on why it was necessary that should have been included in the files that were sent to the insurance.  You said you typed a full page for this, your receptionist said it was a few lines handwritten.  Neither of you could find a copy to provide to me.  When I was filing the appeal to the insurance company a few months prior, I asked if there was a narrative, and was not made aware that such a thing existed.  One or both of you lied directly to my face.\n* If you did not file anything because I was on the \"patient appreciation plan\" which states that you won't file insurance while I'm on it, you could have told me that and I would not have had an issue.  This was why I filed insurance on my own after paying you for the procedure, expecting them to reimburse me the covered percentage of what I paid; admittedly, I did not realize the amount of paperwork and effort needed for this.  Instead your office told me that you did file all the needed paperwork, which the insurance company never received.\n\n3.  I'm not even convinced that this crown was necessary (and there apparently is no narrative to state that it was).  Your office seems to put a higher priority on crowns and other high-dollar work than on fillings, which seems backwards to me as I would think that you would want to do a filling as soon as you find it so the tooth does not get bad enough to need a crown.  Another tooth of mine which you said would need a crown (which I never got from you because the pain on the other side of my mouth never stopped) currently has a filling from my new dentist.\n\n4.  You said an endodontist can remove and save the old crown to place it back on later.  This is incorrect, both endodontists I visited stated that they drill through the crown to perform the root canal.  This may not have been intentional, but I'm counting it as another lie.\n\n5.  After I got the root canal, some porcelain chipped off of another surface of the crown.  I called your office to ask about what material the base metal is (and if I should worry about corrosion) and was told that ALL the crowns you perform are pure zirconium and not porcelain-on-metal.  When I asked how that could be if mine clearly has exposed metal, the person on the phone got quite defensive ... like accusations of lying (perhaps not unfounded) is a common phenomenon.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1600008293148, "text": "David, I'm sorry you are unhappy. I do hope you at least realize we tried our best to provide all the Care that we could. If you don't mind, as you leave us one star would you mind elaborating on what you wish we had done better? That would be helpful for me and anyone reading this. However, respecting your privacy, I don't want to elaborate on what I think your experience may have been.\n\nUpdate: David, I am so happy that you have found a new dentist with a relationship that you have confidence and Trust in! Thank you for taking the time to share this with me.  It will do neither you nor I any good for me to make a defense of the experiences that we had together.

And I'm not a relative, I swear.\nI live in Austin Texas and was visiting Huntsville and had a dental emergency. My crown post broke and I was left without a front tooth. I went to Dr. Cook for options and after extensive discussion decided to put a new post in and a temporary crown so my dentist at home could then replace the temporary with a new crown. But when Dr Cook got into the process he discovered an old-school resin that had been used  to fill the root canal and determined that the chances of success for a new crown were significantly reduced. Rather than continuing with the new post, he simply glued the old crown back in place and suggested that I discuss my options with my dentist at home. Wow... He had the opportunity to charge me for a new post that probably would have been unsuccessful but instead was honest and told me that I would probably need an implant.\nPatient before profits. For me this is something significant and something I was extremely impressed by. On top of all of that, the office was friendly, extremely organized, and seamless throughout the entire process.

My cleaning was amazing, Roxy is one of the nicest people I've ever met. I very recently had my wisdom teeth removed and I felt no pain and didn't even need to take pain medicine afterwards. I used sedation for this and I didn't have an ounce of anxiety before, during, or after. The office is very focused on what your goals are with your smile as well as keeping your mouth healthy.\nI would recommend Divine Expressions to anybody that is searching for a dentist, I actually look forward to dental appointments here!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1622563987636, "text": "Thank you for your kind words, Kiahna!

I had called several times both to my other providers as well as here to organize everything before I arrived, several weeks in advance. They just dropped the ball and claimed they were having internet issues, which is just a lousy excuse easily remedied in a day, not one that takes weeks to resolve. I won't likely be returning, because even though I had the electronic referral done via my physician and got their information from my insurance, Blue Cross Blue Shield, they don't accept Blue Cross Blue Shield, because they don't have the software to bill to medical insurance.

I have never had a bad experience at a dentist office before. I first thought it was weird that they were begging for 5 star reviews when i first started going here. That explains where a lot of these reviews came from.\n\nOn each visit I felt like it was more about up-selling you on the products they offer than focusing on my actual teeth. They were always mentioning teeth whitening, special mouth wash, special tooth paste etc. I am in the sales world so I get it, but don't be pushy. You can usually tell when a person is uncomfortable about the topics. Which I was.\n\nI received a quote for invisalign about a year ago, and decided to save. They quoted me 1800ish without insurance for that visit. Then this past visit they quoted me 3,325 after my insurance pays 1000. I thought that was a bit dramatic increase especially since my insurance now covers a grand.\n\nI go to my dentist every 6 months. I might go two months over, due to work scheduling, but I go regularly. I've never had cavity problems so 8 months ago when I was told I had 6 I almost fainted. I actively brush my teeth and floss multiple times a day. My family and friends make fun of how cautious I am when it comes to my oral health. I want to keep my teeth so I do care for them.  I was told I didn't floss enough and that I needed to start when I asked how it was possible to have 6 cavities. I felt like i was being degraded.  So I started brushing 3Xs daily and flossing after every meal. When I came back 8 months later (2 months over because of a work scheduling issue)  I had 4 more. Only then when I almost started to cry did the Dr. ask about my medical history. I have severe acid re-flux. Apparently that can cause the cavity issue. He then up-sales me on some ORA-Care mouth wash and told me to use it until my next visit. When I return to the next visit if I have additional cavities we will re-evaluate. I'm not sure that I would want to wait another 6 months to see if i get additional cavities even while using the mouth wash.\n\nWhen I went to schedule my filling appointment they told me I had to pay a percentage of the $250 cost before they scheduled me. I told them that I didn't have the money even though I did, and decided right then I would go back to Dr. Sonja Gill's office.\n\nI felt this office is only concerned about the money that goes into their pocket. I get businesses have to make money, but I have never not paid them. Even when I missed an appointment I paid them a $55 no show fee with no hesitation. I felt like I was their personal ATM.\n\nI will never go back to this practice again. I am going back to Dr. Sonja Gill where I am greeted with a smile, and they don't hold out their hand for your credit card every time you walk through the door.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1583345035967, "text": "We apologize and will be contacting you to see how we can make it better for you."}, "gmap_id": "0x886268e976bb6b43:0x3c4d92c0b50a4a2c"}

Content with the service, I decided to have Divine Expressions as my primary and only dental care. And for the most part, it was good. The staff are incredibly friendly, extremely accommodating and very gentle during each cleaning. Not to mention the breathtaking, home magazine worthy office.\n\nWhere it pains me to write is related to Dr. Laurentis Barnett's procedures. Every procedure that dealt with a crown of some sort, always came off. It resulted in me either having to leave work early, take an extended lunch, take a day off and/or come back multiple times that same week. While the staff and Dr. Barnett was very accommodating and flexible with scheduling, the process were still very inconvenient. A particular case was getting an implant for one of my teeth. For starters, the tooth itself was shaped very oddly. It did not look or feel like a normal tooth. It also always popped off, even though the office used dental cement.\n\nWith every visit to either add or replace, I never received an answer as to why this kept happening. Dr. Laurentis also hinted that it was possibly my fault that the tooth kept coming off. I'm not opposed to thinking that I could've been doing something wrong, but after speaking with friends and colleagues with dental implants and explaining to them my daily routine and lifestyle, I was suggested to get an second opinion from another dental professional.\n\nI sought treatment elsewhere and unfortunately had to pay for another tooth implant. The implant printed from Divine Expressions leaves my new dental office with many questions as they have never seen such an odd shaped \"tooth\". My current implant from my new dentist has been in my mouth for nearly 2 months. I had not returned once for a re-application.\n\nThe purpose of this post is not to defame or deface Dr. Laurentis Barnett, it is simply to write a review I felt needed to be written.

However, I am not pleased with the run around I received as if I didn't know what I was talking about. Every time I called the office in reference to the same tooth/problem I always explained in detail what my concerns were. I repeatedly went in and each time you would think I was a new patient. I saw 4 different dental assistants and none of them had a clue as to why I was there. They didn't even know which tooth that I had a root canal on in there office just 1 month prior (this happened twice). One time I called, I was asked what the doctor told me on the last visit I went in.....this is disturbing considering they should keep record of what the doctor says each visit and overall what is actually going on. Also, it would seem smart to keep record of what a patient says for the reason they are needing to see the doctor again so that there is an overall knowledge with other office staff on the situation/patient. I was always greeted by a friendly smile (wish I could remember her name) but once I got behind the door everything seemed surfaced even with Dr Barnette.

He's definitely the best dentist I've ever had in my life. He's one of the top dentists in the state of Virginia and I say that without hesitation. He truly enjoys his craft and has a passion for teaching others about the dentistry profession (he's won a ton of awards). Personally--I don't even need to see the awards to know that he's an outstanding dentist. The rest of the staff there are friendly and are excellent about answering any questions and keeping you at ease in the dental chair. Dr. Vega and his staff's strengths have an outstanding ability to remain unflappable during procedures. I was incredibly impressed when Dr. Vega did a root canal resection on me at his previous practice. Dr. Sauls & Dr. Vega form one of the better tandems of dentistry in the Commonwealth and the Madison area should feel extremely lucky to have not only two outstanding people--but outstanding dentists as well. I'd recommend Dr. Vega to my own family--and I actually have. I've got nothing but fantastic things to say about the staff and I will be a Madison Family Dentistry patient as long as I can find employment in the Charlottesville area for the remainder of my life.

They have transformed my smile and health! Fast forward to now, my dental health is much better and I\u2019m way more proud of my smile! Not only was I so impressed with this dental practice that I have maintained my dental visits, but I also was so inspired by this team that I joined the team and am now currently a dental assistant with Wall Street!

They said I needed a special kind of deep cleaning instead of just a normal cleaning which is fine and great until I was informed that the special deep cleaning was going to cost me over me $200! With my dental insurance 2 cleanings and X-rays are included with my dental insurance at no cost to me as preventive care.  When the dentist told me that she wanted me to get a special kind deep cleaning I figured it was covered under one of my cleanings.  I had no idea that particular cleaning was going to cost me over $200.  So when the office manager made me aware that when I came back in for that kind of cleaning I would need to be prepared to pay over $200 because it wasn\u2019t considered preventive care but basic care because it was a deep cleaning.  I told her that wasn\u2019t explained to me an I wanted to change my treatment plan back to just a normal cleaning.  The office manger said that the treatment plan couldn\u2019t be changed without the dentist approval so she went an asked the dentist.  The dentist refused to change the treatment plan to just a normal cleaning.  At first I thought well maybe I am in need of the special kind of deep cleaning until I sought a second opinion from someone in the periodontal field and they informed me that a normal cleaning would suffice just fine.  So, with that being said I feel like they were trying to upsell me especially since they refused to do any kind of cleaning unless I agreed to pay over $200 for the deep clean! I had to make another appointment with another dentist so I could get the care I need.  More of my time spent on something I had already done.  This whole situation stinks and should be unacceptable!  Dental health is so expensive and stuff like this just makes it more difficult!

After waiting around 30 minutes after receiving x-rays, they came in and informed me that my teeth looked great with ZERO cavities. The lady who cleans teeth came in and looked at my teeth and said that I had some kind of bacteria (I don't know how in the world you can determine by looking at teeth what kind of bacteria they have without placing under a microscope). I said okay when can you clean my teeth? She said she would be right back that she would get it set up. While waiting patiently, I hear her in another room telling someone else they have the same kind of bacteria and would need advance cleaning. After waiting they informed me that my teeth would need an advance cleaning and it would cost $281 to have my teeth cleaned after my insurance (MY INSURANCE COVERS 100% of basic care including cleanings). Basically, for first appointments and cleanings, they tell all of their patients the same thing to try and drag as much money out as possible. After this I was not going to post a review, but I decided to go with another dentist and have called them 5 times to have my x-rays emailed, but they keep insisting that they have emailed them, but have not. They are completely dishonest and are trying to charge almost $300 for a teeth cleaning that shouldn't be over $50-$100. Please save your money and go somewhere else. I asked, \"Can I not just receive a regular teeth cleaning that my insurance company covers?\". They explained company policy that they are not allowed to give regular teeth cleanings for first visits, so basically they lie and tell everyone they have some kind of bacteria.

Since I\u2019d been in last December, they have new doctors and I wasn\u2019t aware, which is fine. However, I\u2019ve had fillings done and the new doctors have no record of the last filling that I had and are wanting to fill and make me repay for a tooth even after it\u2019s already been filled. I feel as if they\u2019re trying to make me think I\u2019m crazy when I know for a fact that I went in to have that specific tooth filled. When I asked them what was it I paid for then, they told me they didn\u2019t know because they weren\u2019t there at that time. So in their minds, there was a doctor messing around in my mouth, telling me he was filling a tooth when he really didn\u2019t? They are also saying I have another cavity that I wasn\u2019t aware I had (they didn\u2019t find it this time, apparently it\u2019s been there sometime but I\u2019m assuming the previous doctors didn\u2019t tell me or it\u2019s not true??). Aspen was fine when I first went to them a little over a year ago but I feel that they have become very unprofessional. I don\u2019t understand how they can just tell patients that they didn\u2019t have a specific work done just because there\u2019s no record of it because they changed doctors. I will not be paying twice for work that I know for a fact that I had done. I will be finding a new dentist that doesn\u2019t have multiple doctors in and out. Dr. A at Aspen informed that I would see doctors come and go from there and I\u2019d much rather be at a facility that has the same doctor(s) so that I don\u2019t have this unprofessionalism.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88628463523227ed:0x8447a88b234254c5"}

Fast forward and I begin to have issues with the tooth that had the root canal. I call the Decatur office (I now live closer to this location, unfortunately) and specifically ask if they will be able to address an issue that another location serviced. The office manager encourages me to come to their office for the issue. A month goes by and it is the day of my appointment. I call and ask if I may come in early since I finished up with work early. The receptionist puts me on hold to speak with the office manager.(DUM, DUM, DUM...*music fit for a villain begins to play**not really, but it should have*) He begins to say that they can't work on the issue and I would need to visit the Aspen Dental location that completed the root canal. ( If you're reading this Greg, in the future you might want to do your research about your company's policies before wasting another person's time) The office manager goes on to tell me that he called and left a voicemail yesterday to tell me all of this information. And I told him that I didn't have a missed call or voicemail from him. And that I thought it was ironic that the other five calls that we exchanged a month ago were never missing from my phone. Only now that I explain that I am irritated that when I called a month ago he gave me a different answer are his call and voicemail from yesterday \"magically\" absent from my phone. He proceeds to say, \"well I know for a fact that I called and left a voicemail.\" To which I respond, \" I know for a fact that I don't have a missed call or voicemail. He then laughs sarcastically. So I told him, \" since he thought it was appropriate to speak to me that way then I decided to respond in the same manor.\" And the conversation ends with him telling me that they will not ever see me in their office. If I could give zero stars, I would. If he would have just apologized and not smarted off, I would have been understanding. Extremely horrible experience.

If you are thinking this dentist is good because he has 100+ positive reviews then you are WRONG! What him and his staff do: As soon as you go in for a cleaning they ask you to fill out a online survey about Dr. Krempa and yes hygienists do a good job cleaning your teeth and are super sweet, which is why everyone leaves good reviews BUT the minute you go back for actual dental work you'll realize he overbooks his patients and then RUSHES THROUGH dental procedures trying to get to everyone.  He did 3 filings on my 3 teeth and was done in 30 mins.  Maybe you are thinking \"that's great\" but you are WRONG! He left me with teeth that felt like shark teeth because he did not smoothen them out after the feelings.  I went and saw another dentist who said Dr. Krempa did a bad job leaving me with such unfinished work that I pretty much wasn't able to floss my teeth. I could go on by telling you more,  but I believe that this is enough info.

As I was reaching out to friends, family and acquaintances for help Dr. Beitel's name kept frequently coming up. My husband called our pediatrician asking about Dr.Beitel and the staff called back telling us they loved him.  Dr. Beitel's office was so helpful, courteous and caring from the moment I called. They were so very understanding of  the situation we found ourselves in with a retired dentist, our sons accident and no dentist. They got Christian in that morning to see Dr. Beitel. Brandy, the dental assistant was so good and caring with him and really made Christian feel very comfortable. Dr. Caroline Beitel, Dr. Beitle's daughter, was the dentist who took care of Christian. She was very patient and kind with Christian and was able to also repair the tooth that day. Dr. Caroline was courteous toward the support staff and she and Brandy worked together well as a team. They both kept talking and cutting up with Christian. Honestly my son was so happy with them that he kept telling everyone after we left how great those two ladies were. Needless to say my husband and I think they are great and both our sons have found a great new father daughter team who are great with kids.

My older daughter who is 5 had to have 2 fillings on her 2 front teeth about 8 months ago, one tooth was chipped a little bit, but other than that we haven\u2019t had to have any other work done on their teeth, and they had no cavities at their recent check up/cleaning\ud83d\ude0a I was terrified for my daughter to have those two fillings done\nand so was she. It\u2019s something I hope we don\u2019t have to do often or ever again so we BRUSH BRUSH BRUSH & FLOSS FLOSS FLOSS, but Dr Beitel did a FANTASTIC job at making her feel safe and he made her 2 front teeth look amazing, like they never had a cavity and like that one was never even chipped. I wish I had a before and after picture, because he did great! I\u2019m sure he's done much bigger things that are also amazing but I wasn\u2019t expecting for her two front teeth to look that good. Both of my girls still have all of their baby teeth, but we look forward to seeing Dr Beitel and his daughter for many many many more years to come!! We have only saw his daughter once, at our recent 6 month cleaning, and she was very nice! Last time I wrote a review this long I jinxed myself lol, so let\u2019s hope everything continues to great with Dr Brian Beitel :)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88621322b8d12b4d:0xd4b222525142f9b2"}

Dr. Brewer has been my only dentist since I have been an adult and he has done an amazing job. When I stopped going to my childhood dentist at around 18 years old I didn't start going to another dentist. I had some bad habits and didn't brush my teeth as I should have. At age 21 I went to Dr. Brewer at Double Oak Family Dentistry because I had a toothache. He told me that my teeth were in really bad shape and that it would take a lot of time, work, and better personal care on my part to get everything under control. So after 10 years of teeth cleanings, root canals, crowns, and prescription toothpaste my mouth is in good condition...no bridges, no implants, and only one tooth had to be pulled. I couldn't be happier with the professionalism from Dr. Brewer as well as the staff. I would recommend this dental office to anyone who was looking for a good dentist.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888916089395ae63:0xae9bd29d09322e43"}

When I returned home I made an appointment with a DIFFERENT dentist office to have the tooth/filling looked at - the filling was cracked and missing parts in 3 places and when this new dentist started taking it out - it was obvious that the filling material never set up properly as the filling was soft.

I went to them initially to have an annual checkup and to have a chip/break in my front tooth repaire.  The repair they made looked fine but only  lasted less a few weeks.  Then the dentist recommended that I get a crown.  My tooth was prepared and they took molds of my teeth for the crown and supposedly  did a color match (WRONG).  When the tooth came back it was the wrong color.  But the temporary tooth that was put on in it's place fell out the first day.  No adhesive was applied.  The  doctor left before the temporary was placed in my mouth and the technician who put it in obviously used no glue.  I did not go back for them to glue the temporary (my fault/busy schedule).  I just persevered until the crown came in,  When the first crown came in it was too long and the wrong color.  So it had to be sent back for a color change and to be  shorten.  I received another temporary tooth.   Well the doctor put on another temporary this time and  he really glued it on.  He glued it on with an adhesive that obviously was WRONG for a temporary because they could not easily remove it.  The next dentist I saw had to drill the temporary tooth off.  Then the second crown again was the wrong color (WRONG AGAIN!).  Another temporary was made and put on.   So now I am waiting for the crown (Third time) and hoping it is the right color.  In the meantime the temporary I had fell off while I was eating a salad a few days ago and is broken and can no longer be used to hide the ugly tooth stub.  I have this HIDEOUS gap and STUB of a tooth in the front of my mouth.   I have had so much anxiety regarding this dental situation and no resolution in sight for a few more days. This is not a matter of insurance, nor a matter of money...I have both and have paid in full my co-pay for this procedure.  It is a matter of good dental service of which I have yet to receive.  After the first two disastrous  appointments and having not received a crown that matches and is acceptable I  am very disappointed and disgusted with ASPEN Dental.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a43ea0834b16b:0x5e04b49f782ae262"}

But, felt it was important because people so easily post negative vs positive. Dr. Walker and his staff went above and beyond to meet my dental needs. I previously worked as a dental assistant while I was paying my way through college. So, I know a bit more than the average patient. I have to say that Dr Walker is far above average in his skill and chair-side manner. I had to have an extraction of #18. I never felt the injections.  And the actual extraction was done with speed and ease.  I hardly had any bleeding. I have assisted on many ,so I was prepared for the stress and pressure that one typically feels. Experience none of that with Dr. Walker.  A couple weeks later, I lost a significant portion of an old amalgam filling on#32. Yet, another difficult tooth position. Dr Walker was aware that I did not want to extract the tooth.  But, could not afford a crown at that particular time. Therefore, Dr. Walker spent extra time diligently repairing the tooth so that I wouldn't lose it. As previously  stated, it's  been about a year and 3 month and the tooth is still holding steady. Dr Walker is a brilliant Dentist with a kind heart. A combination not often found. Not to mention he makes you feel comfortable. As if you've been friends for years. In sum, He's as good as it gets. Aspen Dental and the Florence/Athens AL area are fortunate to have Dr Walker.  If he moves, I will travel to receive his care.  He took the time to earn my trust and respect.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1597439850243, "text": "It's so nice to hear that, Angela.

I experienced horrendous wisdom teeth pain and had put off having them removed because I  have no dental insurance and an extreme anxiety toward needles going into my mouth. The pain got so bad that I ended up in the ER, which resulted in my having no choice but to get them out. I called Aspen Dental and they were so kind and helpful! They allowed me to set up an easy finance plan. They got me an appointment quickly. I had the x rays to be examined and the technician was so helpful by talking to me to make the long process of taking so many pictures go by super fast. I had an initial cleaning with a Mrs. Norma, whose vibrant smile and personality made me feel welcome and calmed my nerves tremendously.  During the cleaning they discovered I had gingivitis and they gave me a full treatment. They helped me get an Oral B toothbrush with Bluetooth capabilities and different modes for brushing and cleaning my teeth on my own. Mrs. Norma took time to give me tips on how to floss better so that I can prevent getting gingivitis again. When it came time to have my surgery, Dr. Perry helped my nerves by telling me what he was doing, when he was doing and why. Dr. Perry took time and didn't rush the process. The dental assistant that day was Mrs. Kourtney. I'll never forget how she kept me calm by reassuring me that I would be fine. She said being nervous was ok and normal. She kept telling me I was doing great. I don't think she knows how much I needed that. She kept my mouth suctioned, which I really liked because I have a tendency to have a gag reflex and that prevented it. Dr. Perry earned my trust and respect especially when he made the decision to divide my surgery in half. He did the left side, then had me wait two weeks for the other because he was concerned about my being able to eat comfortably. When he did the right side, he was assisted by a trainee who was kind also and attentive to my needs. If she continues to do as she did, she will be great! Overall, they really are a great place to go for dental needs. Even though I didn't need to use him, it also felt good knowing they have an oral surgeon with their office too. They will now be my go to for dental work! Thank you Aspen Dental!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1581367889410, "text": "I'm happy to hear that you felt comfortable with the team, Mary!

I, personally, have suffered from depression and anxiety for a large part of my life, as well as adolescent gran-mal seizures since I was fifteen years old. The seizures prevent me from being able to drive a car, which prevents me from from being able to get to and from a workplace easily.\nLacking regular funds/insurance coverage, and being anxious and depressed did lead to my neglecting my dental health, which simply exacerbated my anxiety. I suffered a huge panic attack after encountering some (actually relatively minor) dental pain a few days ago. I made an appointment at Aspen Dental for the next morning, which was impressively easy to do online and your staff here at Cox Creek Pkwy did not disappoint me whatsoever; service was extremely professional. Dr. Konradi and the dental hygienist couldn't have done a better job at reassuring me that my shortcomings can be overcome.\nMy blood pressure at the time was apparently extremely high, most likely a result of the panic attack I suffered the night before, compounded by a minor fever and a lack of sleep. I took my blood pressure this morning and it has thankfully returned to a normal level (111 over 76). I have already purchased the recommended electric toothbrush and a new pro-gum-health toothpaste. I have been instilled with a strong sense of hope already and I have no doubt anymore that I am capable of restoring my dental health.

Wouldn\u2019t u be shaky with someone like that??? He basically told her that her certificate she got hurt her more than helped. Now after years of wanting to be an assistant and go into dental hygiene she says she doesn\u2019t want to because she feels like she can\u2019t do it. He basically ruined her dream. I don\u2019t feel like u should treat ur employees like that. We should uplift and not tear people down and ruin what they wanted to do with their life. He should have never hired her if he didn\u2019t want to teach. His assistant would also yell at her and told her that\u2019s how u learn. The assistant also told her to do something wrong and she got blamed so she told him it wasn\u2019t her. We was told this was the real reason he let her go.

She made me feel so relaxed, like we were old friends! She made the root canal experience almost fun if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that i was there for a root canal! Dr. English made me feel as comfortable as I could have felt in an uncomfortable situation.

Not until i take off work and get back in office, I am now told im out of network and owe a bill. I'm a bill for what he did absolutely nothing. Im taking this issue to the BBB because they tying to put the charge on my credit", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626898d2e3a36d:0x2edc316b6e854265"}

Dr English and his ENTIRE staff are the most professional, kind, knowledgeable, and compassionate people I've encountered in my life! No lie, I'm a complete wimp when it comes to dentistry. I've suffered from dental anxiety all of my life. I've always opted for extractions over getting a filling, and i had to be put under anesthesia first. I was a true phobic, until yesterday. The second his staff called to confirm my appointment, i truly felt in her voice that i wasn't just some faceless voice over the phone. She was so genuine and could relate to my fears. Upon arrival, i was continously greeted by the most beautiful, empathetic, professional staff. Every single person was not only physically beautiful, but genuinely beautiful from the soul. Now, you can't learn that. Thats something thats ingrained deep within and it simply flows out when you're doing something you love.  I don't know about y'all,  but I've literally been around the world and unequivocally, I've yet to frequent an establishment where EVERYONE makes you feel, like you're the only person there! Got my teeth cleaned and didn't feel a thing! She was AMAZING! Never has this happened before, to me. My gums normally hurt for a few days. Yesterday, Dr English took my hand and he promised me that my procedures this morning wouldn't hurt. I was so very skeptical. When i walked in, i felt like a jitterbug! I was literally having a secret panic attack. Well, Dr. English and his staff had me covered. When i say, \"yo, it didn't hurt\"...what I mean is, \"it really didn't hurt!\" At one point, i felt a little pressure, but he was all over it in 2 seconds flat! Bottom line up front: Dr. English and his staff are all easy on the eyes, beautiful from the heart, extremely knowledgeable, professional,  and courteous.  I went back to work and told everyone i saw about them at Apex Dental in Madison,  Alabama! No, I'm not sponsored. Wasn't paid for this review, and my opinions are all my own. If you need quality dental work, want to experience pain free dental, and patronize an establishment that \"brings customer service back\", then look no further! They have it figured out! I love these guys! The entire staff rocks...everyone of them! Don't just take my word, please go see for yourselves.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626898d2e3a36d:0x2edc316b6e854265"}

However, when I first switched to Northcutt, it was because my previous dentist retired.  I was told that a filling I had received needed to be replaced.  I was reluctant, because it wasn't giving me any pain or problems, but I had it replaced.  After the replacement, the dentist said he needed to replace his own work (no charge)  so he did.  Then I started having a lot of pain from the 2nd replacement.  He worked on it a 3rd time.  The last time I went in, he expressed that the whole tooth needed to be crowned - lest I eventually need a full root canal.  (this time charged of course)  Needless to say, I will have to be getting a second opinion.

It was a weird experience at Aspen Dental to be sure, and I cant help but feel as if I was swindled somehow. It was the longest and most expensive dental appointment I've ever had. Being a new patient, I expected extra steps like xrays, but the whole ordeal was weird and confusing from the beginning (starting with when I tried to confirm my appointment via email, which ended up being a phone call, and none of my information was correct in their system). After an awkward xray process, I was led to a room and sat in a chair for about 30 mins. The first obvious red flag that had me wondering if I was getting the wool pulled over my eyes was the TV they stuck in my face (attached to the chair) as the tech and dentist did \"paperwork\" and talked about teeth stuff amongst themselves behind me completely out of my field of vision. Then the dentist said I had gingivitis and two cavities-- which were a complete shock to me since I've never had any in my life and was experiencing nothing unusual in my mouth during my daily life, no pain or discomfort at all. The gingivitis thing I could understand, I guess (i mean it's a reversible condition from what I understand, so I thought it was weird for them to schedule a whole multi appointment treatment process that would take place throughout the month). I dont know anything about teeth, so you could tell me to open up, poke around in there with tools, and tell me it's a whole huge dangerous mess and I'd have to believe you, because what do I know? What I do know is that the visits to my old dentist were always straight forward and I understood everything they were doing because it was clearly explained and they didn't try to schedule 3 visits in a single month. After all that waiting, tv, and a brief examination, I find myself at the cashier's desk and absolutely no work was done on my teeth. I opted out for the 130$ smart brush that was included in my bill. And then they said they could probably fit me in today for my first treatment after I paid for a large sum that was ultimately un-itemized. The paperwork I received was not a receipt for what I paid for in that moment, but a breakdown of all the work they were going to do and how much it was going to cost me later. I agreed to have the first treatment done right away. Finally, I was going to receive some sort of treatment that was physical during this visit, but I didnt truly understand what I was paying for that warranted such a large bill when I was at the cashier's office. The treatment was no different than what any other dentist would do during a routine cleaning so I'm still not sure why it was so expensive. At the end of my visit, I walked away with a lot of fancy products and with the peace of mind that I didnt have mouth cancer...so, that's a relief. The staff was super friendly and kind, and I really appreciated Loretta. She was absolutely fantastic, but I'm not sure I want to go back to this place at least two more times in a single month just to be broke and confused again. I fully understand that I am dumb, but things just didnt add up.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1570203176746, "text": "Thank you for providing this information.

I was quoted $832 by Tanietha to have two of my wisdom teeth extracted with oral surgery on 12/04/2018 and the woman sent my X-ray over to the dentist that would be doing it. And I was told by Tanietha that if they weren\u2019t able to schedule me then they would call me to reschedule. So I went ahead and paid $832 for two of my wisdom teeth to get removed with oral surgery. And it was scheduled for the very next day but I was told that I had to go to the Prattville location. My mouth was hurting so bad that I didn\u2019t mind going to get that relief.  I show up at 1:15 p.m. to my appointment that was supposed to be scheduled for 12/05/2018 at 1:45 p.m. and at first the woman couldn\u2019t find me stating that my appointment was canceled or taken off the schedule. The woman behind the receptionist spoke up because she\u2019s who the Montgomery office spoke to and said she would ask the dentist if he could do it.\nThe dentist said that he would be able to remove my teeth. So I sit down to make sure the paper work was okay and I was informed that I would have to pay an extra $850 on the spot because they would rather that I be put to sleep. I already paid in full the price that I was given without insurance and drove to the Prattville location. And I was not prepared to pay an additional extra $850 on the spot for a service that I already paid for. I just told them to refund me the money and now I have to find somewhere else because these people are not organized in the least bit. They felt more than happy to take my money but when it was time for the service...it\u2019s oh no ma\u2019am we need more money now. Ridiculous! I\u2019m still waiting on my refund now.\nI WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ASPEN DENTAL.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2c76c98bb2c5:0x4f11e77c44287aef"}

Yeah, of course so they can get more money.  They are very unprofessional,  talking about the patients in front of other patients.

From the front desk, to billing, to assistants, to the nurses....all the way to Dr. Beasley. I feel so taken care of.\nProfessionalism is the first thing you'll see and feel. Courtesy and kindness follows close the minute you walk in the door.\nI am 64 years old and I have had so much dental work done in my lifetime that I have seen it all, the good the bad and the scary. Now at my age after all that dental work I went through, because of the ageing process I was in a place I needed to have dentures.\nThe dentist that removed my compromised teeth embarrassed me so bad I went home and actually cried. And it takes a lot to make me cry. I waited a year before I finally found Dr. Beasley on-line and booked an appointment. I did a lot of searching. From the minute I walked in the door of his office until today, I have been so grateful for dentist like Dr. Beasley.\nI ended up having to have oral surgery to reshape the bone on my lower jaw so I would be able to get dentures that fit well. Dr. Beasley was able to do this in his office, with all the sedation I needed so I wouldn't feel a thing, and the staff I already trust. The cost was outrageously so minimal I don't know how he makes a profit.\n\"I FELT SO TAKEN CARE OF\"  The morning of surgery he gave me antibiotics, something I knew I would need because of other health problems but didn't have to tell him, and as I said before all the sedation I needed or wanted. After surgery I was given medication to help the healing process, prescriptions for pain meds and meds to help the swelling.\nToday I had the stitches removed in my mouth and will start the denture process. AGAIN NO PAIN!\nI have no doubt Dr. Beasley and his staff will see to it that my dentures will be the best they can possible be for me!\nIn closing let me just say, first I'm not getting paid to write this review, they don't even know I'm writing it. I just know there are a lot of people out there that are just like me who have been embarrassed about their teeth. Fear of being embarrassed kept me from getting the dental help I needed.\nDr. Beasley won't make you feel anything but...\"TAKEN CARE OF\"!\nHis staff will be professional, kind and friendly.\n\nGo online and look for his website like I did.... you'll see.\nAnd...P.S....I am a Nurse of 29 years. But No one in Dr. Beasley's office knows that and they still treated me like the kind hearted professionals they are!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88628b423e0f4e15:0x2fc9b52211125582"}

I started feeling pain from my tooth on a Monday night. I barely had any sleep from the pain. So, I looked for a dentist in Athens and found Dr. Beasley\u2019s and it was highly rate as one of the best in Athens. I went to sign in. The usual information and what I was allergic to. Then I found out that my insurance expired a few months before this. So, I had to pay all out of pocket. I got check on with the nice ten out of ten assistant. Then, Dr. Beasley came in for a few and said I need a root canal. Lucky they were able to have me in that day. I came back for the surgery; it was just like usual dentist surgery. But, at the end of the process I felt even worse than I did coming in. I was dizzy and just feeling three times worse. The doctor said that was unusual. They said get my prescription and if I still fill worse to call them in the morning. I had to go do my piano exam. So, I had to go through that in pain. I had even less sleep then the night before. On Wednesday morning I call them and they told me to get this a anabolic and to come get the prescription. I went down there and got the paper. I when to the drug store and had to wait in line with really bad pain. The people near me ask if I was okay and I had to tell them I was in pain from a dentist surgery. I help EBC Athens with the media and since I am the one that knows video editing I had to get a video done by that Sunday. I went and started to edit the nativity video wile still in more pain then it was at the beginning. Got at least a good bit out of the way. Had to use some of that Oragel. I was in so much pain I was crying and felt like I had to go to the emergency room. Still had barely any sleep. Next morning I went back up there and told them how much pain I was in. I was even cry when I went in. They checked me again and said I need another root canal because the tooth right next to it was fused to the other one.  I said okay there\u2019s not much I can do, and I was kind of annoyed because I knew that ment twice amount in the price. But I just need this pain to go away. I go through the surgery agin. They had some trouble with their x ray machine but I do not think it was their fault entirely. At the end of that surgery my nose started to bleed. And the doctor said again that\u2019s unusual. I was thinking oh no not again. We know what happened the last time he said that. So, after that I got another prescription that they gave me. But at least I was finally able to feel some relief and able to go to sleep. Finally on Friday I had a playing exam for my jazz band on my vibraphone. And I notice I was swollen from the drugs. But it started once when I took the first prescription. I just didn\u2019t notice until then. I called Dr. Beasley and he was quick to respond and it was on the weekend. So, come to find out I\u2019m allergic to all the drugs they gave me. The reason was, they are related to the same drugs that I put on my form that I was allergic to. But after the last surgery to finish the route canals everything else is fine and everything\u2019s good now. I most likely will not be coming back. Take of this what you will. I\u2019m one of thousands of people that have came through. Plus, probable one of the few that decided to give a review. Everyone\u2019s problem is always going to be different. Your situation most likely will not be the same as my situation. At the end I will say the assistance were great and the doctor answered my questions fast.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88628b423e0f4e15:0x2fc9b52211125582"}

Just drive safely and we'll see you when we see you.\" There was no wait time to speak of, and they were so efficient. Someone was in the room with us the entire time. My father was shocked, saying he couldn't feel any pain whatsoever, neither with the injection nor the extraction. Everyone was sympathetic to our needs and very helpful. Dr. Beasley even stayed to answer all our dental questions, and was very personable.

We do see that you have a history of posting bad reviews for multiple other businesses so this seems to be a rather common practice for you. Regardless, since you choose to communicate in this manner we will reply with an explanation from our point of view. First, the treatment you speak of was performed back in January of 2018 and your procedures we billed to your dental insurance company for payment. The balance of what your dental insurance company didn't pay is your responsibility.  Over the past 7 months we have documented several attempts to contact you regarding your balance both by phone and by mail. You received at least 4 months of statements in the mail. You were also sent a final notice letter which stated if you did not contact us to make payment arrangements your account would be turned over for collections and that this could affect your credit. You still did not contact our office. We then had no choice but to pass your account on to a collection agency. Ignoring collection calls and statements in the mail doesn't make the bill go away Mr. Russell. For anyone reading this, our office is happy to make monthly payment arrangements to help our patients when an insurance company pays less than estimated. Please visit us at www.BeasleyDentistry.com.
