They've done a good job with social distancing and seem to be observing good precautions. The beer selection is more than adequate for a restaurant but disappointing for a place named \"public house\".\n\nThe house fries with sauces are a reasonable attempt at frites, but the fries came sans salt. They came with a mild chili-ketchup, aoili mayo, and a chipotle style sauce. The super salad was good, but did not differentiate itself from the dozens of similar salads.\n\nThe chicken and waffles looked nice but did not have the depth or heat hoped for. The crystal hot sauce was minimalistic. The corn dog looked to be dressed up but the acid was unbalanced with the other flavors making it more hippie than hipster.\n\nOverall, it was very ok. We were hoping for a more \"foodie\" experience and were disappointed.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGBmEvc0y6cv43-LM84-R2a_-ykkGcvGEX0gkF=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgkvVHvarIMQ6YBMSafvaKwLCBdSH7fKZiglZ8=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEoVPkHarAiBIiyguyg65giuh9YeCik3fw5otO=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwWAfaTr0cswijpdIhcY52NS3T4-xKxJ1QqY7z=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNY-wa3kKKsQhvVvjLPSlMyPKQDmfxNO83PvZPR=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888919c9c52ca5d1:0xa4c9f59e8f20aad8"}
