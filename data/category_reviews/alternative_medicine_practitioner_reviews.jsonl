After finding his contact information on the A.R.T. providers page, I decided to schedule an appointment.  I was initially hesitant, as I live in Pensacola and would need to drive almost an hour to get to Fairhope.  I can say that each and every trip I make down for an appointment is absolutely worth it.  Unlike other practitioners that I've seen, Dr. Justin took the time to listen to my concerns and give me feedback.  I didn't feel like another patient on the assembly line.\n\nI was also impressed with his ability to provide me with some immediate relief.  Using A.R.T., Dr. Justin was able to help me alleviate some nagging hip flexor pain, and also give me more range of motion in my knee, in one visit.  While some follow-up visits are required to completely alleviate certain issues, I was impressed with how quickly I felt relief.  It was also helpful to know that Dr. Justin was involved in the same workout program as me, so he really understood the nature of my pain.  It's nice to be treated someone who appears to \"practice what they preach\" in terms of living a healthful life.\n\nAnd lastly, the staff at Eastern Shore Chiropractic & Sports Clinic is outstanding.  I'm always greeted by friendly faces when I walk in the door and have never had an issue getting an appointment at a time that is convenient for me.

The actual acupuncture portion was much more enjoyable and relaxing than I anticipated. He had calming music playing with low lighting. After telling him in the consultation that I get cold easily, he put a heated lamp over my feet without me even asking. When he placed the first needle, I immediately felt the tension and pain in my neck and shoulder melt away. He also used electro stimulation on some of the needles, and it felt amazing. I laid on the table with the needles for about 30 minutes, I\u2019m honestly guessing because I fell asleep! After he removed them, he massaged the area and used a menthol spray.

He takes chiropractor care to levels no one has ever heard of in this town. Let's be real for a moment, almost every who's had pain at some point in their life has gone to a chiropractor for help. The standard way of thinking is that if you could just get that elbow to pop back or to have a hip or shoulder reset then all your pain would go away. But it never works, you might find some mild relief but it's usually short lived by a couple of hours to maybe days and then you wake up and say, you slept wrong and it's out again.\n\nWell the team at Invision chiropractic care will teach you how to do address the underlying problems so you can fix it yourself in the long run. Yes you will get adjusted, yes it will probably hurt (Dr. Aplin has a different approach to adjusting that I've ever seen) but I'm a walking, breathing, significantly less pain and overall stress less person than when I walked into his office 4 months ago.\n\nI'll be honest, I have a long history of surgeries to pains and only walked in to this office cause I didn't want to have another surgery and my dear friend suggested Dr. Aplin. I went when I truly didn't believe he was helping. I went when the pain spread to a neighboring body part. I went even though my TOC doc said I needed surgery to fix my problem. 4 months and I never missed an appointment. I can say today that I don't need surgery, my pain is gone and the results of becoming less stressed and worry free was worth more to me than the pain getting better.\n\nBrainTap. Google it. Dr. Aplin introduced me to it and has changed my life because of it. I feel like I have the answer to a life long question that I know so many of us ask \"How do I feel better?\" yes that's generic but let's be honest, everyone is stressing about something these days. But after 4 months of using the BrainTap and doing my homework from Dr. Aplin, I do feel better, lighter able to take on what the world throws at me.

WE WILL CURBSIDE YOUR ORDER. CALL 334-277-9925.\n\nThe sign also states: \"DUE TO THE RISK OF CONTAMINATION, ALL SALES ARE FINAL - NO REFUNDS.\"\n\nYou were not refused service as you have incorrectly stated - you were refused entrance to the INSIDE of our business since you had no facial covering. You were given the option to our curb side service - which you refused to take advantage of. We provide a nice, socially distanced safe outside sitting area for those without masks or facial coverings to use. We actually have a large amount of customers who prefer the outdoor curbside service and delivery option.\n\nWe require this of everyone - regardless of race, color, gender, religious or political orientation. Why you consider yourself some elite exception in that you feel that you have some special entitlement, are better than all our other customers,  and can disregard our store policy, which has been in effect for many months now, I do not know - and there are no exceptions to our store entrance policy. We are a privately owned and operated local, family business - and we set the store policy here.\n\nYou are not entitled or above all our other customers who follow the store policy and are very, very happy to be able to shop in such a sanitary, healthy and very friendly 32+ year service and community oriented business\n\nAll of us wear our correct facial coverings all day long. We do take short breaks from wearing the coverings when not in the store to allow for C02 reduction and etc - but are right back on when back inside the store.\n\nFunny, but no one here remembers anyone of your mask intolerance issue trying to come in. What ever - there is an outside curbside service area for those reading this post who may have some type of facial mask/covering issue that can benefit from this incident, and know there is an outside curbside service option for them.\n\nWe  hope you find your happy place to shop.

Fresh organic sustainable food, and dry goods that rival any large grocery store. I\u2019ve bought probiotics, prebiotics, vitamins, minerals, alkaline water and so much more. They offer local products too, like honey and candles. The personalized one on one service they offer is above and beyond any local store. They are kind, compassionate and helpful to anyone asking questions when faced with so many choices. Anything and everything they ever suggested for me helped me so much. Now, with the Covid-19, they are asking people to wear masks in the store or plan to call ahead and order what you need and they will bring it out to you, curbside. People complaining they cannot wear a mask have the alternative to call from their car, make an order and literally in seconds they bring it to your car. I also have health issues where I cannot breath if I wear a mask. I ordered a couple minutes before reaching their store and had my purchase soon as I pulled into the parking lot.

Healthwise is the store you have been searching for!\n\nI have shopped at Healthwise for over 15 years. The owners stay on the leading edge of knowledge related to health and nutrition. They are always available to assist you with answering your questions. They have never rushed me and they take the time to answer all my questions. I trust them for their extensive knowledge of nutritional and holistic treatments and practices.\n\nAdditionally, I trust them to validate and verify that their suppliers are actually providing the product identified on the package. Many large chain stores and grocery stores sell brands that are nothing but sawdust and powder. You can be confident you are getting the product on the label. They also sell grass-fed beef and other meat products that are healthy for you -- not full of hormones and antibiotics.\n\nThe owners require their staff members to train on which herbs or supplements would be the best solution to address whatever health condition you are trying to treat. The staff is very friendly and they are right there to help you if you have a health related question, or you can't find a product you are looking for.\n\nI realize the are other health stores in the local marketplace. I have stepped into some of them as I was driving around town. I was curious about their knowledge of health and nutrition, the suppliers they purchased from, and the prices they were charging for the different products I regularly purchase. I could not find any store who could match the knowledge of owners and staff at Healthwise. The range of products were usually not as extensive as Healthwise and the prices were comparable to Healthwise.\n\nI trust the owners of Healthwise and the quality of the products they sell.

I give her credit for my easy delivery! After my daughters birth, she adjusted my newborn and it helped with her colic. You could see the relief in her face after an adjustment.\nAmanda's office staff is friendly and she and her staff are constantly going out of their way to provide excellent customer service. Whether it's scheduling an appointment, or needing to bring the kids with me, the staff is always helpful.\nOne thing that stands out about Amanda's chiropractic care which separates her from other chiropractors, is she is always going to seminars and learning the latest techniques.

Your input is appreciated.\nYour perspective on the first visit is different than most of our patients but significant. The intake paperwork asks the patient to list all their symptoms and quantify their health complaints and instructs the patients to quantify their level of improvement over the next 12 treatments.... That is correct. The reason the paperwork addresses a treatment plan is so patients are aware from the beginning that holistic treatment is not a one treatment panacea, it's not a pill and it's not magic. It is a healing process and the specifics are handled individually with each patient.\nA 20 minutes face to face with a physician is unheard of these days and if you feel that was a short visit so be it. In a 20-minute visit we addressed the entire human frame above and beyond the chief complaint plus acupuncture and tongue analysis. The process didn't stop when you left the office but it continued as the tongue analysis was performed by OUM physicians in California and THERE WERE THREE EMAIL CONVERSATIONS REGARDING THE SPECIFICS. That was a step I take out of true concern for the health and well-being of my patients but it's cases like these that make excellent physicians become callus.\nBest of luck on your journey and next time find something to praise about the next person that gives a damn about your health and well-being"}, "gmap_id": "0x8892927a6c918d1b:0x6fa1927cce21bd5d"}

The office manager at this business is ABSOLUTELY THE MOST RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL PERSON I HAVE EVER SPOKEN TOO. I came in probably 7 months ago, It was my first visit to ever see a chiropractor, and was in a lot of pain. I paid like $150-$175  that day just because I told them SPECIFICALLY that I did not want a bill in the mail and I would pay whatever that day just to go ahead and get it out of the way. I saw Dr. Jumper and he was very nice and helpful. I thought that I was going to be very pleased with my experience. 6 MONTHS LATER, I received a bill in the mail from them asking me for $35. Soon after I received the bill in the mail I gave them a call to ask some questions about my bill. She began to tell me that I still owed $35 and that the lady that I was working with got fired because of doing stuff like this and not charging me the full amount. I begin to tell her what I paid that day and I asked specifically if I could take care of it the day of the visit. I then asked her if she could just take care of it for me because it was not my mistake it was the employees. Her tone immediately changed and she said \"You still have to pay your bill regardless and if you don't we will be reporting you to collections.\" I tried to explain to her that I am a loyal customer and I just do not think it is right for me to have to pay this and she kept talking over me and raising her voice. THEN, SHE HUNG UP ON ME. Today I receive a phone call from the business and I was on the other line and could not answer, and immediately call back, and no answer. The point of the matter is, IF YOU ARE RUNNING A LOCAL BUSINESS, YOU ARE TRYING TO IMPROVE YOUR CLIENTELE. IF AN EMPLOYEE DOES SOMETHING WRONG, YOU DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT CUSTOMER IS SATISFIED. REGARDLESS. If you are looking for a local chiropractor DO NOT go to this business unless you are wanting to get SCAMMED. It was not the money aspect, but the fact they were not worried about satisfying the customer and doing what is right.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1524498735553, "text": "Erika Berry, we're very sorry to hear about your experience.
