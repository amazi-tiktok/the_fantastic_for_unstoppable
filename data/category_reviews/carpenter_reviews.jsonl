Chris was quick in contacting me, quick to start and complete the job and great at maintaining constant communication throughout the project. He was very willing to go above and beyond in assisting me. He provided before and after pictures and a walk through video explaining everything so I could be comfortable with his work. I can't physically be there, so he was my eyes and brought unknown issues to my attention, which he verified with pictures. I have a property management company, but their bids were high to do some of this work, which is why I shopped around and found Birmingham Fast Repair.
