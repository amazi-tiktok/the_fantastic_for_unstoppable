I know it was from there because we didnt take him to stores or in public because of social distancing. When we informed them of this, they shrugged it off and said something like, at least kids aren't that badly affected by it. I bet they didn't inform any of the other parents in his class. It's really expensive too and you have to provide everything. Also they don't support hand washing or potty training till later classes.

When I asked about curriculum for the class my daughter would've been enrolled in, she said verbatim, \"The teacher hasn't been able to work much on that because some of our parents need better parenting skills and a lot of the kids weren't potty trained when they should've been, so the teacher had to work on that instead.\" Excuse me, what? Did you just bash the parents to a potential new parent at your school? Nonetheless, I thanked them for the information and left. Not once was I rude. I kept my composure during that entire (strange) ordeal.\n\nI left a little perplexed and stunned and called my husband letting him know my experience. STILL, because I had heard such great things and wanted to give them a shot, I sent an email the next day letting them know we would like to start Monday. The director emailed back and asked me to call her, so I did. While on the phone, she basically told me she didn't want my negativity at the school (with a very chipper tone) and that she wanted her parents to be happy to bring their kids there. Again, 100% floored that she's saying this as I gave no indication that I was unhappy. I then tell her my experience when I met them and how she talked bad about other parents as my FIRST IMPRESSION. After that, she was silent on the phone for an awkward amount of time and finally said \"I'm sorry you felt that way and you're right, we could've handled that better...but I don't think it will be a good fit. I've never said that, but sorry.\" And I just said okay thank you, have a good day and hung up.\n\nI'm sure this is a great program (if you're okay with a 'play' daycare instead of one based on curriculum), but the way I was treated when I walked in is causing me to leave a bad review. I honestly can't tell you if I've ever left a bad review on anything before, but this was worth the write. I'm sure the kids are treated with love and respect, but the fact that she basically told me I couldn't enroll in her school had me dumbfounded. Still scratching my head wondering why I was treated this way after being so kind to them. Use your best judgement when enrolling! I don't know whether to make heads or tails of it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890ce34fa0fe1d:0xf0338f4b3eb352bf"}

My husband and I were confused because when he picked her up that day he asked her teacher if anything happened today and if she had a good day and her teacher lied and said that nothing happened and that my daughter had a good day. The next day my husband and I were livid sand when he brought her to school he asked the teacher directly was our daughter bitten and pulled down her sleeve to reveal the bite marks and only then did the teacher admit that she was bitten but didn\u2019t explain the scenario for how she was bitten. She didn\u2019t even apologize for not telling us! She only just said that she saw the incident but didn\u2019t think it broke the skin! That tells me that she didn\u2019t even look or apply aid to my child! My husband asked if our daughter cried and she said yes but didn\u2019t say that she comforted my daughter at all. I was at work when my husband called to tell me all this. I called and talked w/ the manager and all she did was cover up for her worker. She admitted that this was not the first time that this employee had not followed standard protocol as no report was written and turned in at all on the day of the incident but she kept saying\u201d I know her heart\u201d screw that my child was injured and I was not notified! Just unacceptable! The manager admitted that no medical aid had been applied to my child! When asked how all this happened she said my daughter was playing with a toy first and a child wanted it and when the child couldn\u2019t get it he bite my daughter. She said my daughter did nothing wrong. Reluctantly we had to leave her there for the day as my husband had to go to work and we have no family or friends available to watch her. When my picked her up today he was handed a report about the incident and on the document the director lied saying that the bite was wiped and cold pack was applied and this  never occurred! She told me earlier today that the teacher stated that she didn\u2019t think the skin broke and she agreed that she had not assessed the bite to see if skin was in fact broken! She didn\u2019t give a flip about my child! So she falsified documents to cover up for her incompetent, lazy employee! She admitted to my husband that this was not the first time that this employee had done something like this and yet she keeps her as an employee!This is not a place to bring your children! They will not take care of your child and will NOT report to you if anything bad happened to your child throughout the course of the day! We will be removing our child as soon as we find another daycare! I\u2019m beyond livid w/ the facility!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889164cd85a6245:0x68fd4e632becdcc1"}

Always makes the child welcome. After the initial jitters and rash of ear infections and fevers my daughter adjusted and then thoroughly enjoyed going here.\n\nMost important thing is place is super clean and all the teachers we have had experience with are genuinely caring and affectionate towards our kiddo and communicative towards parents. Especially last 2 years (k3 and k4) were a blast. From the administration point of view, they are not defensive and open to dialogue and suggestions from parents.\n\nOne of the times, we were struck at the center for overnight due to a snow situation in Birmingham. The way teachers and the director Ms Annie handled the situation was superb. I almost feel lucky to have discovered this center.\n\nI have to mention especially about the assistant director Miss Jennifer. I don't know how she remembers all the children by their names etc. :) she would always greet kids with their name and a big smile. Other than running the operations smoothly, she is understanding and supportive of all the situations that parents go through as we deal with job transfers etc. can't thank her for enough.\n\nI highly recommend this place.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889164cd85a6245:0x68fd4e632becdcc1"}

Williams", "time": 1524508125598, "rating": 5.0, "text": "I believe that there are not enough reviews on here to judge such and impeccable learning facility! Therefore, I am adding mine to show future families of Odyssey how wonderful this school is! First, My child has been attending Odyssey since 6 weeks old. We have had an amazing experience since! Annie and Jennifer have always done everything in their power to please any wishes I had for childcare (and I am a hard mom to please) Yes, Annie is straight forward and awesome, but I am also a huge fan of Jennifer\u2019s ability to make anything happen if it deems possible. Sometimes this may seem as though she is not \u201cto the point,\u201d, when in fact, she may be changing the point all together to fit my needs! She has loving and understanding customer service and I have never had any issues that I Couldn\u2019t come to her about. When my child has moved up in rooms, we have had teacher changes. Especially on the toddler hall. I have never been disappointed with any teacher that my son has had though. They send home a letter upon a teachers leaving and let us know who our new teacher will be. This happens, bc unfortunately a preschool teacher isn\u2019t always a main career for a young adult. However, in the infant hall/preschool hall their teacher have been at Odyssey 10-20 years!!! Now that truly says something about the owner and directors! You have to be doing good by your employees if they work for you each day for decades! So, when my child\u2019s teacher is replaced I figure that it is either due to a career path change or that they didn\u2019t meet Odyssey standards and I am just Fine with that! Lastly, I am so appalled that the previous review referred to the floaters as \u201crandoms\u201d This has to be the most offensive sentence I have read in all of these reviews. The floaters work just as hard as the named teachers at Odyssey...some work harder! I bet every one of them knows every child by name. Watch the cameras yourself! I watch the floaters clean up meals, place out cots/high chairs, put up cots and chairs, close down rooms when they haven\u2019t been in there all day, put my child to sleep, rock my baby when the teachers are busy feeding. I have never seen a group of more loving floaters. I have used one of the floaters as a babysitter and felt from the beginning that she loved my son Just as much as I do! Most of the time floaters are there because they have 2nd jobs and work at Odyssey part time. I also know that a few of them are full time employees and would rather help out and love on all the children than be placed in one room. I wish you would have thought about that sentence before you posted, because if you have never had your child physically harmed by a teacher at Odyssey, then why scare people into thinking that a floater may? They have the same couple of floaters every day and my child can name all of them. It is my hope that all the floaters get just as much recognition as the teachers at Odyssey bc they do the same thing and that is providing a safe, clean, and  professional child care facility where I know my child is loved. Now that my child is getting ready to go into kindergarten soon, I am beyond please with his knowledge! He can almost read! He can write! He can do things that first graders are doing in elementary schools! I owe this all to Odyssey and their outstanding curriculum. Thank you for providing us a second family and I will always refer family and friends to Odyssey!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889164cd85a6245:0x68fd4e632becdcc1"}

(which is why they need more than 1 person for so many small babies) and when my mom went to get my child they DID NOT check her ID she just told them who she was there to get and they just let her in. please, if you care for your child's safety find a different daycare!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a99b05b83b9:0x476247689c174680"}

I walked up to the daycare office and my children burst out of the door to greet me. Hellos, hugs and kisses were shared. I shuffled them to the car as usual, trying to hurry home. I asked them how their days were and the news I would receive from my children would change my outlook on the world. My son, who is 5, stated he had good news and sad news. (This is a usual statement. He like to say something sad and good that happened during his day. He said his teacher pushed him down. Taken aback, I inquired what happened? I had thought for sure I misunderstood. He repeated himself in more detail that she had taken her hand to the back of his head and pushed him off of the picnic table. He continued that he had fallen on the rocks of the playground and hurt his hands and knees. I checked his hands and knees, but there were minor indications of trauma. The owner of the daycare assured me she would get to the bottom of it and let me know. She expressed how much she loves my children and cares for us like family. Trying to reassure myself, I say how maybe he was mistaken, because his sister had said stuff before and recanted. Surely, I told myself, there has to be some mistake. My children have attended this daycare for over 4 years, and we have not had major incidents in that time.....Boy, was I wrong....\nThe owner of the daycare gave me her phone the next night, so I could feel better about the situation and know that my children are safe. She stated how my son was mistaken and that the teacher had caught him from falling, etc.. I was left to watch the video in slow motion to find out what happened....Shocking!

If your child runs to their teacher, and all the other teachers know her name as she is leaving..... that is the sign of good childcare.\n\nThe school age program is very good as well.  The facililty's school age room is also very updated and very age appropriate.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cd1f929061a95:0xe4d0ee862ebd627b"}

We loved the teachers and that class so much. One morning when he was in the guppy class I was dropping off my son and the lead teacher of sea turtles was opening that class. My son had a blow out so the teacher was changing him and I was standing there helping her. As I\u2019m talking to her she is taking his clothes off and then begins to use his outfit to wipe his stool off his entire body. His outfit ended up having to be thrown away because after three washes it was stained. I mentioned it to the admin and the director and nothing was done. Everything was great until he moved up to the sea turtle class. We did not want him moving up to that class because he was only about 7.5 months old. He wasn\u2019t even crawling, but was attempting to crawl. They kept pushing me to move him up even though I expressed my feelings towards it several times. They stated he was \u201ctoo big\u201d for the guppy class and he couldn\u2019t fit in the swings anymore. He was a 7.5 month old who couldn\u2019t even crawl, in a class full of 1 year olds who are walking. After he moved up to the sea turtle class we started having issues instantly. The lead teacher would tell me what to do and not to do with my son. He came home with three knots on his head over the period of time from when he moved up until this week. Nobody called me to inform me that he had hit his head either. When I picked him up the teachers or admin staff would state they didn\u2019t know how he got the knots and bruises on his head. Also, every day when I pick up my sons nose is crusted with snot. It clearly hadn\u2019t been whipped off all day. His clothes would be covered in the foods they had eaten that day too. Several times I would have to change his clothes and clean him up before leaving because he looked so bad. On many occasions he came home with 3 out of 4 bottles still filled with formula that I had pre made that morning. The teachers would state he refused to eat. Let me mention that my now 10 month old is 27 lbs, he doesn\u2019t miss a meal. When I would pack his bottles up to leave he would get so excited like he wanted one, so I would give him one and he would drink it so fast like he hadn\u2019t eaten all day because he hadn\u2019t. They only gave him one bottle for an entire 10 hours. When my son was close to 9 months old he came home for a week straight throwing up randomly and having bad stools. I finally took him to the doctor thinking he was sick. I came back to the daycare the following week and told his teacher that his doctor said he was fine. That is when I find out that his lead teacher had been giving him whole milk with his formula without asking me or even telling me for an entire week. What if my kid was allergic or I didn\u2019t want him to have milk? The doctor even recommends children not have whole milk till they are a year old. I expressed my feelings towards her stating all my concerns about it and she states in that class they train the children on whole milk. I told her not to give it to him anymore but I would find out from the other teachers that she continued to give it to him. One day I had to pick my son up during nap time for a doctors appt and she told me to shhh that I would wake the children up. Let me mention I was whispering asking how my son was that day. The same teacher has gotten a stern tone with two of the other kids in his class while I was in there talking to her during drop off, so it makes me wonder how she is talking to my son without me there. These are only a few things that have happened. The director was aware but never did anything about it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923c63d1e68f1:0x3f6222559ce30c38"}

In the beginning, it was great! It was what I as a single mother desperately needed. It went downhill fast.\n\nThere were many times that the meal I sent with her was not used and they started charging me for the extra meal. I had to work at putting a stop to this. The meals, at least in the beginning, were told to me as being \"organically catered\" but that was clearly not true or had fallen away pretty quickly.\n\nAt the time, we were vegetarian - which was on her paperwork and discussed with the owner. But I learned from my reluctant daughter, who was worried she would be in trouble, that there were many times she would be required to finish her whole meal to get dessert, which included chicken nuggets. That is a ridiculous position to put a small child in.\n\nWhen I reached out via email to discuss the issue, one of the co-owners - Joey - essentially said I was lying and said no child is ever forced to eat something they don't want and did not investigate it or properly address the issue. Funny, because he wasn't even there most of the time. I still have those emails to this day.\n\nThere was also the issue of her meds not being given to her and being routinely \"forgotten.\"\n\nDebra-someone rose to being in charge and she was a very cold and rude person. Despite always paying my bill on time and being one of the original customers, she began requiring me to prepay - something which other parents I spoke with did not have to do. But interestingly enough, it was after I had raised concerns about the food issue and then the medicine issue.\n\nAt one point, I had to be out of work for a month because my daughter had caught from the daycare strains of influenza, strep, staph, and had a full blown case of MONO. I had never heard of anyone having mono younger than a high-schooler! It was made obvious then that they do not clean well enough.\n\nThe last and final straw was the lack of care and protection from the teachers. Despite being the older kid most of the time, she would get hit a bunch by the younger ones. She would tell the teachers who in turn wouldn't do anything, or she would be the one who got in trouble. I tried coaching her on how to protect herself and what to say, but she had a huge fear around doing anything and getting in trouble. No matter what she did, she said she got in trouble when she tried to stop from being hit or complained about it.\n\nI pulled her out and never took her back. She's almost 13 and still talks about how glad and relieved she is to never have to be at daycare. And sometimes I learn new things about her time there, and I overall regret that she spent any time there since it has been such a shadow in her mind.\n\nThis place can't even do the basics. I would never recommend them.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626f62c0ce5887:0xe9e099118a93786f"}

This was primarily because of the extended hours of operation. I was working a job in Retail at that time, and did not have the luxury of people lining up to care for my child while I worked. Long story short.....   Several instances where I would pick up my daughter to find her face, nose, clothes, etc. FILTHY. Not once or twice, but over 15-20 times. I always provided change of clothes but they were NEVER used. She was always very thirsty and hungry-as they do not serve dinner until 7 p.m.\nI emailed the Director to schedule a meeting with her and the owner, to which she took days to reply. One day before the such meeting, I walked in to find my daughter with a snotty nose as an employee crouched in the corner texting on her cell phone. I was later told that BOTH owners were just TOO busy to meet with me so I sat down with the Director only. She assured me that things would improve. One being their extremely high turn over rate-that did NOT change. My daughter no longer attends this daycare. Please PLEASE do not leave your children with these people. On my daughter's last day there, while not being attended to; another child in her over 2 1/2 yr room shut her hand in a door!!!

One week he would go to Milestones and catch something, then we would keep him home for a week and fix him up.  The next week he would catch something else again.  It was a perpetual cycle because of which we decided to pull him out.\n\nHe then restarted daycare (somewhere else) when he was a year old.  For 6 months he was relatively healthy - barring the occasional cough / cold.  We started him back at Milestones this week (i.e. 18  months).  He has been there all of 3 days and already he has caught a stomach bug. This place is horrible!  On day 1 when we went to pick him up, his milk cup was not washed and just sitting around.  The second day, his pacifier was missing.  When I asked the teacher where his pacifier was, she started looking among the toys.  That should have been my first clue - if the teacher is looking for a pacifier amongst the toys, god alone knows how many kids have put it in their mouth!  And the pacifier had a string attached to it, so they could just have clipped it to our son, but they did not care to do that.

Same members have been going here for 10-15 year with no new faces. \"Wonder Why\" One member who's name is Janice Voss, also on the board, in the choir, and is one of The United Methodist Woman is the worse hypocrite in The Deep South. I chalanged her and Amy Gay Ervin to go to a professional Christian mediator for family counseling, but they were to ignorant in their beliefs to go. Our last visit was this past Easter, my fianc\u00e9 and I went because that's were my children attend. We were shunned by 75% of the congregation. I have nothing good to say about this church, other than an elderly couple \"Bill and Ellen Flowers\" it's my opinion, they are two of the most wonderful Christians in the world!  I hope this church makes some major changes, because they're giving Christians a bad name.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a9a1bdc47b4b:0x8c2df27ca15ff874"}

All my son talked about was getting to see his friends at school everyday he was so happy and it breaks my heart that he's not able to get to do that anymore. We were never gave any warnings this just came from out of the blue and the way it was handled was very unprofessional I've lost all respect for the owner and staff. My son is 3 and yes he likes to goof off and thinks everything is funny but today when I picked him up from his new make shift baby sitter he is crying because he didn't get to see his friends and he misses them.  So to the owner I hope you can sleep at night after screwing people over giving them less than 24 hours to find someone to keep my son.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88628ba0e592fb55:0xe1c64a82035d0b25"}
