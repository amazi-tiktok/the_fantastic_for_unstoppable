It can be extremely difficult to translate what your skill set encompasses and relay that to a company.  Add the fact that you have a family to provide for, along with the other stresses of life and you have a cocktail of uncertainty.  Kara is more than just a third party recruiter; she's a coach, a mentor, a teacher.  We take for granted the soft skills a person might have, but when it comes down to it, they are more important than you could ever imagine.  Kara embodies the process.  Understanding not only your credentials, but who you are as a person.  It's what you don't see, the actions behind the curtain that make Kara a force to be reckoned with.  Countless hours devoted to her clients to ensure the next job is not just a job, but a path to success; a career path the answer your 1 year, 5 year, 20 year + plan.  It is an amazing feeling to know deep down in your heart that you will be taken care of.  I owe everything to Kara and her work she has done.

Not only did Rodney contact me and not make it known he was from a temp service, he was beyond rude to me for not accepting a job offer that was not worth my value. The job is located almost a hour from me so my pay requirement was more than fair on top of that the company did not have enough positive reviews for me to trust a 90 days probationary period. As a recruiter your job is to help not only the company to find the best employee but is also to help the employee find a good fit. You don't get mad because they have a family to take care of and cant just accept any pay. Instead of Rodney saying he was going get back with the company and see what he can do, he instantly attack me with verbal insults such as \" your not going find a job for a long time with your pay requirement\" voice got very high and disrespectful meanwhile I had him on speaker and other people could hear the conversation as well. I did not argue with him, but he hung the phone up in my face. Very rude and should not be a recruiter for anyone, he told me so many lies about the job and when I asked for proof of benefits and other things he kept giving me the run around. When I showed up to the job the person I was suppose to speak to wasn't even there, so I had to interview with Another person instead.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1594654235882, "text": "I apologize you had a bad experience.

Also when I started the project I was promised a certain amount of money an hour but I looked at my pay stub and I was missing money I was getting paid less hourly than what we had talked about when I mentioned it to my recruiter she turn around and got real nasty with me and told me that if I didn't like it I can quit and when I told her well I would quit but I need my money she turn around and tell me how about I fire you then so when I turn around and tell her well you know this conversation is being recorded by the way off my phone for your information and also I will be contacting my lawyers and I also have a copy of the contract by Express services which we had a green all of a sudden there was a silent pause and then they told me to come pick up my new check that it was going to be printed out.

Then will tell you all the jobs they have for you is general labor job which is only fit for mans. They have no jobs for any woman and they don't have anything for a person with a bachelor's degree. I have walked in this building three times with my resume in hand and each person sitting at the desk doesn't do anything but act like they are looking over a resume then says I will give it to the manager. They will hand you the business card after that plan to NEVER HEAR FROM THEM AGAIN IN LIFE. Recently I tried to call about any job opens and got the runaway from a manager that has no idea what her staff does and just put blame on her blame. She didn't apologize for the situation or her staff and then started telling me how I should act on a phone. I'm a customer and clearly the manager/stuff has no customer service. A good manager knows your staff is a regular of you and your training. CORPORATE NEEDS TO COME DOWN AND FIRE EVERYBODY IN THAT OFFICE ASAP.

More than any staffing agency I had been to because for some reason, they act like giving employment info is a secret and you have to be initiated first to get any help. Brian made me feel like he was actually interested in helping me find employment. The Registration process was easy. I came back the next day to complete everything because I had an appointment. I meet with other staff members Shannon and Johnny. They too were friendly, kind, and professional. Just like Brian, with them, I also felt like they genuinely wanted to help me. I haven't felt like that about a staffing agency in a VERY long time. While I was there, I also noticed the way Brian interacted and talked to other job seekers that came into the office. The same way he treated me, with respect, professionalism, care, and a positive attitude. That really won me over and stood out in my mind. I also followed up with Sandra over the phone and she displayed the same professionalism that I encountered with the other staff at Elwood. I was blown away! She was so helpful when I called.

The lady I was working with was great, but she moved to a different state for a better job and the person who took over in her stead (Sheri), absolutely was not doing her job and wasn't letting me know when the employer wanted me to work.\n\nI spoke to the employer directly and they told me they asked for me 2 or 3 different times and this lady didn't notify me of their request every time like she should have. I notified her that I contacted the employer directly to make sure that the correct info was being communicated, since I didn't trust that she was doing her job. They told me they didn't know why she wasn't notifying me of their E-Mails. She then told me I am NOT to contact the employer in any way, because Career Personnel was my boss and not the employer they work through.\n\nWhile I understand that and normally wouldn't go around someone's back, communication is important. Anyway, it's completely immature and sketchy that they would even ask me not to contact the employer in any way, as I have never had an issue with this before when I worked for a staffing agency in another state. Seems to me like there was something to hide or protect on her/their behalf and either way you look at it, this lady wasn't looking out for my best interest. Completely unprofessional.\n\nIn closing, I just want to say, you don't TELL another adult what they can and can't do, as if you are in control of that individual. You are their boss, not God. Disrespect people and treat them that way, as if you you are entitled to have power over them and your business is going to crash.\n\nNot only was my experience awful after this experience, but these folks absolutely put ZERO effort in to finding me a proper job placement that fit my skills and what I was educated to do. They just wanted the easy money from the quickest job placement they could find.\n\nPEACE!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1609345329040, "text": "I am disappointed that your experience with us was not good for you.

We failed to contact you on one occasion on 06/11/2019 due to having the incorrect phone number updated in our software. We apologized for that and made the correction to your phone number.\n\nDuring this time you had been contacting our client directly and we asked you not to do so as the client makes contact directly with us when they have a need. You agreed that this process was appropriate and that the client had told you the same thing on 06/25/19. On 07/03/19 we had to remind you again that you were not to contact the client directly. It was at this point that you became upset and tendered your notice.\n\nIn regards to not being able to assist you with a placement that aligned with your certification that was earned at Virginia College in 2015. We did not have any opportunities at the time to be able to place someone in this field particularly since you had no \"on-the-job\" experience that most of our clients require.\n\nIn retrospect; we believe that we have done everything possible to work with you and in reviewing the text messages we also find that you were treated with respect and courtesy by all recruiters. We wish you well in your future endeavors and hope that you have been able to secure a job that aligns with everything you were looking for."}, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a4555a0853b:0x6659fc33eaa66be4"}

I understand that recruiters get busy and sometimes candidates fall through the cracks, but now the same thing is happening to a friend who is working with ITAC. She received an email from a recruiter here. She applied to an Admin position since that is the majority of her experience. When the call came to speak with her, he completely blew past it and focused in on her weaknesses and said that she would not be a fit for the position that she applied for through them.

They were that similar in experience. I give them two stars out of five because while there were no results for myself, I still understand the process however, but feel it could be better.\n\nYou must first understand these recruiting firms are not really working for you, but are working for their business clients. So even though they give you a nice, warm speech about how they are here for you, in reality assisting you is secondary to assisting their paying clients. This is somewhat fair because that is how they make their money.\n\nAgain, experience was very similar at the two firms I visited. You fill out paperwork, which is basically like completing a employment application. You will be scheduled to come in for an interview so they can go over your employment history and get a feel for the type of job you are seeking. They are also using this meeting to \"pre-interview\" you for their clients. Staff at all two locations were very nice and friendly. The recruiters are very bubbly and fun.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, the recruiters will tell you how they will get to work attempting to place you with a matching career with one of their clients. This is kinda where the communication stopped for me. Beyond this initial interview, I received no communication in the following three months. The only call I did receive (from one firm), was a few days after visiting to tell me a job I was initially matched with had changed the job description and the pay scale was well below what I was seeking. Barring that single contact, radio silence. I was even told by one firm that after submitting my info to a place or two they would follow up with me regardless of the results to let me know how things were progressing. That call was not received.\n\nI am sure the firms have worked well for some, just not for me.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bbe64024bd5:0x67754a405c26da5"}

I wouldn't say avoid the company altogether as with all staffing agencies you will eventually run into a bad experience with a recruiter or two. ITAC didn't work for me at all as the recruiter could care less about what I was looking for in a job. He kept pushing the kind of work that I  initially told him I didn't want to do and when I would agree to do the work because it seemed like he wasnt finding anything else, he would tell me they didn't want me or they went in a different direction. I told him that I wanted to steer clear of call centers as they just were not my cup of tea and the two jobs he tried to sell me on were call center jobs at lower rates than the ones I had in the past... Pangeatwo found a job that fit what I like to do but the pay isnt great although it does help to pay the bills...
