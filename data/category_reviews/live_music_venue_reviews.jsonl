It is without hyperbole my favorite place on planet Earth.\n\nIf you are a fan of indie folk/Americana music Tangled String needs to be on your bucket list of listening rooms. Not only do they book amazing acts for a very intimate and cozy venue, but the sound quality is the best I've heard anywhere. The music is always comfortably loud, perfectly balanced and clear as a bell -but you could also hear a pin drop (or beer open). I've never left with my ears ringing. I don't know how they do it.\n\nThe atmosphere is so welcoming and relaxing. If you've ever showed up to a venue and felt like you just didn't belong there - don't worry about that coming to Tangled String. Plus, you will never have to wedge yourself against a sweaty stranger or have your vision blocked by a tall person. There is a comfortable seat for every ticket holder. Seats are not selected at purchase, they are on a first come first serve basis but every seat is fantastic (I know. I've sat in most of them and I'm very short).\n\nThis is a BYOB venue and yes, people bring small coolers. I love that I'll never be over charged for cheap wine in a disposable plastic cup, pay $4+ for water, or have to settle for Pepsi if I want a Coke. (They're also one door over from Piper and Leaf so great local tea is just a step away.)\n\nThe owners and employees are incredibly active in our local community and in the surrounding music community. They have an amazing reputation among artists and patrons. You can feel good about where your money is going when you buy a ticket.\n\nAs long as this review is I just can't say enough good things about Tangled String.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1545148269087, "text": "Thank you, Andrea!"}, "gmap_id": "0x88626cbcca324b2d:0xeaed3a7ed65f20dd"}

Remarkably, he did and showed me where to find them. That in and of itself was incredibly kind. This guy didn't owe me anything.\n\nSo I find the two 2x4's, carry them around to the front parking lot, and start working to get them under my tires. After about 20 more minutes of this I'm starting to get annoyed. Out of nowhere, this little kid (maybe 5 or 6) runs up and ask if I could use some help, cause his daddy's \"got a big ole truck.\" Sure enough, his dad comes over, offers to pull me out, and goes to get said truck. In the meantime, 4 or 5 more kids materialize and start asking me questions rapid-fire. Do I need any water? What about a coke? How'd I get stuck? Am I hungry? (After crawling around in the mud, I admittedly probably looked homeless).\n\nThe guy pulls his truck around and starts asking. These. Kids. For advice. What do they think we should do? Where on my car should we hook the strap? What blew me away is they knew what they were talking about! They start making comments about axles and the frame of my car. He has them shine a light for me while I'm attaching the strap. He has them guide me back once I'm out of the mud. (Boy, did i feel like a yuppie.)\n\nCome to find out, the guy who pulled me out was the owner's son-in-law and some of the kids were the owner's grandsons. (Backstory: the first kid saw me carrying the 2x4's away from the restaurant and thought I was stealing them \ud83d\ude02)\n\nIf it wasn't for the good folks @ Dority's, I'd still be stuck in the mud.\n\nP.

We were told there was a 1 and a half hour wait, which we were fine with because the location is pleasant enough to just sit, have a drink and look at the water.  It ended up taking about 2 hours to get seated.  The kitchen is a food trailer in the back of the property, where there is lots of sand and open sea air (which I thought was a little odd).  While waiting to be seated we sat and watched the waiters and waitresses come out and smoke cigarettes at the kitchen trailer while checking on their customers food.  I even saw one waiter take a plate of food into the restaurant while smoking his cigarette at the same time.  Once seated we waited 45 minutes for our food, and the food was absolutely horrible.  8 of us ate, no one liked the food other than my 7 year old whose kid's fried shrimp seemed to be pretty good.  I had the chicken strips. . . $15 for 5 tiny pieces of chicken that tasted like they were fried in the same grease as the fish (see attached picture).

This place is huge and had at least two live performance stages and 4-5 bars within it's large rambling structure. It even has a large merchandise store. Across the street is their liquor store as well. It literally straddles the Florida/Alabama line, hence the name, Flora-Bama. They have a somewhat limited menu, but what we had was really good. I highly recommend the oyster sampler platter. We loved every roasted bite of each variety. They are also known for their Bushwhacker drink. The easiest way to describe this  is a Wendy's frosty with liquor. It has three different kinds, I beleive, and it's quite tasty and their strongest drink, even though it's premade. Our bartender Stacy was amazing and had all of the best recommendations.  She's very knowledgeable about the local area as well. One of the unique things about this venue is that they seemingly encourage you to write on virtually everything, and I mean everything, everywhere! Bring your Sharpie! We were they're in early December. I can't imagine how crowded this must be in season!!! All in all a fun place, with good music, good and drink!

It's an amazing venue if you like live music and an indoor/outdoor atmosphere.\nThe place is huge. It almost looks like there was the original place and they decided to add on. Then add on again and again.\nYou can roam inside and outside, upstairs and down all night. Even has a boardwalk to the beach.\nWe went on a Saturday night and they had at least 10 bars open that night that were all over the place.\nThe food they offered is more of appetizers and finger food that I seen. We ordered the nachos, get your choice of beef or chicken. They were out of chicken so obviously we had gotten beef and it was to greasy that we couldn't really eat it. But other than that it was good. They also had a food trailer sitting there but didnt order from it.\nGift shop was great, found lots of stuff for loved ones and ourselves.  Some more adult oriented things that are funny if you are into that sort if thing.\nWe seen that they have what I would call a club/dance hall, another place called the flora-bama yacht club and the old river grill. Didnt get to the yacht club but the old river grill was by far my favorite.\nGreat atmosphere,  neat little bar and grill that u can get to by land or water, had picnic tables and beach chairs set up on the beach. Couple different corn hole games set up for u to play.\nWill definitely be back there on my next trip down.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKqNU3NdZaLrEi2lBT6JdPEkkxEz-McSNVPGWJ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhiKdg2K1HRhK4XR81AOv11WmHL8ADBTQFSQfl=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8890a84997a3ca01:0xb5c7b6fa2bbf6d9e"}

Please let us extend our sincerest apologies for the miscommunication in information regarding our age and cover charge  policy. As of June 3rd, the state of Florida issued a lift on all bar and nightclub operations, therefore we were given less than 48hrs to implement changes across all properties in order to open back up our inside rooms and bars. On Friday, June 5th we began going back to our previous hours of operation with the Flora-Bama being family-friendly until 6PM and after 6PM all those under 21yrs of age must exit the premises. This past Friday, June 12, we began going back to a cover charge after 6PM for all those 21yrs and older. Our website was not updated until Friday, June 12 and I'm so, so very sorry for the inconvenience it caused you. With all changes happening so quickly and no advance warning as to what the state of Florida governor will be announcing on any given day, our staff has been working extremely hard to adapt and we now have all signage regarding age and cover policy covered up so that no one is misinformed. Of course with all recent changes our country has experienced in the last few months, we are all in the same boat and doing our best to push info out as soon as we can in order to keep our patrons informed. If you're not already, give us a follow on our Facebook and Instagram where we post any all updates regarding upcoming events, happenings and operation changes. Again, we apologize for the inconvenience and please know updates have not only been made on the website and all other informational fronts, but your comments have also been passed to upper management for further review.

Not so much a place to grab a bite to eat and have one beer since the menu is limited. The Yaught club and ole river grill across the street have a more full menu and sit down service, while the Flora-Bama has a order window. It was confusing to tell where to go since the main entrance leads into a souvenir shop. Outside of the souvenir shop is a split for the upper level and the oyster bar. I found my way past some tents and found the order window and sat on the lower outside deck. I could hear a band warming up inside the inner bar. Three stars because the service was quick and the food was good. Detractors being the crowds at 12 o'clock and the nondescript signs. The free music was a plus, just this place wasn't what I expected at lunch time with everyone drinking and nobody eating. As others have stated this is more of a roadhouse or honkey tonk with modern music.

It's a process where you submit requests for them, and our request for this weekend's day shifts didn't get picked up by a deputy. Also, the county will not allow us to man the crosswalk on our own. Yes, I know this sounds ridiculous, but it is true. We are very much actively working on this change in process and please know that safety is our number one concern.\n\nRegarding the traffic, we have actively met with Alabama DOT and Florida DOT to get them in the room together to discuss our traffic/road issues, since we do not own the road and cannot fix it without their help. These meetings have been going on for a few years. Thankfully, there is progress being made and Alabama DOT has already completed their part of the road, including the addition of an added turning lane. Florida still has to do their part, and the crosswalk will have a light among other changes.

I am 19 years old and was extremely respectful. I entered as 19 years old and got my wristband and marked as underage. Also paid $15 cover charge to enter. After about an hour and a half I got approached by security and told to leave. They thought I had taken a drink from someone\u2019s alcoholic drink, when I in fact had not. I was cooperative but I immediately asked them to look at the cameras or breathalyze me. They refused to look at cameras but called a county police officer. Robin took me outside and the officer conducted a sobriety test and I passed. The police officer was extremely respectful and said my eyes were smooth and there was no problem but that they probably wouldn\u2019t let me back in. Robin proceeded to tell me I was bad for the establishment and she was extremely accusatory. I was shocked by how she was treating me. I didn\u2019t even know how to respond. The police officer then didn\u2019t feel a breathalyzer was necessary even though I said I wanted to take one. I am extremely frustrated by how I was treated by the establishment in this incident. I had no chance at reentry even though I was being respectful and following the rules. I understand that it\u2019s their job to protect their liquor license and they have to enforce the law.

I can understand your frustrations, but we are extremely grateful for our Military as we host dozens of military events here throughout the year, and majority of our staff are retired or inactive military. In regards to the the Mullet Toss event, and all events that may take place on Friday's, we only allow entry for those who have purchased tickets or those with Flora-Bama Membership Cards. We don't accept S.I.N. Cards or Military ID's for free entry as those specific events are ticket entry only (majority of the money collected we donate to local charities, including military non-profits). These specific ticketed events would be for Mullet Toss, Bulls on the Beach in September, New Years Eve (if falls on a Friday) and any other event that may fall on a Friday. Please know your comments will be passed to upper management for further review and action. I do apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused, but please feel free to email me at the address below with any other comments you have.

I knew that everyone at Flora-Bama was on high alert when we were Immediately questioned about our IDs upon walking in, which are all legitimate and have been used multiple times and have never been an issue. The girl at the front desk called the police to have my Illinois ID verified (which I understand as Illinois has new, very poorly made IDs and I am in Florida- which probably aren't the most commonly seen ID). However, after it was verified by the police, my friends and I went to the bathroom as we had just driven for an hour to get to Flora-Bama. It was then that my underage friend, who was given a permanent marker U and a blue wristband for being underage, was immediately targeted by two employees and interrogated about his age. When he entered the establishment he had presented his military ID which showed that he was 19 (never presented a fake) and told the employees that he was indeed 19 when asked. However, because his permanent marker washed off in the bathroom when washing his hands, he no longer had  the U but still had the blue wristband indicating he was underage. Despite explaining that he just walked in minutes prior and was going to go get a new U drawn on, he was rudely thrown out of the bar, and the rest of us in our party were ejected with him. I am absolutely appalled at how Flora-Bama has treated a member of the armed forces who has broken ZERO rules of this establishment. As a result of this horrific experience, we will no longer be returning to flora-bama and plan to share this information with our friends and coworkers who are interested in attending. We hope that management considers looking into these employees and their poor customer service skills because I imagine that we are not the only customers that Flora-Bama has lost tonight because of them.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8890a84997a3ca01:0xb5c7b6fa2bbf6d9e"}

I knew that everyone at Flora-Bama was on high alert when we were Immediately questioned about our IDs upon walking in, which are all legitimate and have been used multiple times and have never been an issue. The girl at the front desk called the police to have my Illinois ID verified (which I understand as Illinois has new, very poorly made IDs and I am in Florida- which probably aren't the most commonly seen ID). However, after it was verified by the police, my friends and I went to the bathroom as we had just driven for an hour to get to Flora-Bama. It was then that my underage friend, who was given a permanent marker U and a blue wristband for being underage, was immediately targeted by two employees and interrogated about his age. When he entered the establishment he had presented his military ID which showed that he was 19 (never presented a fake) and told the employees that he was indeed 19 when asked. However, because his permanent marker washed off in the bathroom when washing his hands, he no longer had  the U but still had the blue wristband indicating he was underage. Despite explaining that he just walked in minutes prior and was going to go get a new U drawn on, he was rudely thrown out of the bar, and the rest of us in our party were ejected with him. I am absolutely appalled at how Flora-Bama has treated a member of the armed forces who has broken ZERO rules of this establishment. As a result of this horrific experience, we will no longer be returning to flora-bama and plan to share this information with our friends and coworkers who are interested in attending. We hope that management considers looking into these employees and their poor customer service skills because I imagine that we are not the only customers that Flora-Bama has lost tonight because of them.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8890a84997a3ca01:0xb5c7b6fa2bbf6d9e"}

As soon as we got out of the car, slimy guys is cowboy hats were yelling inappropriate comments at women walking by and tryin to start an argument with our group. Then we get to the door, guy says we have to go down stairs to order food so we go down, grab a slightly too small table because all of the others are dirty, and sit and wait. And wait. And wait. Eventually, a server comes over, asks if we're there for food or drinks, we tell them both as he's running around us, not even fully addressing our table. He quickly says \"kitchens closed\" and walks off. (Even though the guy upstairs had just told us to come downstairs if we wanted food and the restaurant didn't close for several hours) Didn't off a drink, apology, or say another word. Obviously just trying to get us out of the restaurant.

I could smell the jalapenos on the nachos wow!!! One more or two more tho us I gotta say their drinks are delicious one of the best Bushwackers.\nLOVED THE FACT YOU CAN WALK TO THE BEACH.

We drove all the way from Minnesota with 4 of us. We first got there (Monday) and it was pretty low key which we understood given the day. The gift shop was very nice. Probably the nicest area in the whole bar. Bought some shirts saw a band and then we headed over to their 2nd bar for dinner. They didn\u2019t have oysters that we ordered and the prime rib that my boyfriend ordered never came along with his drink he ordered. I will give the manger props he did say the truck for oysters should be here any min and said the first round of them were on us. Got them and they were great. We visited the main bar 3 times within 5 days thinking the later in the week it got there the more entertainment there would be. We did listen to a good one man band that sang country the 2nd time we were there, but the 3rd topped my anger level. Which is why I\u2019m writing a bad review. Last Thursday march 31st 2016 we went to the main bar where we saw that they had someone singing (who was on break). Our group of 4 got a front row seat. Than we started chatting with another family behind us and while this was happening our entertainment was setting back up to perform again. I guess I didn\u2019t notice that he had started but he made sure that I knew he did because I guess I was being too loud. A group of locals felt the same way and encouraged his behavior which was to call me out in front of everyone saying he couldn\u2019t play because I was being too distracting (Too LOUD). It\u2019s not like I was screaming or fighting with anyone. I was simply talking with my family and learning more about the area with the new people we had met. I found it extremely inappropriate that he would ever say anything to me. I\u2019m on vacation to see this place and have a good time. We simply just walked out. So to round up my experience here I would say definitely disappointing. I don\u2019t get out of Minnesota often and when I do again I wouldn\u2019t go here. There is nothing special about this place unless you like dark lighting, Smokey rooms, being called out on having fun and an old atmosphere. The Hangout on the other hand was a great place for not only my family but so many others.

As we were leaving the gift shop to meet up with his parents were they were sitting by the band, we were stopped by an older woman with a bad attitude because of our age. I understand how there could be an under age drinking problem due to the amount of intoxicated people running around. How ever the way she spoke to us was incredibly rude and she could have been nicer. She continued to be rude  questioning us as if we were doing something wrong and asked for my id. She tried to make us pay 15 dollars each even though we had already been there for a while. I showed her my i.d then she asked for our hands and put a wrist band and scribbled a huge U on each hand . she grabbed my boyfriends hand taking the permanent marker going back and fourth to make the mark even bigger she did the same on mine, almost in a way to be ignorant. she told us to not take the marker or the wrist band off talking to us like we were stupid.  Later walking out my boyfriend was also accused of drinking which he hadn't been. The least to say we are never coming back .

As an avid bar hopper I've been to a lot of bars, some good...some not so much. I was really looking forward to Flora-Bama, the name alone just exudes fun. The hype was there, the reviews were there, and then i was there...and soooooo let down.\n\nTo be fair, it was a Tuesday night at 1030 in September...but this place was not the spot that I soooo hoped it would be. It was dead, I mean except the over 45 folk that were there with a DJ that resembled a older, not so awesome Ted Nugent. Now, that is not necessarily the bars fault. But this is.. this place is a hodge -podge of bad additions which include multiple bars, a gift shop, outdoor venues, and a wierd staging area for things that don't have a home (grills, coolers,etc.). The building was run down and had no flow from one area to another. There was a wierd smell I and only describe of disel fuel and butt, laced with the waftyness of years of nicotine build up. It was the kinda place that made me want to go shower to excape the smell.\n\nThere were several places for live music, but  was none, except for some guy picking at a guitar. The \"band\", all two members, were to busy mingling and not to worried at all about playing. Did I tell you how high my hopes for this place was!? Now, they did have a awesome liquor distribution room. Every bottle in this large room was piped right into the bars for equal and accurate pours. It was really impressive and on display for you to be in awe. All-in-all, I guess if it was spring break and I was super drunk this place COULD be good. But it still feels a bit dingy. I do hope to revisit, hopefully at a different time of  year. Maybe the embiance changes from season to season, but for a bar that has the reputation that this one does, my group and I was let down..hard and my buzz was killed. In all honesty, I would have given it a 2.5 stars..but that was not a option.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8890a84997a3ca01:0xb5c7b6fa2bbf6d9e"}

The idea of playing various songs and interacting with the crowd is great idea and great response.  BUT the main member of the Band is very crude and disgusting!  Can he not play a song without grabbing his crotch and cussing like that to people!?  One lady even tried to buy him a drink, and he told her, with several vulgar words, he didn't want that!  If she can't bring him  'x', then just get out!\nI've seen this singer before, but don't remember him being that vulgar!  Time for some new entertainment.

Also, on Sundays, they have a great church service, \"Worship on the Water\". There are many singers/songwriters/musicians who play at different times and different places within the Bama Lounges.  Personally, I would book The Perdido Brothers with their current time slot, 4-8 on Tuesdays and Sundays. Why? Ever since they became The Perdido Brothers, they have been drawing in more people.  The locals and snowbirds really enjoy their music and the time slot helps bring in the people.  We stay at Phoenix X and we hear so many people mentioning how much they enjoy The Perdido Brothers. This is not a criticism of the other artists because they are fantastic but I feel people really enjoy the music of Rick Whaley, Jon Cook, Pat McCann and Jose Santiago.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1454428864122, "text": "Thank you for your review!

Again, I'm so very sorry this happened but I would love to try and make things right.

The markers they use to place U's on your hands WILL come off your hand if any water at all comes in contact with the ink. I was rudely stopped by a security guard about having very little markings on my hand, even though you could still see part of them. When showing him my wristband indicating I was under the age of 21 and not having a drink in my hand, I was told to follow him and was kicked out of the resteraunt (I even let him check my wallet to prove I wasn't trying anything sneaky). Was a total waste of $15 and I will never be visiting again. Staff was very unpleasant to deal with and I was threatened to have the cops called on my friends and I when I asked about their policies. Very rude and I was not happy with my experience. I was excited to enjoy live music with a few friends but was not able to do this because of the terribly rude staff.
