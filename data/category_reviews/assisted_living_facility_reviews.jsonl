I was my mother\u2019s only child and only area relative so I went there regularly to visit and check on her. But the thing that bothered and really hurt me was that after she died, no one there, and there was a lot of staff that tended to her, sent me a condolence card or called me, except for Crystal, Bless her heart.

Since posting this review, I've had a few lengthy conversations with a couple of the \"head\" personnel  at St Martin's. We have come to a mutual agreement and I am satisfied with the outcome. I am NOT removing or changing anything in my initial review, so one must proceed with care and make sure EVERYTHING is explained to you in its entirety.   ORIGINAL REVIEW: This is a LONG read, if I could rate with less than 1 star, I would, but this NEEDS to be shared!!! NEVER USE ST MARTIN'S FOR IN HOME CARE!!!!!!! I recently had to have major back surgery, and as I have no local family, I opted to use St Martin's \"in home care\".  I have NEVER used this type of service EVER, and I must say I was COMPLETELY taken advantage of and the service was HORRENDOUS . Because, I had never used this service,  I had hoped that they would understand my needs and assist me in setting this up. Oh they SET ME UP all right.  TWENTY FOUR HOUR SERVICE, even while I was in the hospital for TWO weeks.  The hospital did not let them do ANYTHING. (Hospital policy), so ALL they could do was SIT there, maybe assist in putting on those \"stupid hospital socks\" , cover me when I got chilled and uncover me when I warmed up. I had NO idea that I could PICK AND CHOOSE when I needed them. I was left with the impression that once I started their service, that I was STUCK with them until I was released by the surgeon.\nI KNEW that I would need help once I returned home, but NOT 3- 8 hour shifts. I was in the hospital almost 2 weeks and during that time the program manager was to set up my in home care. I informed her that I did NOT want a parade of different faces coming into my home. TWO WEEKS, she had to get a \"team\" put together. THIS DID NOT HAPPEN!!! When I returned home; A DIFFERENT person almost every day AND some shifts not even covered. How could I heal, if I had to STRESS every day about my care?? This is MY home, I was not capable of moving around, so I couldn't very well see what was happening around my home. The 11pm till 7 am shift was the WORST! I did NOT require anyone to WATCH me while I slept, so I PAID A LOT OF MONEY for these sitters to SLEEP, WATCH TV, AND TALK/PLAY ON THEIR CELL PHONES while I slept.\nI know that the sitters were supposed to be bonded/insured, BUT how did I know things weren't moving out of my house. YES, I have trust issues with strangers, but that is NOT the point. The POINT IS... The \"Care At Home\" program is NOT SET UP CORRECTLY, THE PROGRAM MANAGER IS OBVIOUSLY NOT WELL TRAINED IN HER DUTIES,( I heard that she hasn't been doing this long)  AND I, THE CLIENT,  feel TOTALLY abused and \"taken for a MONEY ride\".\nI could rant on & on, but I AM DONE!! I truly hope that this review opens up some eyes at St Martin's AND future clients.  <1 star!! HORRIBLE! NO EXCUSE!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888910f661fbbe1b:0x44d09ccda56ec317"}

SECOND, I nor anyone in my family has a vested (personal or business) interest in Lakeview Estates. Now for the review:\nOur mother was at Lakeview Estates on (2) different occasions. The first time was for approximately 6 months while completing rehab following (successful) cancer treatments. The facility, management and staff were excellent and it was an pleasant experience. Our mother's second \"stay\" at Lakeview was a couple of years later and this \"stay\" was for approximately 2 years. Initially, we were \"less than impressed\" with Lakeview and stated our opinions in the \"end of the year\" survey...I am sure that I was not the only one that was not happy with the facility! Approximately 6-8 weeks after the survey, a new manager was hired (Callie Simmons) and IMMEDIATELY things begin to change. First, it was the facility became cleaner, painting, new carpeting, new furniture in the lobby, etc...However, the most significant improvements were that the residents and the staff were NOTICEABLE happier (my wife told me that when the residents and the staff are smiling that this is the sign of a well managed ASL). Eventually our mother passed away; however, the staff and management at Lakeview were nothing short of WONDERFUL (in every since of the word). The staff CONSISTENTLY went \"above & beyond\" What they were required to do in the daily care of our mother. The director (Callie) was frequently in communication with us...consultations, discussions regarding the future \"care\" plans, and phone calls when problems (potential or otherwise) arose. A couple of months after our mother passed away, I went to see Callie and told her that we would like to purchase a gift for the staff and told Callie \"if it helps the residents; that is wonderful; however, we want to let the staff know of our appreciation for the manner in which they (the staff) cared for our mother.\" After thinking over this for several weeks, Callie back to let me know what the staff needed and we immediately purchased the item(s) and had these shipped to Lakeview Estates. Several times over the past couple of years, I have been asked (by my peers) \"what was our opinion of Lakeview Estates\" and I tell them (what is in this review) and then add \"as long as Callie Simmons is the director of Lakeview Estates; it will continue to be a well ran ASL that cares for its. patients.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888922b2f2f96b31:0x5179ee53183df8e9"}

He needed more care than this one provided. This facility is more for seniors who are able to prepare their own meals and don't need as much support. The facility doesn't provide 3 meals per day and does not have an RN for every shift. IMO, if the senior is in reasonably good health and just needs an occasional \"look in\", then it could be fine. I felt as the seniors needed more help with daily living activities then that's when the facility really makes their money. I will be honest and say these are my opinions and everyone knows what that means. The 2 bedroom apartment was nice esthetically,  the staff seemed nice. It just wasn't a fit for my parent.

Despite CDC and ADPH guidelines which include provisions for \u201clife and death \u201d situations; 2 men-yes, just 2 men- have put a policy in place that saw my beloved Mother leave this world and enter the next completely alone!  No husband of 66 years holding her hand.  No children or grandchildren at her bedside.  We were in the parking lot being\ncondescended to.  We were being offered a \u201cglance through a window\u201d moments before being told, in a parking lot, that she was gone.  If the roles had been reversed and any human being had tried to stop my Mother from being at the side of her loved ones as The final breath were drawn: No Earthbound force could  have stopped the Power of Love that coursed through that remarkable woman.  She would have been at my side.  I am a weaker soul than she.  I tried diplomacy.  My cries fell on ears so consumed with ego and a sense of power that the only meaningful response from the tyrant who dared only speak with me via speakerphone was  \u201c...that\u2019s how we\u2019re doing it.  That\u2019s off our best judgement.\u201d\nI posted a video on social media prior to Mother\u2019s passing, after the phone conversation, asking for support from friends and others in the community.  The calls that they place were met with hostility, rudeness, and empty promises of \u201cthe administrator will get back in touch with you\u201d.  As those phone calls were coming in and my sister was being told of Momma\u2019s passing, I was receiving cold, disdainful stares by the only staff member who could even bring herself to look in my direction.\nThere is no way this injustice can be reversed.  This beautiful creature whose pastor said in his eulogy \u201c... was a beautiful soul.  It was my privilege to be her pastor and to be her friend.  I'm not sure that I've ever known anyone who had so much love, so concentrated, deep within her being.  Every interaction I've ever had with Carolyn was permeated with love.\u201d This giant of a giver.  This Child if God.  My Mother.  I cannot change the final moments of her life.  I can, however, see that her story is told.  I can see that these individuals who slither through this life generating pain and sorrow need not be concerned if they are alone.  I couldn\u2019t be there for Momma on that day but with God as my witness, until I draw my last breath, I will live as a reminder to those who tried to diminish her that She lives in me.

No.  The nurse came into the room and basically scolded my loved one for saying \"random things\" to \"circumvent therapy.\"  A medical evaluation was requested by the family and it turns out she had low oxygen levels, fever and tremors.  Pneumonia.  Low oxygen can lead to confusion.  A skilled staff nurse would have identified this.  Two weeks later, my loved one is now deceased and I believe the neglect and mishandling of medical issues by this particular nurse is partly to blame.  I am posting this review in response to her actions.  The rest of the facility may be wonderful with amazing staff, but our experience did not include that, save the physical therapist.

I wish I could give some type of notice to close down this facility and relocate the residents that are stuck there... to some this is as close to a death sentence as possible. The best recommendation I can give anyone is to not consider this facility to provide the care for a loved one. Moving my mother to another facility was the best thing we could do for her. Diversicare of Riverchase left much to be desired. The lack of compassion and the poor communication are two of the things they should be known for. Their admin leads most of the group that treat you in a very disrespectful and unprofessional manner. If you disagree with what she has to say she will quickly threaten to write up a 30 day discharge notice for your loved one. They recently upgraded their phone system which gives you false hope of being able to get someone on the phone and have your issues resolved. Most people do not return your calls unless you have to escalate your concern by emailing or calling the number on the website. I will say that there are a couple of staff members that did assist my family, and those ladies are Vicky and Lauren. If you send your loved one here please do not send any belongings that you would not want lost or given to another resident. My mother was sent to Diversicare from a short term facility with notes from her husband (who suddenly passed away while she was in rehab). A staff member hung one of the notes on her wall and at some point it was lost and never located. In addition to a note that they placed on her wall being lost, a note inside of my mothers glasses case was lost, a cell phone was lost twice, phone chargers were lost, numerous pieces of her laundry were lost, a hard back photo book with her name and photo on the cover was lost. We were offered a reimbursement on a cell phone and book but no one ever got back with us to issue reimbursement. The most important thing they lost was MY MOTHER - she was supposed to go to the ER and I called to see which one she went to. The two staff members who had me on speaker phone were disagreeing with one another about if she was sent out or not. One finally said \"I know she went out but I can't tell you where\". 32 minutes later I had to call them back to see if they found where she was. 7 minutes of being hold I was told that she either never was sent out or already returned. No one could clearly tell me what the true story was. For an hour or more they were not even aware that she was in their facility! At one point a photo blanket of my mother with her family was lost and then found and kept in the admins office for weeks. Upon picking up some of our mothers belongings we found dirty laundry with another woman's name in it in a bag with trash, some purses and wallets that were not our mother's, etc. As our mother made it to the new facility we found that the new clothing items we took to her a couple of months prior were not sent with her. We saw our mother at doctor appointments and through zoom calls and she was wearing clothes that were not hers. I would do your loved one a favor and find any other place other than this one to send them to. REMEMBER YOU ARE THE ADVOCATE FOR YOUR LOVED ONE AND YOUR VOICE IS STRONGER THAN SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THESE CARE FACILITIES.

They can very easily rectify matters, but so far they refuse to do so. It has to do with the beauty salon.\nIf you\u2019re loved one wishes to get their hair done they may make use of the in-house salon. There is a form that the person responsible to pay the salon charges fills out. You may leave a credit card on file and you may opt to just have your card used whenever the resident wishes or be asked if you\u2019re in agreement with your family member having their hair done before being charged. This is so that a family member who is losing their mental acuity doesn\u2019t decide to go get their hair done too often, which was our situation, and we stipulated on the form that we\u2019d like to be contacted first.\nHowever, our card was charged several times with no permission request beforehand. To the tune of approximately $500.00. With our busy life we didn\u2019t catch these charges as they were incurred. Once we did see them, we called and got them stopped.  To their credit, The Blake admitted they were in the wrong. However, it has been over a year of requesting the fraudulent charges be reversed or having a check sent to us. We\u2019ve been in touch with the beauty salon, patient representatives, the facility manager and a regional manager. We\u2019ve allowed each person along the way ample time to make it right, sometimes two months before we call again, but no resolution is ever forthcoming. Now, they\u2019ve stopped taking our calls.\nWe will now pursue this with our credit card company.\nOur family member passed away in May of 2020, so they are no longer a resident. I would hate to think that is the reason we now are not even getting our phone calls answered.\nIf you\u2019re wondering why our family member passed away, it was due to the virus. We were told she was the only one in the whole facility to contract it. A subsequent email from The Blake that was emailed to families of the residents claimed to have zero cases of the virus at The Blake.\nI suppose no place can be 100% above board at all times, but these things concern us.\nPlease don\u2019t misunderstand us. We realize the virus is strange and can effect some and not others. We have no ill feelings in that regard. These things happen.
