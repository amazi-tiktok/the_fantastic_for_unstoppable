I called on November 14th to check the status of the rug. I was told \"Yes, the rug is ready, but we couldn't clean it.\" I asked her why did anyone not call me to let me know that it could not be cleaned? Basically all I got was an \"I don't know\" and some other pathetic excuse. I immediately proceeded to pick up my uncleaned rug that has just been sitting on a table for an entire week.\nFor the entire life of me, I do not understand why something as simple as a phone call did not happen. As soon as they saw that they could not accommodate, all they had to do was call and say, \"We apologize for the inconvenience, but we cannot clean your rug.\" I would have happily returned to pick up my rug and found another company to clean it. I am pretty sure that someone knew that Friday morning after I dropped off, that they would not be able to clean my rug. But NO, the rug just sat there until I called to check on it.  A simple phone call. Communication, communication, communication. Inconsideration and/or laziness. But regardless, there was absolutely no reason why I was not contacted.

I spoke with Brittney on the phone to get details of the work included and to make the appointment. To sum it up, everything except the engine! I made the appointment and wednesday was there at 8:30am as scheduled. No one was there. At approximately 9 am employees showed up and took my car. Inwas told that the credit card scanner wasn\u2019t working so I would need to bring cash.\n\nAt 430 i called and was advised my car was done. When i got there I spoke with the man cleaning the exterior of my car. I asked if they cleaned the trunk jambs as I noticed a large deposit of mud when i got groceried the other day. He said yes. I then waited about 10 minutes for my car. I watched the man open the trunk and then wipe the trunk jambs...?\n\nIt was an overcast day and the car looked good... until I got home. My chrome exhaust was still black (i rubbed with my finger and it comes off), the fuel tank door was dirty (once again my finger lifted the dirt there), large spots on the chrome grill looked untouched, large spots on the lower door panels were untouched, smears on the windshield,and spots on the rims were untouched. I paid and their CC machine did work... amazing.\n\nI have pictures and videos of all things I mentioned.\n\nI was going to just leave it alone but knowing I paid $200 for a half a$$ job didn\u2019t sit well with me.\n\nI have to say the interior was GREAT! A little excessive with the oils but you can tell they took their time and got everything looking sharp!\n\nOn Friday i called and got Brittney on the phone again. I asked for a manager and she said she would relay a message for me. I told her I\u2019m calling to complain about the detail I got... she asked for details and i told her everything. She called back a few hours later and advised that the owner/manager said i can bring the car back. I advised that i didnt have all day to leave my car to be washed and waxed again. (I highly doubt it was even waxed as there was so many spots that were unwashed... the wax would have stuck to it). I told her honestly the interior looked great and id be ok with paying for that service but need to be reimbursed for the remainder. She basically told me that wasnt an option and that thisnis how the manager handled things. He doesnt talk to customers and just has her. I explained that im offering to pay for the work that was done correctly... most customers would just want a total refund. However, if she cant authorize that and the manager wont even talk to me to settle the issue, ill just have my CC company cancel the payment.\n\nI feel sad for Brittney as im sure she is put in this situation often.\n\nMy advice, stay away.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88621257eb4fc911:0x30d2bc60e10a06b4"}

I went to the small location on Hughes, and they did a horrible job on my car. I got the $60.00 \"Supreme\" wash. This is the first time I've paid to have my car cleaned and it will probably be the last.\n\nThere is a large section on my front bumper they missed. There was cleaning product pooled in my cup holders. It looked like they had just sprayed it on in places and never wiped it off. My dash and console was all spotty, and covered in a mix of dust and cleaning spray. They did not open my hatch and vacuum the back. The front was vacuumed but not well. There was a tone of very fine loose dirt  on my from floor mats. It looked like it came from the inside of the shopvac they used to vacuum the car. I can't believe they use a shopvac for this. I have leather seats, and they did not so much as wipe them down. My back seat had dirt in it from where I had sat a pair of boots. It's still there. There are little spots all over the outside of my car. I suspect that is from the spray wax they put on. I'm not sure.\n\nThe worst part is, my car has an odor now. It smells like body odor. I think that may be from the cleaning supplies they use. I don't know. I'm cleaning my car myself this week though. I've got to get the smell out. This place is horrible.

First of all, the package was 124.00!!! So right off the back I'm thinking they MUST be excellent at their job. I was sadly mistaken! I dropped the car off in the morning after making an appointment online. I asked the guy on duty about what time the car would be done. He said \"about 1pm\". I was cool with that. So I left and went to run errands. Around 1:30pm I called the place to find out the status. The woman who answered the phone put me on hold for over 5 min so I hung up and drove to the place to see how things were going. When I got there there was an older woman complaining about a previous job they did to her car. I just remember her saying \"someone owes me 10 bucks to fix this\". Anyway, one worker sees me and says \"would you like to see your car?\" I said yes and followed him into the garage. The car STILL had the dark brown stains on the carpets! Before I can point it out he says \"I couldn't get it out. You should try dying the carpet.\" I was upset because the car also looked like they didn't vacuum well... if at all! Then there were dirt spots on my back window. The door jams were STILL dirty! The tires were dirty and the front bumper!  I ran my finger on both and lifted black dirt from those areas! They uses the wrong cleaning material on my middle console that caused paint to come off. I was very upset and dissatisfied snice I left it there for almost 6 hours already! I asked to speak with the manager. I told him this was no where near a good job for that price. After some deliberation, he agreed to knock off 25.00. This was a bit of a relief, but honestly, that was a 50.00 job (at best). THEN... about 2 hours later, that woman calls me back and says \"your car is ready for pickup\". I told her I already picked it up. She said \"oh I guess I called the wrong person\". I'm so annoyed with this place! They are so unorganized. Save your money and go elsewhere where they do a job that fits the amount that they are charging you. This was a waste of time. I would recommend Melvins On the Spot Car Wash in Florence, AL if you are in that area. He has had that business for 30 years!
