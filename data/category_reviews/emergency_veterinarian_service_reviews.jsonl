We spayed her and gave her a rabies vaccine, feline distemper vaccine, and feline leukemia vaccine. We did not test her for feline leukemia. It is not our office policy to test all adult cats. A feline leukemia test is $50. If you check your invoice, I think you will find that this procedure was not done. We make every effort to ensure that we follow the client's requests to the best of our ability. On Friday, your wife brought in 4 kittens for their first vaccinations and deworming. They each received a thorough physical exam, their first feline distemper vaccine, and a dose of dewormer. A 20% discount was applied to the vaccinations because you have 4 kittens. Your wife paid the entire bill at checkout. Angel was the receptionist that you spoke with on Thursday when you dropped off your cat for surgery as well as who you spoke to on the phone when you called back with concerns over the bill. Angel is one of our lead receptionists and does her very best to ensure that all of our clients are happy and their needs are met. Prior to this visit, you had not been in our office since 2016. Again, we are very sorry for any confusion and we wish you the best in finding future veterinary care. Sincerely, Dr. Lauren Ellenburg"}, "gmap_id": "0x8889e65014243269:0xa4e772d3ec712f62"}

This disrespectful vet had our Lab, who had been our family pet for 12 years, for the entire day. Somehow between keeping our dog for 8 hours, charging us 400$ just for bloodwork and X-rays, he failed to notice the 5 pound tumor on our dogs spleen. The tumor caused our dogs spleen to rupture in which we took to another vet in town, who was amazing and their entire staff treated us with the upmost respect and professionalism. They had to do emergency surgery for which our pup didn\u2019t make it. Aside from overcharging us, and missing the key diagnoses for the situation, he was extremely disrespectful and unprofessional to my wife and I. His passive aggressive, sarcastic remarks all of which regarding money, were almost overwhelming. Not to mention that he didn\u2019t even send any meds home with us to help my dog. Neither myself nor anyone I know in our community will be using this vet ever again. He really needs to do some self reflection and learn how to be respectful and professional all the way around.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1607195277424, "text": "Mr. Burgamy,\nWe were perplexed by your scathing review because as you left our office on Monday, Nov. 30th you thanked us repeatedly for all we had done and assured Dr. Johnston and the rest of the staff that Cooper would be returning the next day for the free treatment that had been offered. We were even more surprised by the hostile text from your father that was sent to Dr. Johnston after hours. Thankfully, your father was willing to answer our phone calls and understood our position. It has come to my attention that you may have heard a briefing between the vet and staff, which is often much blunter than the conversation between a vet and the client by necessity. Unfortunately, I believe that this misunderstanding may be the source of this perplexing review. Our staff would never speak to a client in the same manner as they do to each other as we understand that clients do not handle these situations on a regular basis. All conversation that has taken place between you and the staff at Pike Animal has been compassionate and courteous up to this point.\nI would like to assure you that our staff does not bring up money unless asked to do so by the client. We did everything in our power to help you and Cooper. I would like to remind you that we did not only offer ICU care for Cooper, which was declined, we also offered 7 days of free out-patient treatment which was also declined. We highly doubt that your other vet offered any free treatment for Cooper.\nIn veterinary medicine, there are many variables. Cooper presented as a 12-year-old Lab who could not walk; therefore, we were searching for hip dysplasia. Dr. Johnston informed you gently that as we ran more tests more health issues would be found due to Cooper\u2019s age and pre-existing health conditions. Once initial diagnostic testing had been run, Dr. Johnston did inform you that Cooper\u2019s prognosis for recovery was poor. Pike Animal Hospital and Dr. Johnston do not make these calls lightly and run every diagnostic test necessary before coming to this kind of conclusion.\nOur heart goes out to you for the loss of your beloved pet. It is unfortunate that you cannot find it in your heart to see things clearly at this time and have chosen to accuse Pike Animal Hospital of any form of neglect or misdiagnoses when so much was offered to you in kindness. We have attempted to reach out and extend our condolences as well as hear your feedback and try to put to rest any miscommunications, however, we have been met with no response. It is regrettable that you misunderstand the situation and this review is all the more disappointing. Each case presented to us is different and as such we must customize treatment accordingly, which we attempted to do for Cooper and would have been able to do better had he returned for further treatment. Please bear in mind that Pike Animal Hospital did everything we could for Cooper. Cooper was a fine dog who the staff here at Pike Animal Hospital, especially Dr. Johnston, grew to love in his short time here. We would like to offer our condolences and hope that you will be grateful for the love and memories Cooper bestowed instead of looking for someone to blame for his loss."}, "gmap_id": "0x888ded6dff28b8ed:0xdf0940acbba4f090"}

I lost a Toy Poodle that I was told had pyometra and needed to be spayed immediately. I took her in and she was extremely sick. I went to visit her, and they had her in the boarding runs, surrounded by barking dogs. I asked for her to be moved to a more quiet place, so they moved her to the cat room. A couple of days later, I came to visit her again, and they had her in a \"parvo\" kennel that was being used for storage. She died shortly after that visit.\n\nA couple of years later, I brought a Heeler in because she was throwing up. Same scenario--pyometra. They spayed her and her health continued to decline. After a few days, she was stable enough to come home. When my husband got there to pick her up, Dr Johnston said she \"crashed\" when he took her IV out. A couple of days later, the doctor recommended that we euthanize her.\n\nI came in to pay my $1200 bill and pick up my dog's ashes,  and the doctor didn't even bother to talk to me. The young man at the desk apologized and hugged me. Then he handed me a stained pillowcase with a plastic bag full of ashes. I couldn't even get a list of procedures that they did on my Heeler.\n\nIt has taken me a long time to be able to write this review. Look around the clinic when you go in. There are used needles laying on counters and the place needs to be deep cleaned. The exam rooms are full of junk, so he uses the exam table in the middle, where the public has no business going.\n\nI've been to a lot of vet clinics, and have worked at a couple. This one is sad.

Since you have chosen to remain anonymous and this event occurred years ago, I have little recollection of the specific details. I do, however, remember you said you previously worked in vet clinics before. You were shown that my equipment is constantly upgraded and all approved treatment protocols were followed. You must still be grieving to write a scathing one star review so long after the event occurred. My heart goes out to you. I would have met you at the door with your ashes had I known you were here.\nI am also very sorry that you did not have your dogs spayed. That would have prevented the deadly pyometra, not the lack of a \"deep cleaning\" which all but brand new clinics require. To ensure transparency, we do encourage clients to watch us work on their pets in our treatment area. All treatment areas have surgical instruments and needles in them. If a client does not care to watch, they always have the option to wait in the lobby. Since the time of your visit we have an entire new staff. I have shown them your review in an effort to reemphasize the importance of client communication, compassion, cleanliness, and grief management. Sometimes during upgrades to our facility, we regrettably must utilizes all the storage space including the exam room and isolation ward. Sounds like you caught us at a very busy time and we made some mistakes in those areas, but unfortunately those things could not have prevented the tragic outcome. All animals I see get the best care I can provide. Tragically, they do not all survive and I have as much trouble accepting that as you  do.\nI have been practicing for 30 years now. Losing a patient gets hard every year. Online reviews are new to me. I take them all personally and would much rather speak in person. I am very accepting and open to constructive criticism.  As you can tell by the vast majority of my reviews, that my cherished clients are pleased. I know it is impossible to please everyone and save every pet, but I do try my hardest. It breaks my heart to know how you must feel to write this review after a loss so long ago. Again, I am sincerely sorry you are still grieving and I am hurting too.\nMy very best regards."}, "gmap_id": "0x888ded6dff28b8ed:0xdf0940acbba4f090"}

I had called ahead of time. It was 11:30 pm on Christmas day 2018 when vets are closed. Including ones that are listed on Google that say Emergency. I guess it is only for emergencies that happen during business hours only!  BUT NOT HERE!!! . At ER Specialty Animal Medical Center there is ALWAYS someone there to help when no other vet is!! Be assured they are there to help your baby!! I had ( keyword had ) a vet for 25 years or more that I kept telling them something was wrong. I kept asking questions wanting answers! We tend to know when things go wrong with our babies  or when something just isn't right but I kept getting told by my regular vet \" she is just old \" . Well it was more than just old!! She should NOT have had to suffer like she did for as long as she did!! A year!! My mistake was trusting my vet and not trusting my gut instinct and taking her here a long time ago !  IF ever you need a GREAT doctor who is knowledgeable and caring or if you have a gut feeling something is wrong and you do not get the right answer from your regular vet THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO DO NOT DO AS I DID JUST GO!! I appreciate EVERYONE who tried to save my baby girl Trixie!   Thank you ALL for making a very hard and painful situation a little easier and giving me the truth so that my baby did not have to suffer anymore! Believe me I will be back to have my other baby Zeno who is also 15 years old checked out because I know you all are the best! They have more equipment than most vets! I see many negative comments about price. All I can say is I have paid way more to save a my baby only to be told after wards that I need to put him to sleep which then added more cost!! These people care about your baby not money! It is my vet of over 25 years who is in it for the money! My heart is shattered to pieces but I know my baby is no longer suffering! Dr. Hinton explained every thing and answer all my questions no matter how many or how long it took!, They do not rush me into anything! Thank you does not seem like enough! I appreciate you all more than I could express or than you know!  Love you all! Thanks again!

The lack of empathy and/or compassion is embarrassingly evident and I feel ashamed for leaving my sweet cat here to suffer overnight.

I paid a significant amount of money for \u201cintensive care\u201d so she should have been offered the diagnostic test that could have ended her suffering if I would have known. The doctor specifically discussed with me the possibility of our cat ingesting a toxin, but failed to offer this simple but easy way to determine that.

By the time we discovered the truth, the window of time to take interventions had passed. My pet was offered no chance at survival. Although I do not blame this establishment for the original cause of our misfortune, they caused undue suffering and prolonged an extremely painful death. My heart is heavy for those who bring their pets here and have to deal with the indifference and lack of overall concern for not only the pet and their suffering, but the emotional trauma and heaviness of watching a pet struggle in pain.

Next time I am driving to which ever city has an open vet close by weather it be Atlanta, Tuscaloosa, Montgomery, Huntsville or even Nashville. It would have to be life or death for me to come back to this establishment. First of all this place was absolutly disgusting. There were numerous stains on floors, walls, and medical equipment.  I would have rather been seen in a fraternity house bathroom than one of these examining rooms!\n\nNow the vet tech was amazing!She came in and had my puppy playing, rolling over for belly rubs, giving kisses to the tech, my puppy was in heaven! My vet tech was so helpful, professional, and educated I thought she was the vet! And to be honest I really wish she was! Everything was okay at this point other than the cleanliness.\n\nBut when this \"Vet\" walked in her energy was so negative I could sence it of course my dog did too. She took one look at my dog and kicled her foot in front of my dogs face and was shocked somehow when my dog did not like it. And didn't ask if she could mussle her just walked out and came back in with \"muscle\" a muzzle and a chocker collar!! My baby was terrified I should have walked out then and there! I have never seen an adult to bad with an animal in life let alone a vet.... I was so disappointed in the back of bedside manner this alone. But after only touching her belly for 10 seconds she asked no further questions, she suggested we ran some test and she scared me into it with an infomercial full of a 1000 was for my dog to die if I did not run these tests  IMMEDIATELY. Of course I pay what ever they want to run these life saving tests!\n\nAfter a miserable 6 hours in the waiting room with chairs that dont have back reats in this filty vet after forking over $675.00 in testing. They now think it is a good idea to ask if I've changed her diet recently. I had and the smart ass response I got back had me appalled. This vet asked ME, why I hadnt brought that up sooner like she was paying me to find out what was wrong with my dog!!!!!!  Of course me not being the vet who appeared to be a doing this for 60 years plus now did not think to bring it up first thing. Before the tests were complete I was sent home and told just tonchange her food back. She was fine after changing her food back of course. Something a vet should have been able to tell me over the phone!\n\nSafe to say you pay for testing up front.

Then we finally get there, an older female vet nearly had a heart attack when she roughly reached into the box where my hamster was and scared her, making her squeak very loudly and flip on her back in a defensive posture. (Hamsters only do that when they feel very threatened. I'd never seen this hamster do that before.) The vet jerked her hand back in fear, and looked extremely uncomfortable. I ended up removing my hamster from the box, wrapping her in a cloth and handing her to the vet, who then left the room with her for almost 20 minutes, which made me very uncomfortable. I've never had a vet leave the room with my animal before, I like to be there for the exam & diagnosis.

I received two calls from physicians, one after their initial exam and she thoroughly explained everything to me and offered to complete dental cleanings for them.

We took her to Dr. Price the next day because she had gotten severely worse. Within minutes he diagnosed her with an IMHA, which is a very serious, usually fatal, diagnosis. He sat down with me and explained the disease and treatment course. He stayed with her through the night while she received a blood transfusion, to ensure that she didn't have a reaction to it. He even called me late that night to give me an update. Now nine months later she is her perky self. I would never trust my pets to anybody but Oak View!

A year old border collie mix of some sort, who knows? I did my research looking for a vet and asked my friends who they recommended. Oak View came up multiple times so eventually i decided Oak View would be Max and mine's vet. I could not have been happier with the choice. They helped me take my firsts steps as friend and pet owner and made both of us feel like we were part of the family.\n\nMax didn't have his first seizure until 3 months after i adopted him. Oak View walked me through the different reasons a dog can have a seizure and laid out a plan to help moderate or even eliminate Max's seizures. Had Max's condition been epilepsy or even one of the many normal conditions that can cause seizures i can honestly say Oak View would have been able to help him. Through the empirical method we tried everything to help Max. Unfortunately Max's grand mal seizures persisted and i lost a piece of my friend after each one. Dr. Price and Dr. Robinson admitted that this may be beyond their scope and I respect them all the more for it. I took Max to Neurologists, pathologists, and almost every specialist at Auburn and in between. No one could put a finger on it.\n\nWithin a year my friend was no longer himself. Oak View helped with his final moments and the level of caring and comfort they provided i will never forget. Thank you Oak View. I can never thank you enough for the love and support you gave Max and me.\n\nIf you are debating what Vet to use i highly recommend Oak View.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1455550971601, "text": "Our sympathies on your loss - you worked hard to help him with his seizures and issues.

I knew her life was coming to a close but when I found her collapsed on the back porch one day after letting her out , she appeared to be suffering from a stroke or cerebral hemorrhage I took her to Southern Regional  Veterinary Specialist because it was the weekend and my usual Veterinarian was closed. The staff were very helpful and caring but unfortunately there was nothing that could be done except ending any pain or suffering that she may have been experiencing.  The experience was awful but the staff were very kind.\n\nA few months after this I was looking after a friends place in a rural area when I kept hearing a persistent tiny meowing from a kitten.  Unfortunately his hind leg had been pinned and severely mangled and I was afraid I was going to have to once again have to poor animal euthanized but after once again having to take the animal to southern Regional because it was the only vet open they reassured me that they could save the animals life and that he would have a good chance of having a pretty normal and happy life albeit without one limb. I choose to adopt the poor critter and spend the money to have the amputation performed. I can say that although the price was what I would describe as fairly considerable, its been by far the best choice I've ever made. The cat and I have bonded like no other animal and I have before. I am very thankful that the staff explained that the kitten would very likely survive the amputation surgery and go on to have a normal and happy life as an indoor cat. I was worried about him not being able to get around well or being handicapped by the surgery but they assured me that since he was so young he would very likely adjust and go on to adapt to not having it and indeed this is what happened.  He is very happy, loving, playful and gets around just as well as any cat I've ever had. He's very fast and can jump on a counter top with very little difficulty and has had no problems to speak of  besides not being able to scratch behind his ear very well on the affected side,  which I happily scratch for him when I see the need or he brings it to my attention.

Our 18 month old Chihuahua Pee Wee was outside on Mother's Day playing when he took off running through the woods chasing a squirrel. When Pee Wee came out of the woods he was limping and wouldn't put any weight on one of his back legs, so we took him to the vet. After having x rays done we were informed Pee Wee had indeed broken his leg and the best option with the best outcome was surgery. After having Dr. Martin at SRVS highly recommend to us the x-rays were sent over and we was told to be expecting a call from SRVS. It didn't take long before I was contacted by SRVS to set up an appointment for Pee Wee to come in and have surgery. The lady I spoke with on the phone was extremely nice and set up Pee Wee an appointment for the following day. The morning we arrived for surgery we was greeted by both ladies at the front desk and was checked in. We didn't have to wait no time before we was called to the back.\nDr. Martin discussed everything with us and we was given an estimate of what it would cost. When given the estimate it was detailed very well with the lowest and highest estimate. (Which I totally appreciated) When we checked out I was ASKED if I could pay the lowest estimate right then and told if it did go over that amount they would let me know the following day when I returned to take Pee Wee home. It was explained to me that if it ended up costing less than the lowest estimate that I paid the day of the surgery that they would refund me the difference. I appreciated the fact that I was given the lowest and the highest estimates that way I would know  about what the cost would be. A couple of hours later I received a call from Dr. Martin himself informing me off Pee Wee's condition and details of how the surgery went. I was told if I wanted he could come home the following day or he could stay an additional night if I felt more comfortable with him there. I chose to go ahead and bring him home the following morning because he was doing well and we missed him dearly. The day after surgery I returned to pick him up and Dr. Martin went over all the aftercare instructions with me and the medications given. Pee Wee is home resting now and is expected to make a full recovery! \u2665 Thank you Dr. Martin and ALL the staff at SRVS for taking such wonderful care of Pee Wee,  you've been such a blessing to our family!!!

I believe he was more concerned about how many surgeries he could do that day and how much money he could make.  Duke is a Miniature Dachshund.  They are prone to have back problems.  When he was 11 years old he woke me up about midnight in pain.  I took him to SRVS where they gave him a shot.  I spent about $200 then.  The next morning, he was still in pain so I took him back.  They gave him narcotics and put him on an IV of fluids.  He did not have access to water, otherwise. I believe they gave him too much narcotics because he was howling and did not even recognize me when I went to see him.   After a quick diagnosis, they said he needed surgery on his back near his neck.  They couldn\u2019t do surgery right away because he was dehydrated.  Dr. Martin admitted they did not give him sufficient fluids. They told me they would have to do a Myelogram.  I specifically asked Dr. Martin \u201cWhat are the dangers?\u201d  He remarked that he may hit a bone (vertebrae) and have to move the needle.  He did not say anything else or tell me of any complications.  When I confronted Dr. Martin about his answer regarding complications, his remark was \u201cMy bad\u201d, meaning himself that he didn\u2019t inform me.  That was no consolation. Duke also had seizures that I was never told could occur.  When I got upset about that, his daughter got all high and mighty like I had done something wrong.  It was only later in talking with friends that I realized how dangerous this procedure was.  In my opinion they did not take necessary precautions when administering the Myelogram, such as keeping his head elevated so that it didn\u2019t go to his brain.  The next day they took him outside to potty but said he just wanted to sit down.  This was the second lie I was told.  In actuality, his hind legs were paralyzed from the Myelogram.  Then his liver and kidneys started failing.  They put him on an IV to try to regain function but it was too late.  On the discharge papers they told their third lie.  They said that he was standing on his own.  At that point I took him to his regular Vet where they tried desperately to save his life.  The damage had already been done.  I took him home.  I took him outside and he took two wobbly steps and that was the last time he walked.   Duke lost his dignity and his pride when he lost control of his bowels and bladder.  I had to have him put to sleep the next day because of what I believe was negligence by Dr. Martin.  That just about killed me.  I knew my little boy had a few good years left.  He never reimbursed me for the surgery he never performed which to me shows just how greedy he is.  I took him to small claims court just to show him that there are consequences.  He didn\u2019t need a lawyer because the judge argued his case because he was a \u201cProfessional\u201d.  Professional or not, he lied in my opinion. I spent about $5000 at SRVS.  Of that about $3000 was for surgery.  Dr. Martin never reimbursed me a single penny for surgery that was NOT performed.  I still mourn the loss of Duke.  My only solace is that he is in Heaven.\nEverything I\u2019ve expressed here is my opinion but I believe everything to be truthful.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892927f2f2133b1:0xc87b5d9adef21328"}

Sounds to me like most of the folks were in seek of free advice. If you need after hours emergency care, you can certainly expect to pay for it. The first time I called this clinic was late at night on a weekend and I agree, the person I spoke with was definitely determined to get my commitment to pay if a Vet was coming to meet me. How many of you would get up at 3:00 AM on a Sunday morning and go to your office if you were not going to get paid? I can only imagine the frustration they experience when pet owner has a possible emergency but yet balks when expected to pay to have their pet treated. It is very expensive to obtain the education necessary to cure animals of diseases and to fix them surgically. Should they do it for free? Is it wrong to make money? There's a difference between a business and a charity. Some evidently don't realize that.\n\nI was thrilled with the care my dog received. Yes it was expensive!! So what, they saved my dogs life...Dr. Martin removed an insulinoma- a tumor from his pancreas and inspected his lymph nodes, liver, etc. for signs of spreading.\nA major surgery that included over 48 hours in the hospital. should I complain about the bill? Should it have been cheap? If your child had cancer would you look for the cheapest oncologist? Of course not. The doctors at STVS are kind, patient, and most importantly skilled. If I went to College for a decade and spent God knows how much money on those degrees, I would like to think I would be well compensated for my expertise. Try calling a surgeon at your local people hospital and asking them if you should come into the hospital or not? Come on folks....everything related to medical care, animals or people, is expensive. If you had gone in and paid the 250,  you would have received very good care for your animal!!! Thank you to Dr. Martin and the entire staff!

Naturally, I didn\u2019t had much of a choice b/c of my dog issue. The desk clerk seemed to be new at her job b/c she continued to ask surrounding vet specialist for help on every question that I asked. After basic paperwork, I was hit with an itemized bill that was x2 the cost for normal OFA x-rays and submission fees. I also had to write down my credit card information on the OFA paperwork for additional reading and filing fees (In which, I learned later this is false). Now, I fear about my credit card information. I questioned everything with little to no help. Faced with little choice at the time, I continued with the process. Before they took my dog, they asked me if I had any questions before they begin. I ask how are they going to evaluate my dog\u2019s legs to determine if it\u2019s a soft tissue or ACL damage. They replied by saying during sedation they would flex my dogs legs by feeling for full range of motion. I, again, ask how is that going to determine anything since my dogs muscle is relaxed and limped. That answer didn\u2019t settled well with me. In the mist, the desk clerk wanted me to pay upfront for the entire procedure. I questioned this action since it was unusual. She replied that it is company policy and we would credit your card if any after the procedure. I told her that I wasn\u2019t leaving my dog during his sedation (previously showed her my military card to validate personal information) and my dog is microchip with corresponding information. After the x-rays, the veterinary physician went over the x-rays. He didn\u2019t give me any answers to why my dog was having issues with his rear legs. However, he kept on saying that German Shepherds are prone to hip dysplasia. This was his go to answer for everything. He didn\u2019t provide recovery recommendations, treatment, potential future issues, or anything. I felt like I was rushed after they finished the x-rays. After paying that high bill, I asked if they had a dog gurney to ease my dog\u2019s problem but nothing. The following day (today) I reviewed this situation with the on post vet.

The Vet Dr. Hankes, needs to learn better communication skills and consider helping animals by paying his license to send out prescriptions, if this is the reason.

This review is completely unfair and not honest. Her dog was seen here four months ago. We don't know why she is suddenly writing a review. First, we don't keep pets here just to make money. We did not charge her $900 for boarding. That's just not true. Hospitalization (boarding) was charged for her pet to stay here for two nights at the cost of $108.22, which included administering the pain medication and antibiotics through the weekend. We stayed late to examine, sedate (to eliviate her dogs pain while she was positioned for radiographs), administered intravenous fluids, splinted her leg, and administer pain and antibiotic medications to her dog through the weekend. All treatments that we provided were completed at her request and signature. The charges weren't any different than would have been charged at any other clinic in Birmingham. This client was not our client and she couldn't get in at any other vet in the area late on a Saturday morning just before we closed at noon.\n\nFinally, we could not discharge her pet because he was completely asleep (sedated). It's something that vets just don't do. Bad things can happen when patients aren't kept quiet and still to rest and stabilize while under anesthesia. Also, the liability of someone driving in a hurry down the highway, slamming on their breaks and causing their dog to fly through the air and breaking it's neck is not a smart thing to allow.\n\nAlso, our honest experience had been that the surgical center doesn't see patients for routine fractures on the weekend. They are kept hospitalized at a general hospital or at the ER until Monday. The emergency hospital that is associated with the surgical center IS open 24/7 for emergencies throughout the weekend. That is probably the information that the client is referring to. This wasn't an emergency as he wasn't in shock and we had stabilized him on intravenous fluids. We literally called down there today and the technician told us that a bill for observation through the weekend for a dog with a simple fracture on intravenous fluids, antibiotics and pain medications at the emergency hospital would literally approach $2000.\n\nSo, we saved this client over $1000, saw her dog when nobody else would, stayed late and provided high quality medicine, and did what was best for her dog.\n\nThis review is not honest or accurate and should be removed."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889046cf4f5b825:0x6863f15c86bf3033"}

We strive to give our clients and their beloved pets the best experience we can offer. Your sweet baby Mercedes came in on 7/14/20 for a spay, which went perfect. Unfortunately the morning after her surgery, we noticed that she was vomiting a little, which we immediately informed you about. When we spoke with you about the vomiting, our associate suggested treatment, which you approved. The relief veterinarian that was on duty thought a fecal exam (stool sample) would help us to be sure that there were no other issues associated with her vomiting, which may have been miscommunicated (we gladly refunded this nominal fee). With this test we did find that Mercedes had hookworms, which can be associated with vomiting in many pets. We informed you of her results and suggested we deworm her. At that time you declined that service. At pick up the receptionist informed you of all charges before finalizing any payment, which at that time you agreed to with no questions asked or problems. When we spoke on 7/16/20, two days after your sweet baby had her surgical procedure to discuss your overall experience, to our surprise you told us that you were unsatisfied with our services. At that time you stated that when you first called for a price quote you were quoted $129 for the spay and were also told that included an IV catheter. This could not have happened as all of our receptionist have been on staff for quite some time and know that these procedures are not included in the surgery fee. I think what happened (because it happens a lot) is that you truly wanted these important protective measures for Mercedes but it all added up to more than you expected it to be with the treatment for the vomiting and nausea. Also, on the sheet that you filled out with the list of recommended pre-surgical procedures such as blood work and IV catheter, the price is clearly stated next to it. Plus there is a box to check yes or no as to whether you wanted the procedure or not right next to the price. Why would we ask you to chose yes or no if it was already included? We refunded you over $107 (which we didn't have to do) as a gesture of good will and you still remained upset and gave us a negative review. Bottom line is that you chose the added procedures which were performed."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889046cf4f5b825:0x6863f15c86bf3033"}

BEWARE!!!\n\nSo to start this off please understand, I am not a medical professional, however I professionally remove and rehabilitate wildlife. I am very experienced in just about all wounds, injury's, illnesses, and human harm caused by domestic and non-domestic animals.\n\nI have recently adopted a Dutch Shepherd, my primary vet for all of my inquires is Mercy Hospital(whom in my experience I would trust with my own life!)\n\nMy dog was a rescue, obviously covered in parasites from previous settings.\n\nI explained the situation to the profession under review( my wife made this appointment due to the ease involving COVID-19, as mercy was booked)\n\nKeep in  mind as a wildlife professional, I have already assessed my dogs illness.\n\nThe main reason for a vet was to acquire a  accurate heart worm test.\nWhen handing over my beloved Dutch shepherd I caught myself telling the vets office about her harmless  Sinus Arrhythmia Heart Rhythm(very common in dogs while sleeping)\n\nLonger story shorter, the vet personally talked to me telling me that my dog has a serious heart murmur, and attempted to sway me into the tests to verify. I already knew with no doubt there is not a heart murmur.\n\nThe doctor himself turned into a upselling salesmen attempting to use sympathy to sway me into purchasing tests. I am also a licensed insurance producer for Alabama so I am very aware of salesmen tactics, and I will say he tried. He tried very hard in his sympathetic approach claiming I need to do it now, its very serious.\n\nI then proceeded to my normal vet at Mercy Hospital for a second opinion. My Vet listened to my dogs heart for an extended period, as well as got another in house vet to listen as well as me, we all concluded there is no murmur and the heart is in great condition, afterword's ran tests to conclude.\n\nThis goes to show, don't try to scam people on sympathy, you never know how educated the other party is in your field.\n\nAlso as a consumer warning always be weary of ratings when choosing a service, especially when life is involved, a huge amount of services either pay for reviews, or pay there employees a commission per 5 star review.\n\nI wouldn't use a dishonest practice such as this, but I also can not say my mentioned vet is your best choice, I only speak from personal experience.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1591036913227, "text": "We unequivocally and absolutely DO NOT upsell unneeded diagnostics at this hospital! We offer and provide medically what is appropriate for each pet. We are sorry that Mr. McAllister did not have the experience at our clinic that he wanted. Due to the accusative and completely unfair nature of his review, we must clear up numerus false assertions that he has made. We have reviewed the chart from his dog's visit with the doctors and staff involved. After discussing, all involved remembered clearly the visit. To say that we use sympathy to perform inappropriate diagnostics is completely inaccurate and unfair.\n\nFirst, he requested (just like any other clinic, our receptionists write down EXACTLY on the chart what the client requests for us to do) to have his dog examined because lately she had been mopey. That was his exact words. The primary request was not to have a heartworm test performed. That was a secondary request.\n\nSecondly, his dog had a heart murmur and wasn't feeling well. That is something very different than a sinus arrhythmia which is completely benign. The further cardiac diagnostics that we offered to fully assess the heart condition in a rescue dog was completely indicated (remember this is a rescue in which the medical history is unknown) and was the best medical practice for this dog. Sometimes diagnostics that are performed come back normal and that is great but it doesn't mean that the diagnostics weren't indicated. All vet hospitals offer tests that commonly come back normal.\n\nBoth of our doctors have been out of vet school 24 and 47 years respectively and are very capable of diagnosing heart problems. They do not offer diagnostics that are not indicated but they do offer the best medical diagnostics and treatments for all pets. Do some pet owners decline to have offered diagnostics performed. Yes, every hospital experience this on a daily basis. Do some murmurs come and go? Yes. Did this happen in this case? Maybe.\n\nAlso, why did the other clinic go ahead and do the further diagnostics if it wasn't indicated?? The answer is that they were indicated! Unbelievable! The diagnostics that we offered were indicated.\n\nSo we were presented with a large breed dog that was approximately 5 years old (which makes it middle aged) and had been RESCUED. Dogs that have been rescued commonly have heartworms because they haven't receive proper care which includes heartworm prevention. If it had heartworms they very well could have and commonly can cause a heart murmur.\n\nBottom line: for someone untrained in the veterinary field that rescues and rehabilitates animals to accuse us of using sympathy and scamming people to increase diagnostics is deplorable. The other clinics in the area know we don't do this just as we know they don't practice this way either. This clinic has been here for over 45 years and the current owner has owned it for the past 15 years. We have a great reputation and thousands of happy clients.\n\nThis review is a good example of LIBEL and is illegal. It should be removed!"}, "gmap_id": "0x8889046cf4f5b825:0x6863f15c86bf3033"}

BYW, please don't tell Sasha she's a c-a-t.  Sasha was adopted from All Creatures 12 yrs ago as a 6 wk old when Dr. Allen held the reins and my son was a lab tech.\n\nWith the arrival of Dr. Hankes (and my son was gone to college), as you can imagine there were questions about the changes coming.  I have been so very pleased with the continuation of great services and getting to know another vet who is not only a well trained physician but truly loves all the pets that come in and wants the very best for them and their guardians.  The big bonus is that Denise (Sr. Lab Tech), who Sasha usually sees - and Sasha's very shy, has won over my baby and even has her choosing to stay with Ms. Denise instead of me after injections and exams some days.  That says A LOT for the caring ways of the team at All Creatures and who they are as crew members/care givers not just employees..\n\nRecently, Sasha had a period of rapid weight loss after getting a kidney issue under control and Dr. Hankes found that she had a growth on her thyroid as well as fluid around her heart causing breathing issues.  She was a very sick little girl.  Dr. Hankes treated her heart and brought it under control and within a period of weeks.  Dr. Hankes, teamed with Dr. Hall, was then able to remove the problematic portion of the thyroid and the growth.  Now 4 wks after surgery, her heart is doing well - she's gaining weight and running round the house like a wild 4 yr old instead of a 12 yr old.  Dr. Hankes and Dr. Hall did a great job with the surgery, the staff let Sasha recouperate in her basket with a blanket from home and are now keeping a tabs on her for a while to make sure her remaining thyroid is functioning properly.  Thanks to their great care, we're looking forward to many more years together.\n\nI have recommended All Creatures to my family, friends and new neighbors who are in need of a vet and have for years and hope you'll see them, too.  I don't know of any Pet Hospital around where you can get the top quality care PLUS the Super Care Givers that are on the team with Dr. Hankes at All Creatures Pet Hospital.  You'll be glad you've found one of the gems of not only Gardendale but the Greater Birmingham/Jefferson Area.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889046cf4f5b825:0x6863f15c86bf3033"}

Dr. Farmer is a wonderful vet and I have used him for years. However recently we saw Dr. Bearden. I cannot recommend her under any circumstances. My dog had an obvious deformation in her leg after an accident. Dr. Bearden put her in a splint, took X-rays and told us she would send them to a surgeon. Each week we went back and the treatment plan/diagnosis/story changed. The staff would tell me something different than she did each time. She never sent the X-rays to a surgeon. 6 weeks this went on. (Shame on me for letting it go on so long) On the last visit the dog was dropped off 7am, at her request, for observation without the splint. She didn\u2019t look at the dog or remove the splint until I called at 1:30 for an update. At 3:30 she claimed the dog only had \u201cliganitis\u201d but was still not putting weight on the leg. When I asked about the \u201cdent\u201d she claimed I had never told her about it. Not true, and it was easy to see on the dog\u2019s leg. She wanted to give the dog back without a splint. I had the staff splint the leg and took the dog to another vet. She had to have a metal plate surgically implanted to fix the damage. Because of Dr Bearden\u2019s poor diagnostic skills, I cannot recommend PC Animal Hospital unless you see Dr. Farmer.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888962c804fbec89:0x71ba20c35393e330"}
