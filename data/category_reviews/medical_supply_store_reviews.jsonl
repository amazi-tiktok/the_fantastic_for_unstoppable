Well today it is 3 pm and there is no Fed Ex package of my medicines that I need.  I tried to explain this to the Pharmacist, Michelle.  I thought she might be educated and actually have feelings about other people that are going through problems due to their lack of CUSTOMER SERVICE. At the least, they should have called me to explain.  She got very angry and before hanging up, starting yelling \u201coh my God, I can\u2019t believe...

But, since Woodbury has been taken over by 180 it's just not the same. It's been one issue or another. It's very impersonal. And even worse since covid. I'm beginning to feel discriminated against by my daughters status of being medwaiver & medicade. It's been many months since we've received our approved amount of gloves. I was patient @ first understanding the shortage. There's no longer a shortage. I'm seeing gloves for sale all over nowadays. We live on less then $800./mth. If I could afford to buy them we wouldn't need medicade to provide them for caring for my special needs daughter who is total care. She has had MRSA. Gloves are needed for sanitarilly cleaning her during multiple daily diaper changes as well as mouth care multiple times a day. I've even spoken to a 180 manager concerning putting our caregivers @ risk. Yes, the manager sent 2 extra boxes that 1 time. Then right back to shorting us our alloted approved amount. I'm beginning to believe they are holding back our gloves so they can sell them for higher prices to those who can pay for them. I'm beginning to believe they do not care about our situation and only care about the money they can make from other customers. Then this month they don't send the wipes needed for my daughters care & don't even bother to notify us as to why. We'd just go without if I hadn't called them desperate to know where are the wipes? Back order, only choice given was to wait till next month (go without) or accept an insufficient amount of little tiny baby wipes! My daughter is a 29yr old Adult!

I work for a nursing home and was pregnant and had to buy new scrub tops and they only had one in stock and had to order another one. So they were both already paid for and I ended up not going back to pick it up right away I went back after I had my baby which was only a few months later that I came back to pick my shirt up that I have paid for already. I was told that I couldn\u2019t get my shirt bc it had already been so long since I bought it and that I also couldn\u2019t get my money back and I was never told ever that I had to pick it up by a certain time or I wouldn\u2019t be able to get it and would lose out on a 34 dollar scrub shirt. I was told well it\u2019s on your  receipt. I\u2019m sorry but not very many people read the small fine print on their receipt so if y\u2019all are going to make such a rule that someone can\u2019t get what they paid for if u don\u2019t pick it up within a certain time it would be nice for that to be told to us before we purchase it. So we can be sure to send someone to pick it up if we can\u2019t make it there. I just think it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous that I am now out 32 dollars for something I had no clue about. So they told me they put my shirt back in inventory which means they resold my shirt and just got double the one for that one shirt. I also called to ask for a manager which they were suppose to have call me and it\u2019s now been over a week and I have yet to hear from a manager.\n\n***UPDATE I never said exactly how many months it had been bc I didn\u2019t know exactly how long it had been but what I don\u2019t understand is that I never was told them I only received a text stating that it was at the store a few times never said I had to pick it up by a certain date and I have a different number now so that may could have been a reason why I may not have gotten anything saying I had to pick it up by a certain time I didn\u2019t think it really matter or would hurt for it to sit there considering it was paid for already but it\u2019s fine it\u2019s a loss Its no big deal I just felt like If y\u2019all send stuff back and are gonna do that u should tell everyone before it is every purchased. And I never spoke to a manager or was never told it was a manager I called back the next day after I went to try and pick it up and was told I\u2019d have someone in contact with me about it and never heard back from anyone. I never said I didn\u2019t get a 20 percent discount that isn\u2019t the point I still paid what I\u2019m required to pay so that discount shouldn\u2019t matter in this situation. But it\u2019s fine I honestly don\u2019t want the shirt anymore i just felt it wasn\u2019t handle professionally and should have been told to me before I ever bought the shirt then I would have been sure to have my mom or husband go get the shirt. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t know one shirt would take up that much room.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1563897058541, "text": "I\u2019m the owner and this doesn\u2019t sound right at all.  Let me check into this please.\n\nHi, I checked into this and found out that you ordered this top in January, 7 months ago and our records indicate several phone calls, text messages and emails to you with no response.  Our last attempt to contact you was at the end of May, 5 months after you ordered and stating we\u2019d hold it another 2 weeks but if you didn\u2019t pickup, it would be sent back to the vendor.  When we send a garment back to the vendor and only because we don\u2019t carry that item in the store and don\u2019t have room; we are charged a 20% restocking fee plus UPS & Fed Ex want pickup for less than $12.  So, restocking fee, shipping charges and employee time spent on your purchase does not equal a double profit but rather a loss.  Plus, you payroll deducted and got a 20% discount.  We work very hard to please our customers.  I also talked to the manager and she spoke with you in person on Saturday.  I personally check my receipt for store return policies before going and specially would look if it had been 7 months."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4308a448a9e5:0x15e6b9804f42bc3d"}

A friend drove me from my MD visit over to this merchant  and I hobbled inside.  I knew I would need to present my insurance information cards and make a payment.\n\nThe employee desks are situated at the very back of the room beyond the product displays. \"For sale\" reclining and lift chairs are located to the left,  then there is a huge group of walkers, wheel chairs, bathing safety seats etc located in the middle section of the store. Neither employee visible got up when we entered the store.\n\nAn employee called out something to us from the desk area.\n\nMy friend encouraged me to sit in the first reclining chair but as it was a floor product I hesitated to do this and  continued towards the back of the store towards the employees.  One of the employees finally said, \"you can sit in one of those chairs\".\n\nI AM trying to make a long story short.\n\nI ended up buying a cast boot, but they informed me that they did not take my insurance so I paid out of pocket for the item.\n\nThe first boot they tried on me was way too big and they quoted me a price of $89.00 for the item.\n\nIn the end they sold me a higher valued, smaller product at close to the price they originally quoted, so I will give them credit for honoring the price they quoted. That is why 2 stars rather than 1 star. (I think the real reason I got the lower price was because my friend advocated for me regarding the price. I could not hear what was said,  because I was still sitting over against the wall in a recliner,  and my friend was over at one of the staff desks.)\n\nThe staff did not appear to know or understand their products very well and did not really explain much about the boot I bought. They were not gentle or accommodating of my injured foot which was covered in a sock, but swollen and quite painful. The boot was not put on my foot/leg correctly. The tops of the two rigid metal posts that are covered in a hard, rough, scratchy Velcro product were up above the padding of the boot.  After a bit of struggling by the employees, I really just wanted to finish the process and get out of the store. My foot hurt and nothing they were doing was helping at all.  Later, after I got home,  my husband and I looked at the picture on the cast boot box.  The picture clearly showed the boot padding extending up above the two rigid metal posts.\n\nThe posts had already sanded away the skin on both sides of my calf/shin. My husband reassembled the boot correctly and put it back on my foot after putting bandages on the two sores on my calf.\n\nThis store needs to rethink the showroom set up. The employees and their desks should be located near the door.  I realize that their product storage and office space are located at the back of the store but they ARE selling medical devices for customers who probably have some kind of limitation. The employees are the ones who should be making the trek across the store. It might also be a good idea for them to have a wheelchair available just inside the door that they could direct a customer to, if needed,  as soon as they entered.  This would be another advantage to the employees being stationed near the door.\n\nLet me be clear. No one was rude to us, but, no one seemed very concerned either. The first girl who tried to help us must have been new and was not familiar with the  boot products.\n\nThis necessitated a second, presumably more experienced staff member also assisting us. The second staff member was pretty obviously not pleased that she had to become involved and was very abrupt with the first staff member.\n\nAll in all it is not an experience I would repeat.\n\nAfter I got home and was finally comfortable with the cast boot, I looked up cast boots on Amazon and I could have gotten a comparable or even better product at half the price. And, Amazon has great customer service.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886266179711a56d:0x909b87d6f07bead6"}

I drove 12 hrs. To get here only to find out at 1130pm. That part of my cpap mask was left at home 12hrs. Away.

My son and I called and left messages hoping that someone would call back.\n\nTheir advertisement said that after 12pm that their recording system would call back in the morning.

I am very sorry you feel that our company is not providing the hospital bed and wheelchair because of being \u201cworried that they will not get their money\u201d.  That is not the main issue in this case, however.  Being paid for the equipment is important to us but most importantly is the medical necessity for the items provided.  Medicare has specific guidelines that we must follow in providing equipment that is ordered and if we do not follow them, not only payment is not received but it opens us up to potential Fraud and Abuse issues with Medicare for billing items that the medical records do not support.  Our Store Manager, myself and another clinical person reviewed the records and documents we have received from the physician\u2019s office who is ordering the equipment and what we have so far, does not show medical necessity for the bed and chair.  We have asked for records that do support it and as of date, not received anything that does.  It is not our desire to withhold needed equipment from anyone who needs it, but we are compelled to follow established guidelines that support it which as of now, not supported by records in our possession.  We would be happy to schedule a meeting with the customer and/or yourself, if you are a designated representative, to provide a copy of the medical necessity requirements and discuss how the records we have compares to the requirements.  Please feel free to contact our local store and let us know when a good time would be.

I have had no experience with any other department of this company.  With that being said the CPAP department is concerned only with a dime and customer service is a myth.  Stay away.  After dealing with them numerous times over the last year, the only thing that has been extremely clear is Jason believes and makes it known to his customers that their insurance never pays enough for his services.  Somehow you end up leaving feeling like this is your (the customer\u2019s) fault and you should be proud to be in his mere presence, since you haven\u2019t paid for it.  This is brought up every time you conduct business with him. If you don\u2019t want to accept certain insurances, then don\u2019t.  However, no one needs to hear your continuous unprofessional whining.  All of this can be tolerated until I am denied a report being emailed to me that is required for my job and my families livelihood, without paying them first for a report they already agreed to provide....for a report, my report that Jason told me I could call and get with no issues when I received my machine.  This issue has since been elevated through my insurance company and was informed this is not allowed.  In my experience, customer service doesn\u2019t call Deep South Home Medical Equipment home.
