I contacted her over two months before my baby would arrive, to see if scheduling would work for a newborn shoot. She responded with an email of her package pricing and the services provided. My wife and I felt we could work with her, so I replied letting her know the package we wanted, and if she would be able to also do the maternity shoot for my wife. I made attempts to contact her via phone for a conversation to fully understand her process, and communicate what we were looking for. Getting her on the phone was nearly impossible. The failed attempts were due to her workshop held in Canada in late April. I made additional calls, with no success, and no capability of leaving a voicemail, as hers was full. My only other option was to send another email. She replied a few days later in between her workshop with one available day in May for the maternity shoot. She did say it would be difficult to fit my wife in for the maternity, but would try. My wife and I initially agreed to the date, and Amy sent an email with an invoice. Throughout this whole interaction, no phone conversation took place. I paid for the maternity shoot in full since the date was about 3 weeks out, and placed a deposit for the newborn shoot. I did this to make sure we could get on her calendar, despite still not talking with her. After I paid her, I still was not able to make contact to coordinate the maternity shoot. I also made her aware that we live in the metro Atlanta area, and would be driving to her. Due to the lack of communication, and not being familiar with the Auburn area, her studio, caused my wife and I to cancel. Again, not being able to get her on the phone to communicate this, I texted her to about a week and a half prior to the maternity shoot to cancel. I asked if the balance I paid could be moved to a larger newborn package, and she was pleased to do so. Fast forward to June 14, I contacted her to let her know the exact date our baby would be born, understanding that we would finally have a phone conversation. Still no success on that front. She responds with one date for the newborn shoot that did not work for my wife and I. I then asked if she would be able to do the shoot on a different day, and that too did not work for my wife and I. It wasn't until I sent her an email letting her know I wanted to cancel everything was when we finally spoke on the phone. I let her know I wanted all my money back and explained the reasons why. She offered no apology, no option, only another date, that still did not work. Her only response was to take it up with PayPal, so I did. I never write reviews of this length, or do review at all, but Amy brought this on herself. She texted me 3:50 AM, then again at 5:03 AM, clearly upset about the outcome of the PayPal dispute. If she did not decide to harass me, and move on, I would have done so as well. There is always 2 sides to a story. I disclosed everything to PayPal, also citing that I was not provided any contract, offered three dates, that did not work, and minimal communication from Amy. Writing all of this took time I did not want to give do so, but having worked with multiple business owners and professionals from different industries, Amy lacks attributes of a business owner. Primarily that of being ethical. Doing research provided me insight on what Amy's true passion is, and that is holding workshops. He lack of availability is due to the abundance of workshops she is scheduled to hold. If she disclosed this material information to me from the very beginning, I would have made the decision to work with her or not. There are so many workshops planned for the remainder of this year, as well as 2020, both domestically and internationally. It's also clear that workshops are her passion, when 100% of her positive 5 star reviews are from workshop attendees.

I was more than professional and when he cancelled his maternity session I was more than happy to let him transfer that money to his newborn session. This is after sending pictures of all of my maternity gowns and giving him several dates for his maternity session. They simply didn\u2019t want to make the trip to Auburn. I was more than flexible by giving him 3 available dates for the newborn session. Baby hasn\u2019t even been born yet! His assumptions about workshops are false.

They were extremely professional and friendly and could make even the most camera shy person feel comfortable. We appreciate their hard work and dedication and could not imagine having anyone else shoot our special day! Our pictures turned out so amazing! Nick takes time to meticulously pick the best photos from your special day and edit them to perfection.

I can't lie I was extremely nervous the whole 3 hour drive, but from the moment I walked in all of the fear melted away and I felt so comfortable and at home in the studio.\n\nI am a plus size mother of two. I don't remember a time in my life where I felt attractive or sexy. I went into this with a fear of not liking any of my photos and I had prepared myself to leave feeling like I wasn't good enough to get a single picture that would make me feel any differently about myself.Boy was I wrong!\n\nHours of being treated like a celebrity with hair and make up and getting my pictures taken was the most amazing gift I have ever given to myself. I left the studio feeling like an absolute QUEEN!\n\nWhen I sat down to pick my pictures I was amazed and even bumped up my package because I couldn't pick a favorite. The amount of confidence I gain in my hours at Hello Boudoir studio is well worth the money and time spent.\n\nMy advice to anyone who might be on the fence about doing something like this is to just jump in head first! I promise you won't regret it! I couldn't have picked a better studio to experience this with.\n\nMy photos are amazing, sexy, and classy.

Correspondence was quick and she provides a tremendous amount of information up front to help you prepare.  As this is her niche, her studio is set up accordingly to make for a wonderful experience. What I like best is you see, pick and choose which photos and products you want immediately after the session. How many times did you wonder, wait, and then never proceed with placing an order for something?  She was also willing to help work with me on a short time frame as I procrastinated and was in a crunch.

During that time, I texted him to gain an understanding of what the cost would be. He asked a few questions and then never got back with me. Since I had used him on 2 other occasions (most recently 9 months ago) and his prices were reasonable... and this session would be no more work than the previous sessions, I didn't press the issue and figured we would just discuss it later. Well..when I texted him a month before the event to confirm my date, he mentioned he noticed he had never responded to my text regarding the price.  After asking a few more questions he came back with a price of $800?!?!?!??? This is almost as much as I paid for my wedding pictures and they were ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS with tons of editing (much better than any session that we had with Joel). I have spoken with several licensed photographers since this time and NONE of them charge anywhere near this high. Going price for this type of session was $150-450 for a 1-2 hr session and digital photos (Max). Unfortunately this put me in a real bind because now it was extremely hard to find another photographer that was available for my date. Joel mentioned he would come down to $550...but this was still higher than \"average\". This high pricing also was not in line with the pricing on his website. Although he did not have Maternity specifically listed, he had Engagement Sessions for the same length of time (2 hr session and digital photos) for $400 and this was synonymous to my requested session since it would be only me and my husband for a couple of hours. Given that he put me in such a stressful bind at an already stressful time in my life, I would definitely NOT recommend him. I tried to work out the pricing with him to be more reasonable and even explained my issue of having troubles finding someone else this late...but he was unwilling to work with me...even though he knew that it was his fault because he never answered my text regarding pricing 3+ months ago. Do yourself a favor...use someone who responds to text messages and honors pricing listed on their website. At a minimum,  select someone who is willing to take responsibility when they make a mistake...that unfortunately does not appear to be Joel at Yellowhammer. :(", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1562982443833, "text": "Thanks for taking the time to share your feedback.

I also wear it in a single braid a lot, so she did it in a way that would look rainbow even braided (she did a great job of asking all the right questions to understand how i wear my hair and what my hair goes through on an 'average day/week' so it will look great and last!)\n\nI come from decade-plus of manic panic/punky/etc I did on my own hair (no major bleaching, as that scared me, my hair isn't that dark so high pigment darker colour vivids worked fine) I was just too worried to mess it up to do a rainbow on my own head.

Our scanning service, whether Proof or Archive level, includes the utilization of dust removal software, which can remove superficial debris and blemishes on the scanned images.\nOur technician specifically noted the high concentration of dust on your slides before scanning your slides.  Prior to scanning your order, our tech  attempted to manually clean each of your slides by hand to remove the dust and lint you described.  Unfortunately, dust and lint are often stuck to the film itself and may not be removed except by rewashing or physically wiping the film with a chemical solution.\nWe are generally unwilling to do such aggressive cleaning, out of fear we might damage our clients irreplaceable originals.  More often, if the condition of the originals is so bad that our usual cleaning and post-production are insufficient, we can do restorastion to the scanned images.  This digital retouching is not inexpensive, but for extremely valuable or badly deteriorated images, it is often the best option.\nAgain, we're sorry to hear you were not completely satisfied with our service.  We would welcome the opportunity to regain your confidence."}, "gmap_id": "0x88891a5120593795:0x418ab9e005e5647d"}

I haven't lived in the area in 15 years, but wanted to get married at home and was forced to book strangers to carry out my day (super nerve racking). I booked  without consulting my father because I didn't want to risk Munoz Photography being booked. My dad has no idea what anything cost, and was blown away by photography cost (not in a good way). If this is what you are thinking after speaking to photographers, meet with Marc and Jessica. They are artist, they know photography, but they also know weddings like no other vendor I spoke too. After my dad met with them he asked me if we were paying them enough. DON'T SKIMP ON YOUR WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER! People said this to me and I rolled my eyes, but now I am right there with them. I just didn't understand the role a photographer played on that day, and now I know it is a big one. These pictures help me relive that day over and over, and they are so beautiful! My husband and I are not comfortable in front of a camera, and Marc made us look like picture taking pros. His team is extremely professional and were a blast to be around. Speaking of planning, I can be super detail oriented and know what I want and don't want. The best thing I did was  listen to Marc and his suggestions. If I wouldn't have listened to him, I would have missed out on some of my favorite photos. Marc has scouted great photo ops and knows the area very well. My day would not have been the same without Marc, his family, and his team. You want someone who can help you have fun, and thats what his team does. Then you get magazine worthy photos to remember the day. Don't hesitate- book this guy if he is available. You will absolutely not regret it. Thank you Munoz family.
