They proceeded to go back over the truck and clean it up.  I told them to make sure the front side of the mirrors were clean.  I noticed what looked like steel wool laying on the table next to where they were washing.  Didn't think much about it, but when I got home and looked at my truck again, my drivers side mirror looked like they had used the steel wool to try and get the bugs, etc. off the mirror.  I called to speak to the owner and he won't call me.  I sent them a message on Facebook asking for the owner to call me.  I was read, but no one ever called.  I guess I'll have to take the truck and attempt to have the mirror buffed out or repainted, at my cost.  This carwash is garbage and the ownership is pathetic.

I live about an hour and a half away so I really love it!  I did all my negotiating via email and set up a test drive appointment. Very, very, easy sale for the company. My biggest disappointment is the fact that the car was filthy when I arrived and the battery terminals were severely corroded. I am convinced nobody from the service department even looked under the hood until I made them.  I wanted the terminals cleaned,  I wanted an oil change,  all fluids topped off and a cabin air filter change (Very minimal requests for a car dealership) I stated it would have to be detailed inside. The detail department worked on it but they would only be there until 12 or 12:30. So we concluded our business (paid cash) and I went to lunch without the car.  Well by the time I got back the headliner was much cleaner but it smelled terribly in the car (like stagnant mop water). Nothing else was even wiped down and unfortunately the detail department was gone. There was sticky crusted disgusting something in all the buttons so some would stick in certain positions. Literally the battery terminal was only brushed with a wire brush to knock off the corrosion. I don't think the oil was changed. When I got home the oil did not appear new. I think they put new on top of the old then they mixed together. The cabin air filter was not changed. I removed it to check because everytime I used recirculated air instead of fresh it smelled bad. It has a new one now and it no longer has an odor.\n\nMy salesman was okay, but seriously the easiest commission ever. Wish I would have at least gotten an after the sale phone call. Just to check in. Would have made me feel better about the other issues.\n\nMy complaints are only directed to the service and detail departments.\n\nI am now looking for a truck in the $20,000 range (same as my Maxima) and I am not even looking at this company now.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb264d8d2482b:0xf6be7f6160faedaf"}

After going through this ridiculous process of trying to prove my income for 2-3 hours and trying to be put in a car  the finance company wanted me to have. I was exhausted, over it and ready to leave. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, someone decided to make a big deal out of nothing. My children went ahead of me and went to the door. They were holding the door for each other and then was holding it for me, waiting for me to catch up and come out. Before I got to the door they were approached by a lady. She told my children to either go out the door or go find their moma or daddy and they they were letting the air out. I was appalled!! I asked her what was the problem. I asked her name and she mumbled something and I asked her again and she told me she didn\u2019t owe me an explanation!!  Come to find out she was the owner. The salesman walked up to me try to find out what was going on. She began to butt in, so then the gentleman walked me out the door to discuss it. it started to rain, he offered to grab an umbrella for me. We make our way into the building and the owner runs up to the salesman and tells him he is her employee and He better not walk me out the door. How pathetic and nasty can a human be over nothing!!\nI\u2019m sick of people  acting ignorant for no reason towards me. So needless to say I left all deals on the table and vowed to make it known that I would never spend a dime with a company that doesn\u2019t value my business or dollar. So it\u2019s above me now!!\n\nAnd so far from what I hear the cars are junk! A friend of mine bought a van and the alternator went out 2 days after she purchased it.\n\nOh and if you plan on buying a car using your business name don\u2019t waste your time.

The interaction that you have detailed is very contrary to what our records indicate. While our technician did arrive late due to some issue with our equipment, he in fact communicated same.  At the time, you indicated that, that was in fact ok.\nWhenever we engage prospective customers whether over the phone or in person we always go over their expectations i.e. what they want cleaned and how they would like to see it look. We are then able to guide their expectations based on our own expertise. In your interaction with our technician, Martez, he indicated that your home was in fact badly oxidized and that with pressure washing it may become more evident in some parts than others. He further explained that oxidation is not caused by pressure washing  but in your case it was because of aging paint.  At the end of the service, you indicated that everything was in fact 5 star quality and you did leave a 5 star review to indicate such. It is therefore, quite unsettling that weeks later, you would call making such accusations about our professionalism and conduct thus purposely defaming our company.\nWith that said, we cannot stand responsibility for an issue for which our workman was not culpable.

Tsunami pressure washed my brick home, the driveways, and sidewalks. Who knew that we would become two of the most beautiful homes on the block. Our houses which both sit on the corner are head turners because of Tsunami. They are now turning the heads of neighbors, visitors, and passing cars because of the clean, beautiful, and stately appearance of our properties. Tsunami is our only choice for pressure washing. Tsunami's service moved our property from diamond in the rough to two very precious jewels.The proof is in the outcome...sheer perfection. I recommend Tsunami to transform your personal residences or your investment properties. They will give your property the face-lift it deserves to sell or rent quickly, or to just personally enjoy.

So here's a more objective review:\n\nOut of the detail shops in Mobile, AL, this is -currently- the one I recommend. The staff is professional and courteous, but more importantly, they speak with you at-length about the services you want, your ultimate expectations, and what can be realistically done. Goals are established up-front, and you leave knowing what to anticipate, and the final cost.\n\nI brought in a 2011 Hyundai Sonata GLS with tan cloth interior to have a full interior detail performed, but with a focus on getting the seats as clean as possible; all other matters were secondary as far as I was concerned. They were familiar with the type of cloth material used and warned me up front that there was a good chance they couldn't get them back to perfection, but that when they were finished, they would be as clean as is reasonably possible. In the end, they were right: the seats came out still looking a bit dingy, but clean enough you could eat off them. That's all I could ask for.\n\nI did, however, have a bit of an issue with the UV protection performed on the plastics in the interior: The panels were left looking greasy, slick to the touch, and with smear stains on smoother plastics. I had to go over certain areas with a microfiber cloth to remove the excess, especially the pedals, which were slick enough to pose a danger while driving. I understand in this region, there is an appeal for glossy interior finishes, but coming from a background of using matte-finish UV protection on the regular, buffed dry as instructed, this seemed like a sub-par job. Still, I couldn't find one area missed, and that speaks volumes about their attention to detail.\n\nIn all, I was satisfied, and would certainly consider giving them my business again. Will probably try their exterior detail next!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb26dea085b1b:0xb5d7634ec43f823f"}

After calling and no one answering for weeks looking for someone to detail both my husbands and my car, we were greated with a gentleman signing \u201cmelllvvvinns\u201d on the phone. That has me immediately happy. He told us to be there by 10:30 this morning. We got there and they were busy but took both our cars, we traded them out, when one was done we brought the other one back. They had my husbands filthy car cleaned in 3 hours and had it looking shiny and brand new. I was shocked for them to get out all the years of stains and grime! I then gave them my car and was also pleased with the work. It was shiny as well and sparkling clean. The prices are truly AMAZING! If I was Melvin, I would UP those prices because it\u2019s almost a steal for all the beautiful work they do. Mr. Melvin I learned is a Pastor and drives some miles to preach on Sunday mornings, he seems so happy and kind! I was very impressed, actually overly impressed with the work and the time it took.

On 3 July I took my GS350 to have the tint removed from my rear glass and have it replaced with ceramic tint that I purchased from tintzoom online for $200.00. When I arrived the owner and I agreed on a price of $190.00 to do all window with the exception of the left front and left rear (I had already installed it) with the tint I supplied. Having done over 50 tint jobs at a reputable local shop while in college (10 years ago) I know the proper way of installing tint, but being a little rusty I decided to take it to a professional to ensure the tint was removed properly (Steamer or Ammonia and Black Bag). After pulling the car into the shop to start the job I noticed the CARWASH DETAILER with a razor blade hacking at the tint in the rear window. I immediately asked him to stop and asked the owner to take over before he ruin the rear glass defroster. I then left with my ride that was waiting (big mistake) and had him take me to the bank to get cash for the job.  When I returned my car was supposedly ready. I looked at my rear package and it was covered with tint scrapings and my defrost lines were no longer black they were gold (as in no longer working from scraping with a razor). I also noticed that my 3rd brake light was torn to pieces, and there were several pieces of tint left on the window with new film laid on top of it. Soon after I spoke with the manager to inform him of my displeasure with the services rendered. The first thing I asked the owner about was my 3rd brake light and his answer was \u201cWe had to break it to put the film on.\u201d The second was my defroster his response was\u201d We had to get the tint off.\u201d The third issue with this humbling experience was the patches of old tint eft on the window with new tint installed over it, in which I received no response from the owner. My response to the owner was \u201cI am not paying for this,\u201d so he decided to vacuum some of the tint from the rear package tray and reduce the price to $165.00 since he broke my $250.00 3rd brake light. After I still refused to pay we both called the police (Little did he know I was on the phone with a good friend who is deputy chief of police). So between the times the police arrived he decided to rip the tint off the windows and throw my $200.00 ceramic tint in the trash, despite his wife warning him not to. When the police arrived he lied about ripping the tint off and even said I didn\u2019t bring any tint to him and stated that he supplied the tint. After looking at the car the officer asked why is there just tint on the driver side windows, I stated that is because those were the windows I did myself. To end the story the officers did nothing (OF COURSE) and stated it was a civil matter which is probably true. Long story short I am out $568.49 to replace the rear glass to get my defrosters back (plus installation), $200.00 for the ceramic tint that he decided to rip from the window and throw in the trash, and $250.00 for my 3rd brake light the he tore up. PLEASE do not go to the poor established called Customized Auto Detail & Window Tinting or you will receive a humbling experience like mine.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b785508b9fb:0xfffd9e0f9eb61f62"}

I took my vehicle here as recommended by a trusted friend. I purchased the highest level service they provided (well over $200), a \"full detail\" as they said. I had my vehicle there a full day with no pressure to have it done at any certain time, as i wouldn't be able to pick it up until i was out of work, well after they had closed. Upon arrival to pick it up, I was immediately concerned. It seemed as if they overlooked quite a few obvious areas. The front-end still had smashed insects and debris on it that easily came off with my fingernail. That lead me to look even closer. Using a flashlight, I noticed quite a few areas where wax was never removed, where hopefully condensation, and not unrinsed soap, dripped down, leaving behind hazy but obvious lines across the paint. The interior of my vehicle was outstanding, with the exception of the entire front winshield being ignored and unclean. I am just disappointed. I apologize in !\nadvance for not having enough faith in this shop to bring my vehicle back there, even for them to correct these issues. I do believe that this may be the best place in town for a basic car wash, but i would not reccomended them to someone expecting expertly trained, skillful, adept work or to even get what they paid for.

In addition I am the treasurer of a local credit union and we have used Alabama Auto Clean when we needed to sell a repossessed vehicle. They always do an amazing job cleaning the vehicles and I have always been happy with the services they provide. Unfortunately when I recently had my Yukon XL detailed I left the trailer hitch cover and another item in the third row seat. Again they did a great job with the detailing but the items that were left in the car were missing when it was delivered back to me. I am not sure if Ricky is still there but I wasn't able to talk to him at any point during this visit. It is a shame that someone would take items from the vehicles they are responsible for but when I asked about the missing items I was told they were not there. Just the hitch cover is $115 plus the body shop cost to paint to match the Yukon. I am sure I can find another detail shop that is honest and does as good of a job.\n\nThis issue was resolved - Ricky saw my review and, as I expected he would, corrected the situation. Since they do remove everything from your vehicle prior to detailing I would recommend not leaving anything inside. There is always a possibility that something can get lost or misplaced.\nThank you Ricky", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4dc42d4b5fab:0xdb32e8965d9285cb"}

It had lightly rained early in the morning and was overcast but hadn't rained for hours.

The message didn't even indicate it was for the car wash so I checked the number on the website and dialed again - same result; no answer, no voice mail box. Without confirmation that the car wash was closed and no cancellation notice received, I drove 20 minutes to get to my appointment on time (12:00 noon) only to find that the facility was shut down and dark. The restaurant inside the building was open and the gentleman there advised the car wash was indeed closed. He offered to make a call to see if he could find out about my appointment, but no one answered his call either. I understand that car washes close in inclement weather and I would have gladly rebooked my appointment for another day. But to close and not notify patrons who have scheduled an appointment is unconcionable and bad business practice. With so many other car wash options in the area, they should do a better job to try to keep their clientele. I will still have my car detailed, just not at this car wash. If I can't trust them to send a cancellation, I'm sure not going to trust them with my car.\n\nUpdate: just received a text and an email confirming a new detailing appointment for next week.

I arrived and paid at 4:45, and was through the automated car wash and in line at the full service lane within 10 minutes, with one car in front of me. It was a full hour before my car made it up to the station to be cleaned. The length of time doesn\u2019t bother me so much as the fact that the lanes were moving at very different speeds. This meant 6 people who arrived after me (one an hour after I did) still got their cars finished first. I understand that the lanes cannot move at the same speed, as not every car takes the same amount of time to clean, but it was very frustrating to watch so many people arrive and leave before my car was even started. I\u2019d highly recommend keeping the cars in a single file line so they can move forward as spots open up rather than trapping them in a lane that isn\u2019t moving. I will potentially give this place another chance, but will definitely be requesting the left lane if I do so! Additionally, it would be great if you could place an ATM inside. Before I became dissatisfied with the service, I walked to the nearby gas station to try to get cash to tip and the ATM was out of order. That\u2019s my fault for not thinking ahead, but I\u2019m sure there are other people who would like to tip but who don\u2019t have cash, and I\u2019m sure the employees would appreciate it.\n\nUpdate: Great customer service\u2014was contacted directly and feel like they took my feedback seriously.

I've had an interior detail from other places before, and this place is mediocre for the price you pay.  I get a little picky when I have to pay almost $200 for something, as this is a major splurge for me that I do only once a year, if that.  However, the staff was really friendly. When I pulled up, they asked what I was most worried about.  I said the dirt and getting my seats and carpets shampooed.  I said I would get the dog hair later.  I probably should have been clearer, as I didn't want to pay the extra 20+ for the dog hair cleaning.  They inspected the car and charged me for the dog hair (about 30 bucks).  I went ahead and paid as I was there and thought, might as well let them get the dog hair if I'm going to pay for it.  When I got the car back, there was still quite a bit of hair in the floor board and mats. I'm going to have to go in and remove it, which is what I had planned to do, but still got charged for it.  With all that to say, they still did a great job cleaning the dash, doors, and seats. It smelled much much better too. However, the windows, when rolled down, still had all of the grime at the top. I was kinda bummed, as this is one of the small things I was looking forward to having cleaned.  I can clean it easily, but again, it was part of a splurge that I was hoping would take care of it.\nThis is where I'm gonna sound real nit picky, but the presentation could have been a little better. Every place I've ever gotten an interior detail from (that I paid less for), they presented the car to me and did something of a walk through with me. If there was some dirt, spots, or stray hairs, they took care of it on the spot.  They didn't do this. There was still a little dirt in the floor board of the driver's side from where they were in and out of the car to move it and a couple of places that I would have liked to ask about. The back mats just looked kind of tossed in. Usually, the mats are placed in the trunk so the floorboards can dry, so it did take longer for my car to dry than it has before.\nI would recommend it with an \"eh\" and shoulder shrug, but I probably won't be back.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889226c05490431:0x6c9f60969359efe7"}

I am a FREQUENT long time user of Riverchase Car Wash and have a PREFERRED CUSTOMER CARD noting multiple visits.\n\nOn Friday, March 31, 2017, I took my wife\u2019s 2006 Lincoln Zephyr to be washed, detailed, and prepared for use the following week.  Normally, when I come to Riverchase, I get the standard car wash ($19.99).  No problems.   However, for my wife that day, I decided to upgrade my car wash to the $26.99 deal. (made it a little more special for my wife).\nUpon receipt of my car, I noticed that part of one of the primary knobs (power knob) for my radio system had been damaged.  I immediately brought this to Riverchase Car Wash\u2019s attention.  Riverchase Car Wash personnel attempted to repair the radio knob.  However, after 24 hours, I determined that the repair was not satisfactory.  The radio knob was still not available for normal use.  I promptly notified Riverchase Car Wash  management.  They stated that they would be notifying senior management for a resolution.\n\nAfter a few days, I followed up with Riverchase.  They stated that senior management would NOT resolve the issue because they did not believe that Riverchase Car Wash caused the damage.\n\nOK, I have NO REASON TO LIE!!!!!!!  FAIR IS FAIR!!!  This is a 2006 Lincoln Zephyr, TAKEN CARE OF VERY VERY WELL.  There would be NO LOGICAL REASON for this type damage to happen.  After review by radio experts, it was determined that the detailing service caused the damage to the vehicle.\n\nHonestly, in my opinion, this is nothing more than POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE on the part of Riverchase Car Wash Management.  Taking care of your customers should be a CARDINAL RULE. (Particularly regular customers)  Fair, HONEST business should be key.\n\nBelieve me, I will make it my business to tell all my family members, friends, and work colleagues to NOT use Riverchase Car Wash for any car care services.  I will send them to Anthony\u2019s Car Wash or other customer focused establishment instead.   You just LOST me and a lot of future customers.\n\nI have respectfully requested a refund for the car wash and repairs(which was barely $120) with no response from Riverchase Car Wash!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889226c05490431:0x6c9f60969359efe7"}

I\u2019ve had at least 10 cars tinted and re tinted in my lifetime and this is by far the worst experience I\u2019ve ever had. On April 23rd I dropped my car off the night before so it could be done the first thing the next morning Damien the new owner assured me that they had plenty of time to get it done. After I waited around all day I finally call and ask about my car around 5pm he said it will be done shortly so my family went to eat to kill some more time. At 730pm! I get a text that it\u2019s about done. At 9pm! I get another text saying it\u2019s about done so I went ahead and went there. Still not done! Didn\u2019t get my car till 10pm! And when I got it you can just tell when something was rushed. I keep my car spotless when I got it back glue was everywhere! And after looking at the tint (in the first 4 pictures)the tint didn\u2019t go all the way into the gaskets and the front windshield didn\u2019t go all the way up! Also cluster bubbles everywhere! I know some are expected but they where horrible. After talking to him the next day he wanted to make it right and I agreed because I felt he would do a way better job next time. Wrong! On May 2nd took my car back around 10am so they could get it back to me at a decent time. 6pm! Told me to come get it when I went there still wasn\u2019t done! The tint now didn\u2019t go to the back of the rear gaskets in 3 out of 4 windows! And debris all in my back window! Including tint coming off the top of my front window which he said I need to leave up for 3 days! I\u2019ve never heard of that so I did and that happened when I finally rolled them down(The last 6 photos posted) I texted him the pictures and called he avoided me. So I needed a witness to go there with me I showed him Everything again and he said it needed touched up and one window would need re done. He said the way my windows move is why he couldn\u2019t get them to go all the way into the gaskets. And said nothing could be done about that. Lies! After asking for a refund because he said nobody could do a better job he just starred at my car and my dad said what if someone can do a better job and we will bring you the bill. He said ok. Well I went somewhere else and had it redone they did everything I wanted the right way! I called and texted him about a refund and he said because they took his film off he is keeping my money! $325. Bottom line if you are a business that offers a %100 guaranteed job or if your customer is not happy you refund them! So just think twice about going here it isn\u2019t the same place it was a few years ago.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9owakAOQ74gMkaXunLS8GVzZSJtWrSkwDkGsn=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtqVVMYP7bTAxO_sQ5uE_sVJmaeOQtz07D3ZVL=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlJUKSI4YOUOu6w1x4ocb0HilXFF1bLimC-Tfo=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMn_65arRPjYGra7h12EQTk9jE6k_zcLAPjAM5v=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdbVvn-TujBJbRv9_LN6C9eA_vYqcVxqUCvCUQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOEJHJFUI7Xo3NEPthz4f0NF6mRzRh8MZ4jDt4=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5gTU_DunMecoWJCLty0ksSsDgx8c0FFB-RBaw=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVO5brPlAEg9CX-d1w3DK6m64oKUZpJaokvwYl=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0OJo8nrO9QuN9YgkRnUyNgZWS_DRAjAWza7FM=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgBdJSeU4d2FLN8R7Xs1YpTe5heMFseOB_o4ml=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNn3H4F_nofoC5YR70ShKq83w6IZL1WF9rfgbmE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a43bd359e1233:0xcc37a4e6bb9592ca"}

When they finally agreed that they could order the car I wanted, they tried to convince me to buy it faster, claiming that in the few weeks I was planning to wait until some new payoffs reported on my credit, qualifying me for a 0% interest rate, my trade would decline in value and that I didn't want a 0% interest rate anyway. They kept me another 20 minutes after I said I needed to leave for an appointment, and even had the sales manager come out asking us, \"Why do you hate my car\", to try to convince us to buy the wrong one again. They didn't even pretend to care if I got the car I wanted (even though I'd have been spending more money), they just wanted me to buy whatever they could push off on me right that second. Overall, a terrible experience, and I felt more like a hostage negotiating for my release than a customer.\n\nAfter it was all said and done, I bought somewhere else, got exactly the car I wanted, in exactly the time frame I wanted.

I had an OUTSTANDING & EXCEPTIONALLY POSITIVE experience purchasing a brand new 2021 Hyundai Elantra SE at the Tameron Hyundai dealership.\nFirst off, I received a call from Andrea in customer relations after I visited the website. She was SO friendly, pleasant, easy going and helpful!\nShe helped me set up a time to come in and look at the cars available.\nWhen we got to the Hyundai dealership at noon, we met with Kevin Dailey.\nMy son and I felt so at ease with him. Kevin was AWESOME!!!\nHe was very friendly, respectful, attentive and knowledgeable.\nHe gave us a great introduction of the Hyundai Elantra SE we wanted. Despite the torrential downpour and flash food warning sirens and crazy scary lightning that day, we enjoyed the test drive with him.\nThe car drove like a dream through all that terrible weather. Kevin did a great job of working to get my monthly car payment rate at a price I felt comfortable with. He also guided me on how to coordinate with my AAA car insurance agent while waiting on financing dept, then he introduced us to Chayse. Chayse also did an exceptional job of getting all my financing paperwork together.He generously provided copies of documents I needed to get my new car\u2019s tag and registration done at the DMV.\nI had no real expectations that day other than to test drive a car.\nMy son and I researched a lot and compared the Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic and Hyundai Elantra SE. The excellent warranty, and better safety features, more cabin room, and other specs sold us on the Hyundai Elantra SE. Our prior vehicle broke down in February. It has been a tough 3 +months without the ability to go anywhere.\nFrom start to finish we had an incredibly positive experience with everyone at Tameron Hyundai.\nFor us, it\u2019s not just about a car. It\u2019s about our freedom to get out and live life. We are TRULY GRATEFUL for our entire experience!\nKevin also scheduled our first maintenance appointment for November before we even drove off the lot!\nWe were thrilled to hear the warranty is doubled and our maintenance is will be handled at Tameron as well! AMAZING!!!\nAfter driving in our last vehicle for 20 years, I\u2019m SO GLAD we decided to trust our instincts and research about our new Gorgeous Hyundai Elantra and the Tameron Hyundai dealership! I posted Kevin\u2019s business card on all my social media.

Her service advisor, Brian informed her that the oil leak was coming from the o-ring for the drain plug due to it being cracked. Brian said this is considered a \u201cwear and tear item\u201d and that she should probably get her oil changed since she was due for another one in around another 1k miles.\n\nThis is where my issue begins, I call Brian to get more information and he is immediately defensive when I ask him for the information about what is going on. I asked him why the O ring isn\u2019t just a parts warranty issue, they pull the plug, put a new seal in it, fill it back up with oil and quote a filter IF she wants to put one in since it is close, he mumbled and tried to get his thoughts together and said i may not understand how warranty works. I\u2019ve been a technician for a different brand for 8 years we use the same computer systems as them and parts warranties generally don\u2019t only last a month, regardless Brian was beyond unprofessional in our coversation and within our 20 minute conversation he tells me:\n\n- o rings are a wear and tear item, which if it was replaced during the service, a month ago.. it shouldn\u2019t be \u201cworn\u201d.\n-She didn\u2019t make an appoitment for two weeks prior(we have the paper work that says she did, that they printed out for her today) and so there is no way that his technician could have left it loose or over torqued the plug because it would have been noticed sooner than a month(it was).\n- for all he knows I did this to attempt at getting a free oil change\n- this may be something I (me) would do to a customer but they would never not take the blame if it was their fault.\n- she should start checking her 2018 vehicle for oil leaks every morning just like he does so that next time there is a \u201cfaulty o-ring, that is also a wear and tear item\u201d is noticed within a month.\n- he doesn\u2019t have to speak with me because the car isn\u2019t in my name.\n- there is ZERO management in the building including service manager/director and general manager for me to speak with other than him.\n- and finally he said the oil change had all ready been performed all he did was have his technician do what was approved on the service recommendations which\nHad zero approved items\n\nOver all, the man was beyond unprofessional had a snarky attitude from the beginning and essentially tried to shift blame onto me instead of just making the situation right.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a1067f2749:0xf08fc8940d9b4549"}

Even then we were refused a rental and told the certain recalls didn\u2019t cover a rental. At which point my mother called to see what the deal was. She spoke to Brian. He was rather snarky and unapologetic when speaking to her and informed her that the recalls have been out for eight years. We\u2019ve only owned this vehicle for five years and were unaware of said recalls. Once my mother got off the phone with him he immediately called us to say our car was fixed on Tuesday which by that point we were unable to pick it up that day because of work schedules.  I will never be using this dealership again. My first and last visit.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a1067f2749:0xf08fc8940d9b4549"}

No complaints. 2 experiences with the service department since then have been poor. Before it was time for the first oil change, one of the car\u2019s front head lamps had gone out. I asked that they replace it for free since I shouldn\u2019t need to replace what was a 2 month old light on a car that I bought from that same dealership. That is their fault. Instead I was charged $80 to replace it, which apparently was a discount on what hey normally charge to replace that lamp.

I had been researching a Hyundai Accent and wanted to look at them. I ended up working with a man (his name starts with a J) who took me to the used accents. When test driving the car he only let me go around the block, I mean the car didn't even get over 40mph. He did not show me that the car was certified, no car fax, and the price was 2-3 thousand dollars than every website I have looked at about this car. In fact, a brand new Hyundai Accent was listed only a few hundred dollars more than the used 2013 one I was looking at. When bringing this up he told me they were not willing to work with me on the price and when I was going to leave he mentioned that \"Were not the type of people who will call you later and lower the price.\" So I left, then I went down the street and bought a Honda Accord that was a year older, had more miles on it and paid $1,000 more than the price J told me he wouldn't budge on the Accent. Why? Because Billy at Tameron Honda treated me as a serious buyer who was paying cash and needed a car instead of a 20 year old college girl who J hurried out the door thinking I wasn't ready to buy.

I felt very comfortable in his confidence and his explanation.\nThe Previous dealership where I had my car serviced in South Alabama did not put enough air of equal portions in the tires, and Joe got a very polite professional technician to make sure the tires work properly inflated.

I\"ll be up front, I made every stupid decision you could buying a used car. The Yukon my wife wanted had a little difficulty starting (that was my first warning sign I failed to heed). When I asked the salesman he just brushed it off as it hadn't been turned on that day (my second warning sign).\n\nWhen we got into the room for negotiations I told him upfront what my requirements were. He then (what I later learned is a typical salesman trick) went to \"argue\" with his boss about giving me the deal I wanted. After a few hours he finally invited me back to his \"bosses\" office to sign the deal.\n\nWhen I sat down to sign, he handed me a stack of papers that I spent some time reviewing. I honestly could not make sense of the numbers. When I started asking him about them he responded, \"I thought we were here to buy a car!\" (my final warning sign I failed to heed). I caved to this high pressure sales tactic and just wanted to get out of there as quick as possible as it had already been 4+ hours. When I finally got my vehicles they said it took so long because they had to \"clean\" them. Worst cleaning job ever.\n\nThe NEXT day the Yukon I bought died in a parking lot. I should have taken it back and got my Expedition back I traded in but I felt like I had to make do with what I bought (besides, I bought the warranty!) Took it to a local repair shop and sure enough the fuel pump needed to be replaced. Lucky for me, I only had to pay the $100 deductible!\n\nLess than a year into owning the vehicle, the transmission went out. Fortunately for me I again ONLY had to pay the $100 deductible to replace the transmission. Little did I know, transmissions tend to go bad again after they go out the first time. About a year later, the transmission went out a second time! That was the final straw, so I traded it in at Driver's Way where I had a MUCH better experience.\n\nNow, my second car I mentioned I bought that same time along with the Yukon ended up having a broken motor mount and the A/C compressor went out less than a year after purchase. Both vehicles were only 3-5 years used and less than 75k miles on them. Maybe I just had terrible luck from Tameron Hyundai but I can't help but feel they knew about these issues and just passed them on to me based on their sales practices.\n\nTameron Hyundai lives by the moto \"Caveat emptor\"...

My story didn\u2019t begin with a five star experience but it ended with one.\nI purchased a used Tucson at a great price.  My salesman, Nick Foster took care of us and got us through negotiations without any hiccups.  We got what we asked for with minimal resistance.  Tim Provost, in finance, processed the paperwork and made us feel comfortable throughout the process.  All was well.  9 days after our purchase we were informed by Tim that the car had been wrecked and repaired prior to our purchase.  Not the best thing you want to hear, but let me tell you how refreshing it is to deal with the team like Hyundai who make integrity and honesty a priority in their day-to-day.  The wreck was not on Carfax or Autocheck so no harm no foul.  They purchased their car back with no penalties imposed on myself.  Still though, I was ready to walk away.\nOne of the owners, Rob Gallik, learned of what had happened and met with me personally.  I was very impressed with this alone.  He apologized for the inconvenience and offered us several options if we were still interested in buying with them.  His personal touch and a great deal (we think) put us in a new car that day (Sonata).  Our salesman on the new car side was Daniel Pereira.  Great guy!  Very mellow and we did not feel pressured with him during our time together.  Really we felt no pressure to take any deal at all but Rob\u2019s offer was hard to refuse.\nOverall I rate these guys a perfect score because of the way we felt after the ordeal was over.

It was Ridiculous how every place turned me away because I didn't have $8,000 down, or an established credit line, or just lazy sales people who could care less to help a young man/single parent out. When I finally got to Tameron they blew me away with what seemed like the red-carpet treatment lol. They were friendly, knowledgeable, and committed to making sure that I drove away in a new whip. The sales managers Larry Keene and Rob Galik worked their tails off to get me a new ride WITH an warranty. They even gave me options on which ride I wanted, all of which had an affordable payment. On-top of that, they even made my lil girl a balloon and got her a coke when she was thirsty:) They went to bat, looked out for me, and got me the ride I needed. My sales person even calls to check up on me and my car; I bought it 4 months ago lol. I couldn't recommend these guys any higher. Its nice to know that I can count on that for the next 20 years, ALL of my vehicles will come from Tameron Hyundai :)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888918a1067f2749:0xf08fc8940d9b4549"}

My story didn\u2019t begin with a five star experience but it ended with one.\nI purchased a used Tucson at a great price.  My salesman, Nick Foster took care of us and got us through negotiations without any hiccups.  We got what we asked for with minimal resistance.  Tim Provost, in finance, processed the paperwork and made us feel comfortable throughout the process.  All was well.  9 days after our purchase we were informed by Tim that the car had been wrecked and repaired prior to our purchase.  Not the best thing you want to hear, but let me tell you how refreshing it is to deal with the team like Hyundai who make integrity and honesty a priority in their day-to-day.  The wreck was not on Carfax or Autocheck so no harm no foul.  They purchased their car back with no penalties imposed on myself.  Still though, I was ready to walk away.\nOne of the owners, Rob Gallik, learned of what had happened and met with me personally.  I was very impressed with this alone.  He apologized for the inconvenience and offered us several options if we were still interested in buying with them.  His personal touch and a great deal (we think) put us in a new car that day (Sonata).  Our salesman on the new car side was Daniel Pereira.  Great guy!  Very mellow and we did not feel pressured with him during our time together.  Really we felt no pressure to take any deal at all but Rob\u2019s offer was hard to refuse.\nOverall I rate these guys a perfect score because of the way we felt after the ordeal was over.  Our two week long relationship was a bit strenuous at times but they came through in the end treating us like family (the kind you like).  Thanks Nick, Tim, Rob, and Dan.  I look forward to seeing you guys again.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1431465537169, "text": "We are so happy to hear that we were able to work everything out to your liking!

Not only did they get out the stains the vehicle almost looked new inside and out. I don't use this word lightly but it was a miracle. I rarely leave a business and feel like I didn't pay enough. I got way more than my money's worth.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1534441756328, "text": "Thank you for your review Marcus!"}, "gmap_id": "0x8862841dc912fd77:0x620fbc8a75a53b40"}

I took the vehicle up there and discuss what all he would do and how long it would take so I left the vehicle about 4 days and when I picked up the vehicle I started to notice that he did not hold up how end of the bargain, I asked him about the undercarriage and he said that he had only cleaned the front of my vehicle because that\u2019s the only spot of the undercarriage that you see and he started to tell me that he did not come through with the paint corrections either due supposedly taking too long that he would have to charge about another $400 on top of the $300+ that I paid for the ultimate package. Also the interior of the vehicle seemed to just be skimmed over with some cleaner which he also said that all the cleaners and chemical he used should be good for a year and about 3 weeks later I started to see it all wear off. Also on the back door he said he didn\u2019t clean it because he couldn\u2019t remove my spare tire because he had the tool to remove the lug nuts but didn\u2019t have a wrench long enough to get the leverage he needed, but I had a tire iron in the trunk that he could\u2019ve used and when I told him about the tire iron when I picked up the vehicle he just laughed about it and tried to play it off as a joke and changed the subject. Extremely disappointed with the work done especially with the ridiculous price he is charging. Would not recommend anyone to come here just another con artist trying to get your hard earned money.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1534037682142, "text": "Carlos sorry about your experience.
