The staff helped at the front with changing my membership from another location. There seemed to be plenty of space. I didn't have to wait on anyone, which is number one for me at any fitness center. Social distance measures were decent, as can be expected. The only real issue that bothered me was that one employee was talking to a customer waiting to go into the spa while I was trying to leave, and he walked in front of me three times going back and forth from the other customer and the counter, as if he couldn't see me. He didn't speak to me at all. I didn't find it very professional to be cutting customers off repeatedly and not saying excuse me or anything, just expecting me to continue to move and go around after already changing directions without even acknowledging me there. It would've been much better if he had the conversation with the customer at the counter, at the table, said \"excuse me,\" or even \"sorry about that,\" anything really to let me know I was valued as much as the person he was talking to and not just in his way. Things like that irk me, especially as a customer. Other than that though, pretty great first-time experience. If it doesn't get too much busier without being expanded, then I'll plan on this being my main gym. Oh, one more thing, I wish they had the treadmills like Midtown.

My friend tried to cancel 3 times by phone and still got charged his Gold's Gym rate which was double the highest Crunch rate.)\n- App still doesn't work for Gold's Gym transfers (This means transfers from Gold's Gym can't sign up for group fitness classes online.

When people enter contracts they should get it in writing and then everybody stick to their end of the bargain. People are famous for joining a  gym and then changing priorities.

I did a few \"sessions\" with trainer Kyle and he definitely knows how to give you a good work out, you won't be disappointed. The two of us have a pretty regular thing going on now. The location is convenient just far from downtown if you're coming that way, and it can get pretty busy after work. I would suggest if you can try and go later in the evening to avoid the crowds and get an appointment with Kyle then hit the sauna afterwards for some small talk and hot relaxation. Also the steam room is great for extra privacy. There's no juice bar or anything like that but Pub 261 is just a minute up 31 and a great spot to loosen up a little bit instead of just going home and straight to bed. Kyle is also very skilled in deep tissue massage due to his strong grip and thick forearms, so if you are sore afterwards it's a good way jumpstart the recovery process and get you in the right mood if you know what I mean. I try to sleep 8-10hrs whenever I can but Kyle has so much stamina he keeps me going all night! It makes me feel like we're in college again. There's also a lap pool and racquetball court.

I understand some equipment is just something you should buy yourself, but it\u2019s such a pain to pack up 10 different things in your backpack because the gym has minimal equipment.  They realllllly push the personal training and nutrition services on you which can be off putting if you feel uncomfortable being firm with them and declining.

You will quickly NOT be a stranger!

With some of the best programming around, the coaches make it easy to be a better you.  They meet you where you are based off your bodies needs whether that's doing 1 rep or 15. Your gym friends quickly become your gym FAMILY that you stay after class with, and share laughs and good talks with. It becomes the best part of your everyday routine. Forge Fitness also features recovery shop options, sauna, childcare, cardio room, basketball court, soccer field, and track. There's a place for all members of your family here.

I travel to the Birmingham area for work once a month and was looking for a gym/box that has hours on Sunday.  I had heard some not-so-great things about a few boxes but I hadn't heard of Forge Fitness/ CF Shades.  Not only is CF Shades the only place with Sunday hours, but they were above and beyond wonderfully welcoming when I showed up unannounced during their open gym period.  Upon first glance, the gym was very clean, which is not very common among CrossFit and Crossfit-inspired facilities.  The owner, Rich, jumped up from a staff meeting and gave me a tour and after learning of my CF history, invited me to use any and all of their space as well as invited me back through my duration of stay while in town.  They have an awesome workout space out back with a platform, squat racks and a rig and the running course around the building is super safe.  I also met coaches Caleb, Josh and Rebecca who were all very accommodating and friendly.  When I returned for a class, Rebecca coached and I really appreciated her attentiveness.  I'm a CrossFit coach in Denver and because I move relatively well, I tend to get left alone - but I love being coached when I drop into new places and Rebecca was great.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND travelers and locals to visit.  If you're a member somewhere else in Hometown or Birmingham, switch now.

The gym even has given me a rain check to apply it in March after I get my tax return, so it's more affordable for me. (so not really a loss when all is said and done!)\n\nThe people (coaches and members) I met have been nothing but encouraging. The workouts were well designed to keep you moving to accomplish in less than 30 minutes what many other classes, at other gyms I've attended, it has taken an hour to achieve (which is nice when you are low on time in your day!)\n\nI have a knee injury, and in previous gyms, my disability has made me feel inadequate or ashamed that I could not do what the rest of the class was doing. The coaches knew about my injury (and no matter what class I attended (morning or afternoon) with any coach, they were already well informed of my needs without the embarrassment of having to say as much at every new encounter. They were discreet and quick to tell me alternate exercises I could do, so I didn't feel as if I was the odd man out waiting to be assigned something different or taking away from the class by holding up the rest of the members, so that a coach could assist me.)\n\nMembers are at all different fitness levels, and the coaches are very attentive to every one's individual needs, and they are watching you and your progress making sure that you are on point doing the exercises CORRECTLY! (which as long as I've been working out, I hadn't realized how many simple movements I was doing incorrectly!)\n\nI could write a book on all the good experiences I have had just in my six weeks of attending, but I will wrap it up here with a final statement that I highly recommend this gym.

I'm not where I want to be physically but I am well on my way thanks to these fine people. They are not cheap - but the value and the knowledge you learn is worth it.  They are crazy hard workouts that are intense and sometimes you want to cry and curl into the fetal position - but everyone does the workouts together and finishes every time and it gets easier.....a little. They scale the workouts to prevent injuries - I was really worried about my knees and they work with you so you don't injure yourself. They know their stuff and want to see you make progress not hurt yourself.  They aren't snobby and neither are the people that workout here - just normal friendly people. They are passionate about fitness not just some other gym you pay your monthly dues and get nothing in return. I was 330 pounds 3 1/2 months ago. Ive lost 45 pounds and feel awesome!  I used to pay another gym 25/month and never went for 2 years. I was paying a Fat tax for 2 years - but not anymore!

Overall the program itself is really good, and the coaches were wonderful.  I did get excellent results during this time in weightloss, body fat percentage reduction and high lean muscle.  Unfortunately I will not be continuing an affiliation with ITF due to the misrepresentation of this program. I was sold that the 98% of challengers meet their goal, the meal plans are customized and that if for some reason you don't meet your goal you could apply to future classes. What I found is that ITF monthly fees are extremely high even with the so called Challenger discount, There seem to be very few challengers that actually meet the goal and the customized meal plan is merely based on starting weight and goal of weight loss, body fat percentage or muscle gain. There is no consideration of gender or age, which can be a huge factor in weight loss. The only offer is to apply your hefty deposit towards a minimally discounted 12 month commitment, so I am parting ways with ITF. Due to the way I feel they misrepresented this program.  I will be seeking a membership elsewhere, and will never do business with them in the future.

I find it the most difficult, challenging, and fun workout I've done in my life.  I'm still on a learning curve, but I can say that I've also made progress!  Before I signed on, I was very worried about re-injuring my rotator cuff.  I let them know about my past injury, Zech and Jon showed me ways to modify my workouts.  As my shoulder got stronger, I've not needed some of the modifications and according to my chiropractor and orthopedic doctor,  my shoulder has fully healed.  I hate weights...really.  But I'm now swinging the 35 pound kettle ball.   The biggest weight I had lifted prior to Irontribe was a 15 pound dumb bell for bicep curls or deadlifts.  With these guys, I've done a 2 max rep 165 deadlift, and I'm learning to do beginner handstand pull ups!  The group environment is fun.  They keep me going.  We cheer each other on.  I find that when you do something difficult, share a difficult experience, like a WOD lol,  we feel connected to the each other and we want to see one another succeed.  We get excited when someone reaches a PR or finishes a tough workout. I'm a school teacher, so I was initially concerned with the cost.  I've found the monetary, time, and physical investment to be worth it. The coaches are the best, they make me smile because they challenge me, they challenge me to put on more weight or work with me on my nutrition and check up my attendance and progress.  Zechariah and Jon, Jen, Brandon, and Joe really care and they enjoy what they do.  They're not only about the paycheck, they're about making better athletes and building a community.  I don't always \"enjoy\" the workouts.  But I enjoy and love this community.  We build relationships and athletes here.

They had materials in their arms that made them look like SALES PEOPLE. And that happens a lot! A LARGE SIGN IS ONTHE DOOR to wear a MASK! Anyone who would give a review like that- after just walking in without calling ahead and already breaking rules- is not really the type of person who comes to workout in this location.

At 5:03 p.m., a counselor walked your daughter back inside to her Afterschool group. At no time during this footage did we observe counselors or sports staff on their cell phones.

Brii has created a family environment of women supporting women- which is a breath of fresh air in and of itself. I have strengthened my mind, my body and my relationships by being a client of Brii\u2019s. I will continue to support Brii and her studio for as long as my body will allow it. Her small business has thrived through \u201cunprecedented\u201d circumstances and that\u2019s because of Brii and the culture she has worked hard to create.

We've always liked the private swimming lessons experience and those instructors have always been excellent. We used to love the Kids Night Out program, but they've made it less conducive for our child who is not into socializing. I wish they had some kind of classes for beginners especially yoga. Administrative people are nice but don't seem to be on the same page with information. Cleaning attendants are friendly and always hard at work. Now that my children are 8 and 11 they do not feel comfortable going in the ladies dressing room which I totally agree with but I do not feel comfortable letting them go in the men's area because there is no privacy for them. I'm not comfortable with them being exposed to naked men or having to expose themselves. Probably a lot to ask for a kids dressing area or family room. There is a changing room/storage room by the pool but I think it's really just meant for storage. It would be great if they would post the status of the pool on Facebook or via text.

I was impressed with his knowledge and ability in the area of health and fitness. Elliott is all about community. He's played a huge role in helping me establish my non-profit, Scarlett's Closet . He's even a member of my board.\nLast year, after attending one of the fundraisers Live Ready hosts for us annually, I saw pictures of myself at the event and realized I needed to take control of my life and be the healthiest version of Lisa I can be. I started doing workouts in my home and making better food choices. By May of this year, I'd lost 41Lbs, but the scales had stopped moving. I reached out to Elliott and he told me I was most likely in a calorie deficit.  I recall my response; I laughed at him. He encouraged me to sign up for  a \"Love to Eat Challenge\" Through this challenge, I was taught what to eat and how my plate should look. I am happy to report that I won the challenge and to date, I have lost 64lbs. I am wearing the smallest clothes I've ever worn as an adult. I recently had surgery and  Elliott has asked me to start training with him once my Doctor clears me to do so.  In the past, I would have said, \"No way.\" Now, I have the confidence I need to accept the challenge.\nIf you are looking to make positive changes in your life, I urge you to contact Elliott and his team. They are not only the best at what they do, but some of the nicest and most encouraging people you will ever meet. You won't feel pressured or intimidated. I am grateful for all their help and encouragement. I've never felt better. Isn't it time you took the first step to a healthier you? call them today!\nLisa P.

That's $1440 for a year. I think what turned me away was the amount of willingness to work with folks like myself, whom are rarely here due to work. It was pretty clear that $120 was the price and nothing less than military orders would change that. Even then the offer sounded less than ideal. So, that's the business side.\n\nThe workout side of this facility seemed... Alright. The facility was great as were the staff and customer personalities and support. Going back to the money, I definitely don't believe the training I saw warranted the price. I saw more flexion in lower back than I care to see-not just from young/new members. My fear of CrossFit gyms is always seeing atrocious form, and although that wasn't the case here (form wasn't... Terrible...) It still wasn't good enough for the hefty price. I could get a personal coach for the same and get precise, individual training for less money and same or better quality.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1507482201039, "text": "We are so sorry to hear that you do not agree with the price we charge.

We also realize that people\u2019s form are less then perfect but everyone comes in moving different, with different mobility problems and different degrees of fitness and athleticism. Some of those people take years of work to make the smallest change but I assure you that our coaches work tirelessly to do so and our athletes make dramatic improvements in quality of movement and life!

Competition is friendly, but it is real. You do not want to be the slowest or weakest person, so you will push yourself to do better. All the members are encouraging to each other.

The location is convenient but it can get pretty busy after work. I would suggest if you can try and go later in the evening to avoid the crowds and get an appointment with Kyle then hit the sauna afterwards for some small talk and hot relaxation. There's no juice bar or anything like that but Mugshots is right up 31 and a great midway point to loosen up little bit before just going home and straight to bed. Kyle is also very skilled in deep tissue massage due to his strong grip and thick forearms, so if you are sore afterwards it's a good way jumpstart the recovery process and get you in the right mood.

No surprise as soon as you walk in the door and they find out you aren't a member they try and get you to sign a contract.  The are commission based and are forced to get a lot of memberships but could care less about you as a person.  I go to a gym now where the exact opposite is true.  Why do you think they make you sign a long contract.  Yeah their facilities are nice, but it won't take long to regret their overpriced rudeness and inexperienced sometimes ignorant physical trainers.  Physical trainers start out at Gold's and the good ones leave because Golds takes a large cut of the top of their fees( not trainers fault)  BE WARNED!\n\nMy own story?\n\nI moved down to B'ham about 2 years ago then had to return to Missouri when I canceled my membership in person with this location's manager, Mike Bick.  I came in and he assured me everything was good.  (Memberships can only be canceled if there's not a Gold's Gym location within a certain proximity of where you are moving, must show proof of move)  When I arrived in Missouri I faxed Bick a copy of my utility bill and called him to verify he got it.\n\nMonths later I moved back to B'ham and considered re-enrolling when I was shocked to find out they were still auto-billing my card and refused to refund me after I called several times and went to their accounting department.
