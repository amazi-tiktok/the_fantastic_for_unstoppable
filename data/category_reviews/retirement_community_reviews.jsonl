Please consider not moving your loved one here. They do not have anyone to answer the phone, so the phone rings forever or goes to an answering machine that is set up for people who don\u2019t even work there any more. Unless you know someone\u2019s cell phone number, you won\u2019t get an answer. And this is happening during Covid 19, when you can\u2019t go in at any time and see your family member. I called weekly to check on my mother when I couldn\u2019t see her because of the pandemic and was told she was fine every time. Then randomly I get a call that she has 30 days to leave the facility because they can\u2019t care for her anymore. At that point, I had to direct her care and ask the staff to do things like check for a UTI because they didn\u2019t care to take the initiative. I couldn\u2019t even get them to answer the phone so I would have to call the dr office directly. She had a massive change in condition and never once was I notified. When it was time for me to move her, almost none of her clothing fit because she had lost so much weight. However the times I called to speak to the nurse, I was told she was fine and didn\u2019t lose weight. Keep in mind this happened during the pandemic when I could not visit her. They also told me she struggled with running into things, but come to find out she didn\u2019t have her glasses, they couldn\u2019t find them, and again - I was never notified. When I called Atlas Senior Living to complain, they said they would handle these situations but never did. When I did move my mother out, they did not let the pharmacy know, and continued to order medications for her, which charged me extra money, because insurance would not pay for these meds as they were filled at another location. The facility never sent her meds back either. Once again I called Atlas to complain about this but had to leave a message and was never called back. Anyone who is in the situation of having to move their parent into a facility does not need the added stress that Atlas Senior Living and this facility will give you. The company has replied below for me to reach out to Marcus, but I have already spoken to Marcus and he was also no help.

Since posting this review, I've had a few lengthy conversations with a couple of the \"head\" personnel  at St Martin's. We have come to a mutual agreement and I am satisfied with the outcome. I am NOT removing or changing anything in my initial review, so one must proceed with care and make sure EVERYTHING is explained to you in its entirety.   ORIGINAL REVIEW: This is a LONG read, if I could rate with less than 1 star, I would, but this NEEDS to be shared!!! NEVER USE ST MARTIN'S FOR IN HOME CARE!!!!!!! I recently had to have major back surgery, and as I have no local family, I opted to use St Martin's \"in home care\".  I have NEVER used this type of service EVER, and I must say I was COMPLETELY taken advantage of and the service was HORRENDOUS . Because, I had never used this service,  I had hoped that they would understand my needs and assist me in setting this up. Oh they SET ME UP all right.  TWENTY FOUR HOUR SERVICE, even while I was in the hospital for TWO weeks.  The hospital did not let them do ANYTHING. (Hospital policy), so ALL they could do was SIT there, maybe assist in putting on those \"stupid hospital socks\" , cover me when I got chilled and uncover me when I warmed up. I had NO idea that I could PICK AND CHOOSE when I needed them. I was left with the impression that once I started their service, that I was STUCK with them until I was released by the surgeon.\nI KNEW that I would need help once I returned home, but NOT 3- 8 hour shifts. I was in the hospital almost 2 weeks and during that time the program manager was to set up my in home care. I informed her that I did NOT want a parade of different faces coming into my home. TWO WEEKS, she had to get a \"team\" put together. THIS DID NOT HAPPEN!!! When I returned home; A DIFFERENT person almost every day AND some shifts not even covered. How could I heal, if I had to STRESS every day about my care?? This is MY home, I was not capable of moving around, so I couldn't very well see what was happening around my home. The 11pm till 7 am shift was the WORST! I did NOT require anyone to WATCH me while I slept, so I PAID A LOT OF MONEY for these sitters to SLEEP, WATCH TV, AND TALK/PLAY ON THEIR CELL PHONES while I slept.\nI know that the sitters were supposed to be bonded/insured, BUT how did I know things weren't moving out of my house. YES, I have trust issues with strangers, but that is NOT the point. The POINT IS... The \"Care At Home\" program is NOT SET UP CORRECTLY, THE PROGRAM MANAGER IS OBVIOUSLY NOT WELL TRAINED IN HER DUTIES,( I heard that she hasn't been doing this long)  AND I, THE CLIENT,  feel TOTALLY abused and \"taken for a MONEY ride\".\nI could rant on & on, but I AM DONE!!

SECOND, I nor anyone in my family has a vested (personal or business) interest in Lakeview Estates. Now for the review:\nOur mother was at Lakeview Estates on (2) different occasions. The first time was for approximately 6 months while completing rehab following (successful) cancer treatments. The facility, management and staff were excellent and it was an pleasant experience. Our mother's second \"stay\" at Lakeview was a couple of years later and this \"stay\" was for approximately 2 years. Initially, we were \"less than impressed\" with Lakeview and stated our opinions in the \"end of the year\" survey...I am sure that I was not the only one that was not happy with the facility! Approximately 6-8 weeks after the survey, a new manager was hired (Callie Simmons) and IMMEDIATELY things begin to change. First, it was the facility became cleaner, painting, new carpeting, new furniture in the lobby, etc...However, the most significant improvements were that the residents and the staff were NOTICEABLE happier (my wife told me that when the residents and the staff are smiling that this is the sign of a well managed ASL). Eventually our mother passed away; however, the staff and management at Lakeview were nothing short of WONDERFUL (in every since of the word). The staff CONSISTENTLY went \"above & beyond\" What they were required to do in the daily care of our mother. The director (Callie) was frequently in communication with us...consultations, discussions regarding the future \"care\" plans, and phone calls when problems (potential or otherwise) arose. A couple of months after our mother passed away, I went to see Callie and told her that we would like to purchase a gift for the staff and told Callie \"if it helps the residents; that is wonderful; however, we want to let the staff know of our appreciation for the manner in which they (the staff) cared for our mother.\" After thinking over this for several weeks, Callie back to let me know what the staff needed and we immediately purchased the item(s) and had these shipped to Lakeview Estates. Several times over the past couple of years, I have been asked (by my peers) \"what was our opinion of Lakeview Estates\" and I tell them (what is in this review) and then add \"as long as Callie Simmons is the director of Lakeview Estates; it will continue to be a well ran ASL that cares for its. patients.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888922b2f2f96b31:0x5179ee53183df8e9"}

After a good amount of research and visiting several locations in town, we visited Kirkwood By The River.  The difference was immediately obvious.  It just felt different than the other facilities we had visited.  There were lots of residents and employees visible throughout the facility, and they seemed happy!  Each one spoke to us and to each other and smiled.  The setting in the woods by the Cahaba River is gorgeous and serene.  The building and grounds are well kept and very clean.  We toured the facility with Mom and Dad multiple times over several months, and in early December they moved into Independent Living.\n\nThere are several things that make Kirkwood a superior choice over other facilities in town:  1) It is a not-for-profit facility and that makes a world of difference in how it\u2019s run.  2) The executive staff, including the CEO, is right there in the building and frequently visible, always working and/or engaging with residents.  This allows for rapid decision-making and problem resolution.  3) The entire staff at Kirkwood is kind and helpful.  As we\u2019ve gotten to know many of them, the overwhelming majority has worked at Kirkwood for 20+ years.  That\u2019s rare in today\u2019s world and speaks volumes about the work environment.  Happy employees = better care and attention to detail.  4) Kirkwood houses all levels of care under one roof; Independent Living, Assisted Living, Memory Care, Rehab and Skilled Nursing.  This was critical for us because if necessary in the future, Mom and Dad can remain in the same building and see each other daily, but reside in and receive different levels of care.\n\nWe have peace of mind now knowing that Mom and Dad have help when they need it and yet are able to live mostly on their own with the cat they adore.  They both have settled in nicely after 3+ months and are happy and comfortable.  Kirkwood By The River was definitely the best choice for our family.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1599769758567, "text": "Thank you so much for sharing your experience.

The campground is actually a trailer park with some spots for camping. We stay in many campgrounds, some better than others, but this is the first time we have driven through a campground and left. I could not even find the camp office to begin with and everybody at the trailer park was staring us down when we drove through.\n\nWhen I couldn't find the office, I called the owner back to tell her we had changed our minds. She did not answer her phone. I got a phone call later on from a different number and it was the owner. I let her know that her park was not what we expected and that we had changed our minds. She got an attitude with me and said, \"Thanks for letting me know. I waited for you for over an hour.\" I then informed her that I had tried to call and she didn't answer. I did not bother to mention that she wasted an hour of my time and the gas that I used to drive to her disappointment of a trailer park that she is trying to pass off as a campground.

After we spoke, I did see that you had called the office number, which is supposed to be transferred to my cell phone. So I called you at 6:10 and we both missed each other.

They can very easily rectify matters, but so far they refuse to do so. It has to do with the beauty salon.\nIf you\u2019re loved one wishes to get their hair done they may make use of the in-house salon. There is a form that the person responsible to pay the salon charges fills out. You may leave a credit card on file and you may opt to just have your card used whenever the resident wishes or be asked if you\u2019re in agreement with your family member having their hair done before being charged. This is so that a family member who is losing their mental acuity doesn\u2019t decide to go get their hair done too often, which was our situation, and we stipulated on the form that we\u2019d like to be contacted first.\nHowever, our card was charged several times with no permission request beforehand. To the tune of approximately $500.00. With our busy life we didn\u2019t catch these charges as they were incurred. Once we did see them, we called and got them stopped.  To their credit, The Blake admitted they were in the wrong. However, it has been over a year of requesting the fraudulent charges be reversed or having a check sent to us. We\u2019ve been in touch with the beauty salon, patient representatives, the facility manager and a regional manager. We\u2019ve allowed each person along the way ample time to make it right, sometimes two months before we call again, but no resolution is ever forthcoming. Now, they\u2019ve stopped taking our calls.\nWe will now pursue this with our credit card company.\nOur family member passed away in May of 2020, so they are no longer a resident. I would hate to think that is the reason we now are not even getting our phone calls answered.\nIf you\u2019re wondering why our family member passed away, it was due to the virus. We were told she was the only one in the whole facility to contract it. A subsequent email from The Blake that was emailed to families of the residents claimed to have zero cases of the virus at The Blake.\nI suppose no place can be 100% above board at all times, but these things concern us.\nPlease don\u2019t misunderstand us.

During that time he fell 3 times. They said he was physically aggressive and called an ambulance to take him to the hospital. They only way we knew this was - the hospital called for information.  If he became angry, and he might have, it was because he was scared!  However, 2 hours later when the ambulance did arrive, he was asleep in his chair.  He is now in the hospital with pneumonia.  These residents are not safe! Oh! ...and I had left him a gift bag with a variety of items the first day.
