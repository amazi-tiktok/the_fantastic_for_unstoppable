The workers leave dogs in pee and poop filled kennels for hours before they are cleaned.\nThe dogs don't go outside from 4pm to 7am the next day.\nThey have had 2 cases of kennel cough since spring break, and have still been using the same sponge to clean all of the dog bowls.\nIf your dog is having a health issue while boarding, the workers will not tell you about it if they don't think it's serious. There are dogs who get incredibly sick either from stress or other health problems that result in blood in the vomit and/or stool. The only thing they do is take the dogs food and water away and don't let them outside.\nThe dogs water bowls are only checked at 7am and then again at 4pm. So your dog may be going without water for any number of hours between those times and the workers will ignore it. The bowls are only cleaned once per day, so if your dog is boarding for several days, there's a very good chance that they'll have the same bowl of water over the course of their stay. They have a major rat problem there, so often times there is rat feces in the water bowls.\nThe dogs are left alone all night with the rats, which your dogs could be eating over night, making them very sick and possibly catching diseases.\nThe workers do not have first aid training, so if your dog chokes on the mulch that is outside in the play area, then they are told to \"look up an instructional video\" to help the choking dog.\nThey don't pay attention to what the dogs are doing because they're too busy on their phones to care. So if your dog poops mulch (very bad for his digestive system) then it's because they were eating it from the play area. There are also several dogs who eat poop, so if your dog has that habit, it's probably only getting worse because they think they're allowed to do it while staying there.\nWhen the dogs are playing outside, they are sometimes not given water for several hours due to certain dogs not liking the water hose.\nI have witnessed a coworker giving the wrong dog her medicine. Once that realization was made, still nothing was done about it.\nIf your dog is not good with other dogs, they are set as \"individuals\" where they play by themselves. These dogs are only getting 10 minutes outside to play, and then they get 10 minutes inside to play. They are supposed to have another 10 minutes to play but are usually skipped because the workers want to go home early. So if your dog is boarding over the weekend and they're not good with other dogs, then they're only getting about 20 minutes of outside time every day while the other dogs get over 2 hours.\nThe weekend hours are different, so all of the play groups are shortened and the dogs are left alone for a lot longer than they normally would be.\nTheir medicine is put in pill pockets in their food. If the dog doesn't voluntarily eat the pill pockets, then that dog will not be getting their medicine that day.\nThe dogs only have access to their food for a couple hours a day. So if your dog is a grazer and doesn't eat all of their food at once then they will be eating very little over the course of their stay.\nThe kennels are painted very poorly, paint is always chipping off the walls, usually because dogs are chewing it off.\nWorkers regularly spray dogs in the face with Bitter Apple spray. This spray is supposed to be used for dogs that have problems chewing their fur, and is not meant to be sprayed in the eyes or nose of the dogs, but they are regularly sprayed in the face if they are barking in their kennels.\nIf you request for your dog to be given a bath, they will usually bathe the dogs very early in the day to get it out of the way. Once they're bathed, they are not allowed back outside and their food and water bowls are taken away. So if you dropped your dog off at 8am to be picked up around 5pm, there's a good chance that your dog hasn't been outside or had food or water since about 10am.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1519324162478, "text": "Hi Lori, I wanted to reply here as well since I did not hear back from you regarding this same review you left on Facebook.\nI'm truly sorry this is how you felt about working at CDT.\n\nAs one of the owners, and the person responsible for systems management in the locations I am very upset to hear these things.

We first contacted Red Dog to care for our 3 older dogs because boarding them was too stressful. Our dogs needed medication multiple times each day and they were just more comfortable in their own home. We knew from the first time we met Cydney and Kayla that we could trust our babies with them. We were thrilled by how much all 3 dogs loved each of the dog sitters who came to take care of them. We could see they were well cared for in the many pictures sent to me after each visit. It was so nice to be able to go on vacation and not worry about our elderly dogs at home.\nNow we have a puppy who we do not want to leave in his crate all day while we are at work.  So we have the best dog sitter in the world come visit him, take him out to potty and a short walk each day. I honestly think Kayla is our puppy's favorite person.  And if Kayla can't visit him one day, Red Dog sitting arranges for another awesome sitter to come visit without me even having to worry about making arrangements.

I have been using them for about 10 years and I have never been so serene while away. I have several cats and dogs and over the years some of them have had to have medications given. RedDog doesn't charge extra for multiple animals or when meds need to be given. I get pictures and text each time they come to the house. They take care of the cats and dogs, feed fish in the ponds, fill birdfeeders, watch the water level in the pool, etc.  The sitters have even stayed extra during thunderstorms to comfort the pets until the storm passes. At times my flights have been canceled or delayed and I can contact them and get an extra sit or two to cover the unexpected extra time away. The animals love them and are so happy to be home (rather than at a kennel). RedDog is a very professional and caring service that takes the best care of my babies. I have recommended them to several friends who now use them as well. I don't  what I would do without RedDog. If they retire, I'll never be able to travel again!

I had been taking them to my office for awhile, but they got too big and rambunctious. They were still too young to be left alone all day. RedDog was a lifesaver. They took care of the boys, plus the other three adult bulldogs we already had. We have never had less than five dogs at once, which always made traveling or overnight trips a hassle. Boarding that many dogs was expensive, not to mention traumatic for them, having to be away from home. RedDog stepped in there as well, providing overnight service for our crew in our own home! The peace of mind this gave us when we were away is beyond words. Over the years, our crew has grown and changed, adding in granddogs as well. Currently, we have 11 dogs in and out of our home!! This includes 4 new French bulldog puppies! Again, these needed extra attention, and RedDog was there, providing twice daily visits for the pups. We also have a special needs bulldog, who wears diapers at all times, as well as special medications. RedDog never balked. They change Lily\u2019s diapers, give her meds, and whatever else is needed. We get photo updates at every visit, as well as special texts if there are any specific concerns. RedDog has even taken one of our dogs to the vet when a scuffle broke out and she was injured. We cannot say enough about, nor recommend RedDog more highly. They are a part of our family, and we would not trust anyone else with our crew!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1546190812430, "text": "Thank you, Joe, for this amazing review!

Like I said previously, they have helped us in and out of last minute situations. As a cancer patient, I would be checked into hospitals and facilities sometimes out of town and at the very last minute. Having a working relationship with Red Dog has really helped facilitate taking care of our babies if they needed access to the house (they already had a key) or if the babies ran out of food during the unexpected stay and they purchased food till we could get home with a reimbursement. Needless to say, we can sleep a whole lot better at night when we are out of town and get those pictures of our babies at the end of the day that our sitter has sent to us via email or text.

The owner of this facility and the manager were told on multiple occasions by employees and were aware of the following: Fire extinguishers (they only have 2) being extremely out of date, last checked back in 2015\u2014 also no evacuation plan, or safety drills, air vent maintenance doesn\u2019t take place\u2014 vents/filters not properly maintained can easily catch fire, this company works with LIVE animals, the safety of your dogs are not being considered as you can tell from the images.... everything is layered with years of dog dander and hair.\nWhen the heater gets turned on the smell of burning hair lasts for days and the company uses wax melts up front to mask the smells. They also stuff the vents they don\u2019t clean with smell good beads to mask the smell.\nEven daycare dogs are kenneled. Employees hang around upfront until around 9 when they decide to start putting dogs in daycare\u2014- this means if you\u2019re paying for a full day or even a half day of doggie daycare starting in the morning your furbabies are missing out on 2+ hours of socialization. This facility doesn\u2019t properly clean the daycare room. And weeks worth of hair is noticeable near the drains in the daycare play areas, this is extremely unsafe for your animals/the employees. The smell in this building that\u2019s separate from the building your drop off your dog is horrific. Dogs are left unsupervised in daycare, and the daycare supervision in maintained outside of the daycare rooms- so instead of dogs getting that one-on-one attention they are only monitored when barking has increased. Because of that, rooms aren\u2019t cleaned right away causing burns on paw pads from dogs playing around in urine. Most dogs have to be ran through Grooming to be spot cleaned before leaving. Bored dogs have started eating the walls of this establishment because of the lack of social interaction they receive. This facility illegally mentioned to employees that they can not pay overtime to them when they have worked 40+ hrs. Because of this, I believe the care of the animals that go there are being affected.\nDuring the recent snow storm an employee managed to chase a already nervous dog around the front lobby of this establishment causing him to run out of the front door. This dog was missing for a week and found with his hip shattered, and he had ate an entire toe off of himself.. this establishment paid his vet bill which included the cost of utilization. Clearly the proper training of employees is not being conducted. This facility also does not clean kennels often and when they do they use a dirty mop to wipe out the kennels. This is probably a factor to the outbreak of kennel cough they are currently battling.\nMany times employees just feed  dogs breakfast without even bothering to clean the kennel first or move the dog to a clean kennel.. that means that they were eating breakfast in their own filth and kenneled with it until daycare started up. In It\u2019s hard enough trusting someone, let along finding out an establishment you\u2019re paying LOTS of money to is neglecting your animal. This establishment recently caused the death of a small 4 lb dog, and they are trying to cover it up. By deleting comments and blocking any negativity they receive. I refuse to be silent.

I met Pam in Pet Smart and she was so friendly, so when I needed a groomer I called her.  She has been grooming Casper ever since.  She is a very caring, loving groomer to all dogs.   Bichon's are very tedious to shape, blow out and make fluffy. Casper loves his bath and Spa day.  An excellent caring place to take care of your four legged children.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888c4faeedf32e7:0xf3c5f7c6b54050a7"}
