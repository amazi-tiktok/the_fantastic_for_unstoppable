On Dec 8 2020 Dr. Bonazt entered the room and began talking with the door of the room wide open. I asked if he could close the door while we discussed my injury. His response no because of COVID-19 a violation of my patients rights mind you Dr. Bonazt was not wearing a mask nor gloves so much for concerns. Also, while waiting on him the door was closed the entire time and anyone else that entered closed the door behind them. He ask me what my job title was twice which I\u2019m sure was on my report. He indicated that the fracture was healing pretty good I didn\u2019t need surgery and therefore there was nothing else he could do. I question him because I must be 100% my strength in my hand indicated that I could hold up to13lbs briefly. I asked him for copies of the report he denied me of that also, stating that workman\u2019s comp would have to request it. Forgetting when I visit him the first time he did.

Unfortunately you are assigned the same doctor for LIFE at this practice.\n\nThis is the most absurd practice concept I have ever heard of. Instead of seeking the best doctor patient relationship this practice cares more for administrative duties and collecting as many co pays as possible.\n\nAs my wife accompanied me to my appointment literally in tears pleading for  help with managing my general anxiety we were met with ZERO SYMPATHY and were denied a refill of an very common anti anxiety medication I have used in the past on multiple occasion when it was absolutely necessary to do so (valium).\n\nRather than attempting to dig into the problem she exasperated the issue and the most she would do was refer me to a psychiatrist. Never mind in Texas with my  primary care doctor I was able to get prescription refills without ever having to see such a doctor. They were more than competent and experienced enough handle simple issues like these.\n\nI was treated with contempt and my personal integrity was questioned on multiple occasion regarding a medication I have been taking literaly for years.\n\nDo not waste your time with this practice. Do not waste your time with Gaile Prentice, she is utterly unsympathetic, contentious, and unqualified as a Certified Nurse Practitioner to act as a primary care provider.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886265774d3585eb:0xdade2efa9001babe"}

The entire staff is professional and caring. Dr. Beckham has the best bedside manner and makes you feel totally at ease to discuss anything. He is professional yet personable, and he takes the time to listen to you and studies your medical history to determine best treatment methods. The most important thing is that I trust Dr. Beckham\u2019s judgement, he has years of experience and extensive knowledge in this field of practice. Also, if you need to have a colonoscopy this is the place to go. My first one was done in a hospital setting it was very cold and clinical. My second one was performed here, and they made me feel comfortable and totally at ease. The only thing I dread about my next one is prep day. Colon cancer runs in my family, so it is recommended that I be tested every four years thus I am happy my primary doctor referred me to Dr. Beckham. I want to also give a shout out to Jason and Cheryl my attending nurses before and after the procedure. They made the experience much more pleasant then my first one. Shoot, I can\u2019t name all of them but the Anesthesiologist, Dr. Logan, was great, the Nurse Anesthetist and Dr. Beckham\u2019s attending Nurse during the procedure were also awesome.

Without your name or doctor, I can't address your specific situation, but I would like to discuss the unique challenges with the schedules of our very busy consulting practice. In addition to our clinic, our doctors staff 4 surrounding hospitals including ER, floor and intra-operative consults around the clock. 90% of our practice involves routine health maintenance and simple office related diseases, but the rest involves more serious issues, periodically managing life threatening conditions such as serious bleeding, infections or cancers. The concept of triage in medicine involves addressing these conditions immediately which forces  delays the rest of the day.\n\nAlso, with increasing government healthcare mandates, we must have patients complete numerous forms, especially on their first visit even for relatively small problems. These then have to be entered in our electronic medical record by our staff. This data can then be exchanged with hospitals and other doctors (primary care or referrals) to help insure patient safety and reduction in duplicated services. To reduce time in our waiting room, we recommend completing these forms online through our patient portal on our website which can then be entered into our electronic records prior to your check in.\n\nAlso I would like to address your description of our office. We take great pride in adhering to health care standards for cleaning and disinfection of our facilities. We have nightly service from a nationally recognized,  health certified cleaning company that adheres to Association for Professionals in Infection Prevention standards.\n\nOur policy is to inform waiting patients of delays with the doctor's schedule, and this appears to be where we fell short. I have already addressed this with our staff and will reinforce this on our Policies and Procedures Manual. I welcome a constructive dialogue regarding your specific situation and hope we can achieve your trust again.\n\nJon D.

Once your insurance company pays its contracted portion, you will receive a statement in the mail explaining the portion your insurance paid and what (if any) balance is your responsibility.

Unfortunately, my husband had to go back to work so, I told them I would pick it up tomorrow.\n\nUnfortunately, that is not the end of this story. I had time later that evening to go try again around 6pm or so. When I walked back in I actually heard them whisper and groan, \u201cIt\u2019s her\u201d. One pharmacist, a tall, thin woman with glasses, exasperatedly began to tell me just how many prescriptions they had to fill that night and how when I said tomorrow mine had been pushed back. This was my prepackaged birth control that they had in stock. I could be wrong but I am fairly certain that it only requires a print out to give it, or at least that's all I have ever seen. I was informed that they could manage it in 15 minutes, and so I waited and inquired about how to move my prescriptions.\n\nSo, I waited feeling belittled and absolutely uncomfortable. I decided if I had 15 minutes I would make a complaint to customer service. Once that was done I went on my way, but as soon as I got home and spoke to a friend she too had a series of stories about the tall pharmacist with glasses.

When I found out on 8/15/2020 that I would need my gallbladder removed, I called his office and scheduled an appointment for 8/20/2020. When I started running a fever and having chills on 8/16/2020 (which is one of the things the hospital ER nurse practitioner warned me to seek care for if it happened) my primary physician started me on antibiotics and recommended that I contact Dr Zelickson\u2019s office and leave a message for his nurse so that they could hopefully see me sooner.\n\nInstead, his nurse asked me \u201cwhy I thought it was my gallbladder anyway\u201d and (mistakenly) informed me that gallbladder issues don\u2019t cause fevers. She said she would have to ask if they could still see me in the office at all because of this. Never mind that my primary physician\u2019s office understood that there is a possibility of infection, and never mind that the ER physician and nurse practitioner both understood this as well. This nurse didn\u2019t believe it was an issue. She acted like I had no idea what I was talking about and had just decided all on my own that I needed my gallbladder removed.\n\nI immediately contacted another surgeon\u2019s office. Nobody there had a problem understanding what was going on- the nurses didn\u2019t , the surgeon didn\u2019t, and the receptionist didn\u2019t. She had me come in that very same afternoon (yesterday, 8/18/2020) and my wonderful new general surgeon recognized the issue at hand. He removed my gallbladder this morning (8-19-2020) and it was necrotic and covered in pus. THAT is what was causing my fever, and THAT is how a knowledgeable office handles this.\n\nDr Zelickson and his nurse were flat-out wrong. His nurse called me later yesterday (after I had already called and spoke to receptionist about why I was canceling my appointment) because they needed to reschedule me due to my temperature. Thank goodness I found a surgeon with qualified nurses who actually know how to recognize an infection. I couldn\u2019t eat and could barely drink from 8/15/2020 on. I made Dr Zelickson\u2019s office aware of this also when I made my initial appointment. I really liked Dr Zelickson and his staff when he was at the previous practice but this one is absolutely terrible. They had no problem ignoring my symptoms and apparently believe signs of infection aren\u2019t a thing.\n\nAlso, even though I called and canceled my appointment for tomorrow (8/20/2020), and then told the nurse I was canceling my appointment and going elsewhere, I\u2019ve still gotten reminder calls so I have to call yet again I suppose and make sure they know I\u2019m not coming because I wouldn\u2019t put it past them at this point to try and bill me for a missed appointment.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cac9e5152c3:0xea2e615b781d3ca9"}

I am very disappointed in my \"very short\" visit with Dr. Rosenstiel and staff. (Well I didn't even meet Dr. Rosenstiel???!) Being that I live in Montgomery, I have to request a day off for ALL my eye appointment visits.  I am not new to UAB Callahan Eye Hospital as I've had multiple surgeries within the last three years there. As a matter of fact I just had an appointment there two weeks ago with the incredible Dr. Priscilla Fowler and staff.   I've been diagnosed with Kerataconus and Dr. Priscilla Fowler is my primary eye doctor.  Dr. Fowler and staff are some of the nicest people I've met in the eye care industry. Earlier this year and this past month I received the Cross-Linking  procedure.  I spent over $6000 within the last three years at Callahan eye.  Dr. Fowler and staff treat me with respect on EVERY visit,  yet on December 10 with Dr. Rosenstiel and staff I felt the lesser of.  This visit was scheduled to replace my old sclera lenses with new.  You would think before my arrival they would've did their research on my condition.  Upon my arrival in the room, Dr. Rosenstiel's nurse asked if I ever had sclera lenses?? (I'VE HAD SCLERA CONTACTS FOR THE LAST 6 YEARS??) From there, he goes straight into and I quote, \"before we even see you, you have to pay X amount of dollars!?. Furthermore, he adds, \"The Lenses will be an additional $XXXX.XX amount of dollars to get them?   Now at this point I was feeling as though they did not want to help me as Dr. Fowler and staff did you for the last couple of years.?  Now do mind you I've already spent thousands of dollars to get my eyes corrected.  The money is not an option, but I felt inferior to his demands.  I also wondered have they even looked in my charts from previous visits.? \"Have they even checked my insurance\" I thought to myself?  At that point I asked him a series of questions in terms of verifying my insurances and deductibles. To no avail he says nothing will be covered. Now as I mentioned money would not be a concern as I've spent a lot of money to fix my Eye disease. ( As well as the removal of an tumor in my eyelid two years prior ).  More questions came to mind in this parlay with Dr. Rosenstiel's nurse.  At this point I felt that the nurse is trying to rush me so he leaves then comes back with a business card and prices on it. He then states, \" if you have any questions please call Melissa\" on the business card. I agreed and proceeded to leave. Upon leaving, I felt very embarrassed to even be there. I rushed out and got in my car. I kept thinking to myself \"have they even check my insurance\". So I called my wife, and she confirmed we do have Eye insurance.  I decided I needed to call them back to confirm and verify with them that I have insurance, the same insurance I've used last three years. Two calls later and one left message, I still have not heard from Melissa, Dr. Rosenstiel , or the male nurse that was talking to me. I never even got to meet Dr. Rosenstiel??? I will still come up to visit Dr. Fowler but I will do my business elsewhere in finding new Sclera lenses!\nVery disappointing!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bea1d7b458b:0x2741eb9855e3054"}

Three hours later a doctor and nurse finally came in to apply skin glue to the cut.  They didn't really seem to know what they were doing and just plastered the glue all over the wound like a 3-year-old with a glue stick and then sent us home.  Having had skin glue used before, I knew this did not look right and you could immediately tell the glue had not sealed the wound because you see fluids building up under it.  Sure enough, by the middle of the next morning the glue had fallen off and the wound was open again.  I decided to just deal with it at home.

I know it is not an easy task, and I had no side effects with the 1st round and very little to none with the 2nd round.

My back kept becoming worse and the pain got to the point I couldnt take it anymore after hurting for about 6 years. Dr. Heck told me that he could help me but i had to have a long and extensive back surgery that was about 5 to 6 hours long. I was ready for anything and I left his office that day confident he would help me.\nDr. Heck came out 3 times during the surgery to speak to my husband to let him know how I was doing, and where he was in the surgery. That meant so much to my husband and me that he had that much consideration not to leave my husband wondering what was going on.\nI came out of surgery that day PAINFREE, after 6 years of constant hurting.  I was Up walking around the hospital floor on the second day feeling like wonder woman, I went home on the 3rd day. I can also walk straight and stand straight. That was a bonus that I didn't know that could be fixed.\nEveryone from the nurse care in recovery, the nurses there on the floor that took the most gentle and sweet care of me. The sweet people that brought your food, the folks that came to your room to get your food order, to the sweet sweet girls that cleaned my room were a joy to be around. GREAT HOSPITAL!!\nBoth of Dr Heck's office staff are great and attentive.

It\u2019s not like they\u2019re manufacturing it, they are literally just COUNTING to 20 or 30, etc. Half the time when it is ready, they can\u2019t find it.\nExample: Doctor sent in 2 prescriptions at once, I received a text that it was ready. Went to pick it up 3 HOURS after they text only to find out that they had only filled 1, not the other. Why would you not fill both at the same time, or at least within 3 HOURS when they come across at the same time?! Why send a notification when you\u2019ve only done half your job, for me to have to drive out there twice (whilst having to load up a toddler and an infant both times)?

Well in this case today, which is December 15th, i spoke with another gentlman named ELI  and he denied me permission to donate as well as said he was deferring me for my actions. I explained to him  i have a daughter who is 5 years old and i need the $ from my donation for her Christmas i have on layaway. He kept asking my name so he could defer me. I apologized for the way i walked in through the back exit door and explained  That i was just in very much in need of the $. When it comes to my lil girl i do not give up and i will do anything and everything for her. I was never rude but i did not give him my name. I showed him i had $80 in my wallet and let him know i was not one of the drug addicts and desperate for money for dope, but that i was a working father who is doing what he can and would love to see his dauggter happy and excited on Christmas. Though Eli never quit or even thought about changing his mind after i explained what that little but of change they give us for donating meant alot to me. And i apologized sincerely numerous of times. Well as i walked out he said to me. You cant donate today and ill see u again and when i do u will b deferred. It furiated me to the point i dont like. He purposely and willingly stood between me and my lil girls happiness. I find that Eli (the manager) is very unprofessional and is fully taking advantage of his authority.

I wish we could divide this up, as having one cumulative review summary about the whole mall is not very useful.  For example, if I were going to a normal mall for the Bass Pro Shop, why would I care how good the Bath and Bodyworks or the AMC are?  In the same way here, if I'm going to get my blood drawn, what do I care about how much people like the imaging center?  (It is also kind of funny how it is called a mall.  I imagine going to each \"store\" and doing their tests as I walk along.)\n\nI was called to the room.  My nurse was quiet, either tired (I came in the evening, so who knows how long she had been on the clock already) or introverted like me.  Certainly not in a cold way.  But she counted down and then inserted the needle, and I barely felt it.  But that's not the amazing part.  I was answering questions for the other nurse in the room (who was super friendly!), and when she found out I was on new insurance, the nurse drawing my blood told me she would need my card.  I was confused because it sounded like they wanted it now, but I was thinking 'Is it safe to reach into my pocket with a needle in my arm?' Then i looked down... She had taken out the needle and bandaged me up without me even noticing.\n\nUnmatched talent.  All I can say. And this is coming from someone who gets his blood tested monthly. I wish I had gotten her name to give her the proper credit and maybe even contact the hospital higher-ups for a formal compliment.  But I will in time...

The nurses were mostly kind, but they dropped the ball several times.  When I came out of surgery the nurses left the IPC device unplugged until I woke up from my morphine induced sleep 6 hours later.  It was good that I educated myself beforehand so that I knew that they needed to turn it on.  The next problem was their lack of food options.  I eat a very clean diet, so the heavily processed and salty food just destroyed my stomach. I decided to go without food instead of making myself sick with their food.  On the night of June 16th, my nurse had a trainee and neither one of them offered to help me walk the halls.  I explained that I was in extreme pain and suffering from nausea and dizziness.  I made it to the restroom on my own 3 times and asked them to please review the cup and dispose of it.  The night nurses did not check on me, so I was left to care for it in my own.  When i finally fell asleep, I was woken around midnight by the loud crackling of the 2 nurses.  In the morning I explained that the meds weren't helping with my pain, nausea, or dizziness.  The nurse told me that I needed to take more meds or showering would be unbearable.  She was very abrassive and kept trying to push me take more meds.  Never once did she offer to help me to walk in order to relieve some of the pressure.  I was listed as a fall risk (due to anemia), and the nurses instructed me to shower on my own.  I barely made it back to the bed before passing out.  I clicked the nurse help button and the new nurse on duty came in to help me get back in bed.  The lab tech that drew my blood (the second time) was not any more considerate of my pain.  She immediately rammed her cart into my bed and blamed it on her supervisor not getting her a cart with brakes. She then inserted the needle wrong and had to restick me.  It looks like the hospital needs to up their training in compassion for the majority of their nurses.  The one nurse that was like an angel was Beatrice.  I think the younger nurses should watch and follow her lead.  Thankfully I was released soon after.  I'm able to walk with the help of my husband and he regularly reminds me to do my breathing exercise to avoid post op pneumonia. It seems easy enough to take care of yourself after a surgery, but I spent most of the time sleeping or in pain.  Thr nurses told me that I needed to walk the halls 3x/day and not a single one of them offered to help me despite the fact that I was a fall risk.  I needed the nurses to remind me and help me to take care of myself, and they failed at that several times.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1592844490963, "text": "We're disappointed to hear of these experiences.

Speaking on the behalf of My wife . Her first visit two months ago, it was terrible. I went to the hospital to sit with my wife . As i went through the emergency room to see exactly how to find her . An African American lady rudely described how to get to the \u201cfast track \u201c room . I followed directions and it was an empty floor with dimes lights on one end of the hall and light on the other end of the hall . Let\u2019s not forget i am not from Alabama. I am from Illinois. There was no nurse to be found . I stumbled across a worker who was janitor and asked did he see any nurses . He stated he doesn\u2019t know . I called the emergency room off of my phone for directions to find the fast track room . Her voice grew as i was confused on finding the room . And as she got frustrated she said i can come back downstairs because my wife was discharged. As the janitor continues to work i ask him how do i get back downstairs , he politely gave me directions to the elevator. As i pass the empty dark patient rooms on the second floor , i stumbled past the fast track room . As i begin to knock i hear nurses laughing uncontrollably and loud . The nurse answer the door and asked what is it that i need as if i was interrupting as she chew her sandwich in her mouth and sandwich in her hand . I told her i was looking for my wife and why isn\u2019t there a nurse on the floor as i walked around for an half hour looking for help as you nurses have the door closed . She showed me to my wife. I ask the nurse why did the emergency room associate who sign people in tell me that my wife was being discharged . She stated that she doesn\u2019t know . I sat with my wife and asked how was she she said that the service is terrible and believe the nurses has no idea what they are doing . Blood was on the wall i asked why she said the nurse caused that from the needle she put into her and another nurse was making the previous nurse clean it up but she didn\u2019t finish . As i stayed i complained about the hospitality of the workers there . The nurses didn\u2019t state what they were doing every move they made on her . And i wanted to ask just to see if they were going to say something. And they didn\u2019t as they finished up with her we hurry up and left . Yesterday we went to the same enterprise hospital because my wife was in pain . We were the only two in the emergency room at 4 am . They er clerk said the doctors were situating a person that came in through ambulance. Which made me question exactly how many doctors and nurses are there . The nurses were better this time but the shadow girl never stated who she was . The doctor came in and said they couldn\u2019t find exactly what was causing her pain as they lazy butt barely tried to find out . They gave her medicine AT the hospital and said that\u2019s all they are going to give her for her pain in the stomach . We went home and she woke back up with pain just a few hours later . We went to flowers hospital and the hospitality was amazing it was faster and more professional and caring than enterprise hospital and they asked why did the nurse do this but not that . We didn\u2019t know but we knew enterprise hospital was a bad hospital not to mention they weight machine did not work at all . Crazy right?!? Despite the drive . It was worth it because Flowers found the underlying problem enterprise hospital failed to figure out . With something that only took an x ray to find out . And was seen by two different doctors with in the same hour . It\u2019s sad. I would never recommend anybody go to enterprise hospital even if they were dying . I hope it gets better for the community and those who depend on this hospital. On the other hand thanks to flowers for everything.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88926c2431ffc953:0x4f7011db67be22d6"}

On day one, she did receive great care with nurse Justin and Page.  It progressively got worse however with the new nursing staff refusing to help her with bathing and showering until her doctor made his rounds. Well, the doctor didn't make rounds until 4 PM on day three which meant all day without caring for her hygiene. What makes it worse is that she had n/v and diarrhea. She had a heart monitor and IV so couldn't do it on her own. Unacceptable! The room was left with dirty linen piled high on the bathroom floor and trash full to the rim for two days in the a row. Each day at around 6 PM when she gave up hope for her room to be cleaned, she had to call to get the room refreshed. Gross! When her liquid diet got changed to bland, she was sent a dish with ground beef.  She's never eaten ground beef in her life.  If she would have had an opportunity to talk to dietician or fill out a form, he/she would have known this fact. Most of the staff were cold and made her feel like she was a burden. Did they forget why they get a paycheck?! My mom did not want to complain but when I saw her holding back tears, I called Chad McCullough, CEU of the hospital.  He was very nice and apologetic. He agreed that the care she received was unacceptable. After talking to Chad, the floor manager and charge nurse suddenly came to identify themselves on day four. My mom was a nurse at Flowers Hospital for several years and never witnessed this lack of care and disrespect.

This is the absolute WORST hospital I have ever been to. The only two good Doctors there are Dr. Uyamadu and Dr. Gabrielson. The other two I have seen, Dr. Mahurin and Dr. Reed are terrible!! Last year, my daughter and I were seen by Dr. Reed because we were both running fevers and had chills. We weren\u2019t tested for flu or anything. He only listed to our lungs and said our lungs sounded clear and said it was probably something viral and sent us on our way. One day later, we were so sick. I could barely move, I was weak, high fever, chills, body aches and hallucinations. My daughter still had fever and chills and body aches. Family members took us to Columbus and we found out I had Pneumonia and my daughter had a really bad upper respiratory infection.\n\nOn the next occasion, earlier this year, I had the unpleasant experience of meeting Dr. Mahurin. I was there due to knee pain and swelling and I could barely walk. He was very rude and I was very uncomfortable with the encounter.  He ordered me an X-ray and told me I had severe joint disease and that I would need a knee replacement. Well my PCP referred me to an orthopedic who did an X-ray as well and said I had a small meniscus tear. When I told her what Dr Mahurin said, she laughed and thought I was joking. Medical Center Barbour has been known to misdiagnose patients a lot.\n\nAnother occasion was last night. I dropped my Husband off at ER because he had an excruciating headache due to a lump on the back of his head that went away but came back recently. I explained to the nurses before I dropped him off that the lump went away but it came back. The took him to the back but I wasn\u2019t able to stay there due to Covid. I didn\u2019t find out until after I picked him up that the Dr on duty was Dr. Mahurin. My Husband said he was very rude and that he laid there in pain until he got ready to leave and they gave him a shot toradol and phenergan. Dr Mahurin asked my Husband if he had been hit in the head. My Husband told him that he had not been hit in the head and that it was a lump that was there before but came back. They ordered a CT scan and said they saw the lump but didn\u2019t see anything else. They didn\u2019t send him home with any type of medication, and his discharge papers stated that he was treated for a contusion after we specifically told the Nurses and Dr that he previously had the lump but it went away. They just automatically assumed they he took a blow to the head despite what we told them. What is the purpose of Home Care instructions if its instructions for something that he doesn\u2019t have. My Husband is still in pain and the only instructions I have to follow are for a contusion that he doesn\u2019t even have.\n\nThese Doctors at Medical Center Barbour, with the exception of two, needs to be fired. From my experiences and other reviews, I am not the only one who feels this way. People go to hospitals for help, but these Doctors make you feel worse than what you did coming in. They are rude, belittling and incompetent. I would rather drive 1 hr before I ever go back to Medical Center Barbour.

Dr reed and the gentlemen who handled the x rays. Thank you for doing your job and doing it well and not treating us like we\u2019re not important or with attitude because of our race\n\nIt is feb 4 of 2019 - and the sad truth about racism is still very vivid at this hospital. I\u2019ve been in the x ray department for 3 and a half hours. They are NOW beginning to start taking the X-rays.\nUpon entering the hospital within the first 10 minutes of waiting and filling paper work wAS one other patient complaining of the wait. After noticing the way the receptionist spoke to her I was convinced the receptionist must\u2019ve received attitude previous to us getting there because she was nasty with that patient. (Patient was black)\n\nAnother patient came in (patient is white) was seen within 30 minutes and I watched him exit guessing he was done w his visit.\n\nAfter being registered we were told to go to a room where we waited another hour and a half before speaking to the doctors assistant who agreed to do the x ray as a favor (I feel like personally if it\u2019s your JOB DESCRIPTION it\u2019s not a favor.\n\nI asked about the wait time 3 times and each time I was spoke to as if I was a problem and they were doing me a favor. I am a medical assistant myself in new York so I understand completely how it feels to be overwhelmed on a Monday however the way black people were spoke to and white people were spoke to were of completely different respect and reguard.\n\nAlso when asked the receptionist for help twice she repeated the question back asking me why I made the decision instead of offering assistance I found it VERY disrespectful and sarcastic makes me never want to visit a hospital in this town If this is how BLACK patients are treated.

I am actually considering starting a blog so the community and guests know how bad this hospital ER and staff really are. They have no idea how to treat patients. When I say \"Treat\". Not only, do I mean medically, but professionally either. I came in with a true simple condition. I could not get in to see my primary physician until Monday. My visit was Friday night. I was in transition of moving from one state to the other. I brought my current records from my current doctor, the medicine I was taking and EVEN HAD A MEDICAL CARD with all of my info including my picture, birth date, address, leading physician and contact info. Let me say first of all that I have pulmonary embolism. I do take a narcotic for pain management. I had accidently packed my medicine in a box that was meant for me to carry but ended up in the moving van that had not arrived at our new home yet and I was going into severe withdrawals. I had gone 10 days without and  I went in feeling like warmed over death. I presented my ID card, showing when I started my medicines, how many times a day I was prescribed to take it . This included all medicines I was prescribed for PE.( Pulmonary Embolism). I provided and showed the receptionist in highlighted areas exactly what I took. Did I get any blood thinners? No. Did I get something for my GI track? No. Did I get anything for the intense migraine I was suffering? No. Not only did the doctor treat me and talk to me disrespectfully, but so did the nurse. I had to leave the room to get sick where I was sick from both ends. Plus, let me say that my husband said he could hear everything that was coming out from a couple doors down, but so could everyone at the staff desk could hear it too which was emotionally damaging to me. I could not help how I was feeling. That's why I was there. The nurse came back and said \"okay, I've got a shot for you!\" In a snarky tone. I asked her, what is the shot for? She said. \"It's a shot of toridol. \" Um ... Toridol? I said. Yes. She said. \"The doctor is not putting his licence on the line to help you.\". I was so upset and and got up to leave. I let her know that it was quakes like this so called doctor that made people that had real problems go and have to buy drugs off the street because instead of just being honest with the doctor, people have to lie to be able to get the relief that they needed. First of all. When doctors have all the information to see that you are not a drug addict, and you truly came in to get legal compassionate help and choose to degrade you, treat you like you are less then a person especially when you have a life threatening disease.... Those doctors need to have their lisences pulled and they need to find another job where someone else can put up with his snarkiness and disrespectful comments. Him and his little blond nurse. If this is what healthcare for the sick has come to... No wonder why we have such a drug crisis in America. It was all brought on by doctors that didn't deserve to have any lisences of any kind. This hospital should and I will fight with all of my being to have it shut down completely. There is no reason to have a hospital that is not prepared for the patients they have or are soon to come. Shame on this ER. If you have an unfortunate accident, the extra miles to another ER will definitely benefit you more then this bandaid station. That's if they even have those on hand. I plan as of right now to find an attorney, or a group that sheds light on these quack farms. That's exactly what this is. And no one could ever tell me any differently. So if the staff and the board even read these reviews, you had better do something fast before we find a way to shut this POS place down. I will give you another clue... Look how many people put one star as their review. I bet they wished that they had a choice of none or negative stars to rate. I wish i would have checked the reviews before coming in. I would have never come.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1618432680452, "text": "We strive for good, quality patient care at MCB.

Basically the pharmacy didn't have my prescription. So when I used the telephone to call back into the doctors office, I felt like I wasn't going to be able to be helped properly. Not because of unprofessional staff or them having a desire to not help me. But because its a doctors office during a pandemic on top of already taking care of patients.\nSo I went online and began reading reviews. One response I kept reading was \"did you try messaging us on social media or direct thru our website\"? So that was what I decided to do. Now it was after 6pm when I messaged and just a few hours later I got a response. You may think getting a response at 9pm seems bad, but let me tell you. When your in need of help, getting a response at 9pm let me know that Go medical is taking care of their patients.\nSo now here we are at 930am the following morning and my problem has been resolved.

In the beginning I was heard, I was treated for my conditions, everything was going fine in my life other than one issue.(5\u2b50\ufe0f then) Until my last appointment, I didn\u2019t even see Dr.Go after being told that\u2019s who I would be seeing that day. I seen a Np that knows NOTHING about me or my conditions & who was rude and kept cutting me off, wouldn\u2019t even listen to what I had to say, She was hateful to me both times I was seen by her. She laughed at my concerns the first time. The second time she treated me like a liar and someone just fishing w/out allowing me to talk to inform her on what Dr. Go and I had discussed about MY issues and what actions we had taken so far. She admitted that she didn\u2019t know what my apt was even for. Dr. Go stopped one RX, that is REALLY dangerous to just quit prescribing to a patient \u201cCold Turkey.\u201d It states on the FDA website,& medical professionals that tapering IS necessary, I wasn\u2019t tapered at all. I wasn\u2019t I informed at my previous appointment with Dr. Go that I would no longer receive this RX. I didn\u2019t even get my own choice on which I believed my body/mind needed more to have quality of life. Along with the only testing/imaging that was ever ordered was ultrasound and CT which my disease won\u2019t show up on neither one of those as that has been proven by many other medical experts. Nothing further was even discussed to get an accurate diagnoses. Sent me for a CT with dye knowingly that I have a allergy to contrast dye and I had to be treated at the ER because of this and have my husband come 30 miles away to drive me b/c they didn\u2019t check my chart before ordering the scan. Dr. Go has always treated me w/respect and mostly listened to concerns. There was a few times I felt like he was only concerned about a symptom we\u2019ve already discussed when I had multiple concerns that was never addressed. I paid $70 copay to be seen every time besides once therefore I should see Dr. Go. He did help me for 6+ months, especially with my anxiety, etc, but now that my anxiety meds was removed w/o me even being informed my anxiety is @ it\u2019s worse since I lost my dad & two miscarriages this past year. If I was told last month, I could of tapered myself knowing that you need to safely be tapered from any barbiturate. So I felt reeled in at the start. I didn\u2019t break any rules or anything to cause this, either. My first apt I went I was told I would be seeing DR. Go, I didn\u2019t see him that day either. That day was with another NP, Dr. McDaniel, who I DO recommend if you go and have to see a NP. She truly did listen to my concerns and try her best to treat me in the best way allowed, I\u2019d solely give her a star alone, but again I was told by the front that day I\u2019d be seeing Dr. Go & didn't. Normally most DRs would have you come back in two/four weeks to monitor how the meds are working/if they need to be adjusted/changed, to check on how you\u2019re doing with them.  I was really disappointed in the care I received from the office my last visit. I\u2019ve been referring a lot of people to this office, but now I\u2019m unsure if that\u2019s the right thing to do. I truly hope this was just a mistake on the NP side & when I do go back I can see DR GO HIMSELF & discuss options or I will be looking for a different PCP to receive the help to accommodate me. I truly don\u2019t want to do that, but I don\u2019t want to continue to throw away $70 with nothing accomplished, really. MOST of the staff has good bedside manner,a few that could use more discipline as JOKING ab patients after they leave & their private health info is very unprofessional.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nUpdate: to the response, thank you for replying. I am not meaning my review to be hateful. I\u2019m adding a star since you took the time to look into this for me and replied. I have been satisfied the care I\u2019ve received prior to this day, that\u2019s why I said I didn\u2019t want to change PCP without seeing Dr. Go first to tell him how I am feeling about my last appointment.

I believe there were one or two nurses working, but a woman (albeit a very nice and helpful woman who did her job, or rather someone else's job, well) who's badge said Radiology Tech performed all nurse duties other than blood draw and throat swab. I spent most of the visit wishing I had gone / thinking about going somewhere else. I grew up in Vestavia, and this was one of many poor experiences I've had at that location over the years. About 10 years ago I had a nurse insert the blood draw needle upside down! Meaning, she put it in to where the tip of the needle was pointing towards my wrist. Absurd. I was right near it and looking for a urgent care when I went in this week. It didn't take me long to remember why I stopped going there. Also, I've read multiple negative reviews about Dr. Brentnall, and I'm here to add another. I was there with a cold and an unrelated YI. He asked me, \"Well, about that, we can't still get in to see our lady doctor, right?\" It was very dismissive, rude, and awkward. He really didn't pay any attention to what I had to say. He ordered a step test when I had clearly explained I knew the only reason my throat hurt was sinus drainage. The only thing he did listen to was my self-diagnoses. After much wasted time and unnecessary labs, he came in with a prescription for an upper respiratory infection and a YI - exactly what I told him I thought I had.  Overall, he made me uncomfortable and wishing I'd seen any doctor but him. Spare yourself, don't go to this office!

This was a truly baffling experience, and you should only come here if you want you symptoms ignored or to be immediately referred to an allergy specialist for cold / strep throat symptoms.\n\nHere's a quick list of things that Dr. Brentnall did or said to prevent me from ever coming back here again. I came in after my cold symptoms worsened for 5 days with no sign of improvement plus I had developed a bad sore throat and dizziness:\n\n- He treated me like a child. He grabs the instrument to look in my mouth, ears, and nose. He stares at me for a second then says, \"I can see better if you open your mouth.\" Are you serious?? How about you ask me to open my mouth? For all I know you're going for my nose!\n- \"your nose is red. Looks like you're bothered by the ragweed\". Proceeds to talk about an allergist he recommends and a medication etc. I have had allergies since I was 13, and they are under control. I know what allergies are, and this is not allergies. How about my nose is red because I've had COLD SYMPTOMS FOR 5 DAYS!?\n- He never asks about my symptoms. I had to force them on him by blurting them out when he walks in for the 4th or 5th time he's come in the room (usually to talk about allergies some more). He dismissed them all as either being allergies, my IBS (which is also under control), or a side effect of medication I've been taking for 6 YEARS! I have never had a negative reaction to this medication. I know it can start at any time, but what are the odds of all of these things happening at once rather than I actually have a bad cold, or the flu, or something else?!\n- He sat on the bed with me twice.... I was very uncomfortable. He should have grabbed a chair since there were practically no other patients in the entire office.\n- I cannot count the number of times he talked about allergies or particles in the air.\n- He tried to trick me into taking allergy medication. He vaguely described what it was when he listed the meds, and never said it was for allergies. I only found out when the pharmacist mentioned it. I already take a daily OTC allergy medication. I DO NOT HAVE AN ALLERGY PROBLEM!\n\nI'm really curious to know if he treats all of his patients this way or if it is just the female patients. Also, does he get some kind of kick back from the number of people he refers to this allergist?? My boyfriend and I left that place completely furious. Every time Dr. Brentnall left the room, we would rant to each other. I believe the staff could hear us through the door each time, and I really hope they did.\n\nI will say the only positive was the pharmacist. She was knowledgeable yet eager to learn when I told her I needed gluten free medications due to celiac. And there was no way I was going to get that allergy medication filled.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889220ea1374f87:0xf88c51cd3ebb99d0"}

He has been suffering from pain in his foot for over two months but could not afford a doctor's appointment. He doesn't have insurance and is working really hard to get back on his feet after a difficult period in his life. The pain finally got so bad that it is shooting up his leg and he is having trouble walking so he decided he had to go. The appointment was a little over $180. The nurses didn't know how to use the computer system. They asked him the same questions and what his name was over and over. One of the nurses smelled so badly of body odor that I could smell her as I was following her down the hall. My friend was gagging while she attempted to take his blood pressure. It took several tries. Finally, we got into a room. The doctor (Caroline Feist) came in and asked what the problem was. She seemed skeptical like she did not believe him. I'm sure she sees many people seeking pain meds and is therefore skeptical, but he never asked for pain pills. He described the problem and how it was affecting his job and how it developed. She touched the area of his foot, lightly, with two fingers (no thorough exam) and sent him to get x-rays. Once the x-rays came back, she told him they didn't show anything and that there were many reasons he could be in pain (she didn't say what any of these reasons were). He asked what he should do: sturdy shoes, orthotics, compression, ice? She said to do whatever he would like to do, wrote him a prescription for anti-inflammatories, and said to go see his primary care physician. He can't afford another doctor visit. Now he has lost a day's wages plus $180 for nothing and will not be able to pay his bills. Dr. Feist demonstrated a lack of empathy and professionalism and strong skepticism throughout the visit.

If you are an active duty beneficiary, look elsewhere for your healthcare if possible. The only reason for even 1 star is that I, as a healthy adult, was able to eventually get an appointment simply to get a referral off post and my own provider seemed completely capable of caring for his patients. This comment is not reflective of the actual providers, but the fact that it is impossible to get an appointment (or to cancel one). I have been trying to get an appointment for my children since June (it is now almost November) and the soonest available is December.  I once waited 65 minutes on the appointment line to make an appointment that was later CANCELLED without my knowledge until I called to confirm what appointments we had and to be reminded of them (because they don't automatically send reminders for appointments despite making them months in advance). I have NO confidence that my children would receive medical attention if necessary, and that we would be forced to wait in the ER despite COVID conditions for basic medical care. In addition to the inability to make appointments and receive appointments within an appropriate amount of time, they referred people to off post clinics and pharmacies for the flu shot this year. Most pharmacies do not offer flu shots for children ages 3 and under. Not surprisingly, Fox does not offer flu shots for children 3 and over and \"maybe you can try the health department?\" Why do we even bother having a PCM? God forbid my children need regular medical care. After this interaction, I immediately called Tricare and switched to an off post provider of my own choosing, DESPITE having been told once before I MUST use Fox Clinic. Disgraceful. Of note, this is not our experience with MTFs everywhere. In fact, I have had nothing but excellent experiences with MTFs in the past which is why I was willing to stick it out with Fox.\n\nUpdate: Having filed an ICE complaint and spoken with the appropriate authorities at the clinic, I understand this is not the intent of the OIC and that there are systems in place to handle the influx of patients. However, these systems are clearly breaking down at the appointment line/communication level.

A lady finally answered with \"How can I help you?\" and calmly told her how long I had been waiting when I was second in que. She simply repeated her greeting. No apology, no explanation, nothing. Oddly enough, I changed an appointment which took exactly 4 minutes so I'm wondering why the two callers before me took over an hour to assist. Perhaps the service rep was drinking coffee and socializing while I waited on the line to be served.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626e9c50ac0e3f:0xa77cf650f39e6b6f"}

The only other issue I have is that you cannot fill prescriptions on the weekends. The waiting time can be over-the-top, but I do not mind.
