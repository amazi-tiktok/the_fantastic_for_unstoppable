There was only one person available for customer service, but it looked as though they were preparing for an event, I saw tables outside and the door was open when I arrived.\n\nThere's an array of wines, gourmet food and truffles just to name a few reasons to check this place out. I had my eye on a couple of things so I'll definitely be back when I have time to linger and browse.\n\nI didn't have an opportunity to ask about the wine tastings or the personal consults for gift baskets because of the limited service. It's easy enough to check their website for the classes and there's plenty of time to check back for basket ideas.\n\nIt's a great place to get gifts for family, friends or co-workers.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-5ZFNFaapcS3tx93Ruwhux7aE_N2RXgEjO_qq=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtah4rBijkCp_Kp3rk7tm0VKeGaj1qAJRBdvYV=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP32NkXSmibKvHUPr8KzEDEsNkMe9deczmAydGR=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPa_k7YsM3aJCMZIe4CducOPwxZ0WHSMh22YtZy=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6gHyv2WISwD8cGd_PseUxk-cgcRT4LUKglDiZ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNuXbKDvNmz5w38LaQ-pEEFdeCWrh9Us8TAoY6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvkUGT2Ka65vOyMekjnkgv7ImjIHq9L7oBgGBw=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMetblD9v_JvFIi3ZyMGfW6Zo-V2YhPSPbL1cij=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmoYQjxT4-WaomrWMUblTmd61z4VaVqbRnUxgK=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOav1b93YvXmcQ0Hb-D6er4jmoJKA0aId1GgZPo=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKhnkiZMImx7PcA-RKCCWp_AqdYVvWa8mXlndP=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODZl1hLyM3im5JjbrvTZ4JEGpsqMTWSNmB4Gp-=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb32c0847c87b:0x6354c7ecf71c4ea4"}

In addition to having just about anything you might find yourself needing while out on a stroll around downtown, or serving jury duty, etc., the staff is incredibly friendly and will (in my experience) go out of their way to ensure your good day.\nHowever, you will be paying convenience store prices for most of their selections: a cup of coffee will only leave you a little better off than a visit to Starbucks (without the carefully constructed flavor--ACoE's coffee has been particularly bitter in my experience, even with sugar and cream), and the food can get a little pricey as well. Packaged foods, on the other hand, seem to be a bit cheaper than, say, the store inside the courthouse but it's not really enough to keep me from driving the little extra distance to the Publix at Twickenham Square.\nThe cozy atmosphere and neat meeting space upstairs, though, may be enough to counter-balance the slightly higher prices and not-so-awesome coffee--and a warm Spring day sat outside with a cold cup of iced tea and a fresh-made sandwich can't quite be beat.\nSo all-in-all, if you don't mind spending a bit more and not getting Starbucks-quality coffee, you will get a cozy, unique atmosphere great for a refreshing time on your own or with friends.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b56a1fd3df7:0xd805f6cc220b76af"}

DONT GO TO ABC OR ABC SPIRITS or whatever that place is called - thats on 231. I mean its good but so far NO liquor store has compared to this one. Just come here. TRUST. ME.\n\nFull Review:\nI just went here for the first time today. As in just left. I loved this place SO SO SO MUCH. I was telling myself I must do a review as soon as I get home. What this place has to offer is so much! I just bought soju from there! And it was not terribly price. The only place I could find it was at a Korean restaurant (that was called Kalim Garden. And I would buy unopened bottles from them. I also got 2 different bottles of sake. Which I couldn't be more happy about! There is White Claw here. They still have it in stock despite the fact that there is currently a shortage. The guy inside (I didn't get his name was so friendly. This is also a place you can get CBD & vape products. I actually bought a pack of prerolles hempettes. It looked like they have 4 brands to choose from. I have tried a lot of the hempette brands and listen to me!! - just buy the red pack. Stunna Bubba Kush. I have tried the other ones pure hemp is pretty good but there are a lot stems in it even tho they claim theres not, wild hemp brand is just...really tame. Flavor is worst than the \"Pure Hemp\" brand. So that's usually just what ive been forced to get around here. HOWEVER I am currently smoking one of these Stunnas. The flavor - very good. Would rate 4/5 bc its good but it is def no premium ish. Stem wise give a 3/5 I'm hearing tons of little pops.... But nothing like the Pure Hemp brand. Price I give 5/5 stars. This one was $13.99 I think. The other brands I have mentioned were $9.99. Which is typical but very decently priced compared to other hemp shops ive been to. So just pay the extra $4 for the red one if you are interested.\n\nAlso as for how the store looks and atmosphere wise - AMAZING. hate that google is a 5 star system bcuz that for sure is a 10 star - no 11 stars for the atmosphere of the place. Employee also seems to be very knowledgeable although I didnt have to ask many questions bc I knew what I was going for and know my alcohol. But they had things in there I have never tried before. So that excited me a lot.\n\nI will be putting the TLDR at the top of my review as well in case no one reads this novella of a review. \ud83d\ude02 but if you need to go to a liquor store. DONT GO TO ABC OR ABC SPIRITS or whatever that place is called - thats on 231. I mean its good but so far NO liquor store has compared to this one. Just come here. TRUST.

As I approach the counter she proceeds to say \"I'm not coming home to another drunken fight about the dogs, plus you look intoxicated I'm not going to sell to you.\" I stand there for a second speechless because she is the one always drunk coming down to my house talking mess about nothing. I say to her really? Then I ask her for a number where I can reach someone in management. You can Google it I don't know it, is her response. I look on their Facebook page and see that a few other people have had to deal with the same thing. I thought a business' main goal was to make money.... apparently if she doesn't like you she will try to embarrass you and use the line I have the right to refuse service to anyone in the state.
