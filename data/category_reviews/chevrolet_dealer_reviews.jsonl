I brought the car back in on Monday the 4th and told them the service engine light came on and something under the car was rattling. I was told by the owners son that he didnt know anything about standard shift cars and they would not be responsible for anything wrong with it. Almost 3 weeks later the car starts running hot. When my husband got to me to check it out he opened up the radiator to find that it is full of J.B block seal he runs over 80 gallons of water through the radiator trying to clean it out to no avail. We replaced the thermostat that was so coroded with block seal it was rusted up. I called and left a message with Pierce auto sales telling them that the car was running hot and because someone was trying to cover up a cracked block or blown head gasket and there was so much block seal in the radiator and engine that I didn't know if the car was going to make it home and that I really needed someone to call me back because I had no way to get it home. I never recieved a call back.It cost me $60 to rent a car dolly to drag it home. Now the car came with an outside warranty but because \"whoever\" filled the motor up with block seal to hide a major problem until they could find an idiot \"me\" to take the car off of there hands the warranty will not cover the car. So now I have a blown up car sitting in my yard that I drove less then a month and repo men knocking on my door because they want there car back and still after all this time I have yet to recieve a call from anyone at Pierce Auto Sales.  I recieved more help and sympathy from the repo man in 10 minutes then I have from Pierce in 2 months. I paid $1500 down for a car that didn't even last until the first payment was due. I dont bash people or businesses but i have tried every other way to get them to talk to me. I just want my money back so I can get a car that runs and won't leave me on the side of the road less then a month after purchase.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a56497104639d:0x842e60c3c94517bb"}

I went back and what should have been a calm discussion about getting the right battery turned into a very heated exchange when the dealer began to call my mother rude and claiming the battery was fine.\n\nThe battery ( the 12 V startup one) is a specialty type of battery for a hybrid that only the dealer provides and costs about 500$:\n\nWe ended up getting a check from them to get the battery from the dealer (they wouldn\u2019t pay the install price, just the wholesale). The thing is, is that this review would have been 5 stars if they had just been polite and understating when we came to them about the problem.

Great, genuine people here. Drove an hour and a half to the location, test drove the 2014 Nissan and took it to get checked out at a near by garage. It checked out- As any used car it had minor things that needed to be addressed but that's to be expected with any used car. I don't expect a brand new car, besides a mechanic shop HAS to give you a long list otherwise they feel like they have not done their job correctly.

Paid it in cash and made it through the paperwork hassle free in less than 15 minutes. On the way out I ran into  the owner who  explained to me the way that they conducted their business. They seemed to do well and sold many cars at that location. He was a very down to earth person. The reason for my detailed explanation is to make it clear to anyone that looks at online reviews to take them for a grain of salt. Mid-conversation with the owner I watched a man come into this dealership and demand new brakes and tires on a vehicle he bought a few weeks back apparently, and otherwise threatened to leave a bad review!! People like that get on my last nerve. These folks are selling good quality cars for a fraction of the price. If someone wants a brand new car they need to help themselves to a brand new car store. We don't see shops like this anymore, everything is being bought out and turned into a franchise sore where you would pay at a lot more for the exact same car. We need to value these people.

{"user_id": "105902349707911834158", "name": "Mirandal Kendricks", "time": 1555629020785, "rating": 1.0, "text": "While I don't usually leave reviews for places I visit, I was strongly compelled to inform the people of Alabama about my visit and the \"OWNER\" of this establishment. If I could leave 0 stars, I would.\n\nMy mother purchased a car a few weeks ago and today she decided to go on her lunch break and get her tag. Information that should've been provided during her purchase at the dealership was requested from the clerk at the tag/title office. She placed a call and got the owner on the phone and he was attemping to assist her. While he was able to eventually get her the information she needed the process of how she had to get the information from the owner was where she had an issue. She stated that there was a language barrier which she didn't personally mind BUT as she was on her lunch break and had limited time to talk she requested to speak with someone with better English that could accomodate her and articulate the information she needed in a timely manner. The owner became rude with her during her phonecall even prompting the clerk at the window to comment on his rudeness.\n\nI later accompanied her to his dealership as she needed to make a payment on her vehicle as well. Once arriving conveniently the owner was sitting on the front \"porch\" of the lot. When she expressed to him her issue with the process that it took to get information from him earlier and why she requested to speak with someone with better English he became rude with her again, and constantly interrupted her.  I happened to accompany her on this visit and made a comment about his direct rudeness. I guess he didn't take our visit too well because we'd interrupted his flirting with his employee but he then proceeded to invite the both of us into his office and present to us a dusty old box containing his many \"degrees\" which from what I saw were merely laminated certificates as if that gave him the right to conduct business and talk to us the way he did. I made the comment that both myself and my mother carried actual degrees from accredited universities, she even having her Masters which at the end of the day should not matter. Him having the title of \"OWNER\" and his many \"degrees\" should never give him the right to believe that he should be able to be rude to customers or anyone else for that matter. It takes way more than walking around and merely calling yourself a business owner. Its a matter of action as well. As an owner you should be able to take criticism and responsibility for your actions. A simple apology would've been good enough but my mother didn't even get that. I myself began to get upset because of the way he chose to speak to my mother. I simply could not allow it. I began to explain her position yet he attempted ot interrupt me like he did her. I wasn't allowing that either. Our conversation ended up being a mix of words in which he eventually summoned one of his employees into the room for reasons I still don't know. She attempted to explain that the owner was alone by himself at 8 AM until she was able to get into the office and the fact that she hadn't been able to hang up her purse because he asked her to take the phone. This made no difference to me or my mother because 1. She called around 1 PM not 8 AM & 2. As a business \"OWNER\" he should've done a better job with tailoring his business to order to fit the needs of customers. If you had staffing issues then as an \"OWNER\" it was on him to take on that matter himself. Either way it should not fall on the shoulders of the customer to deal with your rudeness and lack of customer service. My mother always raised me to be honest and to speak my mind so here I am speaking my mind and saying that the \"OWNER\" of this establishment is trash and should better spend his days gaining proper accreditation on what it means to be a good business owner and how to deliver good customer service as well taking some time to fix up his dealership because all it takes is for the wrong person to have an accident on that janky \"staircase\" on his lot and his entire business under fire due to lawsuit.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923b189b005c9:0x6db750ee718606e9"}

I bought a truck from them at an outrageous price (had no options at the time and needed a truck A.S.A.P. for business) and I have spent over $5,000 fixing it in the 6 months I've owned it. I was told by Lee and the \"salesman\" that the truck was $11,000, only to charge me $13,000. Of course once I realized what they did and contacted them they play dumb and it is too late. I know if I should have taken more time to review and ask questions but it was the end of the day, past business hours already and I needed to leave with the truck that day. Regardless you should never practice those business ethics in any industry. I have had to change the rotors, brakes, brake drums, brake cylinder, master cylinder, calipers and brackets, hub assembly, CV axles, steering arm, I am in the process of changing the transfer case (over $2,000 on it's own) and it still needs a steering column, gear box, front differential, driveshaft and possibly the rear differential. When it's all said and done I will have put at least 5 times the value of this truck into making it run right and paying it off. I am a self employed remodeler and I have missed countless days of work, lost countless jobs and it's gotten to the point that I am having trouble paying for my daughters daycare and buying her essentials.

I stopped in fort Payne al and had tire balanced and it helped some but to the point before I get to Pennsylvania the backs of both front seats had fell off and a week later tha Ac quits and low and behold today April 22 I had a buddy follow me to my house and when we pull up he asks do you know your truck runs down the road sideways and I was like no. I then followed him down the road to look and sure enough it\u2019s running sideways so I\u2019m sure you can imagine what my view on Cooper Chevrolet is. UPDATE I talked to scott at cooper Chevrolet today April 22 and he said they done an alignment on it before i bought it  and I told him I was going to have it checked out and if the frame was bent they would be hearing from me are a lawyer and he hung up on me. So scott I hope you read this because if the frame is bent it was like that when I bought it from you and if it is I\u2019m gonna have a 4x8 sign made stating how you screw me and all the problems I have with my truck and it will be parked as close to the Cooper Chevrolet dealership as I can possibly get it for everyone to see.

I call Daniel again at 12pm Tuesday and he said that they looked at it off and a couple times but they really haven't looked at it thoroughly and that it would be later that day. I called around 3pm and he said that he would let me know something before they left that day. No call. I call again on Wednesday @at 12 pm and I'm left on hold for a few minutes and the secretary comes back to take a message. He supposedly was  busy with another customer. I don't get a call. Again, I call back around 430pm and he tells me that the mechanic had to hold my battery cable to start the vehicle. And it would be $650  to change my battery cables. SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS!!  I show up Thursday morning to pick my vehicle up and it won't start. Mind you, I started the vehicle everyday for two weeks since having the initial problem. Daniel laughs in my face  when I expressed that to him. After I left I tighten the battery cable(30 second process)and the truck starts just fine.

Two days later the check engine light came on , still thinking that it was the sensors, I over look at the magnitude of the situation. Exactly 4 weeks after having the car, it started smoking so I had to get it towed to Mini Cooper. Mini informed me that I have an oil leak, my turbo went out, and other things.

When we arrived, the vehicle we came to see was parked in the front and ready for us to look over and test drive. Michael answered all of our questions and was very helpful. When it was time to complete our sale, Grant already had all of our paperwork done ahead of time, it took about 30 minutesto sign a few things  then walk out the door with our new vehicle.\n\nWe had been looking for a month for a replacement vehicle for me after mine was totaled. I spoke with numerous dealerships within a 150 mike radius of Nashville. There were several times that we drove over an hour out of our way to see one, only to arrive to find the vehicle was NOT at all as described, it was beyond infuriating. Premier Chevrolet was 100% up front and honest from the first phone call. We will absolutely do business with them again, and also recommend them to our friends and family should they be looking for a vehicle.\n\nThank you so very much to Grant and Michael for going above and beyond what I even expected from a car dealership.
