Of course there has always been a nice wait time but we decided to continue going there despite waiting a while to be seen. But this last time really made us change our mind. We have 3 children to receive updates on as they are being seen. As I sit down near my youngest daughter, and reach for my phone her hygienist tells me I have to leave because I have my phone out. I'm shocked, because I had just taken my phone out to return a text from my husband  as he wanted to know how the appointments were going. She would not continue my daughter's appointment until she escorted me out of the area. Now I completely understand businesses asking for cell phones to be turned on silent but to tell me that I cannot use my phone AT ALL is completely absurd! I have taken time from my off day to come to this business to bring my children and you're telling me I have to go to a consultation room just to use my phone.  I have already driven 30 minutes to come from my side of town, I  could have easily changed them to a Dr less than 5 minutes from home and had little to no wait time. In addition to all this, I'm trying to get information on my best friend who is in the ICU and no one knows what's going on because I can't use my phone to get the messages. Someone must have notified the manager because she came to talk, but she wanted to do it around my children and that was not going to happen. She should have asked to step away and then we could have talked.......... In other news, we won't be going  back.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888e1dc936fa5b5:0x92ccf0ccb518dc57"}
