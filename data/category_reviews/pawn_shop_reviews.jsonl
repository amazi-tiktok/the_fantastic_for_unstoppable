I took it back up here and they said they would attempt to get someone to repair it. A few weeks later they said they tried multiple places, each one could not repair the Xbox One. They apparently could not get a video out signal, despite me telling them to wait 20-30 minutes for the included error code. I could reproduce this issue every time. I got a $100 refund and got to keep the Xbox One. That is very generous of them, and I thank them for that. However, I was given a power supply with no screws, it was held together with tape, and it seems like it's missing components, as seen by the empty pin header in the photo. I was going to attempt repair myself, but I no longer have a working power supply, as when I did when I dropped it off to be fixed. This may be the fault of whoever they took it to in order to get it repaired, but everything should have been independently tested after each repair attempt IMO. I just bought a new One S bundle after two failed Ones, this one being the second.\n\nEdit: After a trip back up here, they replaced the power supply, no questions asked.

I took it back up here and they said they would attempt to get someone to repair it. A few weeks later they said they tried multiple places, each one could not repair the Xbox One. They apparently could not get a video out signal, despite me telling them to wait 20-30 minutes for the included error code. I could reproduce this issue every time. I got a $100 refund and got to keep the Xbox One. That is very generous of them, and I thank them for that. However, I was given a power supply with no screws, it was held together with tape, and it seems like it's missing components, as seen by the empty pin header in the photo. I was going to attempt repair myself, but I no longer have a working power supply, as when I did when I dropped it off to be fixed. This may be the fault of whoever they took it to in order to get it repaired, but everything should have been independently tested after each repair attempt IMO. I just bought a new One S bundle after two failed Ones, this one being the second.\n\nEdit: After a trip back up here, they replaced the power supply, no questions asked. They might make mistakes, sometimes no fault of their own, but they do try to make it right. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nThe PS3 I bought for $75 is thankfully another story.

I arrived at the pawn shop at 5:30pm, and they close at 6pm. I sat in the parking lot for a minute to finish up the phone call that I was on, before I was rudely interrupted by the owner beating on my passenger said window. I rolled down the window, and he said \u201cWhatever business you have to do here needs to be taken care of now because my wife has a hair appointment.\u201d And I responded with \u201cIt\u2019s 5:30. I thought you closed at 6\u201d. And he responded with \u201cYou must not have heard me, but my wife has a hair appointment, and we have to go.\u201d I almost left at that moment due to the absurdity and in professionalism in the conversation that I had just had with this man, but I wouldn\u2019t make it to another pawn shop before closing. I bit my tongue and took my guitar and laptop inside. He immediately looked at the laptop and guitar and said \u201cI have no interest in these.\u201d I pointed to the wall of guitars that was behind him, and he finally said \u201cfine. I\u2019ll do $75 for both, but I can\u2019t do more.\u201d He literally had the audacity to offer me $75 for $1950 worth of product. His excuse was that guitars have terrible resale value, which is 100% false. I used to work at a pawnshop, and we ALWAYS took in guitars because the depreciation in price is very minimal. We even took in laptops at 60% of what used ones were selling for on eBay. But no, he offered me $75 for both, and then reminded me that his wife had a hair appointment, and that I had to make up my mind. There was no mind to be made up, because that was a completely ridiculous offer! He followed me to the front door upon my exit to lock it behind me...at 5:40pm. 20 minutes before they were due to close. Any grown adult should know not to make appointments that interfere with their work schedule, but his ignorance on products brought in further validates his ignorance in general. I went to A-Z Pawn the next day and received a loan of $450 for both items, because that\u2019s all I needed. Do NOT go to this pawnshop. Not even as a last resort. They\u2019re unprofessional, they\u2019re rude, they offer TERRIBLE prices for EVERYTHING, and instead of looking up information about products brought in, he will either low-ball you because he doesn\u2019t know their worth, or he just won\u2019t accept it at all.

The gentleman waiting on me was very nice and answered questions as much as he could as he pulled the cameras out for me to see. Then his supervisor came over and made him put all the cameras back. She told him that I could not look at them. I told her that the one I was looking at in particular was available brand new with accessories for about $75 more than they were charging, with a bundle of accessories included , and I was not able to make a decent decision without seeing their selection. She came back and said the camera bundle was available at Walmart for $500 but I have been researching this for several months and I know it's available on Amazon for about 350.

I explained we weren\u2019t that he was only asking for clarification. Instead of stopping or apologizing she kept on becoming even more forceful. I asked her to please be more pleasant when she expressed herself. At this the young gentleman waiting on us went off and said they were married and tore up everything.

You cannot be upset with how long a transaction is taking (part of which is out of our control) while simultaneously complaining about our efforts to train new people. Lastly, are you aware that nearly all gun stores have security cameras? Is that still an infringement on your rights? We also have a copy of your ID when buying a gun. Taking a picture of our customers (not just gun customers) for our internal system has been our policy for years with no complaints.

I said it was wrong, but they wouldn't fix it. I called U-Haul and was told they would call Depot to straighten it out, but he still overcharged me and was rude about it. I told him I'd told the woman I didn't want the insurance, but he refused to take it off and said it was between me and U-Haul, after the U-Haul rep already confirmed to me that I was being overcharged. Then he acted like he was doing me a favor by taking one day's rental off because I was a little late bringing it back today. I said that was because I was on the phone with U-Haul disputing the charge, but he still acted like he was being nice. Not nice at all. I don't appreciate being conned and then treated rudely.

I understand that's how they make their money, however, we shouldn't have had to pay the full price of the fee when it had only been two weeks since we pawned it and two weeks until the maturity date.

They notify the FBI of a firearm purchase, whether exempt due to Alabama Concealed Pistol Permit, or not. You buy, they call the FBI. No friend of privacy, and all it would take would be a call to the sheriff office to confirm Permit not revoked for some crime.\n\nI bought two firearms prior to getting permit, took week long delays, commented non-stop how i needed to get a permit to stop the delays and invasion of privacy over a simple purchase and they never said a thing.\n\nGot the permit, had an ordered pistol sent to them, and when i drove to town to pick up the gun, they told me they were running the check anyhow, and always did. This is not posted anywhere in store as i write this. They did this KNOWING i would take a delay and another 1.5hr round trip that meant nothing to them, and never said a word before as for, \"yer permit's no good, here, pal.\"\n\nAnd really folk, are you going to trust ANYone who voluntarily reports you to the FBI regarding a purchase, when not forced to by law, but on their own, when they know you have the check already done for the permit, and do not care if it means you might have to come back up to a week later from however how far? Is this our brave new world? It reminds me more of neighborhood informants in Russia in 1950.....some progress....and we are all so much safer now, right?\n\nYes, they are allowed to do this.

Once everything was said and done, I shook Jacob's hand and asked \"How can I ever repay you?\" He said \"Your thanks is payment enough\", and then he went and started our baby a college savings fund and deposited $6,000 into it.\" We never actually pawned anything with him, but he will forever be our favorite Pawnbroker up at Pocket Pawn.

I visited this store in search of an item that someone had 'borrowed' and then pawned. They worked to make things right because they have no desire to have stolen goods in their store.\nFunny. Have you read their signs? \"Too hot to keep changing this sign. Come inside for good deals!\" \"We buy used DVDs. Except for Batman III. It was awful.\" \"How bow dah?\" \"For the last time--NO. You cannot pawn your kids!\"\nRespectful. They have a beautiful parking spot designated for combat-injured veterans. Gulp. Many folks SAY they support veterans. This certainly shows that.\nFriendly.

I've never used that aspect of their business, but going over some of the negative reviews that are posted on here, it makes you wonder if people don't understand the concept behind a pawn shop. It's like they expect to go in there to pawn something and get what they paid for it or either what they think it's worth. Then, if they happen to not come back and pick it up, and happen to see it for sale in the store they're upset because of the sale price that's put on it. The pawn shop is in the business of making money. And I've always thought that that's how you make money is to buy low and sell higher. But hey, what do I know?

A couple of months back I bought a 9mm Taurus hand pistol we did all the proper paperwork and I was approved. In may I got in a bind and went to redstone pawn as I have in the past and got a loan on my gun. When I came back to pick it up  wes made me take another background check and said that I was delayed and to come back in a cpl of days. First off I should have not had to go threw that process again the gun was already mine and I have a receipt of proof of ownership, I was just paying back my loan and picking up my property. When he contacted me back a couple of days later he didn't call he texted me and said i was denied and kept my gun that I have receipt of ownership for nor did he give the full value of the gun he gave me the loan money back mind you I have an expired gun permit. This was a scam to cheat a customer out of money and his property and i want stand for it, I'll be taken more legal action against this business and show them that you can't treat people like this. I was a good customer to them and they handled me very rough and not fair at all, businesses like this get over because as consumers we dont know the law in Alabama you only have to a permit to carry a firearm not to own one. They violated my second amendment right also no way I failed a background check I work for DHR and I passed the first one I took for the gun nothing has changed so why did I fail this time.

I have never in my life had someone treat me the way this employee did. If I knew her name I would absolutely call her out. This was at the Trussville location and there were only two employees that I saw. But it was the woman that happen to be available when I came into the store. She was a straight up ass hole. Rolling her eyes when I asked a question as if it was the dumbest thing she had ever heard.  Or as if I was waisting her time. As I told her what I needed to pawn her attitude towards me was hateful from the start the least she could do is be polite and say that they were not interested in what I was trying to pawn at the time. Instead she said she would maybe give me a dollar for it. As she laughed under her breath. That behavior was so uncalled for. And then when I pointed out something on the clearance table that was still marked 60 dollars she stomped her foot and in a aggrevated tone said ok fine let me see it. Now I understand what she was telling me. And I understand why that product that was similar to mine was on the clearance table because it wasn't  selling well. But none the less it was still worth more than a dollar. But she apparently thought I could not comprehend that because of  her childish body gesture's. What she would not take the time to hear was that I had no intention of letting my item be sold in the store. I just needed to pawn it for a little while because life is not easy sometimes but thanks for making my day a little brighter. I wasn't looking for sympathy when I went in, but is it to much to ask for you to just be polite to someone you don't know.   Finally I said to the woman, \" you know what, I haven't done anything to you to deserve such a attitude. I will never be back to this store again.\" And then she had the audacity to reply with, \" good deal you have a great day!\" GOOD DEAL!!!! Are you kidding me. If you hate your job that much then go do something else instead of being a jerk to your customers I really don't think the owner would appreciate that at all. I know if I had worked hard enough to open three different location and had all that going the last thing I would want is people walking through my doors to be treated that way. But I didn't act a fool because I have more class than that I just kept walking and took my business to another pawn shop who did let me pawn my item and gave me way more than a dollar for it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890c6f9f2ccc9d:0x4a0af5af35d1fd24"}

Also I'm not sure if they still do a lot of pawning or buying jewelry and guns but used to be if u need a little extra money for the month you could pawn your items and get them back for low cost. Just ask they are very friendly to everyone so be sure and check em out if you are near it I'm pretty sure you'll find something to buy or something you like \ud83d\udc4d  GREAT PRICES!!!!

There were guns of all kinds and other hunting equipment, tools, musical instruments, high-end sunglasses, games, sports equipment, rods and reels, portable air conditioners, TVs and other electronics - you name it - and LOTS of top quality jewelry.

Man was I surprised - I not only got a confirmation of the details of the ring were 100% correct - I was told that the ring was worth 5 times what I paid for it......I couldn't have been happier.\n\nTo know that I got a great deal on a great piece of jewelry alone would bring me back to this store.
