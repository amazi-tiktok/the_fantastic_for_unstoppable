In attempt to getting my girlfriend some Halloween themed flowers, Amy's Florist dropped the ball. I placed an order for one item and 5 minutes later they called and said they did not have the item or vase in stock YET I was still charged. After emailing and calling back, I was fully refunded. I decided to try my luck again and place another order but for a different item. Same thing, received a call saying it was not in stock. The people calling me were horribly unhelpful and rude and made it seem like I was to blame. Why have something on your website if it not in stock? I also find it suspicious Amy's Florist and Pat's Florist have the same exact webpage layouts besides color scheme.

Yes you placed an order off our website that stated NO substitutions.  The closer it has gotten to Halloween we have sold out of most the containers. We would have been glad to do a similar arrangement for you but you said no substitutions. Also you did email us and I got back with you as soon as I seen the email, unfortunately I don't check my emails frequently.  The staff called and left you a message regarding the order, and soon as they spoke with you a refund was issued.  As for the two websites bringing the same...YES they are because a floral company designed them for us.  Nothing suspicious at all about that.  Again, I am very sorry we wasn't able to help you.

You mention you spent $95 on the arrangement but that's not what the sender gave us to work with. Also, out of the total, we had to take out for the 2 balloons and delivery charge that was associated with the order.  Yes, you could have got more flowers from Publix, but I don't sell Publix quality flowers. I only carry the freshest and finest.
