We cannot clean rugs with pet urine in the home as you do not want your hardwood floors to get wet.  In our facility the rugs go through many steps to be cleaned properly (dusting machine, submersion bath, centrifuge, hung in drying room and then any fringe is repaired).

It smells and looks great and Steve worked very hard to clean thoroughly and comply with requests.  He was also fair about giving me the best price he could.  A couple of things I would say could be improved - Steve was not provided anything by Chem-Dry to put under my heavy sofas to protect the legs since those could not be moved out of the room.  In the past, the company we used had some plastic squares.  Steve used plastic grocery bags from Target that I provided him and one faded the red onto the carpet but it is in an obscure place that is not noticeable.  Also it would seem ideal to have 2 people working the job vs. one because of better control of the long hoses, etc. which dripped some moisture and dirt from someone else's house onto my hardwood foyer.  Not preferred but not a big deal either.  Also, I signed the paperwork at the end without reading the words written, just the price.\nLater, my husband read it and asked me why the work was not guaranteed against the stains coming back, etc.  I plan to call and ask them about that.  Hopefully the stains won't come back so a moot point.\nI would recommend just the basic cleaning plus any pet stain treatment for rooms that might have pet soiling.  The basic formula is supposedly with baking soda and that is truly all natural.  There were options to buy two add-ons in the cleaning formula - an anti-microbial spray and a scotch-guard product.  I opted out on these 2 and don't think there were beneficial.  In fact have read that scotch-guard can be harmful to health.\nAlso, if you are expecting this service to have very little moisture after cleaning, not really so.  Even un-pet-treated rooms needed overnight to completely dry to move furniture back and my cleaning started at 11:00 am ish.\nHave a great day!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1553714008857, "text": "Susan, Thank you for your comments & for choosing Huntsville Chem-Dry to serve you.  We always strive for 5-star reviews but we welcome the opportunity to learn & improve from other reviews.  Your input is very valuable.  I want a take a minute or two to clarify a few things.\nIt is standard that we provide plastic tabs for furniture legs so I am embarrassed to hear that we did not have them on the van that day.  Plastic bags are not acceptable & I apologize for the inconvenience.\nWe run one man crews on the van to help keep the cleaning costs lower for our customers.\nOur paperwork & signature is an agreement confirming our price before the work begins & our agreement that we will do everything we can to remove stains but we cannot guarantee complete stain removal.\nWe do have 3 packages to choose from, our Basic Cleaning, our Stain Fighter Package & our Healthy Home Package.  Our Chem-Dry proprietary cleaning solution is called The Natural.  It is not like baking soda but it is a Green-Certified cleaning agent.  It is a wonderful product that does not leave a dirt attracting residue and has amazing cleaning abilities while still being safe to drink (tastes awful though)!  Our Stain Fighter package consists of co-applying the stain protectant (another Green-Certified product called PowerGuard) with the cleaning.  Scotchguard is a brand of protectant that is toxic but we pride ourselves on using safe products for the home.  Re-applying stain protectant is very important to extend the look of your carpets.  The original protectant wears off over time with vacuuming and normal activities.  You mentioned that yours is fairly new so it's always good to re-apply once a year on average, this will make cleaning up spills or muddy paws so easy on you in between professional cleanings.  Most companies spray some kind of protectant on the carpet after cleaning which creates a crusty top layer.  Our co-application of the protectant allows us to protect the entire carpet fiber, not just the top.  Our Healthy Home package is the combination of the cleaning, the protectant and an Ant-Microbial pre-spray which removes bacteria in the carpet (especially if there are pets).\nResults can vary with drying times in carpet depending on how dirty it is and what kind of carpet it is.  2-3 hours is average but we run our cleaning machine until the carpet is clean without soaking the carpet pad & we use a powerful extraction method for the best possible results.\nAgain, thank you Susan for your recommendations & please let me know if I can help in any way.\n\nTara Outson\nOwner, Huntsville Chem-Dry"}, "gmap_id": "0x88623e0338d7b62b:0x9436b519d7638670"}

It smells and looks great and Steve worked very hard to clean thoroughly and comply with requests.  He was also fair about giving me the best price he could.  A couple of things I would say could be improved - Steve was not provided anything by Chem-Dry to put under my heavy sofas to protect the legs since those could not be moved out of the room.  In the past, the company we used had some plastic squares.  Steve used plastic grocery bags from Target that I provided him and one faded the red onto the carpet but it is in an obscure place that is not noticeable.  Also it would seem ideal to have 2 people working the job vs. one because of better control of the long hoses, etc. which dripped some moisture and dirt from someone else's house onto my hardwood foyer.  Not preferred but not a big deal either.  Also, I signed the paperwork at the end without reading the words written, just the price.\nLater, my husband read it and asked me why the work was not guaranteed against the stains coming back, etc.  I plan to call and ask them about that.  Hopefully the stains won't come back so a moot point.\nI would recommend just the basic cleaning plus any pet stain treatment for rooms that might have pet soiling.  The basic formula is supposedly with baking soda and that is truly all natural.  There were options to buy two add-ons in the cleaning formula - an anti-microbial spray and a scotch-guard product.  I opted out on these 2 and don't think there were beneficial.  In fact have read that scotch-guard can be harmful to health.\nAlso, if you are expecting this service to have very little moisture after cleaning, not really so.  Even un-pet-treated rooms needed overnight to completely dry to move furniture back and my cleaning started at 11:00 am ish.\nHave a great day!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1553714008857, "text": "Susan, Thank you for your comments & for choosing Huntsville Chem-Dry to serve you.  We always strive for 5-star reviews but we welcome the opportunity to learn & improve from other reviews.  Your input is very valuable.  I want a take a minute or two to clarify a few things.\nIt is standard that we provide plastic tabs for furniture legs so I am embarrassed to hear that we did not have them on the van that day.  Plastic bags are not acceptable & I apologize for the inconvenience.\nWe run one man crews on the van to help keep the cleaning costs lower for our customers.\nOur paperwork & signature is an agreement confirming our price before the work begins & our agreement that we will do everything we can to remove stains but we cannot guarantee complete stain removal.\nWe do have 3 packages to choose from, our Basic Cleaning, our Stain Fighter Package & our Healthy Home Package.  Our Chem-Dry proprietary cleaning solution is called The Natural.  It is not like baking soda but it is a Green-Certified cleaning agent.  It is a wonderful product that does not leave a dirt attracting residue and has amazing cleaning abilities while still being safe to drink (tastes awful though)!  Our Stain Fighter package consists of co-applying the stain protectant (another Green-Certified product called PowerGuard) with the cleaning.  Scotchguard is a brand of protectant that is toxic but we pride ourselves on using safe products for the home.  Re-applying stain protectant is very important to extend the look of your carpets.  The original protectant wears off over time with vacuuming and normal activities.  You mentioned that yours is fairly new so it's always good to re-apply once a year on average, this will make cleaning up spills or muddy paws so easy on you in between professional cleanings.  Most companies spray some kind of protectant on the carpet after cleaning which creates a crusty top layer.  Our co-application of the protectant allows us to protect the entire carpet fiber, not just the top.  Our Healthy Home package is the combination of the cleaning, the protectant and an Ant-Microbial pre-spray which removes bacteria in the carpet (especially if there are pets).\nResults can vary with drying times in carpet depending on how dirty it is and what kind of carpet it is.  2-3 hours is average but we run our cleaning machine until the carpet is clean without soaking the carpet pad & we use a powerful extraction method for the best possible results.\nAgain, thank you Susan for your recommendations & please let me know if I can help in any way.\n\nTara Outson\nOwner, Huntsville Chem-Dry"}, "gmap_id": "0x88623e0338d7b62b:0x9436b519d7638670"}

I'm not quite sure what went wrong, but the owner, who answered the phone, was brusque and acted as if I was wasting her time... although I spent less than 3 minutes talking to her and only inquired about 2 things. I have a medical condition that makes it hard to speak quickly or process the speech of others, maybe that's where we got off on the wrong foot. Anyway, I tried to ask about the price for one room and a couple of other spots throughout the house. I was confused when she told me the price would be $135, as the website says a living room is $55. I asked her about it, and she told me the minimum is $135. That would have been fine (even though other companies I've called either do not have a minimum or have a smaller minimum), but the attitude behind the comment was if she was talking to a clueless employee rather than a potential customer. Wouldn't you get more customers if you spoke pleasantly and said something like, \"I'm sorry about that. Although we'd like to serve as many clients as possible, because of our high quality service, our overhead to come out for less than the price of 3 rooms wouldn't allow us to stay open for business.\" rather than \"No. There's a $135 minimum.\" in a rather snotty and abrupt tone? Because I had wondered why they weren't listed with the BBB, I asked if they were considering registering with them. I actually wasn't planning on asking about that, but I needed a minute to think after the first part of the conversation went so poorly. Things only got worse. In the same 'you're an idiot, leave me alone' tone, she said \"All that means is that you paid them a yearly fee.\" So after this friendly and pleasant interaction, I told her thank you anyway and hung up. I'd work on my customer interactions if I were this business owner. Who knows, maybe she was having an off-morning, or maybe my voice reminded her of someone she didn't like.

It is now Jul 2021 so now I am posting here:  I really did not want to leave this review as I really liked the technician that worked at my house as a person.  And I am not requesting that anything be done to make things right.  I am good at this point.  The job that was done on the tile floors was good (with one exception noted later).  What makes me unhappy is when I have to do work to clean up after a job is done.  I was a bit bothered right away when I noticed that the technician was leaving boot prints everywhere he walked on my hardwood floors on his way to the tile floors he was cleaning.  I didn't say anything as he was just starting, and I thought maybe it would be taken care of.  He worked hard and did a good job on the tile floors (with the one exception I will note later).  Once he was finished and was removing the corrugated water line and the machines, rancid smelling water was spilled in some areas on my hardwood floors.  Also, while pulling the corrugated water line out of the house, he pulled it around the corners of a room scuffing the baseboards.  I had to put my foot between the baseboard and the line so it would stop hitting the baseboard.  This prevented it from doing any noticeable damage.  He did bring in a wet mop and attempted to clean the hardwood area but did nothing more than smear the rancid smelling water around which dried leaving a VERY noticeable film on the floor.  I had to clean a fairly large area of the hardwood floor twice to remove the dried, rancid water and most of the smell.  As noted above (the one exception) I also mopped the tile floors he cleaned with vinegar and water as some of the quarter round in the tile floor area had filth on it and I figured some of that floor probably had some of the same rancid water on it.  The rancid water smell stayed in the house for more than a day.  The second cleaning of the hardwood floors and time got rid of the rest of it.   My bet is that the machines and/or the water line contained the rancid water from other jobs.  I really hate leaving comments like this, but it is probably important that the company be made aware of these type of issues for training purposes.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626c9eeb4ff555:0x1c3ae99102e6b228"}

And you bring up a great point about our pricing compared to traditional carpet cleaners. It is true that we are not the least expensive carpet cleaner in Huntsville, but our patented cleaning technology does provide a better long term value. The difference is our certified zero residue cleaning process. We will explain: with traditional carpet cleaners, soaps and detergents are combined with hot water extraction to clean and sanitize carpets. And although this is a tried and true process, it has a big problem; it's impossible to get all the soap and detergent out of the carpet. And this soapy residue (which can feel a little crunchy under your feet after drying) ends up acting like a dirt magnet which results in spots and traffic lanes reappearing. But with the Zerorez patented process, we do not use soaps and detergents to clean and sanitize carpets but instead a revolutionary, and completely non-toxic, solution called Empowered Water. This process results in a zero residue cleaning, and without residue, carpets stay cleaner, longer. Additionally, they feel softer than you can imagine. Thank you again for your business and fantastic review! We look forward to seeing you again."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626c9eeb4ff555:0x1c3ae99102e6b228"}

Paid for tile cleaning and grout sealing. Crew had to come out 3 times in one day to attempt to fix and finish. First, they forgot to seal the shower that we paid $90 for them to do. Then, we noticed a film all over every single tile that would not come up; Technician did NOT allow the tile and grout to dry before spraying grout sealer..Then, did not wipe off the excess grout sealer, just left it all over each and every tile. 3rd trip out of same day to day to try and fix it, they used every chemical, scrubber machine, everything they had to try and get it off, guess what, didn't work. So now, my grout is wet UNDER the sealer, which never had proper curing time, because they did not let the grout dry before applying, and my tiles have giant stains, splotches, blobs all over every single one because they did not remove the sealer from the tile after spraying the grout. And on top of it, one of the technicians decided that no, all of my white grout was actually completely stained before they got here that's why it's dark (Not because it was wet, which was the case)..He ended up arguing with me and cursing at me.

Couldn't be easier. House only one year old. Rep on phone was not polite and not accomodating.

Called company back. Asked for another rep to come back and they said original rep had to. Company CONTRACTS for their work. Never recommend and never use again.\n\n****ADDITIONS OR RESPONSES after owner response. The Rep referred to was not your wife, but the \"contractor\" that he said he was doing our carpet. Your wife (or person who scheduled our cleaning) WAS friendly on the phone. If you do not use contractors perhaps the \"technician (rep)\" shouldn't tell us that.  The stains and lackluster was noticed BEFORE we put any furniture back into the home. Plus, the guy who did the cleaning REQUIRED that we pay prior to the work and to him not the office. Not used to paying prior to work and wont again. Nothing I have said is intentionally false or misleading.  Still highly disappointed in work and don't believe in luck but do thank you for the intended kind ending comment.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1601404614366, "text": "UPDATED 10-1-20 after another false claim by Stacy. For anyone reading this....please visit our about us page on our website...https://www.goprosteam.com/about-us/   as you can see Cams' picture and bio are listed and have been on our website for years. Stacy, this is tiring to say the least.  Let me fill you in on a little nugget of information...the technician is not only our employee he is my stepson, so I think we know a thing or two that goes on in our company.  I mean for goodness sake Stacy...we have company vans with our logo, company name, address and phone number plastered all over it with an expensive van wrap...do you think any company is gonna let a \"contractor\" drive their company vans?  They are not, so again, either you are confused or making this stuff up for whatever reason you have...not sure...maybe you are just having a bad week...still no reason to dump all over us. The reason you were required to pay upfront is because both you and your husband were leaving the house, this is company policy..otherwise if a customer stays they pay after work is completed.  Also...if Cam left a busines card with our logo all over it, it says his title \"OPERATIONS MANAGER\".  We have already asked Cam about his experience with you, as a matter of fact the only communication he had with you was on the phone when he called to ask a few directions to your home while he was on the way...you were not even there when the cleaning intially started, your husband was...so no Cam has no reason to tell you he is a contractor.  By the way....you did not pay Cam, he carries a credit card reader that is mobile, you were charged by my company...would you like to see a copy of the receipt?  Ive been more than nice to you over this but you keep making false claims.  Again I appreciate your business but please stop this...it is making you look foolish.  Once again we wish you all the luck in your new home.\n\nHi Stacy.  This is Matt Lowery, co owner and founder of Pro Steam Carpet Care.  First let me say it is unfortunate that you feel the need to leave such a false review of our company.  Secondly here is the url to our about us page on our website  https://www.goprosteam.com/about-us/  as you can see it has Cams' bio on there and states he is our OPERATIONS MANAGER, not a contractor so let me clear some things up for you.  Firstly...the \"rep\" on the phone is my wife and gets compliments daily on how helpful, resourceful, nice and educated she is, the \"rep\" that cleaned your carpet and furniture is an employee and has been employed with us for 8 years with zero complaints, only praised because he cares.  We are a family owned business and have been for 30 years.  Secondly...you claim we \"contract\"  for our work....sorry but that is false and misleading.  We do not use contractors..we use employees.  We refused to send a different technician because your husband called us approx 4 days after the job was completed and after you had moved in due to a \"stain\" reappearing.  We were more than happy to reservice your carpet at no charge but the technician who originally cleaned your carpet was already familiar with your carpet and had absolutely no problem in returning to satisfy you....I found it odd that your husband called back and canceled the reservice of your carpets.   We do have before and after pics of your furniture, they are like night and day and cleaned up perfectly.  If I am able to post the pics to this response I will.  I do however have a suspicion that since we performed the carpet cleaning BEFORE you moved in that during your moving process there was probably some soiling that occured....this is common, however it is still unfortunate you feel the need to leave a 1 star review.  We agreed to return to reservice your area and you refused.  We are a good, generous and honest company with many certifications and one of the only firms that is insured in the area.  We appreciate your business and wish you luck with your new home."}, "gmap_id": "0x88f5952399cc1ad9:0x87abb5071354d46d"}

Ok, no big deal, except the appraiser would be here in 1 week.  I needed my carpets cleaned FAST.  Panic set in when ALL my normal carpet cleaners in Newnan were unavailable until after appraisal date.  So, I searched for companies in LaGrange and read the reviews.\nPro Steam seemed like the best option.  I called and Ali was able to get me on their schedule same week.   Price was affordable, in my budget and primarily fit my time constraints.  Cam arrived on time, went over the house and was very thorough.   I really appreciated how quick Ali was able to get me scheduled due to extremely tight timeline. I was amazed that the products they used smelled refreshing AND DID NOT bother my sinuses at all!!!   That is saying something because glass cleaner will make my nose burn.  My carpets look like new, all the little \"oops\" stops are gone, house smells AMAZING.
