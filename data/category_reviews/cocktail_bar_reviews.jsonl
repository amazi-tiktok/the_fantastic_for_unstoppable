The bar is beautifully appointed and the drinks were very good. We called our daughter and her friends, UA alum, to join us. They decided to use the restroom before ordering and were accosted by one of the workers (a manager?). He yelled at them for their audacity to use his facility without ordering, then aggressively pursued them as they headed for the door. My husband and I were sitting outside and witnessed his pursuit of them as he aggressively threw open the door, and quickly apologized to my husband and I as he realized they were with us. I am appalled by his behavior. I could understand a conversation with them about the facilities being for customers only, but pursuing three 23 year old women like a predator is absolutely uncalled for and I will NEVER return nor recommend this place to anyone as a result.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888603bae4f3a2a3:0x4da125f030934b4d"}
