However, my name  was used by samuel and his family to arrange a marriage for his nephews legalization. I was blown away by such accusations that I called samuel to get to the bottom of it. Instead of samuel admitting to him using my name in an illegal manner, he used vulgar language and hung up on me. He then calls my dad to \"get control of me\" for standing up for myself. That's what he trains ppl to do, stand up for themselves, show respect, and be our best. With this being something he trained on, I thought he could have a mature conversation. I also expected an apology. I've never met anyone in Samuel's family so I knew that the information was coming from him. Samuel calls my dad, who has tried with him for years, and tells him he cant go to the gym anymore bc of me calling samuel out for illegal accusations. My dad remodeled Samuel's old gym and did a ton of work in the new gym for a lifetime membership. Now that membership is gone along with all respect I had for samuel. He later admitted to my brother that he and his wife did in fact discuss my name in this manner. He has not called to apologize but he has made threats to my dad bc all he cares about is his reputation. I just so happen to care about my reputation and my family also. I want everyone to be careful around this man bc hes not who he claims to be. I'm not saying he isnt a good trainer but there's more  to being a leader than training physically. Women need to be careful especially bc I'd never want them to convince someone to do anything illegal. The last thing samuel said is he was getting a lawyer so I got me a lawyer and all the proof anyone needs to know the truth. He thought an apology was too much to ask for.

This took diligence and commitment after starting at a yellow belt for the 2 time (because he had to start all over again coming from a different karate school). Tiger Rock is not a skip and a hop for us. We travel at least 40-45 minutes to each lesson. So on those nights we get home late. But it\u2019s apart of our lifestyle for now and believe me it\u2019s well worth it! On a day to day basis my son is maturing and becoming more confident and focused as a young man as well as in his academics. I\u2019ve also noticed his expectations are higher and he even sets goals and challenges his discipleship. What I like most about Tiger Rock is the feel of a family oriented environment. Anytime I have questions no matter who the staff member is the response is always friendly and polite. Communication is paramount and Tiger Rock ensures on a consistent basis that you are included in the family!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88860336aaaaaaab:0x21e352f46b7f4ce0"}

He was a shy, to him-self kind of kid and let's just say he's nothing like that today. He LOVeS this place and you can find him there every chance we can get him there. He has learned so much here and all that he has learned and more will follow him to his adult years and beyond. He is a great kid and very genuine person. I love all the coaches and the owner of Tiger Rock.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88860336aaaaaaab:0x21e352f46b7f4ce0"}

Kid friendly.The instructors, Sensei Keith and Sensei Wyatt, are awesome with the kids! Patient, kind, and good with small kids (we are in the Little Dragons Program). They gently redirect kids when they need to refocus in class and do it with ease. They know how to speak to little ones and meet them on their level.\n2. Communication. They are great at communicating with the parents. We get calendars and text updates when any changes occur, etc. Feedback: Every week, parents fill out a progress sheet and sensei gives a shout out to them at the end of practice when they get their new stripe. This makes my kid feel awesome because he gets to hear from someone outside of our family on how awesome he is. They are great role models for little ones in class. PS- my son got such a sweet shout out on his birthday from sensei in class. He was called upon many times in class to answer up and demonstrate new sills. This is just one example of how they recognize and encourage our kids. My son is one of the younger ones so it was nice to see him get recognized even though he was not the highest belt or most skilled in class.\n3. I like what I see happening at the dojo...Team spirit, kids interacting with their peers, lots of POSITIVITY, focus manners and answering up, and new skills/ techniques being taught each week. There is always emphasis placed on safety when learning new skills and practicing them. P.S. go online and read The Little Dragon Pledge. Kids are not just learning about a sport; they are learning and developing so much more than this. We have been involved for a approx a year and have no intentions on leaving. In fact, I feel like this is a sport we will stick with because of everyrhing my son gets out of it.\n\nThanks to everyone at the dojo for all you guys do for our kids throughout the year.

He will correct their mistakes but always surround it with praise for the things that are correct. He requires discipline and hard work, and his students know it. My son trusts Sensei and that makes me feel good as a parent. I trust him because he also surrounds himself with good instructors and helpers (students). His staff is truly top notch!

We became a little frustrated as summer camp went on, that they require DAILY extra cash of $5.  That really ends up becoming quite expensive on top of the initial price, I can't imagine having multiple kids there!  While I think the occasional field trip is fun for a change, I felt like some times this was used unnecessarily.  This information was also not told up front, but after signing up in the paperwork required.  Extra money for field trips, snacks, pizza parties, gas for the vans?!, etc.  Honestly, this is what changed our mind from doing the After School Program.  Also keep in mind the After School Program change: initially they said there would be homework time, Jiu Jitsu/tumbling/gymnastics practice, and an active game (we thought, perfect, not on devices!).  This has now changed to field trips again with daily fees and less emphasis on JJ, with no word of homework time.  It's basically 2-2.5 hours, why are multiple field trips expected???  Again - overall good, I believe they are trying, but I think they have moved away from some of the initial appeal of these programs.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1627736754334, "text": "SJ!

I joined Premier in October 2012 with Oct-Dec free. I enrolled on the family plan with my 3 children. My children quickly became bored with the short 30 minute classes that they could only attend twice a week. The instructors were good with the kids, it was just the rushed format that was bad. By January only one was left attending. I wasn't any happier with the jujitsu, Krav Maga, or Muay Thai classes. All classes were only 30 minutes as well. This means practically no warm up, rushed instruction, and little to no time to practice technique or spar. To make it worse, because I had some experience in jujitsu ( my main area of interest when I joined) I was handed a book with the curriculum for the night and left to teach students who had attended Premier longer than me on several occasions. So not only was I losing my training time, I was left in an awkward situation. At this point I figured I would just deal with it and not renew my contract when the 6 months were up. In January the owner sold me on joining the Certified Instructor Training Program with promises of additional training outside of normal class times, seminars that would be paid for by my tuition, weekly CIT meetings, and eventually running my own school under the premier name. There were about 4-5 other adults that signed up for this as well. We changed my contract to reflect that my monthly payments would now go to paying the $10,000 tuition for this course. Between signing up in January till April there were only a total of 3 CIT meetings, far from the weekly meetings I was promised. There was no additional training offered. The seminars were all held in either Kentucky or Texas so to attend you had to drive there and get a hotel. That's not so bad I suppose, but then I was told that there would be an additional fee of several hundred dollars to attend. Also I would have to buy all the equipment required for the seminars (which had to be Premier brand). To purchase all of this equipment added approximately $400 (that's with the CIT discount). By March I had come to accept I had been suckered into a joining a McDojo and was now stuck in a contract. I was going to make the most of it. A month or so later the lead instructor came to teach class intoxicated. To the point he was slurring and falling asleep mid sentence while sitting up. After attending the jujitsu class he taught, several of us informed the owner of the instructors condition. He allowed him to continue teaching the remaining classes (Krav Maga and Muay Thai) while he sat in the back and watched. After this I told the instructor that I wanted to cancel my contract. I expressed all of my concerns and disappointments. He assured me that he was going to improve everything and make good on his promises. He asked me to give him another chance and a little time to get things the way they should be. 2 months later the only thing that had changed was that he fired the instructor that was intoxicatedd. There were only 2 CITs left, including me. Everyone else quit showing up. I informed the owner via E-mail, multiple voicemails, and Facebook messenger that I was dropping out. I listed all of the reasons and was very polite. I received no response. I also contacted the billing company, Member Solutions, as per my contract, to cancel. I explained my multiple reasons for wanting to cancel, and they informed me that I could not cancel. The new contract I signed for the CIT program was counted as a loan for $10,000 that I had to pay back before I could cancel. I attempted again, multiple times, to contact the owner about this issue and once again received no response. I am fortunate enough to have a lawyer as a friend to help me beat this scam. However, I would strongly recommend you stay away from this \"school\".\n\nSincerely,\nChris Allen", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889720dd9ebefeb:0x8c472225533f0464"}
