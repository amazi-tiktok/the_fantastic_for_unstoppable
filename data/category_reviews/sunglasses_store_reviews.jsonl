Also discussed the need for blue light filter, at which time there was no mention that the filter wasn\u2019t available for plastic.\n\nGet a call a few days later when system is back up and given a price and told blue light isn\u2019t available in plastic lenses. According to the LensCrafters website and online ordering it IS available in plastic. I\u2019ve always been suspicious of their charges and now I know to stay away.\n\nInstead of showing us prices for what we asked just kept asking what our budget was like a used car salesperson.\n\nAnother example is when they put my son in Ray Ban branded lenses (most expensive) when we only asked for regular polycarbonate a few years ago.\n\nIf you want transparency and fair pricing just order from the LensCrafters website and take out the dishonest sales people.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1603981320265, "text": "Hello Lee, thank you so much for sharing your experience.

I was able to find a frame that I liked as well as the frame fitting prefectly. The guy that processed my transaction was very cool and he actually helped me choose the frame that looked the best on me. Rewind to the day I pick my new glasses up. Well let's just say I was not happy. First time trying the new frames on they were so big they did not fit at all. The first lady adjusted them but they were still falling off my face. Then she ask another lady to help while she is adjusting them for the second time I asked why are they so big and not fitting like the previous frame (demo) I tried on. She tells me that my actual frames are bigger because the thickness of my lenses and that demo frames will fit differently. I have never heard of that or had that issue anywhere else. Everytime I tried on frames I liked and was fitted they have always fit fine with little to no adjustments. After about 5-6 times adjusting my glasses they somewhat fitted ok. The piece behind my ear is adjusted so far inward on both sides that the top of my ear sticks out and the frame does not fit properly on my face or behind my ears. She then tells me that I will have to come back and get them adjusted again because overtime taking them off and on they will adjust back to there normal size. I was not told this when I was making my transaction nor have I ever experienced this elsewhere. I will not be coming back. Worst experience ever. I have had them for several hours and they are loose sliding down my nose constantly.

She didn't say I'm sort for the inconvenience or nothing just sat her round Pok\u00e9mon butt down and stated the price so I had to ask her about what I was getting and she abruptly said what I was getting and rolled her eyes ( imagine that a manager).

I had picked out the frames I wanted.\n\nThey were all so super nice & helpful to my dad. They took proper time with his insurance, fitting, asking him all kinds of questions about what he wanted & everything.\n\nWhen we came back the next day, the lady didn't ask for my insurance, rushed through me & she didn't ask me any of the kinds of questions she asked my dad, like did I want tinted lens or anything else. When I asked how she knew what to charge me when she didn't even bother to see what insurance I had or what discounts I may be eligible for, she said it was because I said yesterday that I did not have insurance. That is a total lie & doesn't make any sense on so many levels. I had to wait a while on my dad the day before, so why not just go ahead & get glasses while I'm waiting if insurance was the only issue? When you apply, doesn't it take a while to kick in? If I didn't have it the day before, then I probably wouldn't have had it the day after either.\n\nShe just wanted to scam me for some reason. I agree with some of these other reviews that said these people are scammers. It's like they make up their mind about you right after you walk in the door. They must have liked my dad, but decided to try to scam me.\n\nI work for the federal government just like my dad. I have good insurance just like he does, but they decided to treat me like either a loser who still lives at home with their parents even though I am 42 or a total homeless bum. Well, if that's the case, then how could I have paid for my glasses? I guess my dad would have because in their minds I am a loser who still needs my parents funds to survive.

My sales clerk, Phyllis, was helpful about the type of frame I should get according to my face structure....after I was looking around about 20 minutes. When I entered the shop, I told her I needed a quote for frames and lenses, and without even looking up, she told me to pick out some frames and we would go from there. I asked Phyllis shouldn't she at least look at my prescription since it was pretty strong because I knew all frames don't work with all prescriptions. She glances at my prescription and says\" Oh yeah, it is pretty strong\", and tells me to stay away from rimless and metal frames. I really should have left then and went somewhere else, but decided to look around. Phyllis comes to assist after about 20 minutes. She brings over about four pair of frames for me to try and critiqued each one . I narrowed my choices down to the pair I really liked. As I was getting fitted, due to my special prescription, I was quoted a time of 14 days. Insert sad face here. Oh well, that's the price I pay for being a nerd and reading all those books in dim light as a youngster.\n\nMy glasses came back in about 10 days. After trying them on and getting them adjusted, I discover my right lens is scratched / cracked smack dab in the middle . While they agree to reorder the lens, I am quoted another 14 days for it to come back. Phyllis suggests that I go ahead and wear this pair to get used to them and when my new lens comes in, they will just switch the damaged lens out. I'm disappointed to say the least, but happy to get new glasses I was well over due for.

There were several customers in the store but I was greeted as soon as I entered the door.  I believed the ads stating 2 pair $74.78.but this is next to impossible.  I ended up spending $119 for 1 pair.  The frames were $9.95 but the progressive added $98.66.  Trying to get the advertised pricing is for people who don't need glasses.  Araseli helped me and did a wonderful job but I really do not think anyone could explain the pricing. Even though the pricing was crazy, I was happy with my final decision.  Araseli told me the glasses would be ready Monday but when I got home around 2 hours later I received the text the glasses were ready.  I really like my new glasses but noticed when I got home there is writing and lines on one lens.  I plan to take the glasses back Monday and see if they can clean this off or replace the lens.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890dc21c7566ad:0xbe643ff2373dd465"}

Staff and Dr. Harris are always nice and professional.  I don't have vision insurance, but price on visit is always reasonable.  Wait time is a little long but I never make an appointment either.  I'm always a \"walk-in\".  The eyeware part is a bit higher on retail prices for contacts so I choose to buy my contacts online.  They are always nice and helpful in providing my written Rx to purchase my contacts elsewhere.  Overall, I would recommend Dr. Harris @ Marx Optical to anyone looking for a good optometrist.......\n\nUpdate : I have officially quit seeing them after  10+ years.  After sitting waiting for almost 3hours with an eye injury,  I felt as though greater concern should have been given to at least administer a triage type exam to assess the situation,  but none was given.  In much pain,  I decided to leave after nearly 3 hours of waiting, since no concern was given.  I don't know if  my doctor knew that an eye injury was waiting,  but if not, his office staff have been poorly trained to deal with medical necessity Vs.  Standard eye exams.  I have seeked out an ophthalmologist and will begin seeing Dr Cain from now on instead of any optometrist office.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862847643db3f51:0x1eb815f284b146b5"}

One of the girls helped me pick out frames and assured me that I looked good. I couldn't wait for my glasses to come in so I could start wearing them. They came back a week later but unfortunately I noticed that one of my lenses was blurry. So I called the store the next day to let them know and the person I talked to was so kind and friendly on the phone and told me to bring them by so they could have a look at them. When I got there, one of the girls told me she accidentally typed in my Rx wrong. The manager came out and talked to me and she also was VERY NICE!! They got my glasses re-ordered and they were back within I think about 6 days! Super fast!! I am so so IMPRESSED with the level of customer service I was shown. I also work in retail and have since 2013. So I've seen all kinds of craziness! Haha! But these people are a class act. They treated me with respect, kindness and put a smile on my face despite the accident. I wasn't worried about it. I was just glad they got it corrected and I couldn't be happier.

The peak progression is so for down making it impossible to fix ones eyes continuously. Kirk suggested a \u201cshort progressive\u201d that allows one to focus on the peak 4mm sooner with a much larger window. After purchasing, the change is incredible.\n\nBut the big story is: I took Kirk a pair of rimless glasses that I had stepped on back in 2005. They were my favorites and I was nostalgic for them. Kirk didn\u2019t hesitate, he immediately started the logistical process, built the glasses, and a couple of days later: I was looking through short progressive rimless glasses exactly like the ones I stepped on.\n\nBut the bigger story is: I\u2019m used to paying around $700 for everything.

I couldn\u2019t imagine having 4 teeth pulled because this place sent me home with NO ANTIBIOTICS. Only pain pills! I noticed that the pain was beginning to be a bit unbearable so I called and ask if it was normal and if I could come in. The RECEPTIONIST proceeds to tell me that everything was normal. She\u2019s not a dentist so I called back to schedule an appointment to come in. My appointment was at 4:00. I didn\u2019t even make it to the back until 4:40 after asking if I was forgot about! A heavier set girl in at the front desk said very dry \u201cwell they had to squeeze you in\u201d as if I was a burden or something!   She left for the rest of the day. The other RECEPTIONIST I asked ignored me when I told her I\u2019d been there for 40 min and never even got up to see what was going on Smh! The entire time I\u2019m sitting in the waiting area the vision department was clapping and dancing to music (imagine how that feels to hear loud clapping after having your teeth pulled) VERY unprofessional! I finally was in the back at this point. The assistant that helped me was very nice and patient! I hate the fact that I didn\u2019t get her name but I loved her attitude and how she was willingly trying to help me! I was sent home with antibiotics! The same antibiotics they said they didn\u2019t give after a extraction smh and steroids for my swelling. He also gave me more tabs for pain as if I\u2019m a junky or something or if that was going to make me happy. I\u2019m not going back at all. Thanks but no thanks. On another note!

This is not once but twice for us. This time I'm going to the Better Buisness Bureau", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889badbf94081c6b:0x4f3c6da5ce8f1c70"}

He started a filling and my son raised his hand and made noises to let him know he could feel it, but the dr kept going and told the nurses \"He's fine.\" Then when my son finally jumped & grabbed his hand, he got aggravated and said to refer us to a pediatric dentist to be sedated. Very rudely made a point to say he wasn't even touching his teeth when he jumped. He didn't even offer to give him another shot or try to comfort him/talk to him about what he was feeling. My son is 11, knows what he can feel & has never had this problem with other dentists. :( I am very disappointed that an office so heavily geared towards children & close to home, has such an impatient & unkind dentist.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889badbf94081c6b:0x4f3c6da5ce8f1c70"}

The ladies at the front desk were lovely, but the man who did my prescreening was awful. He was rude right off the bat. I'm generally a nervous person when it comes to doctors and I like to know what's going on, however when I was asking questions about what he was trying to do to me, he got annoyed and kept trying to rush me into doing things. This automatically put me off, and made me feel unsafe. The puffer  test, for Glaucoma always has made me really nervous, but usually I try my best to get through it. However, I felt so unsafe and uncomfortable in the small room with this man that I was not about to do anything I wasn't comfortable doing to begin with. When it came to doing the eye mapping, he kept getting frustrated because he wasn't getting a good picture and ended up pushing my head pretty hard into the equipment. I wish I would've left at this point, but I figured it was probably just all in my head. He asked if he could hold open my eye, but made no attempt to even put on a glove, and at this point I had 0 trust in the guy. When I went into the exam room, the doctor was condescending. I try to tell doctors that I get anxious around them, and it typically helps the appointment go smoother, but she as well rushed me through everything which made me feel really uncomfortable. She then went to put drops in my eye, because I denied the puffer test and became really mad and threw down her paper towels she was holding when I refused. I know it is an important test, but they didn't try to establish any trust, and made me feel really freaked out and uncomfortable. I figured I don't have to go here again, and will take the test with a doctor who I actually trust, and who treats their patients with kindness.\n\nTo sum it up I will never be going to this location again, nor will I suggest it to anyone. They made me feel uncomfortable and unsafe.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da239f8e191:0xca264ffb151bf5e2"}

Still I didn't learn from them overcharging me from last year, that was partly due to my not so great insurance coverage.  I've been wearing corrective lenses for decades.  This would be my second visit to this office, I was in need of new glasses and my old prescription expired, so I dropped in on my lunch break.  This was one of few places my insurance covered.  The office assistants were nice.  They tried to upsell my dilation but I told the girl that I wanted to keep everything under my insurance coverage.  Everything went fine until I had to wait 45 minutes for Dr. Davis finish her causal conversation with the patient next door. When she finally appeared, she touched base on the astigmatism in my left eye.  I've had an astigmatism in that eye for years and there has yet to be any issues about it.  She said she wanted to try a specific contact lens for that eye, she would order me free trial and that I'm to come back for a follow-up.  She also suggested that I change my disposable contact lens from daily to weekly.  She asked if I slept in them, I said no because I rub my eyes in my sleep and I have symptomatic reactions with allergies which causes severe protein buildup.  She said she will write a prescription for some allergy drops.  I didn't think I needed them because I haven't had an allergic reaction like that in a while. So I thought I would just not get the prescription.  Finally I am about to check-out and the lady at the desk, Sarah, tells me that my final total is over $100.  I only assumed that my copay would be $40. Sarah said that my eye exam \"became a medical visit because the written prescription for the eye drops and the specialized fit for the new contact lens we are ordering.\"  I was blown away.  I had no room in my budget for that.  I know I signed the form understanding there would be extra costs but they should at least TELL me as they are working what costs are to be incurred.  Sarah saw I was distraught and made and additional comment, \"You know, I'm working on getting a coupon for these drops.  I don't know what your co-pay is, but these drops are expensive.  The coupon will make sure you don't pay more than $25. Oh and the follow-up visit is free.\"  Thanks but no thanks, you obviously know what you were doing and got caught.  I don't plan to fill out the unnecessary prescription.  I don't plan to use this office again.  I'll go back to get the rest of my contact prescription and that's it.  No more.  I've been seeing an ophthalmologists for, years under basic insurance and my copay was not over $20, let alone any surprise charges for a non-invasive visit.  My suggestion is to go elsewhere.  A medical office is supposed to take care of their patients, not rob them blind.\n\nUpdate 7/18/2014:  I came back for my follow up for my contact fitting.  This time I was seen by Dr. Bradley.  He asked about the contacts that were given to me, I told them that the left lens was difficult to adjust to because it was thicker than the right lens and that with my new job, I'm looking at a computer more so they dry out faster.  He examined my eyes and found out that it wasn't the computer use that was drying out my eyes.  He said the contact lens material was not working with my body chemistry and that my tears were being repelled from the lens and not being absorbed for normal wear.  He then looked closer at my prescription and said that I didn't have a need for these special lens.  I was doing fine before and this was not a solution to my problem.  He referred me to use a different lens, free of charge, and crossed out Dr. Davis' previous notes in red marker.  I'm so glad there was a second opinion in the same office that could help me out.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da239f8e191:0xca264ffb151bf5e2"}

Not only were they none attentive, but did nothing but rush & try pushing my teenage son to switch from glasses to contacts. Instead of giving a teenager time to think about whether he was comfortable with contacts or wearing them, they insisted on forcing you to pay for a lesson and a contact exam on top of his glasses exam before making a decision. After leaving the first time with a horrible experience, we got a call that his lenses were in after 2 weeks. Then, after calling to make sure they\u2019d have time to complete the service before driving the distance again, we get there to be told they had ordered the wrong lenses for his frame. The frame in which he specifically had with him at his first visit & had taken a picture of with him in them. The employees were unfriendly, unconcerned, and sat there arguing with me about them having more than one frame listed in the system for him as an excuse. Regardless of the fact that his current frames were there with him on his exam visit & they were responsible for making sure they ordered the lenses for that exact frame! They completely disregarded checking the frame model he had with him before ordering the new lenses I paid $362 for, and we were not only out of another long drive for nothing, but ended up being  left without him having his glasses.

A doctor that will explain to you what's going on and makes the time to answer your questions.  A doctor that CARES about your eye health or lack there of, depending on the situation.  A doctor and his staff that know what customer service is all about.  A doctor and his staff that will work with you on the health of your eyes.  I'm dealing w/ these people today, b/c I have to.

She took my ins card  that clearly had my husbands name and employer information on it. She had me wait for over 20 minutes in the waiting area . I  walked back to the receptionist  desk to find her doing nothing and asked for my ins. card and to find out what was taking so long and she stated oh I haven\u2019t ran your ins yet but you do have VSP . SO , I\u2019m like how do you know that if you have not looked into the information. So she said I will in a minute very rudely. I had to ask her to pull my file if she needed additional info and  told her that i was not a new customer, everything should be in my file nothing had changed. She rolled her eyes and just sat there looking as if I was bothering her.  Then she finally looked up and said I need your husbands DOB and the last four of his social on this sticky note and you can have a seat. I said no ma\u2019am run my ins and give me my card back please. By then they were calling me to the back for my exam. Let me just say the rest of my appointment went well . The Hispanic lady did well with helping me with my contacts ,but i honestly think they have lost a customer . I don\u2019t have time for attitudes where I\u2019m spending my money.

She is such a kind human being, she listened thoroughly while I talked about my history and concerns. She did not lose patience or make me feel rushed during my eye exam (especially when I had difficulty deciding between which two lenses looked more clear). We chatted while she checked out my eyes after dilation and she was just a joy. I love love love the experience I had with her and the fact that she is a WOC sealed the deal for me.\n\nCecily was a peach and walked us through what insurance would cover, our many options for lenses and frames and was able to play with some numbers so that we were able to get the most bang for our buck based on our needs.\n\nI'll come here to update about receiving our glasses, the fitting and how things turned out but the experience overall was wonderful!\n\n***Our glasses were ready for pickup 5 days after our appointments! We both got multiple phone calls letting us know they were ready.\n\nThe only reason that I couldn't quite give a 5 star review was that some of the staff that worked in the front were not as polite and patient (my wife didn't have such a great experience with the person who assisted her at first).

But, my opinion of Dr. Mark Shirey, who is also trying to run for public office - has changed.\n\nDr. Shirey was a savior to me when he helped me with a nearly debilitating ailment. I have photophobia - no I'm not scared of light. It's a diagnosis for high sensitivity to light. Bright light, and all Sun light, are very painful for me. Dr. Shirey gave me the prescription that helped me deal with this while driving, of which I can't describe how grateful I was for this. It was literally life changing.\n\nBut - during my last visit, Dr. Shirey told me that he \"doesn't do that anymore\". He doesn't recognize a diagnosis that's over 100 years old and recognized by all major medical institutions. His excuse was \"ALDOT doesn't recognize it.\", which is not true. Neither ALDOT or ALEA list any diagnosis that they do or don't recognize. The law in the state of Alabama is very clear in this regard.\n\nWhen I got home, I did the research on this. I compiled the information and sent it to Dr. & Mrs. Shirey for review and follow-up. I haven't received anything back from them.\n\nI've dealt with tremendous pain in my life, and live with severe musculoskeletal pain every day. Every day I deal with challenges doing things that most wouldn't have a second thought about. But the pain from bright light is something that stops me from being able to safely operate a vehicle. I have to close one eye and squint the other - all while they're watering. depending on how long I'm exposed, my vision just starts deteriorating - colors start blending/fading.. etc. It's not a pleasant experience when I'm without shaded lenses.\n\nI've been very fortunate to have doctors and specialists that have helped me with a number of things in my life. Doctors that listen to their patients and seek to understand them.\n\nThis is the first time I've felt discriminated for a medical diagnosis. By a Doctor.\n\nI'm sure Dr. Shirey didn't think of it like that, or do it out of spite. But it's still a blow to the quality of life for me. Dr. Shirey, like the rest of us, is human. But, in a position where you're responsible for providing care for and improving the quality of life for your patients, you should never assume, discount or interpret your patients plea as unimportant or conjecture.\n\nI'm the one with the condition, not you. You're responsible for having the knowledge and authority to help me cope with the condition.\n\nI do not take any pleasure in giving a review like this. Especially for a local owned business and a member of our community. But, I also take professional responsibility very seriously - and this was an irresponsible action that negatively affected my quality of life, where I was a patron seeking professional help to improve my quality of life. It was a request well within the realm of service that one would expect from this establishment.\n\nThis is very important as a leader in the community as well. If you want to run for office, don't start by discriminating against your own patients by directly denying them the help you're tasked with and responsible for providing.\n\nI guess it's good practice for becoming a politician...\n\n5 years ago: 5 Stars\nI've visited this office twice and will be back. Both times I was promptly taken care of by the staff. Everyone there was polite and showed great hospitality. They have excellent equipment and are truly capable of providing great vision care.\n\nThanks! =)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb20b61f7d133:0xe258a2eb70da471c"}

I bought two pair and they both equaled a total of $63.99. However, the service was suspicious to say the least. Eyemart is advertising multiple pairs of glasses, at an affordable rate. When I went into the store, I noticed the employees were seemingly very nice and eager to help. Long story short, when it came time to purchase my glasses they were tremendously higher then I expected. My total came out to be $143.99 originally. I thought that was strange so I just simply asked is there not a more standard lens that I could get? Suddenly the employee gets nervous, as if I've asked a question that's too sensitive for her to answer. Her boss reacted rather strangely as well. What had happened was, they had rung me up for two pairs of glasses and lenses and instead of asking me what lenses I would like or giving me choices on what they have; they simply just charged me for the most expensive and weren't even trying to provide me with any options. This was very upsetting to me simply because their advertisement says one thing, yet they are not at all trying to correlate such through their services. What is even worse, is that the manager actually brought me an example of what I would be buying going with the cheaper option. Let me be the first to tell you the example she brought out was not what I ended up buying. Which leads me to believe that Eyemart is only after your money. Granted I got my glasses within literally 30 minutes I was a little bit taken back by my experience considering I was trying to be bamboozled. If you go into this store they have a great selection, and I suggest that you go with whatever you like, but I would be very wary of their service and also be sure to ask questions.

We go to our appointment and she takes our card she has to see it or she wouldn't of known they didn't take our insurance because of the mcr on it she didn't tell us nothing about it or we would of went some where else. Our insurance pays for the eye exam and 100.00 towards frames and /or lenses however u want to use it. We take our exams and I come out to the lobby while my eyes are dilating she said I could get with the receptionist and pay or do what I needed to do. Ok  I tell her that I shouldn't owe her anything that our insurance pays for the exam and 100.00 for frames.  I told her I called before we came in to make sure you took our insurance if u didn't we would of gone somewhere else. Then she said that she didn't know we had mct by talking to me on the phone. Ok you shouldn't of said you take it u should of asked about the mcr on the card first before saying I took it. The thing that really got me is I'll give her the phone call. But when we went in for our appointment and she made copies of our cards and highlighted where we had MCR she knew then they didn't take our insurance but she didn't tell us until after we both had our exams and was leaving. I told her that she did not tell us that or we would of went somewhere else. I told her she could file the claim and hope they pay it. We were not very happy about that.\nWe go next door to get our glasses thinking we can do all of this in one day and be done with it. Wrong again I called and asked did they take our insurance yes we do they just didn't bother to tell me that the machine tht runs the card through hasn't been sent to them yet and they have no way of filing our insurance. But we will call you when it comes in. How long will that be? I'm sorry I have no idea??  So we either go somewhere else or go home and wait on there call thinking it will be just a few days Wrong again. It was a long time before they called us. So we were still aggerivated about the whole thing we weren't sure wether to go back there or not. We did decide that if the insurance didn't pay for the exam that they could write it off or do whatever they wanted to do with that bill we werent going to pay it cause she knew before we had the exams and done them anyway without giving us a choice to have them done or not. So far I haven't got a bill from them or anything from my insurance.\nThey finally call us and say they can take our insurance now. So my husband goes and gets his done. They look good on him and so far he's satisified.\nI went Wednesday and got mine done and picked them up Friday so far I'm very happy with them. I bought the 29.95 year warranty I have narcolepsy and I fall and drop them all the time. I can mess them up I have had my dog to eat them and I'm being serious. I woke up and she was crunching on something I was trying to find my glasses to see what she had  that's when I found the frames.\nThe people were very nice, the place was nice they just need to have there knowledge together and tell people the right thing and most important tell them if you don't take their insurance before you do nothing to them. We were nice. There's allot of people hat would of caused a big big scene.\nThank you!!\nHave a Nice Day!!!!\n\nDebbie Waldroup", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1564174066563, "text": "Hello Debbie, thank you for your review.

Also, since my employer is so strict on the glasses, they provide me with a free pair every year, but my prescription has to be up to date. The ladies behind the desk refused to give me my exam results because it was against their policy. Basically they didn't want me to take my prescription to a competitor and purchase glasses or contacts. I explained my situation and that I had just spent almost 500 on glasses and contacts (and thats additional to insurance paying 150 toward my frames) with them. Didn't matter. I walked to the back and grabbed the optometrist. He gave me my prescription so I could take it to work.

It was covered in my insurance for a replacement  but they still made me pay a $20 dollar processing fee. \ud83e\udd2d\nNeedless to say, I won\u2019t be returning ...But I do want to be fair...so  why did I give 2 stars.. here\u2019s why:\n1. The eye doctor ( lady with brown hair) was thorough.. still abrasive\n2. The girl who measured the glasses to my face after they came in was very polite, she seemed genuine in wanting to help me find a pair I liked, she was honest\n3. They give free bottles of water and fruit snacks and mints while waiting", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888920ff09cd3e19:0x307e205adca64c68"}

I had been having problems with finding someone to work on my bike.  I have a \u201995 Honda VT1100c Shadow.  No one wanted to work on it because of it\u2019s age & my regular mechanic had closed up shop.  When I spoke to, Ronnie I explained what I wanted him to do.  I asked him how long would it take to complete the job.  He told him that it would be two weeks.  I agreed to that.  He came out to my house in late July to pick up my bike & take it to his shop.\nI waited the two weeks & gave him al call.  He said that he was still working on another bike & he was waiting for parts to come in.  I said, that was fine, I can wait for a few more weeks.  Two more weeks came about & he still hasn\u2019t gotten to it.  So, I just gave up & bought another bike in September.  I finally got a call from him on October 10th & 12:38 pm.  He said that he got it done.  I called him back & asked him how much it was, he said the total was $865.44.   I told him I would have to pick it up in a month. He agreed.  When I got there on November the 23rd to pick it up, he had flattened the rear tire.  He said  he broke the valve stem.  He told me he was going to charge me $75.00 to replace the stem that he broke.  I then asked him if we could start it, he said again, no.  The bike did have to be bottle fed.  So, I took it home.  When I got home I bottle fed it, it wouldn\u2019t start.  I called him & he said that it ran when he had it.  So, I asked him if he could look at it & see if he could figure out what was wrong.  He said that it would be two weeks & he would get $80.00 an hour to fix it.  Keep in mind, I just gave him the previous day, $865.00 in cash.  So, I took the carbs back off.  The only thing he changed was the diaphragms. The main jets, slow jets all were corroded & stopped up. He had the float heights all off.  He even used rubber hose for fuel line.  I called him back to ask for half a refund on it. I called him out on what he did.  When I told him that the jets were filthy & the carb bodies were filthy he stuttered & then told me that I am not getting sh*t back and hung up.  I wouldn\u2019t let this man work on anything.  The review on here before mine had a bad experience & they were there when I picked up my bike.  If I could give it negative starts if I could. These pictures below show what I got for my money. You can see that the bottom of the carbs are green & the jets are old & stopped up.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOikOY_9uySYZgFYs1yCu1pjr8BZtBxgR0_EOs=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhLhKb5HMQDNeqRvZbtmc8KlHnW95v1eurcwvz=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFfYMTVub6Q4n1Pl1qjaSVW3wzgg-2EQdl5Gce=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOohWrBi_KZuuZs2rloW7fiD3qhVAPjuRE0JFjC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLu6wYyOwVVADFo8rLp4GUUTVDDZj5Ase2sJ2S=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNB8ELRalR_eFBXcm4HlSFtTC2gO2l35PHpvTYa=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOU5e-7LjQrUBNqmroCXFgKbwERuAmEQZdOySBK=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgVwuVEVgOaOQnwAqi7YlwXUGSHFWBUeoRahs-=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnMu7Z4WXFhh-wL7F6MitbO42L2Uzj1C27niZD=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2NUFL7xZB2E2_ba96Ko7Bd0NJFJ8rZ-zubAh6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzMI0yG2lwNxnXx4ddN8XuxyydEnCmQ480LnZK=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPt40-BH5IeCZHmqv2sKSd2wkMdHtAiFDnYzG02=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889bfdd2f410caf:0xf666e3cabfd567f4"}

Big Mistake.  He charged us $3500 plus to fix it.  He was clearly aware that it had set up.  The first time we went to get it, It would not start and the lights wouldn't work.  He ask how long has this gas been in here. My husband said 7 years remember you were supposed to drain the tank for me.  He even wrote it sat up for 7 years on the receipt.  He painted the front  fender with paint that didn't match.  He put a used rear tire on it and called it a new one.  It had dirt and clay mud on it and the bike wouldn't start so where would the mud come from on a new tire? .  We left it with him for obvious reasons.  My husband ask him to replace the bushing in the handle bars since we were leaving it anyway.We paid him in the beginning to change the light covers.  He charged us twice the original one he ordered we found in the saddle bags.    My husband starts home on it today.  The brake light would not go off and the mirror was just spinning. You would think he would have saw that when replacing the bushing in the handlebars. My husband gets to Arab while driving the brand new war bonnet on the fender fell off.  Oil is leaking from a bike that he supposedly changed the oil and fixed the clutch on it.  We paid this man 3700 plus and he didn't take enough pride in his work to even wipe the dust off the bike.  I was using his shop rag to do that while we were waiting to get it running last week.  He literally took it out of my hand.  When I first met him i told my husband he seems like a good Christian person.  Boy was I wrong he might be a Christian.  I have no Idea but good is far from the truth.  We are very upset with the way we were ripped off.\nWe took our bike to another shop because it was obvious that Ronnie did not change the tires, the battery, fix the carburetor or anything we ask him and paid him to do. They could not believe that anyone would say the changed tires when they were literally rotten around the rim because it had set up for 7 years. He really screwed us out of 3700.00 He is a dishonest man. The Battery was 7 years old yet he said it was new.

Because those changes were not dramatically different, Dr. Kuo recommended my prescription not be changed.
