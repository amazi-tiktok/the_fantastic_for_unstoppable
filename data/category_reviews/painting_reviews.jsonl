What a COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT!  Bryant Darby came for the initial consultation and was very thorough and detail oriented, so I could only assume the painters would follow suit. Long story short, the painters were absolutely terrible! The crew dripped paint EVERYWHERE.  Inside and outside of my house were covered in drips of white paint.  **UPDATE:  The paint drips were on a brand new deck (less than 2 years old); a new rug (less than 2 years old) and newly installed flowerbeds/rocks less than a month before the paint job.  THIS WAS NOT FROM A PREVIOUS PAINT JOB!!!!   Every time they returned to fix something, they'd leave their mark on something else.  It finally got to the point that I didn't even want them on my property any longer.  The lame attempt they made to clean up after themselves was laughable and I was ready to cut my losses** The house wasn't prepped correctly and I have fresh paint peeling already!   They broke bulbs on my string lights and not only didn't tell me, but didn't bother to clean it up!   This crew was completely lazy and careless.

The painters did come back to the house to clean off any drips and as we discussed with you onsite many of the drips were from the previous times the house was painted and could not be cleaned.  To my knowledge any drips or spills we were responsible for were cleaned from the house.  If you do have peeling paint from the current job we did for you please remember you have a 3 year warranty that covers any peeling, flaking, or fading. Likely this is not a product of incorrect prep but the conditions in which the paint was applied.  If any moisture gets trapped between the paint and the wood it will peel no matter how well the house was prepped.  This is why we offer the warranty we do.  Please feel free to contact us to schedule any necessary warranty work.  We are happy to fix anything we are responsible for."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889166f758133e3:0xb2e24817cff76e0b"}

After 20+ years and doing touch up painting as needed, we had to do more and that involved changing colors in about 70% of the house.\n\nWe did our due diligence and got three estimates from reputable painters.  The first came in roughly $4000 over our budget and we began to consider just painting the main level.  The second (who we had used in the past) was only $200 over budget, had done good work for us in the past and we were now in a comfortable price range.  The Painting Company was the last we called and came highly recommended by several friends and neighbors.\n\nWhen Peter and I completed our walk through, he handed me a nice glossy folder containing references, insurance information, standard practices and the like.  We had also discussed upgrading from a contractor grade paint to something better (especially since we are known to only paint when its an absolute necessity).  Peter was courteous and professional and as he drove off, I knew we could never afford what we had discussed.\n\nThe bid from the Painting Co came in the next day and was $1600 under budget ($1800 under the next closest bid and $5600 under the high bid).  I read through the detailed list of inclusions and exclusions, the color choices in the different rooms, the type and manufacturer of paint to be used and found it all to be exactly as discussed the day earlier.  We had found ourselves a painter.\n\nWe called and set up a date to start, game them a 25% deposit to cover material and began taking down pictures and putting away breakables.\n\nA little over a week later, two painters showed up at the house as scheduled.  They may have been 10 or 15 minutes late.  But, that was all.  The date was correct and they had all their gear and were ready to go.  We walked through the house marking which rooms were to be painted which colors to avoid any confusion or misunderstanding and they began moving furniture, taping the trim and covering everything (and I mean everything.  our house looked like a drop cloth bomb had exploded in it).\n\nThat day and part of the next were ceiling days and they began some of the upstairs walls.  The next day the upstairs was complete and they brought the show to the main level.  Three and a half days after beginning, they were cleaning up the house, we did a final walk through, some light touch up and they replaced the furniture before leaving.\n\nThey had estimated four to five days and finished in three and a half and the product was nothing short of excellent.  I was contacted promptly when they had the one question that required a minimal amount of homeowner guidance.\n\nIt's been a week now and every time we walk into a room we are still amazed by the quality of work and the difference that it makes.  I guess it's time to start planning the painting of the outside again.  The Painting Company will get the job.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1620411002108, "text": "Thank you so much for the incredibly detailed 5-Star Review, Jimmy!"}, "gmap_id": "0x88893d2530b97bb5:0x3d2e1ac8c6984d89"}
