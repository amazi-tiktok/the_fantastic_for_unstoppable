They was surprised that I didn't  use my favorite oil. They liked the flavorful taste, more olive and peppery flavor. They also wiped the sauce from their plate. The salad I used the balsamic vinegar with the olive oil, they liked it too. I think everyone should try these tasty flavors. It's made by a family owned business.

This is what I found to be true in Papa Vince Extra Virgin Olive Oil. It is extremely difficult to find a high quality EVOO. I researched, and happened upon a video on YouTube about Papa Vince. The video features Vitina, and her Mother having a conversation, and drinking their olive oil out of a large shot glass. Vitina was so passionate about her EVOO. I could not wait to try it. It is truly exceptional! The quality far exceeds anything I have ever tried. I drink 1- 2 tablespoons daily for health benefits. I have a reoccurring bleeding ulcer, and diverticulitis. After one week, I noticed the benefits. After a month, I was convinced! I actually ran out, and was forced to be without my daily servings for 15 days. My stomach issues returned. I am anxiously awaiting my shipment, and I will NOT allow myself to run out again. I had the extreme pleasure of finding out the person who answered my text was Vitina herself. I couldn't believe it. I was actually complimenting, what I thought were her employees on treating their customers exactly as Vitina herself would... This company is based on family values, and integrity. They are honest. They care about their customer, and the customer experience above, and beyond. That is an extremely rare find! This company. This family. The people that represent them are truly exceptional, and in a class all their own.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this High Quality Extra Virgin Olive Oil, or the Family that stands behind it. Check out the video on YouTube. Check out their official site, papavince.com.

I have tried MANY excellent, high end, award winning Extra Virgin Olive Oils, and this is my favorite, and my family's too. I'm a bit of an olive oil freak and I can't stop trying different ones-but I always end up coming back to this one. My mom & I love to taste test different olive oils, and we'll go on kicks with different brands, but Papa Vince's is always our #1 top choice that we always come back to. Their EVOO is SO delicious for salad dressing, drizzled on steamed veggies, (like broccoli or zucchini) and steak or chicken. It's also wonderful on baked potatoes, and of course on pasta, and in homemade pesto or tomato sauce. I LOVE to use it as a bread dip with some nice, hot & crusty, fresh Italian or French bread. \ud83e\udd56 It's a small, family owned business with wonderful customer service as well. Vitina is SO sweet, and is such a wonderful, genuine lady. Anyone giving this company less than a 5 star review is shocking to me. My whole family loves this EVOO as much as I do, and the price is not bad at all considering it's imported, and the flavor is so fresh & amazing. Bottles of Papa V's EVOO make excellent gifts too. I gave large bottles as Christmas presents last year to a few close family members, and they were extremely well received. The olive oil has strong hints of tomatoes, with a fantastic peppery kick. I can taste artichokes in it too. I can't wait to taste the fresh harvest every year, it's never the exact same as the year before, which is awesome because I look forward to a great surprise every year now.Their Moscato Vinegar is delish too and makes a fabulous salad dressing mixed with the EVOO. Highly recommend this company and I can't wait to try some of their other foods, like the fresh pasta! I'm also excited to see what new foods they add to their selection!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0538982768c1:0xc0a10e6bb3509782"}
