I was kind to the young lady behind the counter but let her know I would be checking with my husband to make sure the price had not been pre approved by him. After checking with him I knew it had not been pre approved. I called to complain. The manager called me the following week and was very very rude. She stated that she was certain I had been made aware of the price. Ummm, no,, why would we approve the price more than the worth of the dress. Then said that it was \"suspicious\" that I didn't pitch a fit and did pay at the counter. I expressed that I thought I had handled it very nicely. She didn't care and continued to accuse.

The lady that checked me in looked at the rug, consulted with another worker that was there at the time, gave me a ticket, and told me that the rug would be ready around the same time the following week. I called on November 14th to check the status of the rug. I was told \"Yes, the rug is ready, but we couldn't clean it.\" I asked her why did anyone not call me to let me know that it could not be cleaned? Basically all I got was an \"I don't know\" and some other pathetic excuse. I immediately proceeded to pick up my uncleaned rug that has just been sitting on a table for an entire week.\nFor the entire life of me, I do not understand why something as simple as a phone call did not happen. As soon as they saw that they could not accommodate, all they had to do was call and say, \"We apologize for the inconvenience, but we cannot clean your rug.\" I would have happily returned to pick up my rug and found another company to clean it. I am pretty sure that someone knew that Friday morning after I dropped off, that they would not be able to clean my rug. But NO, the rug just sat there until I called to check on it.  A simple phone call. Communication, communication, communication. Inconsideration and/or laziness. But regardless, there was absolutely no reason why I was not contacted. This was my first and most definitely my last visit.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2bf976f6c0f3:0xdcc5b0bc176bd3c5"}
