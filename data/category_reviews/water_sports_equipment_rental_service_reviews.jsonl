Our captain did his best to make it as smooth as possible for us.  Our crewman was amazing.  He handled the rough water very well and managed to get us our life jackets, our harnesses, help us get ready to fly and also took a ton of pictures!  He deserved a large tip for sure!  We were shocked at all he was doing!  We had 8 of us from 9 years old to 67 and we all loved it.  They were very knowledgeable and we felt comfortable with them the entire time.

AWESOME!\nWe rented a boat yesterday June 8th, 2017 from Orange Beach Boat Rentals.  Everything was just Amazing, we rented some rods and bait, and they had it ready on the boat when we got there, he showed us on the map where the fish were biting the day prior and gave my son some great fishing tips.  After fishing for a few hours, we did catch and release, we ran into a group of about 15 dolphins, they were so graceful and beautiful, we had our on Private Dolphin Cruise.  We then pulled into Ingram's Bayou, which was easy to find from the map that was provided to us and we swam for a while, then went back out and watched the dolphins some more. Then we pulled up to a secluded beach and found some nice treasures to take back with us \" shells, driftwood etc.\"  It was such a perfect day, and Igor and April was so accommodating, we felt so welcome on their boats, and they really went above and beyond in many ways. There was even a restroom on the boat! The GPS was a huge plus and the shallow water alarm kept us away from the sandbars.  So glad we found Orange Beach boat rentals, we will make this a annual trip now.  Thanks Again so much from the Sands Family!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a07b1ee0a0e57:0xd9fd06f174faed2"}

No hidden fees, everything is loud and clear upfront.\nI would like to believe, We have it almost foolproof, There is GPS which color-marks shallower waters less than  6 feet in blue color, Deep water is white color. You go less than 3 feet \u2013alarm sounds.\nWhile cruising sandbars are bright yellow visible from a distance by untrained eye.\n\nWe specifically ask in the video to not beach the boat due to our shallow access.

Damage does not stop here, as the propeller work in the sand the blades loosing the cup.

We took food aboard, fished a little, spent time looking at all the porpoises following us and came in about 5 p.m. with the joy of an incredible family time together.
