The drinks are organic and super refreshing. Have I mentioned that they have dole whip? Like.. the kind they have at Disney but without the long lines and Florida humidity. We got the pineapple and it was soooo good and refreshing! If you haven't been here, please do. You won't regret it! And if you are a good friend, tell all your friends and family!
