I had NO idea what to expect when I first visited and oh boy was I impressed. The store itself is packed with items and a tight fit for sure, but I am not complaining! They had everything under the sun for vinyl, crafting and blanks. The T-shirt selection is amazing, every color and size you could want at VERY reasonable prices. They have plenty of blanks from cozies, license plates, bows, children's clothing, jackets, etc etc etc! Their sublimation blanks are coming in strong as well, a great selection of 100% polyester and poly cotton blends, cups, tumblers, coasters, sublimation vinyl and more I have not even looked at yet, every time I go they have something new in to play with! Oh and the VINYL! Sooooo many options. They have a HUGE selection of permanent vinyl as well as Heat Transfer, from patters, to glitter, to just about every color of the rainbow in matte and/or glossy.\n\nNow let's talk about customer service... I do not think I have encountered such consistent good customer service in a long time. Most of the times I have visited have been fairly busy and the employees are working hard at various tasks or helping other customers. I have asked many questions about various products, inventory and have always gotten informed answers. If one person did not know they found the person who did know the answer. I was quite amazed with the effort to help me out in gaining swatches to show clients, beyond what I would have imagined. I have been in the market for a Cameo 4 and their prices were comparable but I found an online location that had it cheaper, but since I have had such great experiences I made the decision to buy local.\n\nLess than a week later the Cameo went on sale at Gator and not expecting to get a refund (Exchanges only with receipt 30 days) I sent a Facebook message to see if it was possible to get a store credit on the difference.\nI got a prompt response to come on in with the receipt during the sale. I returned with the receipt and was happily given a store credit for the difference in price. Talk about a kid in a candy store!\n\nI look forward to working with Gator Vinyl for a long time to come and would recommend them to anyone crafter or otherwise. You cannot go wrong with the exceptional customer service, reasonable prices, and an owner with a human touch.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb27501fbcfb1:0x286b5e200231d8d6"}

I thought it was rude and a little disturbing.\nNext, the prices you see on the website attached to their store are not the same as in the store. When I asked an employee about that, she denied their having a website. Her colleague interceded and said it was outdated and the prices were wrong. When I got to the cash register, I asked if I could leave the vinyl with the cashier. She asked me why. I had to explain to her that I changed my mind. Then she started mumbling and didn't respond when I said \"have a nice day.\" Of the two staff ladies, one was on her phone the whole time and the other was verbally rude. Neither smiled at me once.\nAll in all, I thought the store was well equiped but the staff rude and unprofessional. The general experience was unpleasant.

It\u2019s just annoying, and not something I would recommend to friends.\nI hope they get better at customer interactions because that could make the trips to this store and shopping experience way better.

I have never been told this at any of the other shops around town. I understand that they are a larger store and have a lot of customers, but this is terrible customer service. You never tell the customer that their request is a WASTE OF TIME. You tell them that you don't normally do this or somehting else. That being said, they did check on the shirt for me. At the end of the conversation, I thanked the person and told them that I appreciated them checking, but they shouldn't use the words WASTE TIME when talking to a customer. He said\" I didn't say that and I did go look for you\" and began to talk over me.

We have investigated the issue.  From our understanding, there has been a little miscommunication on the behalf of our rookie employee.  A lot of clothing has been moved around becuase we are opening a bigger store across the street and the new employee was having troulbe understand what you was discribing as the shirt you were looking for.  He might have been missunderstood or use the wrong communication a little. We did find he didn't communicate clearly what he meant by \"waste of time\".  We agree no one should tell you as a customer that something you want to know is a \"waste of time\". We are 100% sure that's not how he meant it because he did find what you was looking for. He also said he corrected his self put you on hold and then looked for the shirt. The employee explained it to us that he didn't want to waste your time because he didn't know where the shirt was or what it was and where to begain looking for it.  Again, you are right he should have used better words to communicate. He admitted to not knowing where to begain looking and was lost on what to say or where to begin.  He also, explained he did search the store upside down to make sure your question was answered.  He explained he answered your question after looking for over 20 minutes.  We glad he did that.  Again, thank you for taking the time to help us understand how we can better serve you. We are 100% sure he as been corrected and will be more sensitive when helping customers with inventor questions.  Let us know if anything like this happens again.
