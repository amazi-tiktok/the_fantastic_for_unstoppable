We had a fire and built a new building. When the carpenter put the new lines in, my husband told him to only hook up cold water. Well that was the problem, these newfangled washers have sensors, and the sensor on the hot side said there was no water coming in at all.  Shawn stayed around until the washer ran through the full cycle to make sure that was the only problem. He didn't say we needed a relay, a new motor, a new anything.  All we needed was the lever switched on on the hot water line.

The repair only came with a 90 day guarantee. So, I called them. It is going to cost me $120 bucks just to get them to come look at it, even though their repair was likely not done correctly, (the unit most likely was not functioning during the 90 day warranty, it just wasn't being used in the winter months). Long story I know.\nI'm also extremely ticked off with GE. I now have a $500 unit that will heat but not cool. None of our local HVAC people will even come look at it. They say a window unit is just a throw away. I don't have $500 to just throw away! CUSTOMER SERVICE IS DEAD, A THING OF THE PAST.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1590974139838, "text": "Blake,\n\nI am sorry that you are dissatisfied with our service. I will advise you that your unit was actually warrantied by the manufacturer not us. The manufacturer provides a 90 day warranty on all repairs any company performs regardless to whom performs the repair. Our warranty is slightly different and had the unit not been covered by the manufacturer things perhaps could have been different or at least there could have been more wiggle room.\n\nI completely understand that you may not have used the unit for cooling in the winter. Unfortunately the manufacturers have no way of knowing when a consumer starts to use their unit and it is not up to us to make that decision. We have a contract with them that dictates what we can and can not do. Every step of the process starting from the first visit up to the final repair are documented. In fact we require prior approval from them before we can even put a single part on a unit. The manufacturer will perform a cost to replacement analysis to determine if it is a repair that they deem is worth pursuing.\n\nI strongly suggest you call them and ask them to take care of the issue. I see them offer concessions on warranties all of the time. Especially in a situation like this. I have no issues with being an advocate for you in this matter. Should the need arise, you can direct them to speak with me personally.\n\nGiven your distance from us, we would have to charge a service call if the manufacturer is unwilling to cover the repair. Alternatively, you could bring the unit to us which would greatly lower the service call rate and you would only be responsible for the diagnostic.\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything else I can do to help you in this regard. Should they choose to send us a work order we would be more than pleased to come and help you. We want you to be happy with your product.\n\nPlease feel free to call and talk with me about this During business hours should you feel that I have left out any pertinent information. My name is Jonathan.\n\nKind regards,\n\nJonathan"}, "gmap_id": "0x88617bdf1752d905:0xda96bf56eb1ff39f"}

I understand your frustration being that you were not home and we wish we could have related it to you directly.\n\nWhen asked, your wife said she could have you replace the venting. Due to this being a warranty claim, installation issues can not be covered by the manufacturer. Had your wife requested, we could have charged you separately and addressed your install problem. She did not request this and stated that you would take care of it.\n\nWe try our hardest to inform our customers as to what their appliance manufacturer will and will not cover and are truly sorry if any of it was lost in communication.  Should you like to discuss this matter further, I implore you to give us a call. Please ask to speak with me \u201cJonathan directly\u201d\n\nThank you for your time and take care."}, "gmap_id": "0x88617bdf1752d905:0xda96bf56eb1ff39f"}

When I called It was an extremely long wait, but after 30 min of waiting and I was finally connected to Natoshia she was very professional and understanding and got me moved up by a day. So finally the man John came and looked at the dryer he said it was the timer and door switch and that he would have to order the parts and it would take a week.\n\nAfter he left they ordered the part and scheduled me for another two weeks out.\nThe day of the appointment arrived and I got an email saying my appointment was canceled because part was on back order and so they rescheduled me for another two weeks out.\nThey had the part in a week before my actual appointment. So on the date of my appointment he called and told me it was miss-boxed so it\u2019s the wrong part and would take another 4weeks to get the part in!!!!!\n\nI stayed calm and called whirlpool and told them what was going on and they shipped the part out to me within 2 weeks.\nHe came yesterday put it on and now he says the dryer needs a new start button and a fan is broken\nSo he couldn\u2019t see all the problems when he first came in NOVEMBER and looked at the dryer?\nSo now I\u2019m stuck waiting AGAIN! But before John left he said he found the parts local in Birmingham and that he would try to get someone to go get them so he can come back the next day and install it.\n\nI called today and got connected with a woman named Tammy and I explained the situation to her and she responded \u201cwell there\u2019s nothing we can do, we\u2019re ordering the part and we\u2019ll schedule you for feb 3. Maybe you\u2019ll get lucky and get it in on time\u201d I told her what John said to me and she said \u201cwell ma\u2019am we have to order them so you\u2019ll have to wait\u201d I replied to her that I can call whirlpool and get the parts sent within 5days that way they can come install it she said \u201cno ma\u2019am and if you get the parts yourself (from the manufacture) that it will void my warranty!\n\nBut That\u2019s what I did with the other part and he came and installed it so I don\u2019t know what the difference is.\n\nI understand COVID has put a strain on a lot of things right now and I\u2019ve been very patient and understanding with this company but it shouldn\u2019t take 5months to fix a dryer!!! And today after the way that lady\u2019s treated me I am furious. I will never use this company again and have called whirlpool and made them very aware of what\u2019s happened and how I was treated they completely agreed it was unacceptable and after they finish this job they will no longer match me with S&S for my repair needs.\n\nIf nothing is done by February 3rd they will schedule me with another company.\n\nThe only reason I give this company two starts is because of Natoshia, she understands how hard and costly it is not having your appliances when having a large family and tried her best to help.\n\nCovid  can\u2019t be an excuse for everything, I suggest you hire some more technicians so customers aren\u2019t waiting two weeks just to get their appliances looked at and I also suggest you hire more professional people to answer your phones.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888df132a70994f:0xdc635790045d61d7"}

Parts are not as readily as we normally can due to industry wide manufacturing delays- we have been working as hard as we can to source parts from any available/approved vendor.

It's been three months, and my patience are wearing thin about ready to get a lawyer. Maytag warranty has already paid for the part and labor, but I have no new part and no one has done any labor. They got over here quick to get money from maytag. They are taking their sweet time to actually do the work. I'm questioning has this Company ever fixed anyones stuff? Idk how they have 3 and a half stars. Must be a bunch of fake reviews on here. How are they still in business? Poorest experience I've ever had. I wouldn't recommend this company. I'll let y'all know if they ever fix my washer. Also I went back three years. This isn't a covid related issue. The company simply sucks.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1609869178170, "text": "Hi Regina, thanks for the review- unfortunately I couldn't find a job under your name- please email me at wmoseley@sandsappliance.com as I would like to look into your parts ordered and see if there is anything I can do to move the process along.\n\nI want to clarify something for anyone reading this. With warranty covered service calls, we don't collect ANY money until the job is complete (with customer pay calls we collect the service call fee on the front end but don't collect parts and labor until the job is complete). In fact, we have to spend money to send a tech out to the house to diagnose (salary for tech and office staff, gas, time, etc.) and we pay for the parts on the front end. So until the job is complete and we are able to bill the warranty provider for it, we are in the hole financially on a job while we are waiting for parts. Manufacturing disruptions and distribution delays are a real thing we're dealing with- Google \"appliance parts shortage\" and there are many articles done by national publications regarding it. We cant just order parts from \"any company\", we have to order genuine parts from the manufacturer or an approved distributor. the parts shortage has had ripple effect throughout our business that has been an incredible challenge to deal with. Calls that would normally take a week from start to finish are now taking months, customers appointments get pushed back again and again because a date we were told a part would be in gets changed at the last minute and we have to call or email the customer to reschedule, more phone traffic to schedule/reschedule/update customers has led to much longer than normal wait times when calling our office, the list is almost endless of how it has affected our business this year.\n\nMs. Lewis, I just want to say that our company doesn't \"suck\". We are a family owned business that has been in operating for 60 years, and we didn't do that by \"scamming\" customers. Everyone that works here has a home and a family and knows what it is like for a major appliance to go out- it stinks and we want it to be fixed for you. We truly do care about our customers and are doing out best to get everyone taken care of but we are absolutely going though a really challenging time right now trying to overcome this obstacle with parts. I really do hate that it has caused you to have a bad experience but I hope that you will keep this in mind and show patience and empathy towards businesses in a time when there are so many small businesses going though challenges that they could have never prepared for and that you might not be aware of."}, "gmap_id": "0x8888df132a70994f:0xdc635790045d61d7"}

We appreciate hearing from our customer whether it's positive or negative- although we much prefer people to have positive experiences. I'm extremely sorry that your experience has been unsatisfactory. We have been in business for 60 years and really take pride in taking care our customers that have allowed us to be here that long. I fully recognize that without you, there is no us. We are going through some very challenging times right now stemming from COVID. Parts are not as readily as we normally can due to industry wide manufacturing delays- we have been working as hard as we can to source parts from any available/approved vendor. We have recently had a few senior techs that had been with us for a while decide that now, with concerns regarding COVID, was the best time for them and their families for them to retire. We also have been following CDC protocol in regards requiring our techs to be tested if they are exposed or show symptoms and quarantining for 2 weeks if positive. This has caused us to need to hire and train new technicians and for our existing techs to unexpectedly miss work for a time ranging anywhere from a couple of days up to 2 weeks depending on if they are positive or not. I admit, this can be frustrating for both us and incredibly inconvenient for the customer but we are working every day to overcome these challenges and operate at the level of quality our customers deserve. I reviewed your service call record and wanted to let you know I would invite you to reach out to me directly via email at wmoseley@sandsapplinace.com if there is anything I can do to help turn your experience around."}, "gmap_id": "0x8888df132a70994f:0xdc635790045d61d7"}

We called him out for a service on on washer and dryer. He looked at the machines and ran the diagnostic tests and stuff, but he also told me all about the small nuances with their functions and how to get the most out of my laundry. Ray was also really friendly and we had a normal conversation while he was working. On top of doing what we called him out to do, he noticed the detergent pods we use for our dishwasher (Cascade Platinum) and how we should only be using those for pots and pans with a lot of food residue. If there isn\u2019t any food residue, the soap will stay on the dishes, and the heat from the dryer will cake it into your cups and plates. And then when you use your dishes later, you are consuming the baked-on soap and basically poisoning yourself. He recommended using the 12x power pods and not rinsing or scrubbing the dishes off beforehand. Overall, Ray was a really nice guy who did more than expected. I learned a lot in the little time he was at my house.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888df132a70994f:0xdc635790045d61d7"}

I read the reviews and thought Oh great-here we go.  I was pleasantly surprised that they called when they were on their way, the customer service people were quite nice and the service guy seemed knowledgeable. He arrived on time, and upon inspection of the stove, found a wire that had shorted out.  The previous week, out of nowhere the stove flipped the breaker and blew sparks all over my kitchen.  He fixed that and left-after ensuring the stove could be turned on without the breaker flipping again.  After he left, I kept noticing that something smelled like it was getting hot so I checked on the stove.  The oven was fine and no smell was coming from it.  However, when I stood in front of the stove to check the oven, I immediately felt heat coming from the warming drawer-even though it was off.  Somehow, either the original problem that the tech didn't find or something he did bypassed the off button on the warming drawer and had it on high all the time with no way to turn it off.  Had I not been home, in all likelihood, we would have had a house fire.  I tried to call him back on his cell and he didn't answer and the company had closed and doesn't have an after hours/emergency number (it was a Saturday when they came and they must close at noon).  DON'T use this company or if you do, make sure you are home the rest of the day in case something like this happens to you.\n\nThe home warranty dispatched a different company after I let the have it and the second guy found the problem-when the stove flipped the breaker and blew sparks everywhere, apparently it fused part of the circuit board so the warming drawer was on-and on high-all the time.

( a new left side door)....  he acknowledged that the door was deformed and instead of ordering a NEW fridge he ordered PARTS to replace..In the meantime he use cardboard and tape to produce a makeshift knob for the ice dispenser to connect..He was very rude and told me do not call him and he would only call me when the part is available I may receive it as a Christmas gift but do not continuously call looking for the part it will only prolong the process. I received the part in LATE FEBRUARY!!!!!  I took off work to schedule the appointment for the repair man to arrive he came on the day of the appointment but he did not have the parts to repair the fridge.  He now has to come back for a third time with the part blaming others because he did not deliver the part.  I rescheduled the appointment for the following week. He came with the part this time. The repair guy acknowledged that he\u2019d never serviced my model fridge..saying it would be the first time for both of us.... he replaced the door..... an \u201ceasy fix\u201d took 2 1/2 hours... and he did not replace the parts back in the fridge as he\u2019d removed from the old..... He could not remember which wire went to what...  he was so short that I had to give him a chair to stand on to service the fridge...  I tried to explain to him that certain wires did not belong in that area but he was a know it all and put the fridge back together in the way that he wanted...  he then told a family member that was at the home that he could keep the old door at my home to use the door for fishing and to scale fish with the door.  I then asked him to take the door with him because I did not need trash in my home and I am not a hoarder....  he rudely ask my family member if he wanted to keep the door my family said it doesn\u2019t matter to him so the repair guy left the door in my home!!!!!! I tried  explaining to the repair guy that the  door open indicator light should go off instantly when the door is closed.  He continued to work on the light and became very frustrated with me because the indicator light stayed on at least three minutes with the door closed completely..... indicating that the door was still open. I tried to FURTHER explain to the repair guy that  The doors were not aligned properly.  He insisted that the indicator light was to stay on two minutes at most and he was pleased after the light went off and he went home.... I was Livid!!!!!!!!!!  LONG STORY SHORT..... the fridge is now broken!!!! The motor hasn\u2019t turned on I since Monday and the fridge is like a Sona. The ice maker has leaked water all over the floor about 2 weeks after the repair.... the opened door light indicator never worked properly after his repair. and no lights come on other than the interior... and the entire fridge QUIT on Monday....... an 8months NEW fridge...... THANKS REPAIR MAN...... for nothing...!!!!!!!... water on the floor and soaked through floor....... 200 dollars in fresh food RUINED!!!!! After an Escalated complaint to whirlpool they agreed to send out a new unit but it will take three weeks to deliver from the manufacturer..........

Their website says you can schedule a service within two days, it took us weeks before someone was able to come out.  I own a WhirlPool front loading washing machine and the bearing is slowly fading and it makes a lot of noise.  It's loud but it works.  Today, I was told someone will show up between 8am and 12pm.  He did not show up until 2pm.  During the next hour, he disassembled the washing machine.  After about an hour, he told me that headquarters needed him to finish his other jobs, so he left my washing machine disassembled and started his next jobs.  About 530pm he called and said he had one more stop and then will be over.  At 645PM he called again saying he will come back but only to put the washing machine back together.  Around this time I was hungry and went to get food where I noticed he did not turn off the water and it had slowly leaked on the floor.  I cleaned this up and turned off the nozzle.  When he finally returned, he did not clean up any of the water on the floor and started to put the washing machine back together.  Once it was back together, he told me it will work just like it did before where it worked but was noisy.  So once he left, I started a load of wet towels, which I used to clean up the floor.  During the first 30 seconds, while I was gone getting a fan to help dry the floor, I heard what can only be described as a waterfall.  The front of the washing machine was leaking water profusely.  I quickly turned it off. Needless to say that I waited weeks for them to come repair a working washing machine for them to flood my floor and make the washing machine unusable.  Not only that I missed a day of work waiting for 12 hours when if they just did not come it would have been all the same and possibly better.  Throughout this experience, I did not feel like a customer getting any type of good treatment.

I have a Bosch Dishwasher that had an issue under manufacture warranty and unfortunately the closest authorized Bosch repair vendors was this one (who has an auxiliary service center in Huntsville), and another company in Birmingham (The Birmingham place seemed very nice on the phone, but I didn't want to wait a couple weeks for a tech to fix it... so I called S&S).\n\nFirst off after calling the other repair place in Birmingham, I found the lady on the phone at S&S very rushy - just wanted name, address, payment method got me off the phone quick... the other repair place took down all my info, make/model, serial #, everything and was going to preorder potential parts so they could do one visit and be done. Dispite my initial impression of calling S&S I went with them anyway since they could come out in 2-3 days vice 1-2 weeks. (when your used to having a dishwasher it's not fun when it's broken...)\n\nSo the first guy comes out, looks at the dishwasher, deems we need a new sump pump, leaves. 2nd visit he comes by installs the new part does a really quick test and deems its fixed and leaves.  My wife goes to run the dishwasher on a full cycle and the draining error code comes up again.\n\nI called the company and was informed someone was coming out the next day to check it. This time we get a guy who didn't even know how to spell Bosch (OK I'm exagerating, but in his words he never seen this kind of dishwasher... had no clue how to work it, fix it, nothing...), treated my wife horribley, he had to call Bosch to walk him through troubleshooting, then proceeds to berate my wife saying it's our plumbing get a plumber the dishwasher is fine, and threatens to charge us if we call for warranty purposes again since it is our plumbing.\n\nJust to give this jerk the benefit of the doubt I took apart the piping under my sink and found no blockages (cleaned it a bit anyway), the sink the dishwasher was hooked to for drainage has never had issues... as far as the intall it was professionally installed by Lowe's and has worked flawless for 11 months so how the heck can it be my plumbing?\n\nAfter fooling with it more myself I found out when the 1st guy replaced our pump it ajared the door that covers the sump pump from the inside of the dishwasher, and some food was caught in there. After I cleaned it and reseated the door correctly it worked fine again...\n\nIn summary my experience: Curt, rushy phone operator; experienced, but in a hurry repair tech (1st and 2nd visit same guy); and lastly rude and unknowledgeable repair tech (3rd visit).\n\nNext time if I had to choose between this place and the Birmingham repair place I'll take my chances with how long it takes the Birmingham folks to come out.... I'd rather wait a week longer and have someone take the time to fix it right then some half fast job, but you know it's all about the $$ the more jobs they cram into a day the more $$ they take in so this is what you get.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888df132a70994f:0xdc635790045d61d7"}

I first had them come look at the microwave a year ago.  A technician came to the house, looked at the microwave for about 5 minutes, didn't touch a thing and said it was the controller that was broken.  He charged his $100 service charge and only after I called would he send me a quote with the part I was supposed to get and the over $600 quote.  I didn't trust him so I never went through with the repair.  After a year of a non-functional microwave, I called again and had a different technician come out.  This guy was way better and actually diagnosed the problem and said it was a completely different part.  same $600.  So this time I had them come fix it.  but when he came out to replace the part (which I later found out could be ordered on the internet for less than $200 and takes all of 5 screws to replace), the part he ordered wasn't functional.  so he frankensteined together part of my old microwave and part of his new part to get it to work.  i guess it works, but when you pay $700 to fix a microwave, I would have liked to get a brand new part.  i tried to call the company to tell them what happened and they did the typical \"someone will call you back\".  which they never did. i only write this now, because I have since had service by an excellent appliance company called \"Appliance Connection\".

He wore shoe protectors to not track anything in the house, and when he had to run out to his truck for a tool, he first removed those protectors and left them outside the front door so as not to get them overly dirty when he was outside.

In looking at this Work Order, we actually quoted the entire heating element assembly, which is a more reliable repair than just replacing the actual element within the assembly. We also use OEM parts straight from the manufacturer, so you know you aren\u2019t getting a cheaper knockoff part. On top of that, we include a 1- year parts and labor warranty on our work. Our competitors only offer warranties anywhere between 30-90 days, max.

I thought that was too high so I paid diagnostic fee of $99 and decided to call around. 1st company I called said \u201cNo way, that\u2019s outrageous\u201d- looked up my dryer and said $263 for service, repair, and part.

In looking at this Work Order, we actually quoted the entire heating element assembly, which is a more reliable repair than just replacing the actual element within the assembly. We also use OEM parts straight from the manufacturer, so you know you aren\u2019t getting a cheaper knockoff part. On top of that, we include a 1- year parts and labor warranty on our work. Our competitors only offer warranties anywhere between 30-90 days, max. Therefore if that assembly were to fail in 10 months, we would cover that completely, whereas the company that quoted you $263, likely would not. I hope this clears up some questions you may have about our business. Thanks for the feedback."}, "gmap_id": "0x88890e063831425b:0xa5df89967a52a34d"}

I called on last Friday to see if/when they had availability to come look at my dryer. The office staff seemed nice, scheduled me the same day, $79.00 diagnostic fee which would be waived if we do the service needed with them. I told the woman scheduling the service that my dryer was giving us the \"FE\" error code, which when I googled it meant it needed a new electronic control board or it could be the fuse which is often mistaken as the electronic board error, both being \"FE\". She assured me that their technician would do a thorough diagnostic check to ensure they ordered the right parts, etc... The technician arrived 20 minutes outside of the 1-3 window, which I was fine with considering it was same day service. He went into the laundry room, pushed some buttons on the dryer, got on his tablet, searched the error code \"FE\", then 5 minutes later told me I needed a new electronic control board and with parts/labor it would be $384.00, jaw dropped. I asked how he knew what was wrong because he had not taken one part off, did not check the electronic board or the fuse, he then raised his voice telling me that there was nothing to check, it was the electronic board, gesturing to the error code. The tech seemed very agitated with me and I explained I was not questioning how he does his job, rather asking how he knew what was wrong because he only googled exactly what I did which said it could be either the board or fuse. At this point my brother who was visiting came to the laundry room after he heard him raising his voice and asked him about the fuse as well and got the same response. The tech then asked if we wanted to proceed with the parts ordered, which I replied no and he said ok it will be $79.00, he spent 10 minutes total in my house including talking to me and did not do a thorough diagnostic check. After he left, my brother who actually works on computers, ordered a new electronic board from Amazon for $36.00, it arrived, he changed it out after watching a YouTube video and shock shock it did not work. He then took the entire dryer apart to get to the fuse (which is why I think the tech did not want to spend time doing it on a Friday), tested the fuse which showed the fuse was out, ordered a new fuse from Amazon for $7.00, arrived today, put it in the dryer with the old electronic board, and magic, it works! Now we are sending back the electronic board to Amazon we ordered since it was not the electronic board and we spent $7.00 vs $384.00 on this repair. Very disappointed that I spent $79.00 for a tech to shout at me and not do any actual checks or work.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890e063831425b:0xa5df89967a52a34d"}

Witten(service tech) was the most personable, professional, knowledgeable technician I have ever worked with! He arrived to my parents door less than 2 hours after contacting Mr. Appliance when another company could not make the appointment that had been set up a week in advance! Most repairs are same day or next day. No charge for service call.  Repair quote was given before repair. Competitive, reasonable pricing. He was able to diagnose and fix the repair in less than 15 minutes! Called Mr. Appliance at 8:30am and my parent's Kennmore icemaker was working by 10:45am. One year warranty on labor and parts. They stand behind their work. Very impressed! I will be calling Mr. Appliance Over the Mountain for all of my family's future appliance repair needs. You will not be disappointed! I did not receive any compensation or discount for my review. Honest, dependable company that cares about their customers and the service they provide. Thank you Witten and Mr. Appliance for taking such great care of our appliance repair needs! -Tim & Nancy Layfield from Pinson, Alabama", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890e063831425b:0xa5df89967a52a34d"}
