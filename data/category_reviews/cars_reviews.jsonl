I bought a car for my daughter recently and could not obtain insurance from my carrier  because of a report they received from this company. They claim that an auction employee reported \"frame damage\" back in 2008, yet no such damage was ever reported to the owner's insurance nor was it noted on the title. CARMAX and several other reporting agencies didn't have a record of the damage either. When I questioned Red Mountain Customer Service I was told that they are under no obligation to share their reports with other agencies, but that she would follow up with me. The next day I received this email response: \"The Auction that sold your daughter\u2019s car in 2008 reports that the damage was to the left apron which was noted as severe damage. I have attached a copy of the AutoCheck vehicle history for your use.\"  The report states \"Frame Damage\", not \"Apron Damage\". Huge difference. So... they reserve the right to \"report\" whatever they want (accurate or not), thus creating issues like I now have with the car, while withholding information from other reporting agencies that if accurate, could be a potential safety issue to the consumer. The rep I spoke with at this company was very friendly, but evasive when I pushed her about the shady reporting. This is a very shady company.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bd699b1ae93:0xbbee418d3e9160f4"}

He reminds me of a used car salesman. He sold us junk policies and when it came time to really need your insurance professional he would not help us! He would always call us if our policy was coming up or to ask for a check...\n\nWe had 7 rental properties insured with Grey. We have been systematically consolidating our properties and our last property was broken into while it was in the process of being sold. The criminals broke in, stole copper fitting from the attic and caused a leak throughout the house. The home is in terrible shape now but thank GOD we have insurance. Well not really... Grey from the get go sounded like they were never going to honor this claim. Every question was some sort of angle towards not having to pay out or to help us with this mess. There was some back and forth with \u201cwe can\u2019t pay this because it was vandalism or some other sort of incident\u201d  Grey ultimately settled on the 60 day vacancy clause as his reason for not paying out on the claim, stating that he just couldn\u2019t help us. Maybe that is true and maybe that will help him sleep better however my contention is that he is supposed to be a professional and help guid his clients in order to avoid situations just like this. This is exactly what you pay your insurance agent. I\u2019m not sure why I paid Grey for so many years... He was never helpful. Never was he a trusted servant, mentor or guid in our rental journey.\n\nI feel so cheated I can barely type this message but I do want everyone to know to never use this individual or this firm. It is worth a few more dollars each month for professionalism and peace of mind.\n\nI am also just glad my wife is not writing this. It would be much worse. She is the one who dealt with him on a regular basis and she NEVER liked the guy. Used car salesman would be too kind and an insult to those who sell used cars.
