I LOVE Advenir at Station 121 and I am only leaving because I will be relocating to another state. Some of these reviews are laughable.

You also can\u2019t judge an apartment community because of some bad reviews.

The pool was always clean, the grounds were well taken care of, the 3 amazingly wonderful ladies in the office became my family ( Tara,Mandy and Ellen). They always took the time to get to know me and what was going on in my life, and they genuinely love me. Leaving them will be very hard because it was such a great place.I never had any trouble with break-ins (which will happen in ANY downtown area if you don't park behind the security gate!).As for others saying that it was noisy, when you live in an apartment you can't expect it to be silent all the time, but I can say that I  never had any trouble with an overabundance of noise at all. 90% of anything I ever heard was normal city noise, but if you want to live in a silent environment, buy a house in the woods.

Garage parking is plentiful though not assigned, and if you get home after 6pm or so you may not get to park on your floor, which isn't a big deal as there are multiple stairwells and elevators around. The property just installed a locker system to handle package deliveries that you can access with a code 24/7, which is convenient. Also trash chutes on each floor are nice. Front desk staff are all very friendly and know your name. What I've been most impressed with so far is the maintenance staff.

The on-site gym, common room, and pool seem nice, but I have not spent any time in them.

I bumped into another resident that I knew a few days later, and turns out his brother had a car there that had a window completely shattered the weekend before my car was stolen.

Pros include: a secure parking deck,  walking distance to Publix,  UAB (campus and health system),  bars and restaurants,  Region's Field,  Railroad Park,  and tons of other stuff too.  You can work out at Orange Theory, grab a pizza and pint from Pies and Pints, and then walk upstairs without going more than a block.  UAB Urgent Care right below the apartment is a huge plus too.\n\nWe (luckily) haven't had to call maintenance too much, but they have been prompt during each visit. Usually by the end of the day.  Office staff has always been friendly and helpful.  You can get as much free coffee from the office as you want too. (Big plus for me)  Our unit is the perfect size for a new married couple downtown.  Floors look nice, kitchen is updated, and the unit is well insulated.

The grounds are generally well-kept and very secure. An HID key fob is required for entrance into any exterior door to the building. I have had zero issue with noise in the property. I have not witnessed any crime of any kind within the property. I live on the 4th floor of the west side of the building facing 20th street, and street noise is a problem - mostly it's just the sirens from ambulances headed to the hospital. This, of course, is nothing the property or staff have any control over, just a note for those considering living here and choosing a unit. Garage parking is plentiful though not assigned, and if you get home after 6pm or so you may not get to park on your floor, which isn't a big deal as there are multiple stairwells and elevators around. The property just installed a locker system to handle package deliveries that you can access with a code 24/7, which is convenient. Also trash chutes on each floor are nice. Front desk staff are all very friendly and know your name. What I've been most impressed with so far is the maintenance staff. I have put in four or five requests for maintenance to my unit, and they all were handled the next business day. The on-site gym, common room, and pool seem nice, but I have not spent any time in them.

I nor my daughter was there to let them in and the only people that authorized the charge and transaction was Creekside and Creekside refused to call Spire and correct the problem by billing them or the owner of the condo. Also, the small print indicating they could and did switch the unit that we wanted is a fact and an issue that future tenants need to understand. It makes you realize that they could and did show a nice unit in the style, location, and price and switch you to whatever they want.

Some of it is good, some of it is bad, some of it could go either way depending on what you want out of a place to live, and some of it is just unavoidable as it is targeted to college students.\n\nSome aspects of the property are really nice. The clubhouse is pretty nice (though the weight room is a joke; I don't know why any Auburn student would use it instead of the top notch campus facility). The common areas are generally well-maintained. I say generally because while the landscaping is kept up, the gates are not. I've been trying to get my name added to the call box for three years and it still hasn't happened, yet I know residents that moved out years ago still in the list.  The gates are frequently broken and they keep nobody out. If someone wants to get in, they will get in. They will simply wait for someone to open the gate and go in after them. If you are going to be a \"gated community\" then be a gated community. In my opinion, Creekside should just get rid of the gates because they really don't accomplish anything except annoy the residents.\n\nCreekside does not tow. This could be good or bad depending on your point of view. I never had an issue with parking. On busy football weekends, perhaps I'd be 10-12 spots away from my front door but that was about the extent of it. However, other parts of the complex may not have quite as abundant parking so that could be an issue. I'm really not sure. It was nice to not have to deal with visitor passes, etc. but it would be very frustrating if there wasn't enough parking near your home.\n\nCreekside does not enforce many of its own rules. The one that really annoys me is the pool. It is supposed to be limited to residents and residents are allowed two guests I believe. What it ends up being is tons of people who might know one person in Creekside... or in some cases just show up without knowing anyone. I pay good money to live in a place like this and don't feel like my money should be going to clean up after non-residents who break chairs, leave beer cans and bottles strewn about, etc. Some would say I'm a party pooper... but I like to think of it as being irritated by trespassing. People (many times non-residents) bring beer bottles and dogs to the pool routinely... both are supposed to be fineable offenses... but I've never seen one handed out.\n\nMaintenance is a mixed bag, but mainly poor. To get a broken door repaired, it took about a dozen phone calls over a two month period. Simply absurd. I also reported a broken toilet two different times. Once, it was repaired promptly. The other time... I was told they'd be out there \"in the next couple of days\" and nobody ever came. After about a week, I fixed the toilet myself. Also, I should point out that *OWNERS* are occasionally treated as second-class citizens by the on-site management. Essentially, the homeowner's dues should get me the same rights as the renter's... but when I file a maintenance issue that is supposed to be covered by the HOA dues, they handle all renters first... I guess to make sure they get people to resign because they know the homeowner is unlikely to sell because of a small issue like this. Or, in the vast majority of cases, it isn't the actual homeowner who lives in the house; It is often the parent of one of the residents who probably never even hears about the issue.\n\nThe last issue I have is with the TV/Internet Service. It has been nothing short of awful the entire time I've lived here. In 2015, I don't think people can really appreciate just how bad I have had it and what a negative it is. The internet is slow, often less than 1 megabit/second so forget about streaming Netflix during peak hours; You'll be lucky if you can just get a YouTube video to play in 240p, nevermind HD.\n\nAll in all, it is a decent place to live. You could definitely do a lot worse. I think I'd rather pay for a location closer to campus rather than the resort style amenities, but that is personal preference.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1586452516041, "text": "Thank you for the valuable information"}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2c3710357e3:0xc8afc14b7cb32308"}

Oftentimes people who come to the pool don\u2019t even know anyone in the complex (I have no idea how they get in). Adding to their being unwelcome is the fact that they, along with actual residents, throw empty beer cans and cigarettes into the pool, making it disgusting and completely unable to be used.\n\nCreekside also advertises itself as a gated community. Unlike other gated complexes, however, Creekside uses a barcode scan system, which is usually broken. Thus the gates are open 24 hours a day, including weekends. If the gates are closed and the scanner is broken, there is no code to open the gates, which led to three broken gates because of cars driving through them in the year that I lived there. Why they chose a system with no backup way to get in is beyond me.\n\nCreekside is a magnet for irresponsible students who love to party loudly. I did not understand how there could be such a high concentration of people with such habits, but then I discovered that much of Creekside\u2019s advertising involves half of drink specials for residents and other alcoholic incitements. There were obnoxiously loud parties that could be heard two rows of houses over and up the street nearly every weekend and even on weekdays. These parties were rampant with underage drinking and lasted until four a.m. or later. The courtesy officer never picks up his phone, so the police usually come. This is an inconvenience and an annoyance for the officers, especially since Creekside hired someone who is supposedly responsible for taking care of such noise disturbances.\n\nThe Internet is abysmal, and it is nearly impossible to get someone to come out and fix it. Our Internet didn\u2019t work for three months, and the management refused to give us a refund on the portion of our rent that went toward cable and Internet.  They also refused to let us get our own router.\n\nManagement threatens to fine its residents constantly, but never follows up; therefore, what looks like a beautiful complex from outside the gates is full of porches that are littered with beer cans, cigarettes, trash, and beer pong tables. Any complaints about the state of the porches will go unnoticed.\n\nAll in all, Creekside is a place for rich kids whose parents don\u2019t care if they drink excessively underage and blow off classes in the morning due to a midweek party.

I called the number and I was directed the call center and made an appointment. My friend and I sat outside for 45 minutes before someone came back. When Fredricka returned to the office, she was off the rip rude. I was washing my hands at the sink and I guess that is frowned upon at the Haven apartment complex.\nWhen my friend was explaining the purpose of her visit, Ms. Fredricka was not comprehending anything she was saying. Before viewing the apartments, I gave a suggestion to Ms. Fredricka that she should turn the sign around so people can know she is not in the office at the moment. She explained to me that she didn\u2019t turn it around because she was just getting her lunch. Although she was just getting food and not handling business pertaining to the apartments, she should have still turned the sign around so others can know that she is not in the office.\nWe went and viewed the renovated version of the Madison and it was beautiful. One thing that I might add is that the description of the \u201cpatio\u201d should be worded and explained as a balcony because that\u2019s exactly what it is. The bedrooms in this particular unit is not big enough for the price of rent.  Upon our return to the office to view the other unit, there were people standing outside because once again, the sign was not turned around to inform them that she was on a tour. We went to view the classic version of the Hamilton and how Ms. Fredricka explained this unit is not how I envisioned it. This apartment has cream counter tops and appliances and it is not appealing to the eye at all. The cream appliances and grey cabinets make the apartment look real country. The fridge had rust on the side and I asked Ms. Fredricka if they would replace or paint over this rust stain on the refrigerator should my friend move into this unit. Maybe she did not see nor comprehend what I was saying because she said that this apartment comes with cream countertops and appliances. That\u2019s clearly not what I was asking her. I asked the question again and she seemed perplexed as if I was asking if she personally would replace the refrigerator. When she finally comprehended what I was saying, she explained that no one has ever asked that question but she would have to check into that and see. This whole experience, completely turned my friend and I off from ever thinking about renting apartments from here. I gave it two stars because the first unit we viewed and the property itself is very beautiful.

The place was absolutely beautiful, and the beach view is awesome if your condo is facing the beach. However, when we checked in they only gave us two parking passes for the parking lot, when we should have gotten three. You get one parking pass per bedroom in your condo. That part wasn't bad. What discouraged me the most about this condo was several of my family members were sitting outside on the balcony one night, and I was in the living room. I heard a knock at the door, and the security guard informed me that we had received a noise complaint. Note, I did not hear them talking, and I was less than 20 feet away from them inside. We give that the benefit of the doubt, the next situation was too much. We were enjoying a barbecue with the family listening to clean country music, at 7PM. It was still daylight outside. The security guard again told us that we were being too loud. This frustrated the group due to the time of day. Lastly we observed the owner of the place who actually lives there walking in the parking lot pulling on car doors. Even pulling on one of the family members that was staying with us car door. The security guard informed us that it was the property owner calling in all of the complaints, and eve threatened the security guards job.

We checked in and we all bought parking passes and everything they required. Got to the room and boom right off the bat the pullout bed was completely broken, the ice make was making loud sounds and did not produce one ice cube, the screen door was hanging by a tread about to fall off the balcony. I messaged them about theses things the day we got here and did not get a reply!\n\nWell things got worse. We had an extra girl coming and she got here a few nights after our first nights stay. She arrived at 1 in the morning the guard waved her through so she parked and slept until they had to be at a photo shoot early in the morning at sea side (3 hours away) well before she got back here car had a boot on it and two tickets. No warnings just two tickets and a boot. Less then 20 hours and boom they hit her with this and a $250 fine. We talked to the mannager the next day and he was rude and could careless. Had the guard been doing his job and actually checked to see if she had a parking pass non of this would of happened!\n\nThis entire say was a big bust and couldn\u2019t of gotten any worse!\n\nFind a place that wants you to stay there and that will treat you with respect and not be rude and ruthless about the parking situation I mean I understand why they have to be strict but right now with COVID-19 going on there\u2019s tones of empty parking spots and they were not hurting on parking spots!\n\nVery dissatisfied will not recommend this to anyone.

I can barely even watch tv on my Xbox since they switched the network. I have called white sky and nothing helps. They installed the wifi in a terrible place so I can\u2019t even connect a router to extend the signal. White sky person came and recommended that I run a cord from the kitchen to the other side of my apartment. Never had these issues when we had Xfinity and it was much nicer. The apartment is overpriced for students not to even have good wifi and there aren\u2019t any Ethernet ports to hardwire internet. It is not a hardware issue. My TVs and Xbox are brand new and I had NO issues with xfinity for the 2 years we used them. As you can see in my pictures sometimes the connection drops just minutes between.\n\nUPDATE: The owner of my condo is now trying to move us out. The office has sent people up here AGAIN to work on the WiFi and they said the issue was not the WiFi but my usage. However, when I had all devices off as they suggested, other than the one I am using, and I\u2019m still unable to work on school or remotely effectively.

Newsflash folks: if your bank isn't in town it's really really hard to find a way to pay rent, which is why the direct pay option was heavily used. Lots of maintenance problems too: the air filter in the apartment I stayed at probably hadn't been changed since the place was built because it was completely clogged. First floor apartments have bugs too. The kitchen counters are warped and starting to break, the carpets are nasty, and the cracked window in the bedroom still hasn't gotten fixed either.

We waited just to move into a dirty apartment. Nothing was prepared for us. The mailbox key was the wrong key and the mailbox was broken so we couldn\u2019t get our mail, and of course we were waiting on something important to be delivered. We didn\u2019t have a gate opener so we had to use a code that worked half the time. When I finally received a gate opener it didn\u2019t work because they didn\u2019t activate it. The gate is trash and stopped working. Then our laundry room was flooding b\\c of the air conditioning. We had to call them 3 times before they actually fixed it, just for it to happen again months later. We paid rent EVERY month ON TIME but they would put all the rent either on my account or my room mate\u2019s account so we would get eviction notices. This has happened at least 6 out of the 9 months we have lived here. Then they decide they want to take up the carpet and replace it with something else while we\u2019re still living here!! They kept changing the date so the day ends up being on a week where I have worked three 16-hour days plus I have back issues and need an operation so I\u2019m having to try and move all my stuff out of my room and closet so they can do something they could\u2019ve done after we leave this place!! Which just made my pain worst. For a month or two they had no groundskeeper so there was dog feces all over the property!! Everywhere you stepped you were likely to step in it. The tub is made of horrible material and is terribly hard to clean. The faucet in the bathroom has been leaking since I moved in. The walls are thin and you can hear the people upstairs. The dryer is trash and you have to dry your cloths twice just to get them dry. There\u2019s no button for the garbage disposal. This place is trash for the cost!!

My overall experience here was above average and I did enjoy living at Vie at University Downs, but it was a roller coaster. The staff is AWESOME. Nothing else to say there, they are all really good people and willing to help. I moved in fast and it was very easy, especially from a gentleman named Rulondo who helped me numerous times during my residency. Also, I want to emphasize how impressed I was with the security in the complex. There are numerous guards roaming and keeping watch, I felt very safe here.\n\nIn the units, the floor layouts are nice and the rooms are pretty spacious, the living/dining room especially.\n\nI did however, have a few things I\u2019d like to share. The first negative experience I had was after I was all moved in, I realized my apartment\u2019s living room and dining room was unfurnished. I was informed that when the new ownership took over earlier in 2018, they furnished every unit with furniture. The one I lived in however, had a resident who had been in there prior to the change in management and had personal furniture already in his room. They told him that In order to get the living room stuff: couch, chair, television, tv stand, dining room table, chairs (basically everything one would need in a living space), that he must also accept the bedroom furniture. This meant he had to move all of his stuff out of there. Since he already had everything he needed, he declined.\nIronically, the other two bedroom units were furnished but the living room was still left empty. I tried numerous times to get furniture in this apartment but it felt like the staff really didn\u2019t care about doing this and just didn\u2019t want to deal with it. I was told numerous times that because we had already \u201copted out\u201d of receiving furniture months ago, there was \u201cnothing they could do.\u201d Also, I know for a fact there was a plethora of extra furniture available. I let it go because I only signed a short term lease but to me this was unacceptable and simply just laziness on the management\u2019s part.\n\nIn October, the whole complex underwent a network change to a company called Single digits. In summation, we were without internet connection for about two weeks and even after everything was \u201cfixed\u201d I still experienced issues. I discussed this with the staff and I can vouch for them that they did everything they could to get it up and running as fast as possible. However, I don\u2019t know if they made the correct decision going with this company.\n\nSomething minor, but I felt necessary to be addressed is there are a lot of bugs. I am aware this was a problem a long time ago and the staff has previously addressed this, but I still had numerous experiences. Ant infestations: One in my bedroom from the trashcan and one in the kitchen pantry. This was fixed easily by a few and traps but still gross and took a while to clean up the dead ants. I am not sure if the property had been treated for bugs but mine definitely wasn\u2019t, not to mention that there were roaches in the kitchen, often.\n\nAfter seeing what other apartment complex\u2019s are like. Yes, I had a few complaints, but I want to make sure the management can see these because feedback is a great way to improve. Vie at University Downs does have a lot to offer and it was a nice place to live. With a few fixes and changes, this place has the potential to be a top notch choice for living in Tuscaloosa, but changes definitely need to be made. They are upgrading the clubhouse and I assume it will be very nice.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1583962215841, "text": "Thank you so much for your useful insights.

I moved in late September to a 3 bedroom unit. However my garbage disposal has constantly went out every month, my hot water heater leaks onto the floor in the washing room and the dryer has to be rigged to keep running and this is just the beginning. I was moved into a unit that was already occupied in which it states on our move in lease if you moved in during the month of august you have 72 hours to get the lights in your name. So I think my apartment already has a power account attached to it that I just have to pay on. I gave something one month however in the month of December my power has been turned off due to it not being in someone's name. I was never notified of ANY of this and to make matters worse neither one of the two people I live with will reply to my text messages nor my calls. I'm just ready for my lease end honestly. If you already have roommates maybe it's not that bad but this is a very unacceptable situation. And to make matters worse the best option the leasing office could give me was to pay the start up fees and bill for Alabama power and bring in the bill and they will charge it to my roommates accounts. First off I shouldn't have to handle this myself, second off why would I want to continue staying in a unit where I can't get a answer from either one on A matter as serious as this. I'm the one without power right now while both of them are gone and nobody is helping me fix this", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1481646356614, "text": "Hey Tony,\n\nWe are so sorry that you are having problems with your power.

I understand there is a large amount of residents that occupy this complex, but in-turn, office workers and management should be working urgently to process maintenance requests and to solve other issues to keep PAYING CUSTOMERS satisfied with their living space. This has not been our experience while living here. My sister and I have lived with UD for almost 6 months and requests we put in those 6 months ago have still not been taken care of. Don\u2019t bother calling the office because they probably won\u2019t answer. And they have neglected returning promised phone calls on multiple occasions. Office is known to close earlier than the hours listed on their door/website which is inconvenient for those of us who work, or interested people traveling from out of town. It is very unfortunate because we love the property, but until management changes I believe these issues will remain the same. If things do not change soon, I foresee this complex going downhill fast in cleanliness, safety, and appeal to possible leasees.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1552521743818, "text": "Bree,\n\nThank you for your feedback.

I went on about thirty different tours of different complexes in Tuscaloosa to view one bedroom apartments as this was my only option due to the issues I had leading me to needing a place. To say the least a majority of the apartment options in this town are sketch especially when its last minute last chance in May. However when I came to the downs, Bronson took me and my mom and sister on a tour and it was a great experience. I wanted to see the type of unit I would actually be living in as opposed to just a model unit and they understood my concerns so they made it happen. One of the other employees, Jade, let me go into her apartment and see what it was like since that would be the layout I would ultimately end up with, without hesitation or second thought. I ended up signing for this current year and have been here since August. I have nothing but great things to say about the office staff especially Andrew who truly makes anyone's day each time you see him. Being so far away from family no matter what year you are in is always hard but the staff always is so welcoming and caring. When you read other reviews they talk about disasters of maintenance and such where their needs aren't attended to but I have not seen where that's an issue. Like normal there are always going to be household things that need fixing no matter where you live, its just a part of life and being a tenant. I have had my fair share of unwanted critters (yikes its ok I am alive still) or leaks/minor breaks but no matter what the office always responded fast and urgent for me. People fail to forget that its usually just one person, Ryan, doing all the repairs so they need to cut him some slack and be understanding that the issue will be addressed quickly but maybe not immediately. As far as safety goes, I feel secure at the apartment and the one incident where I was nervous about someone near my apartment I called the office and legitimately a golf cart, and I am talking like one of those extended ones, full of staff came zooming in and investigated and checked in on me to make sure I was okay, including Taylor Duncan the leasing manager too. I find that the staff really makes the living experience worth while at apartment complexes which is why I gave 5 stars overall. I had a few hiccups here and there with maintenance or billing like I mentioned but those issues were resolved to a level of satisfaction which is the part that matters most. Now that this novel of a review is over have a great day and if you are in a predicament where you need not just a house but a home stop on over here at UD!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1518124468038, "text": "Thank you Tiffani Greene for sharing your fantastic experience with us.

When I first began paperwork with them they were undergoing renovations, which at the time was exciting to see. When I came in a couple weeks later to finish my paperwork they had lost it! Papers that had my entire identity plastered all over them as well as my co-signers (parents) info! This happened TWO more times. When everything was finally taken care of I had signed during an incentive to get a $600 dollar gift card or use it as credit towards my first months rent, so being the poor college student that I am I put it towards my rent, well when it came time to pay first months rent they told me I couldn't use that incentive because I was in a privately owned unit. Why would you assign a resident who signed during an incentive special, a condo that's privately owned therefore cancelling out that incentive?\n\nIt's just one inconvenience after another with these guys. Probably because they can't get a property management company to stick around long enough for things to flow smoothly. University Downs has gone through three ownerships since I've been involved with them. The staff is almost entirely undertrained or under-qualified to be handling the responsibilities they're supposed to take care of with ease. Nearly every question is answered with \"I'll have to check with my manger when they get back\". Which then leads to nothing because the manager is never around.\n\nAlso if you're planning to live on the condo side rather than the apartment side then please know that all those inclusions they promise like wifi/cable or Google Chromecast are NOT included. They didn't share that until after we had signed or lease.\n\nTruly an awful experience. Please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for housing. Aside from the awful management the condos are higher quality builds than most of the newer places, however be prepared to do all of the move-in cleaning yourself, I've never seen such a gross move-in room.

Most importantly, the management staff (not necessarily the office staff) has been unhelpful, incompetent, and downright rude.\nFirst, even though my name was on the lease (I am looking at a copy right now), my name was NEVER put into their system, so every time I called they couldn\u2019t speak with me (or pull up my lease apparently). Furthermore, they never put any of the emails on my lease into their system. When my roommate wrote a check for $785 instead of $795 on accident, we were never notified of the \u201clate payment\u201d either by phone or email \u2013 even though they had both. So they after a few months that $10 charge grew into hundreds. They then had the audacity to place an eviction notice on my door. So they can walk to my apartment to threaten eviction but they can\u2019t notify me of a $10 dollar payment??? Needless to say I paid the $10 dollars I owed them, but not a penny more! And I wished it ended there\u2026\nWhen I moved to a different city over the summer (and paid two rents because I didn\u2019t want to sublease!) they actually moved another person into my apartment!!!! I found out about this when I went back to my apartment on checkout day (to turn in my key) and there was someone else living in there with all their stuff! I have had two UD employees acknowledge this, but they don\u2019t see a problem with it at all \u2013 even though I was still paying rent!\nFinally, after months of phone calls, emails, and weeks on end of no response, I still have not received my security deposit back. They have acknowledge \u2013 finally \u2013 that they owe me the security deposit, but now they said they \u201cmailed the check.\u201d That was over three weeks ago. This is on the point of ridiculous. The managers at the office do not care. They are rude and completely unprofessional. I have friends who have been through similar experiences at UD! And you should understand. I took pride in my apartment. It was always clean inside and out, and well taken care of.\nI could go on for another page or two\u2026\nI am going back to Tuscaloosa in a few years, and they could not PAY ME to live there.\nFinally, apparently the complex is being purchased by a new company in 2016. Don\u2019t live there!!! They are keeping the same rude and unprofessional managers \u2013 so nothing will change. In fact, it will probably get worse.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a82f5f021da3:0x9a4a2ef42a843052"}

The appliances all do not work correctly. Staff/maintenance comes in whenever (literally they will knock and, from the back bedroom, not give us enough time to put pants on and go open the door before they are already letting themselves in) to fix or change things without even telling residents. They have just come in our place numerous times this year with numerous excuses. They tell you they would give residents a heads up if they have to come in, but that is not true. One day while we had multiple friends over, they came in and said they had to paint all our walls. Needless to say, that was the final straw and we told them they could not paint that day randomly without telling us, while we had people over. We live on the second story and one morning we were woken up at 8 am bc some workers had climbed up the back balconies and were on our back porch working, of course without telling us. I have never lived somewhere where maintenance just comes in without warning so many times in a year. Our friends have a joke going on about hanging at our apartment because maintenance will probably be joining us. Also, one day when they randomly came, we had an empty cat litter box. No cat, not cat toys/food, not even cat litter, just the empty box, and then they tried to charge us $500 by saying we had a pet and kept coming by randomly to catch a nonexistent cat in our place. Even then, $500 seemed like much for a cat. Another thing, along with not telling any residents about maintenance coming to do anything in residents places, they have also decided to change the internet connection and password without telling residents. We went almost a week, a school week without internet is very difficult, thinking the internet had gone out without being fixed. We finally called and they told us it had been changed. We told them we were not happy they would do that without telling us, therefore making us go without. The next day, after we had gone the week without internet and then resolved the issue, they came by and put a paper in our door telling us they changed the internet, so at least our complaining did something, even if it was a week too late.\nOverall, you will not have the privacy you want in your apartment and do not count on the staff/maintenance to do great jobs. If you can get pass that, the pools and community itself is not bad, just needs better people running it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a82f5f021da3:0x9a4a2ef42a843052"}

The apartment itself was nice, despite the large bloodstain upon the guest bedroom duvet cover upon arrival, which the owner later accused us of causing. . The residents of the complex did not hold back in unleashing their full \"Karen\", and we were falsely accused numerous times by residents of the complex for \"infractions\", such as not cleaning up after our dogs- which was false and not supported by any evidence (we are very conscious of the need to pick up after our pets!!) This, along with a slew of other false accusations, resulted in nightly visits from security coming to our apartment to scold my parents (who are in their mid-60s) and I as if we were school children, putting a major damper on our evenings.  Whereas the security guards themselves were generally friendly, we felt as if we were unwelcome and being \u201cwatched\u201d. We were also accused of not having \u201cregistered\u201d one of the dogs, again untrue as they eventually admitted.\n\nLastly, and this may not be as important for some people, but the Wi-Fi network that is offered to guests is not secured. For people who work remotely with sensitive data, this did not provide an accommodating environment. Hours after we left the Phoenix, I realized that my Amazon account had been hacked- I am inclined to believe that this was a result of being forced to access an unsecured network.\n\nAfter our departure the owner contacted us to complain about the apartment. Her claim was that our dirty sheets were not clean enough. Yes, you read that correctly. She also complained about other minor matters that were well within the bounds of normal everyday use. Next time we will make sure to take photos on departure.\n\nAs a residence that claims to be \"dog friendly\" it certainly is not in our opinion a welcoming place for larger dogs (over 40 pounds). We were constantly harassed and accused of things which we could prove we were not responsible for. Thankfully we were able to get away to the beach for a couple of days and enjoy the beautiful Orange Beach scenery and weather. If you are looking for a fun, relaxing and dog-friendly environment, this is not the place for you!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a079383d8dafb:0x2b9750baf75e249e"}

I found out at the end of the week that the part had been ordered. It would have been nice if they could have left some tool for me to use to turn the dryer on and to leave a note explaining they were sorry and the part had been ordered. The air conditioner began leaking all over the floor. We called and the maintenance came to fix it. Hopefully for the next guest it will remain fixed. The owners need to update the tv. We rarely could get the remote to work. I had to call maintenance and they came several hours later saying it was fixed. I still had trouble with it.  It would be cheaper for them to get a smart tv and not even use cable. I like to be able to relax with the shows I watch and I couldn\u2019t  do that. Overall it was a good trip for us.

Jerry took the time out of his schedule to immediately make sure that we were taken care of and he came right away and ensured all the tv's were on and hooked up properly.

Adults were throwing empty beer cans from the lazy river into the kiddie pool area and slinging beer everywhere, cussing, flipping off the security guard, Quinton, who was doing his best, blocking the lazy river, and handing out shots in the lazy river. Tons of children and families were there, but no respect was given to their needs at all. My child felt very uncomfortable in the environment and hated having to go to the part of the lazy river where the \"drunk adults\" we're congregated.\n\nAt no time did the pool cleaning lady or the homeowners association lady come to stop any of that. Other moms were having to take their children to the small indoor pool to get away from the \"GD\" word. We will NEVER vacation here again. If you are looking to book here because of the slide and lazy river which children should be able to use, go somewhere else. This is NOT an appropriate environment for children or relaxation.

It's a really nice apartment complex and relatively cheap compared to apartments closer to downtown. Unless being 10 minutes away from everything really bothers you, the distance is not a problem at all. Tuscaloosa is just not that big to make it an issue. The management is pretty solid--as long as you're dealing with an actual manager and not one of the assistants. Pool area is really nice and peaceful. High ceilings, granite countertops, hardwood floors, and a sizeable outdoor patio. It's pretty much checks all the boxes for your \"House Hunter\" list. It's also one and a half minutes from two grocery stores, pharmacies, and some fast restaurants. It makes it very convenient on one of those days where you need to get dinner quickly.\n\nThe girl who complained about getting the boot on her car is right--they will boot cars usually two or three times a year. However, they only boot cars that don't have the \"Traditions\" parking tag. So her dumb ass probably forgot to put it on there. It happened to my roommate around six months have he moved in with me. He never put the tag on until he got booted. But you know what? That's what happens when you make a mistake like that. It sucked for him and me (I had to give him a ride), but in the end he understood. He kept his tag on from that day forward.\n\nIt's a really nice apartment complex. It doesn't get too wild, but people generally are tolerant of fun. Great balance for Tuscaloosa. I've never had a worry about my safety while I've been here.

Recently, I called to get it set up and the customer service rep had a horrible attitude and said that there is a 65 dollar service connection fee due upfront BEFORE they come out to set up service. I was told that this is mandatory although this unit came with cable and internet and I\u2019m being charged 75 dollars monthly for it. Pathetic.\n\nI constantly have problems with my toilet, there\u2019s mildew in the hall and bathroom and my air constantly goes in and out. I\u2019d rather turn a fan on. DO NOT BRING YOUR BUSINESS HERE.\n\nThe staff seemed nice and friendly and that\u2019s what will draw you in. Response time to application was swift. Which is what impressed me. But stay away. Go somewhere else. I do not intend to renew my lease. I will be leaving the first chance I get. I am strongly considering just paying to end my lease just so I can go somewhere else. If I am going to pay 850-900+ a month for an older 2 bedroom 1 bathroom unit then I expect better service. For there not to be trash everywhere and for the necessities in my unit to work properly and to know exactly what I am going to be paying for upfront.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889226e970e81e5:0xee87e48bb963c749"}

We were literally footsteps from the beach from where we had our assigned parking spot. Quite honestly that is the most important aspect when you go to the beach. The views were great and the neighbors all respectable.  This wasn't a party condo.\n\nOne thing to understand though, is that the pool is extremely small which was a bummer. The beach front condos don't actually have a private balcony, as it is a wrap around balcony where anyone can come up to your condo (though we never once saw anyone do that).  The showers to rinse off from the beach leave a lot to be desired. Is that a big deal? I don't know but it was annoying. There are no elevators here, so be warned of that.\n\nFinally, it may have been since there was a recent tropical storm but the sand on the parking lot was ridiculous that even after showering off the sand, you still seemed to carry a mound into the condo.\n\nI would highly consider going back to this condo.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a1b7ac12b073f:0x9502e44959a4f43"}

Sheets and towels were on the floor beds were stripped, the counter was dirty and the bathroom ( which I am a freak about) was not clean . So we call her and she is like , its 3:35 check in is at 4. The girl with us says Lady it doesn't matter that is not enough time to wash all these sheets and towels and clean a 2 bedroom condo.  She says well y'all go eat and I will send you a maid and a $50 in the mail for y'all meal and we are like Lady we can't eat MC Donalds for $50. So I asked the people down stairs if they had a parking pass and a pool band cause we didn't have that either, so the lady says oh no you need to give me her number she can't do this to yall, she says I am calling her she needs to make this right, so she calls her and tells her that is rediclous and she needs to make it right or she will be getting a civil suit filed against her. She tell her just give them their money back. In the mean time the maid shows up and says I was never told I needed to clean but, I am not doing it while y'all are here. So we said we will go eat.  We leave find a place to eat, and while we are eating we get a message we are kicked out. Mind you all our things are in this condo. So we get back and have to call the police to get our stuff out of a condo that was still not clean.  So then we have to ride around Orange Beach and Gulf shores trying to find a hotel because, they are all booked and mind you we have been kicked out but, our money has not be refunded.

Overall I cant say a whole lot about the accommodations. When we booked the room, being as it is to sleep up to 6/7 people, we were told that two parking spots came along with the booking. When we got there to check in, we found out that we had to pay additional fees for any vehicles. Not a single one was included in the booking cost. Not even 24 hours in we had problems with the room keys not wanting to let us in. Some times it would blink red, sometimes it didnt register at all. We had to go to the office 4/5 times to fix the issue. Finally they replaced the batteries in the main lock. The office staff was rude, pissy, and didnt have much interested in helping their guest. Lastly, upon leaving, we did the courteous thing by sweeping majority of the tracked in sand up,  wiped down counters, made sure all dishes had been ran and washed, and so forth. Left, turned out keys in. And headed home. Today May 31st we are charged $110!! after speaking with someone at anchor, who didnt know why, she contacted the condo then gave us a call. These people are trying to say that they have pictures of ashes and cigarettes butts all over the room, and claiming they had to strip everything down due to the smell of smoke. Mind you we have small children in this room under the age of 5!!!!! Not once was a cigarette brought into that room and we are extremely disappointed with the way this is going. Might I add we were also charged another $40 for them to wash the comforter! The cleaning policy clearly says fresh linens are included and any additional cleaning will be extra. There was not reason to be charged extra! We will be doing everything in our power to have our bank reverse the charges as they are FAULTY!!! We will not be booking again, and would never recommend the condo to anyone!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a04b30bef84b7:0x239614a30c0c2e51"}

We stayed in room 877 and on entering the condo was met with a musty mildew odor, back balcony door had been left open and was almost impossible to open or close without significant effort, wifi service was spotty, phone in room wouldn't dial out or to front desk, bed sheets were gritty from sand. The next morning construction was loud on the balcony, and I couldn't reach the front desk so on going to the beach I stopped by to ask how long it would take place seeing as I was on vacation and wanted to sit on the balcony and hear the waves not construction, was told they didn't even know anything was going on in the building, Brett-Robinson only owned the property didn't manage it, I explained that I booked through Brett Robinson and that was my only contacts and that if they owned the property and was renting it it would make sense they should know what was happening and inform guest before they arrive, I was told by the front desk woman, Dawn that she sarcasticly told me she was sorry I couldn't understand and that there was nothing that could be done and that they had no information.\n\nLater that day I began to notice several dirty dishes that were put up as clean (spatula with dried up egg, skillet with burnt food on it, spoon with food on it) called to inform them with the number I assumed  was  the front desk(the phone in room is broke) and reached a lady from house keeping whose phone I had borrowed earlier who helped with the situations, finally reached the front desk only to be again be greeted by rude employes griping because we didnt call the front desk or use the phone in the room, explained it didn't work and they acted as if we were stupid. The lady from housekeeping came took the dishes apologized and explained they had a lot of new kids working and that stuff was missed, she was great. She gave us the phone number for the building manager and when the situation was explained to her and the problems especially with Dawn her response was \"you really wouldn't stay here again because of 1 person\" no honey it's the dirty dishes, stinky room, gritty bed, broke door locks, broke balcony door, bad wifi, and broke phone that's the reason we would never stay at a Brett Robinson rental again the rude employes is just the cherry on top!

We spent days trying to find the perfect place on the beach at a reasonable price.\n\nI think we found that place. We rented unit 879 of Island Winds West from Brett/Robinson, and couldn't be happier. They really eased some of the worries we had with some of the other property rental places nearby.\n\nWe booked less than two weeks before our vacation, and we still only had to pay a deposit ahead of time. Other places we checked out required the full payment.\n\nThe unit itself is almost perfect. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is mainly due to the low water pressure. Maybe this is normal on the island; we're not too sure. The shower in the master bedroom had the worst of it.\n\nThe other negative is the washer/dryer combo. We couldn't figure out which was punching holes in our clothes... Also, my wife mentioned some dust on the pictures, but I didn't notice them myself.\n\nAnd I should probably mention the Wi-Fi. Each unit seems to have their own Wi-Fi, but are probably all feeding into one network. I ran a speed test on it and only recorded 1Mb of download speed. This resulted in Netflix buffering every once in a while. You can forget about streaming anything in HD...\n\nBut who goes to the beach to stay in all the time?  Everything else really is perfect. The kitchen is fully stocked with dishes and utensils. Just bring your groceries. We even had enough dishwasher detergent for a couple of days.\n\nAnd the view.... To wake up and sit on the balcony and watch the ocean... It is amazing. We even slept with our window open so we could fall asleep listening to the waves.\n\nAnd speaking of sleep, I invited my parents to come stay with us, and we still were all able to sleep comfortably. My parents moved the twin beds together and my two toddlers slept on the pull out sofa bed.\n\nSo, over all we're having a great time at IWW-879. We will more than likely rent from Brett/Robinson again. Hopefully we can find that 5 star condo next time.

The furnishings were nice and it was well decorated.\n\nIssues:\n- the right elevator kept getting stuck and was not functioning\n- the indoor pool and fitness area were not available, and we were not told this was the case before we rented, when we were reminded of our stay or with our check-in instructions.\n- the bathroom shower rod came off the wall (it was sticky taped on), and I called about it and the staff member told us they would put in a \u201cwork order\u201d.  No one came, we had to go to the store to get supplies to fix it ourselves so we could use the shower during our stay.\n- both doors to the washer/dryer were broken, which I also told the manager about, and it was not fixed during our stay.\n- there were only 2 parking passes allowed for our room. This was not told to us in any of the information about parking. It just said free onsite parking.  One of our cars had to be parked across the street in an unsecured parking area.\n-the basketball court was not located on the premises.  It too was across the street behind the HOA building.  This is not in any information whatsoever.  I had to reach out to staff to even know where it was located.  Also, the basketball area was not maintained well.\n- the pool is supposed to be non smoking, but there were people smoking all around it.  Being a non-smoker, that was irritating.\n-the door stopper to the front door was broken so every time you opened the door, the door stopper would come down and you would have to hold it while you shut the door.  We taped it up, but it kept falling down.\n\n-There was no physical person on-site at all.  The staff that left their name and number did call me back when I called them, but didn\u2019t come fix anything or call me back to see if anyone came to fix it.  Since the fitness center was not available, he told us we could go to a local gym about two miles away, but then later told us the only gym that we could go to and get reimbursed was 20 mins away.  That is frustrating, because amenities are what typically decides where I am staying, and when they are not available as stated, it is a deal breaker for rebooking with the same resort/condo/hotel, etc. in the future.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nHave someone physically on-site.  The virtual check-in was nice, but not having someone on-site at all was not the way to go.  Also, the place was not maintained like it should have been.  Notice I didn\u2019t mention all the construction work in any of my complaints, because it was expected and communicated before arrival.  My family and I expected to use the indoor pool and fitness center and were not able to as it was not available.  Also, there was a mixture of random shopping carts, luggage carts and double decker carts to take your luggage up.  It seemed very ghetto to have that mixture. We would have stayed elsewhere.  We won\u2019t stay here in the future due to these items mentioned.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a1b4c4e8e68bd:0x7c4fe3f360953ed8"}
