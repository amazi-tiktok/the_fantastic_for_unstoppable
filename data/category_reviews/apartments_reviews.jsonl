The management team is really on the up and up to respond to any and all complaints if there are any about the apartment. The grass is always cut. As a matter of fact the grass is cut too much.almost every other day even if it rains. The pest control is here every single month like clockwork. The neighbors depending where you are some are actually nice. Others are just plain long nosey! Then there are some that will get angry if you appear to not want to be their friend. If you live downstairs your neighbor upstairs is not considerate of you living below them. So yeah they like to stomp their feet as hard as they can when they are walking across the floor. My best advice: always get an upstairs place.\nThere have been a number of car break ins.\nAnd there isnt a 24 hour security guard patroling the property. I personally have never had a problem. But I have seen others who have. My best advice is: JUST DONT LEAVE YOUR VALUABLES IN YOUR CAR. AND DONT\nADVERTISE YOUR BOOMING CAR RADIO,YOUR SUPER PAINT JOB, YOUR TV IN YOUR CAR, OR YOUR NICE SHINNY RIMS ON YOUR TIRES.\nDont walk around with a gang load of jewelry on your neck and 200 dollar shoes. Etc..etc.\nAnd things like robery possibly could be prevented. Overall this apartment complex is not bad. Its pretty decent for the price. The only complaint that I have is its this filthy nasty looking Maintence guy that's always wearing the same old dusty looking clothes all day everyday. I DONT THINK THE GUY EVEN KNOWS WHAT A WASHING MACHINE OR BATH TUB EVEN IS!  He is so gross he reminds me of the tv show called Swamp Thing!\nI hate when that guy comes to my apartment to fix anything. I try to fix it or get it repaired myself so i dont have his gross ass walking around in my place.\nI hate that there is only one pool open. But other thsn that. I would give this place 3 stars.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a546081c04d:0x79b40014507cdb46"}

At one point I had no complaints about living here. But since this new take over I have to report that I am not pleased. The rent use to be 650 or month for a basic 2 bed 1 bath unfurnished  apartment. But now the rent is you can go ahead and say 700 a month for a basic 2 bed 1 bath unfurnished  apartment that comes with only a garbage disposal and carpet on the floor and central heat and air(in which all apartments are suppose to come with air and heat so that's no spotlight). Thats right only 1 bath for 700 and no ceiling fans. No washer or dryer hook ups. I have to walk to the washroom to wash my clothes and pay to use the machines. And even though I pay to use the machines as well as I pay my rent. There is this huge big red sign on the wall in the washroom that says NO LOITERING AND WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE  FOR LOST STOLEN PR DAMAGED ITEMS....sounds like a set up huh....you can't stand around and watch your clothes not can you complain if something happens to them....my clothes was both ripped and stolen from using that washroom....so now I never use it at all.....No dishwasher. No ice maker in the apartment period. The sink sits outside of the bathroom instead of actually in the bathroom where its suppose to be. There is this itty bitty small so called balcony just outside of the master bedroom. The so called code gate barely works..they are always fixing on it. And if it does work then it only stops cars from coming in at night. It does not stop people from walking in on foot. There has been a number of car break ins. And nothing has been done about it. There is no security guard or police patrolling the area around the clock for safety at all. Only 1 cop will show up every blue moon from mpd ride through and keep going. He doesn't stay posted on this site at all. There is this guy that's in maintenance that looks like a child molester. Neighbors are ok. Some are nice others are nosey. There is this one real old dude that loves to scream at the top of his lungs just to hold a conversation with another person. That gets really annoying especially  when you work at night and are trying to get some sleep. The people in the rent office some are ok. But then again there is always one who thinks that they are the owner of the place and they are the one whose calling shots and running the show. And sometimes I have to let them know that I am the one who pays rent. That means that I am the customer and you serve me not the other way around. Sometimes you have to remind peggy that she is an employee at this apartment complex. She gets paid to do a job. She is not doing anyone any favors. Nor does anyone owe her behind explanations or anything else that they choose to do. At one point like I said I use to love being here. And obviously there were others who did as well because it has been several people that have lived here for over 6 years. But now those people are moving out. And I dont blame them. The only reason why i choose to stay is because it seems to be the only place in town to live that allows you to be on a month to month program. Which means you are not stuck here until your lease is up. You can leave whenever you want. Just as long as you give a 30 day notice. At one point a studio would go for roughly around 400 bucks. But now it's like 528. I saw on the available list that they had an apartment that's going for 748 with contract and like 900 without contract(lease) 900? And no washer dryer hookups. No dishwasher. No microwave. No ceiling fans. No ice maker. No stainless steel. Only 1 bathroom. No fitness center. No security patrolling the area around the clock. No video surveillance.  I can do so much better at Vaughn lakes. Not only are there prices cheaper. But the area and the apartment is worth anyone's time. They have fireplaces in their apartments. Burglar alarms in the apartments. Video survallence all over the property. Fishing ponds. Fitness center. 24 hour pool. Washer and dryer hookups. As well as a washroom that's open 24 hours a day.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a546081c04d:0x79b40014507cdb46"}

But then agin i never fool with people anyway. so why should they bother me? But on the other hand\nThe apartment complex itself could stand for a makeover. Yes a new color of paint on the building and the stairs wouldnt hurt at all. The inside of the apartment is very clean and well maintained. Pest control every month. THATS A PLUS!!!! Garbage disposal.\nDecent applicances. Beautiful hardwood floors!\nIm not too fun of the sink that sits just outside of the bathroom. Im use to a sink being inside the bathroom with the toilet and the tub. But hey thats ok too. It'll work. I dont like the fact that the pool stays closed more than it does open. And i dont like the washroom. Its entirely too small and too closed in. Its only one exit and thats threw the door that you came in. So far i havent had any problems but i fear that washroom! It scares the hell out of me! And i feel that if its going to be that small and that closed in then it should have round the clock monitoring or a security camera. Or at least extent the size of it so that it would not only offer more washers and dryers but also a second way out as a safety concern for the residents Espically females. I love the bbq grills all over the property.THATS A PLUS! And i truly enjoy lots snd lots of shade in the summer. Thats also a plus! I love the central air/heat. Thats a plus. I love the fact that everything you need is not far away. Theres resturants, grocery store, dollar stores, places for entertainment such as bowling etc.gas station. Everything is right at your fingertips.\nAnd its quiet! I like it here. Its pretty decent.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a546081c04d:0x79b40014507cdb46"}

Just recently the community has started renovation and the plan is to install something for the children. Apartment living can be a challenge for children as well as adults.  It's not like having your own place and doing whatever you want to do.  While living in an apartment, everyone has to be considerate and mindful of those who live above, below and around them.  Our motto is be a \"Good Neighbor\".\n\nI have an open door policy for our residents and if there is a concern residents are more than welcome to come speak with me.\nIf you are a resident, please come see me so that we can address your concern."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4e3367f5a3e1:0x1cf3ad585de651d1"}
