I dropped off my lawn mower and was told it would be a week, maybe less to fix. A week and a day later I call and they have not even looked at the mower because the misplaced my paperwork. So two weeks and a day later I have to call again. The lady that answers the phone says that David will have to call me back. Finally receive a call back from the same lady to tell me that the mower is ready. You would think that they would at least knock some off the price after jerking me around...but nope. I will never do business with them again. Anybody know a GOOD small engine repair shop?", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a389058bca063:0xed54af27fa746dd2"}
