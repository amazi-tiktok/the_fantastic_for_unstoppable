I am in the kitchen most times that he comes and have watched him. He does every single thing you have paid for regardless if it needs to be done or if he could easily skip that step without you knowing.  He does all of it...every single time he comes.

And he always takes pictures of the pool after servicing and sends them to you through email.\n\nI have had other pool companies where I have questioned did they really do anything...for several months. I kept missing them when they were here. I finally was home and saw the guy literally walk in the back yard ...toss in a chlorine tab in the skimmer basket..come to my front door and leave the card stating he has been here and did this and that...which he had done none of. He didn\u2019t even empty the skimmer basket. Upon calling the owner ...he gave the excuse of \u201c Well, he\u2019s a big guy and doesn\u2019t like to get down on his knees\u201d.

After I offered my condolences and asked to reschedule he informed me he mailed my check back then asked why I wanted it done so soon... 3 months after I requested the drain and clean- I expected to wait this long due to the weather, but the week it was to be done Brad found every reason under the sun to refuse me service. I suspect the original quote he gave me of 900$ was too low ( I usually pay 1,200$) for him to complete the contract. I did not ask for the check to be sent back, or for it to be cancelled, so he voided a contract illegally. After I APOLOGIZED to him for asking for my services to be rendered, even once again offering my condolences for his loss, I assumed his erratic behavior was because of this, Brad still snubbed me, telling me we didn't communicate well.

Well, pool might be a bit of stretch to describe what in fact appeared to be in the process of becoming a protected wetland. The pool, like the house, was in a state that was the result of years upon years of deferred maintenance. I called several companies with ASP being among the first. And before I continue, let me say that many of these companies won't even call you back, answer their phones or come out for visits like they say so ASP is ahead of the curve just for that reason alone. Brad was exceptionally busy with it being the beginning of the pool season, which he told me right off, and that he would try to get over to the house to inspect the pool. The price I was told it might take to get the pool in a usable state took my breath away! But I wasn't too surprised by it. He stated several times that it could be a little more or much less depending on what was found beneath the cover and behind walls. He was sure to prepare me for the worst. However, after that initial few calls and the visit, I didn't hear back from them. This wasn't a major problem because there was roofing and foundation issues to tend to before swimming could even be considered. Why would you need a backyard water feature when the roof itself was becoming one all by itself? Being that I needed someone to get out to do it fairly quickly once it came time address it, I called another company and they gave me a lower quote and could get started fairly quickly. Well, that went bust because we required a contractor with insurance, just in case of a problem. This guy didn't have it and didn't tell us until AFTER he was supposed to show up to do the job. I called and then he lets me know all that. ABSOLUTELY UNPROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR that seems to be the hallmark of many service businesses like that these days. I was ready to just put the pool stuff off for awhile until I could find someone trustworthy until Brad calls out-of-the-blue! Just in time!!

Not only have they performed all the work needed so far, they did it for WELL under what they told me initially. It seems they prefer to brace you for the worst rather than underestimate costs just to get the job. We have a few more issues to address with the pool, again from the previous owners, that I'm sure Brad will help us iron out. These people have been tremendous and I can't say enough good things about them. They do what they say they're going to do, are available anytime just about and HONEST. I will only call ASP for any of my pool needs. Save yourself some frustration, money and anxiety--CALL ANGIE AND BRAD AT ASP!!!!!! Love them!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2c461872e37b:0xbc765d666f41deb4"}

I have a 12,000 gallon KOI pond that is 4 ft. deep and has 2 large bottom drains and a skimmer that feed a filter system much like that of a swimming pool except the media in the filter is plastic beads instead of sand.  It pumps 9,000 gallons of water through the system an hour and runs 24 hours a day.  The water after passing through the filter returns over a waterfall back into the pond.  There are 2 large river birch trees that overhang the pond and the shed a lot of leaves and small twigs into the pond.  Over time I had an accumulation on the bottom of the pond and the drain pipes running under the pond had stopped up and after a routine backwash of the pond the pump lost its prime and I was unable to restart it.  I got the bright idea that since it was similar to a swimming pool to call a swimming pool maintenance company for help.  I looked on the internet and found and called ASP.  Brad answered the phone and when I described my problem he said he could help and he could come 2 days later.  When I explained that I had 60 large KOI fish that required the water flow to keep the water oxygenated he said he was leaving for an appointment and would come as soon as he finished.  He worked on my problem the rest of the day and returned the next morning and got everything working great.  He also altered the plumbing to give me the ability to blow out trash in the drain line.  He found a problem with the multiport valve which we decided needed replacing and added a shut off valve on the waste line to solve the problem until I could get a replacement.  He was great to work with and communicated his findings and suggestions well and his pricing was very reasonable.

It wasn\u2019t the cheapest either, but you pay for what you get, or so we thought. So they come out to install Thursday before Memorial Day. While digging they find a \u201csink hole\u201d as they called it. It was an unfilled perc test. We filled it in that weekend and let them know. (This is NOT their fault, just setting up for the next two weeks it hasn\u2019t been dealt with.)That next week we are told the installation would resume. Later that week the installer said he would be out Friday and that someone needed to be there to sign \u201csink hole\u201d liability papers. Saturday comes still no show or call. So my husband calls the owner. We ask if we could get our money back, and husband tells him their contracted installer won\u2019t call or show up like he\u2019s promised several days to do. After that the installer calls immediately and says he will be out Monday. He comes for 30 minutes. He comes back Tuesday and digs it out and leaves because of weather ( didn\u2019t rain). Thursday my husband asks when we can expect him again. He gives another day and says once again he promised it would be up, my husband told him if he couldn\u2019t keep that commitment then we would find someone else. He told us to go ahead and find someone else. So, I go to the store front and speak to the lady in there. She was very defensive of the whole situation, said we couldn\u2019t have our money back because pools are special order. So I ask when it would get installed. She said she didn\u2019t know. Mathew would do it. She then told me the installer was in tears over us. I tried showing her the screenshots of the conversation to prove we weren\u2019t rude and was simply needing someone to come when they say. I asked to speak with the owner, she refused to give me his information and told me to leave or she was calling the police. I had my children with me who were scared she was saying that.

We were told they did install liners for individuals, so we agreed to have it put in by The Pool Center.  Gavin Johnson came to install the pool liner for us and was here for around 4 hours and was paid $500 when the job was finished.  I didn't inspect the pool as I thought they were professionals and I was working,  I work online for a corporate office.  When my husband came home, he saw the liner was crooked and not aligned straight.  He call Gavin and left a message.  Gavin returned his call and said he would drive up and look at the following day, which he did.  When he arrived, I was told by Gavin  that they saw the liner was not straight after they had finished, but the holes had already been cut for the returns.  They thought the water would straighten the wrinkles out.  Gavin and his helper tried to pull a few of the side wrinkles out, but did not correct the problem.  My husband was talking to Gavin and told him the liner was not centered in the pool, Gavin said it was probably just a bad liner and left.  I called The Pool Center and talked with the owner and she said they couldn't do anything about it since we did not buy the liner from them.  They would only correct their error if we had bought the liner from them.  My husband has been undergoing chemo and this is the only reason we didn't install ourselves in the past.  It is bad when a company doesn't stand behind their labor even if you buy the product elsewhere.

In beginning, the staff were extremely polite, courteous , knowledgeable  and pleasant to interact with. We picked out the pattern we wanted, and paid 50% of the total cost, to cover the  price of manufacturing the liner which, was very reasonable indeed. Steve came out in late December, to take the measurements of the pool, to pass onto the liner manufacturer. We then agreed to call Anders Pool, early March, to set a date to install the liner. I called Anders Pool, March 9th, and spoke with Steve, and set the date to install the new liner on Wednesday, March 27th. Steve touched base with me, a few days before the install date, to make sure we were good to go. Chris and two other staff, arrived early Wednesday, and drained the pool with a gas pump. They removed the old liner, thoroughly, and I mean thoroughly, cleaned, the pool walls and floors, smoothed over the pool floor and installed the new liner without any issues at all. Then, they set up a vacuum pump and a set a vacuum hose between the pool wall and the pool liner, to suck the trapped air out as we filled the pool from the faucet. The Anders pool liner installers, were extremely Professional and polite throughout the entire operation. They did a fantastic job, far, far, better than their local competition, that I'd used for the two previous liners, over the past 30 years. This liner fits snuggly up against the 4 ft. radius walls of the pool. Anders Pool, took the time, to accurately measure the pools dimensions. The previous pool company, when measuring up, rounded down the measurements, to get an even number. Which, resulted in a poor fitting liner. If you need a new pool liner, make sure you get a quote from Anders Pool Company. Trust me, they'll get you the best price and, the best quality liner, and the best possible installation.

And of course we now have to pay someone else to do the tile job we already paid Swimming Pool Services for.\n\nSwimming Pool Services drained our fiberglass pool twice (tried for a 3rd before I told them to stop) without first sumping (we have a sump line - they indicated they didn\u2019t know what it was), they used no bracing any of the 2 times they drained our pool, and then left it empty during rainy days - look up \u2018drain fiberglass pool\u2019 to learn how terrible this all is. The whole time, they\u2019ve dismissed our concerns via long drawn out email back and forths and continue to assert that they did everything correctly and are trying to help. After they failed to make things right, I requested a refund, which they\u2019ve refused - they will only agree to keep sending guys out to redo portions of the job the same way that resulted in the problems that we have today. It's always worth mentioning that what was estimated to be a \"2 to 3 day job\" took more than a month - lots of no call/no show and terrible communication across the board. No thanks.\n\nI\u2019ve since spoken to multiple other local FIBERGLASS experts as well as the manufacturer, all of whom assert this was 100% NOT done correctly (with the owner and manager have simply dismissed this, acting as if we\u2019ve only learned info from the Internet. Despite every other expert and resource saying SPS is wrong, SPS continues to assert that they are the experts, even having gone as far as attacking other local businesses work). I\u2019ve been asked no less than 3 times \u201care you sure they were reputable?\u201d. The manufacture literally put me on speakerphone so everyone could hear my story, to which they responded with gasps, \u201coh my\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u201d. The warranty manager actually said \u201cit\u2019s a good thing you didn\u2019t have any remaining warranty because that would have definitely voided it - we wouldn\u2019t touch it now\u201d. I\u2019ve also been told that the tiles, grout and adhesive used for the job are incorrect for this size/shape/type of pool, which is something that SPS vehemently argues against - I\u2019ll attach some pictures of the current state of our pool so that you can be the judge for yourself.\n\nThe Manager (Dave) AND Owner (Glenn) will act as if they\u2019re trying to help, but it\u2019s seemingly just an act to keep things looking positive online (look here and at the BBB for examples). In conversations they remain friendly/polite, but will only offer to continue doing the very things that have led to us now having a damaged pool. I fully anticipate that the owner will follow up on all reviews acting as if they\u2019ve tried to make things right, just as he seemingly does on all negative reviews, but their idea of making things right is continuing to do things incorrectly - \u2018the customer is always wrong\u2019, seems to be their approach to customer service. No thanks.\n\nUnfortunately there\u2019s a max character count for reviews, so I can\u2019t share everything - though I will be elsewhere.\n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t allow these guys to put a bag of salt in my pool going forward.\n\nUpdate based on owner's claims:\n- The response, as expected, is full of misleading statements in an attempt to come across more helpful than is actually the case.\n- I turned them away ONCE, not several times. I turned them away because they refused to proceed with repairs without 100% draining my pool and indicated that properly bracing it was out of the question.\n- Notice he's not mentioning the 'remedy' that they proposed? Because they didn't propose a remedy. They said they would 100% drain my pool, and would not brace it - which is actually the opposite of a remedy.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWFp0EfHj0oSG3ApdvzMCI-80MWmgJqno06aEE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4tjuqvHvrZEA5bY-MTV8G8oir5Z0Iv8cYzC8K=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOokYi54tLnNqMDkPCSmSNJeG9E7ld1w77GtA2R=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_9RUO7otQifznO9h9uUp-qHfdspKF1zWj_yZP=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRB_x9TPBN3U87jCmN-8mL89RSnax0kerjyxbl=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpjtsEvUANahj3v54DKdWZNW6A4o7RaMjPINIw=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeiwPiGcL3HpVwZB2Ivtop56JpIE9fTggW-e4y=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSN89--TjXMUceMLKEvQc0Y-iKMm5BBho0Sa7d=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPI-zJ2OcILKZGHMe4cqdKmz1M438l2gTyJSJBH=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1544041452230, "text": "Matt, I am sorry that you feel this way and felt it necessary to resort to social media!

We can't be responsible for chemical dosages used when we are not given the proper gallons for your pool. Our dosages given are all based on information that is supplied by our customers unless we send a Technician out to the pool to measure and get accurate volumns. My staff in an effort to help after getting the proper size of your pool did in fact give you chemicals at no charge to treat. My understanding is that you wanted a continuing supply of chemicals at no charge. We make every effort to ensure that you have what you need and are very conservative when dosing a pool typically, however in this case the overdosing was not something we could control based on the information that we had. Social media and review sites are an easy way to try to hurt a smalll business when we are trying to do the right things.

When we called to complain, we were told it's hard finding good help. In Oct 2012, we bought a hot tub from them. In Oct 2016, the hot tub quit running. When the repairman came out, he said we needed to buy a new pump. After waiting a few days for SPS to give us an estimate on a new pump, my wife called the maker of the hot tub, Shoreline Dynasty Spa, and got an estimate from them. We decided to try to fix it ourselves and took the pump to Alabama Pump and Supply who fixed it for much less. We then reinstalled it. After reinstalling the pump, we decided to move the spa a few feet and called SPS and were told Glen would call us back shortly as he was on a job. I waited until 2 PM. When I called back, I was told they wouldn't be able to help us until sometime the next week. TIME TO MOVE ON. We had experienced poor service many times over the years, but weren't sure who to use.

Purchased the pool and everything was going well until we refused to accept the wrong liner that they order. After that the started dragging their feet.

Took them three weeks to install the ladder. Still waiting on the yard to get fixed , huge mound of dirt and mud. Looks like a lot of wasted money seeing how I\u2019m going to have to pay another contractor to come fix their disaster! Avoid this company at all cost.

Hands down the worst customer service and quality of work in the area for pools. Gary came to look at my liner in fall 2017 and we agreed on a new liner in April 2018. April 2018 arrived and I called Gary to get the new liner installed. After at least half a dozen calls, called the main number again and  asked the guy who answered the phone what was going on. They said I was on the liner list for 2017! That doesn't explain Gary not returning calls or texts. And how could we be on the liner list for the previous year!? Just an awful place to do business with. Also had a problem with a Polaris vacuum and called for service a week ago. No call back - NOTHING. Contacted a better company and they responded quickly. Three days after the call, Pools Plus people were in my backyard looking at the pumps. No call to confirm they were coming and then had the nerve to say I could be charged because I didn't call to cancel! Well, they didn't call back to say they were responding to the service call.\n\nThe service was much much better five years ago. Now it's garbage and you're better off using anyone else. Horrible service. Horrible communication. It's like they're TRYING to go out of business. Let's hope that happens soon so other customers don't have to deal with this place.\n\nI can\u2019t prove it but I\u2019m fairly confident any positive reviews are anomalies, family or friends of the owner, or paid reviews. This place is inexplicably bad in every regard.
