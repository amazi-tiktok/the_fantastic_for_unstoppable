You have to follow up numerous times to get an issue resolved.  Judy who works there is rude and unprofessional.

Being a former Realtor myself in Tennessee, I'm aware of the responsibility an agent has to their client.  When we hired Mr. Stanton, we were pleased with his feedback and demeanor.  As time passed the feedback, both from his weekly calls stopping and the review emails from the property viewings, slowed down significantly, however we would still consider it satisfactory.  Throughout listing our property with Mr. Stanton, we provided him with all of the information he requested.  However, 36 hours from closing, we were told that we would have to pay our property pool assessment to the tune of $4700.  It was our understanding this would be assumed by the new buyers.  At first he said that he didn't want to go around and around if we told him or not (which we did upon hiring him), but he was aware of our other assessment, so the logic of knowing one but not the other makes no sense.  As I stated in an email to him, even if we pretend that we didn't pass along the information, he's presented himself as one of the most knowledgable and successful agents in the area with lot of experience at the Gulf Shores Plantation.  How would an expert agent who does business there all the time, not be aware to ask about an assessment that began a year and a half ago, which all units there had.  He then proceeded to tell us that he checked on it and the assessment was non-transferrable and could not be assumed by the buyer, which we double checked with our HOA and that was untrue.  We had to pay it because our agent didn't negotiate that on our behalf in the contract.  We gave him a grace period to do something to make it right and were basically told that it just was what it was.  Instead, Mr. Stanton tried to force the situation/closing like everything was common practice.  Had any effort been shown to correct this or any financial responsibility whatsoever been taken, we absolutely wouldn't have posted reviews on every website we could.  As we indicated to the company before closing, with this not happening, we felt like we needed to let our HOA, others rental services and the general public know our experience with Mr. Stanton and Exit Realty.\n\nOne of their brokers/owners stepped in to call us to see what could be done and apologized repeatedly, saying he believed it was an honest mistake and that it has changed how they will do things in the future.  He said on all future transactions, they will have a disclosure form for things like assessments.  First, I am shocked that's not already common practice as I know in Tennessee everything has a disclosure.  Second, I am glad that this error may have changed how Exit Realty does business, but it was at $4700 of my expense.  We hope this helps anyone who is looking to list or buy in the future and will assist you in assuring the same thing doesn't happen to anyone else", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a0546b1066981:0xc327fec7a2544bfa"}

My rent was always due by the 6th well they changed that and did not tell me then tried to charge me 50$ extra for Jan Feb and March claiming I was late but they just took too long to deposit my checks. NOT AT ANY POINT IN TIME WAS I CONTACTED AND MADE AWARE OF ANY LATE CHARGES. I HAD TO FIND THE INFORMATION ON MY ONLINE PORTAL MYSELF 3 months later and I never got a formal letter stating that I owe anything. If you owe a business, arent they supposed to send you a letter or written notice? They are so unprofessional because not only did I get ZERO letters, in the lease it stated I was to pay 45$ for late fee not 50$ so someone is not able to ensure things are consistent in this office anymore. I would not recommend dealing with this office whatsoever. They raised my rent and took three weeks to stop a huge rain water leak I had coming through my ceiling, and let me go without a working fridge for nearly a week while leaving two fridges in the tiny apartment for two weeks for storage not able to use either one. It has just been a ridiculous experience I am hoping there is a still a decent place to rent from in this area but so far this place has done me wrong totally I got two babies under 2.  Can\u2019t afford unnecessary extra charges, rent going up, and not having a fridge. Just ridiculous and sad. I cannot wait to move.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1589572580769, "text": "Kyrie,  we are so sorry this has been your experience and we would like to be able to look into your complaint.
