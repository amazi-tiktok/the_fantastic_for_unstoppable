And the timing was in the middle of COVID-19 when no childcare is available. We had to bring our four children with us. We decided to split up to watch the kids. My husband went in first. I went in second. When my husband came out alone, I handed him the keys to take the kids in our vehicle. I went into the office with Christopher to sign. He showed me the plot map and told me where to sign. I made the assumption since I was signing paperwork that it was accurate as it was based on our closing disclosure. Right on line 17, it says I was to be on the title. When we received our warranty deed in the mail this last friday, we called the attorney's office for the second time. The first time we called we spoke to Anna who told us she was going to get me added to the deed and it would be corrected. That was when I purchased the deed from the county a couple of weeks ago. She assured us it would be corrected. Therefore, when we received another one in the mail on Friday, we assumed it was the correct one. However, it was not. So we called ALS again. We talked to Shannon this time and was told I could not be on the loan because I was not on the sales contract. We had done this exact thing before in NC so that was strange. I asked for the law statue. Shannon said she did not know what it was. I said ok. I reached out to Veterans United because our closing disclosure from them said I was supposed to be on the deed. Mr. Morgan asked if I could call our closing agent back to see who he contacted from Veterans United who denied adding me to the loan as he stated because that was not their policy as they did it for us in NCs. I followed up with our closing agent Christopher with ALS to get the answers for Mr. Morgan. I was told by Christopher that he doesn't remember who or when he contacted Veterans United. I said so I am just taking your word for it? He said well I have the survivorship deed you can sign. I said I understand that. However, you said you reached out to Veterans United and they denied your request of adding me to the loan. He said well you sat at closing and just signed instead of asking questions. I said you are right because I trusted your office. In the midst of a pandemic, we are moving across country with four small children and no family. Our children were anxious as we had just drove 4 hours to get to his closing office that morning at 10am. I was never able to get the truth about the situation. Christopher with ALS was very unprofessional and lacked empathy for this mistake. I said I was going to write a review about our experience since he basically told us it was our fault for not reading what we signed. PLEASE DO NOT ASSUME THAT WHAT IS ON YOUR CLOSING DISCLOSURE IS WHAT YOU ARE SIGNING IN HIS OFFICE. Oh and he said he was going to tear up the survivorship deed we were supposed to pickup in the morning. Our realtor, Scott Smart, picked him and had never heard of this law before. I regret not looking at the reviews first. Christopher also threatened to have his attorney sent me a letter for writing an honest review of our experience. Can we really trust the good reviews?? Also, he mentioned us having all them kids at closing so he is remembered that when it had 45 days ago, but conveniently, he COULD NOT REMEMBER WHO OR WHEN HE CALLED VETERANS UNITED. He could NOT remember whether he explained to me what I was signing or not, either. PLEASE BE CAREFUL.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d485e3310b3db:0xe94f33270f5b3cb5"}

Like others, notice how all the 5 star reviews are from employees, which is great, I cannot say that anytime calling customer service they were not \"kind\". However, I can say for sure that I have experienced what a LOT of others have, which is that I was taking a medication for 20 years, that is GENERIC, and they would not cover once the benefits implementation was switched to these folks. The first prior authorization was DENIED incredibly despite my doctor saying it \"doesn't seem wise or prudent\" to have to rapidly stop the medication.\n\nI am really blessed, so I could afford to pay out of pocket to fight with the company for 6 months, using coupons etc. while I got \"approval\" on a second prior auth. Again, I am blessed to have some medical knowledge, reasonable time, and afford to find other resources to pay. However, I KNOW FOR SURE that a lot of folks don't, and that this could have been catastrophic (I.e. couldn't get right meds - more PCP or heaven forbid ED visits which then just waste time at PCP/etc offices). This company advertises how \"great a workplace\" they are and they are \"saving money\" for companies, but all of these review are pretty clear HOW they are doing that. Putting up arbitrary guidelines that just waste your doctors time, your companies HR time, and frankly, the patient's time as well. Please, this company is TERRIBLE.
