April was kind and compassionate and patient. I started off my divorce without a lawyer, as the husband made me all kind of promises, and I believed him. You know the saying \" fool me once, shame on you, fool me 7639 times.....\", well..... things got ugly, and I saved my quarters, dimes, and nickles, worked harder, and on Jan 23, 2018 I hired Miss April Bauder. Why? You don't  fake kindness, that is something  you are taught. You don't fake compassion, that is something you feel. People with handicaps are treated \"different\", and April has never treated me different. She ALWAYS returns my calls, and last, her laughter! She has this infectious,  contagious  BEAUTIFUL laughter!!!!  The last few months have been sorrowful, painful, and soooo much hurt. I could cry til the sun goes down, April calls me and I giggle, and giggle and giggle!

We chose Tim since he was  a member of our legal plan to represent us in a civil case. After telling us that the plan would not cover our case, we paid Tim a $2500 retainer. During this time Tim would be proactive and mail us copies of whatever documents he would send or file with the courts. I looked over our legal plan and found that his charges should have, in fact, been covered by our plan.Our legal plan's counse determined that this was so and advised Tim of the same. Since being notified that his time would be covered by the plan and  to not use my retainer for covered charges, I stopped getting any correspondence from his office. No copies of any documents,  no phone calls, no more updates, nothing. Tim never even told us that there was a hearing for summary judgement. The  only reason we found out was from a copy of the order from the  court, itself.  After the hearing, we found out that Tim didn't even argue our case as we had discussed. We eventually lost our case. Tim didn't even bother to notify us until over a week later. When asked about our options, Tim determined that he no longer wanted to represent us and referred us to another attorney who wouldn't even return our calls. When asked about the refund of the $2500 retainer, Tim put us off for over 6 weeks until he finally acknowledged he was trying to \"come up\" with the money. Our legal plan counsel had also been contacting him to return our retainer without further delay. Throughout this time and during our case Tim would never initiate contact with us. We had to initiate contact with him. Even then, it would take anywhere from a week and a half to a month before he would respond.  Tim eventually decided after 46 days that he was no longer going to refund our money despite knowing that his charges were covered by our plan. I have yet to get a breakdown of how my retainer was spent, much less anything else. I would never refer him to anyone. Now he is running for circuit court judge.

While my charges were from 2017, I was not arrested until 2019 because I was sent to the hospital on the date of the offense instead of jail and diagnosed with Sudden Traumatic Shock exasperated by alcohol.  Being arrested was completely out of the norm for me.  I did not know where to begin, what to expect, and was consistently imagining the worst possible outcomes and scenarios.  Based off my charges, my bail agent highly recommended that I contact Mr. Crumbly for counsel.  I had an initial meeting with Mr. Crumbly within a week from the first time I contacted him.  The initial meeting did not take longer then an hour and during that time Mr. Crumbly was able to explain all my available options to include representation options, payment options, court expectations, and expected timelines.  Perhaps the most beneficial thing Mr. Crumbly discussed in the initial meeting was the overall stress of the situation.  He told me that it was human nature to imagine the worst possible outcomes and to not worry about that as it was him and his teams job to make sure those outcomes don\u2019t happen.  He was absolutely right and ,during the entire course of my case, I constantly imagined the worst possible scenarios; however, I always made myself think back to that initial conversation with Mr. Crumbly and remembered that is why he is there.  After that initial meeting, Mr. Crumbly and his team handled everything for 6 months up until my court date with the Judge.  Before I even had to go before the Judge, Mr. Crumbly had secured a deal with the DA for me to enter the Pre-Trial Intervention Program (PTIP) and have charges dropped following the completion of the program.  I was more than happy to enter PTIP as it took all uncertainty and stress off the table and I was able to hold everything going forward in my own hands.

He takes his work very seriously, and has a huge heart that most attorneys just make you feel like a number and only care about your money, but he is not at all that way.  He really cares about his clients,and appreciates each and every one.  There is no one that I know that has the heart and knowledge of law that he does. He is genuine, kind, ambitious and most of all caring.  He is a family man with kids, and he knows how important it is that he takes care of you.  My words are only from my heart about this man.  You have to give him a chance to understand for yourself that what I say about him is nothing but honest and loyal.  But I do want and need to add something to my review about Russell..he is not only caring, ambitious, and knowledgeable, he is also very direct, will always be truthful to you and you need to be truthful with him.  He can not help you if you are not.  He is humble and kind...but he can not help if you will not open up to him, because how can he help you if you are not giving your all to him.

In addition, I was uninformed of all the specific issues pertaining to Alabama State Law as they apply to a DUI charge especially, with respect to possible fines, imprisonment, unknown future adverse impacts, or establishment of an unfavorable permanent criminal history. The level of stress in my daily life was extremely high, to say the least, due to this situation and these concerns.\n\nI was referred to the Law Office(s) of Russell W.

His office has been helpful and detail oriented to ensure that we knew everything that was going on and kept me up to date every step of the way.  They were always friendly and accommodating.  Even while not representing me, he was able to give me some great advice about my father's will and estate after my father had passed away.  He took the time out of his busy day to tell me what I needed to do and who it would be that I needed to find and contact once it went to probate.  This is not his area of expertise, he was just helping me know where to start.  He explained to me the process.   Since it was a large city that my father lived in, it was a while before the estate went to probate and I assumed I had been written out due to my father's controlling sister so I didn't bother looking into it until 2 years later when I was found by a life insurance company and received a letter explaining that I was the beneficiary of a policy.  I then took Mr. Crumbley's advice by finding the attorney through the probate court and found that I had many savings bonds, which the sister told me had been spent 10 years prior.

The DA will lie straight to your face.  The DA will threaten you with the highest jail terms to get you to plead guilty so they don't have to take it to trial.  Their in house legal assistants that are there to help guide defendants will tell you that if you don't take the plea \"deal\" that you wont win.  They are only there to help the DA, not you.  It's very difficult, especially when it's your word against law enforcement officers, many who have no problem lying in court and they're buddies with the judge.  You need someone who knows the law and knows how the courts work.  It wont be free, but it's worth it to not have to go to jail and/or have a record haunting you.  For more serious crimes, you may get a public defender, but your life is on the line with someone who may not care about you or what happens to you.

His office has been helpful and detail oriented to ensure that we knew everything that was going on and kept me up to date every step of the way.  They were always friendly and accommodating.  Even while not representing me, he was able to give me some great advice about my father's will and estate after my father had passed away.  He took the time out of his busy day to tell me what I needed to do and who it would be that I needed to find and contact once it went to probate.  This is not his area of expertise, he was just helping me know where to start.  He explained to me the process.   Since it was a large city that my father lived in, it was a while before the estate went to probate and I assumed I had been written out due to my father's controlling sister so I didn't bother looking into it until 2 years later when I was found by a life insurance company and received a letter explaining that I was the beneficiary of a policy.  I then took Mr. Crumbley's advice by finding the attorney through the probate court and found that I had many savings bonds, which the sister told me had been spent 10 years prior.  The executrix allegedly told the attorney that she tried to contact me, but she did not  Thanks to these cushions I have been able to go back to school.\n\nI want to add, if anyone is in legal trouble, please seek counsel.  The DA will lie straight to your face.  The DA will threaten you with the highest jail terms to get you to plead guilty so they don't have to take it to trial.  Their in house legal assistants that are there to help guide defendants will tell you that if you don't take the plea \"deal\" that you wont win.  They are only there to help the DA, not you.  It's very difficult, especially when it's your word against law enforcement officers, many who have no problem lying in court and they're buddies with the judge.  You need someone who knows the law and knows how the courts work.  It wont be free, but it's worth it to not have to go to jail and/or have a record haunting you.  For more serious crimes, you may get a public defender, but your life is on the line with someone who may not care about you or what happens to you.  It's a dangerous risk to take and once you are convicted, it's harder to find people to listen to you.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1541428090094, "text": "How kind of you. Thank you.

When I explained I was busy I was asked if I would speak with him over the phone. I agreed and I was transfered to Mr. Crumbley.  After listening to me explain my why I left the review and my account of my interactions with Mr. Matt Wisda, Mr. Crumbley asked me several questions.\n1. Would I consider removing my review?\n2. Would I consider moving it to Mr. Wisda\u2019s webpage?\n3. If he (Crumbley) were to fire Mr. Wisda would I then delete my review! I said no.\n4. Was there ANYTHING he (Crumbley) could say or do that would result in me removing the review? To which I responded \u201cNot ethically\u201d, because I felt he was trying to \u201clead me\u201d into asking for a monetary resolution.\n\nDuring our discussion Mr. Crumbley stated he was not at all happy about Mr. Wisda\u2019s conduct. And that he was considering actions (including termination).  He asked once more if there was anything he could do To get me to retract the review against \u201cCrumbley, Blackwell, & Wisda Lawfirm\u201d.  I explained to him that when I researched Divorce Attorneys/Firms I based my decision in part on the reviews of his Firms website and information regarding the lawyers and therefore would not consider removing the review. We said goodbye and I hung up.\n\nI spent that day wondering if he would call again. I just knew \u201cIT\u201d wasn\u2019t over.\nSo this evening I checked on my review out of curiosity...and wouldn\u2019t you know it there is this long drawn out explanation that it was I who was misinformed etc.  Never once mentioning any unethical behavior on behalf of Mr. Wisda!\nI want to SHOUT from the highest rooftops what a sleazy slimeball you are! Shall I post more? Shall I post information Mr. Wisda freely disclosed to me about a clearly VERY SENSITIVE divorce and custody battle where the children involved had been...!\nYou disgust me!\n\nI retained Matt Wisda to represent me for my divorce.  I feel he acted unethically.\nI contacted his office after receiving an invoice for services that were not rendered. When I followed up with an appointment a few days later not only did he begin by talking about another case he had been working on (this was the 2nd time he mentioned details of this other party's case!) but he also presented me with an official Settlement Agreement\" that clearly stated me and my spouse had both agreed to - WHICH NEITHER OF US HAD!\n\nWe never went through discovery at all! No mediation - nothing!\nThe entire document looked copy and pasted, and all of the assets and then some were to be awarded to me!\n\nMr. Wisda was trying to fool me into thinking he had been hard at work on my case and that I was entitled to everything when in fact he hadn't done anything. Additionally It was never my intention to try take my husband to the proverbial cleaners. I just wanted a fair settlement.\n\nI didn't even look at the \"Settlement Agreement\" he'd drawn up while at his office. I had already decided to sever our business agreement and told him so.  I asked when I could pick up my remaining retainer and he said it would be about a week.\n\nWhen I went to pick up the monies, enclosed with my check was an invoice of almost $700 for the bogus \"Settlement Agreement\" that had been drawn up without consultation or discovery.  Coincidentally the new invoice showed just one line item for the preparing of said agreement which was dated after the phone call I mentioned above.\n\nI immediately drew up a letter refusing to pay and insisting I be refunded.  Additionally in the letter I called him out for trying to fool me and get paid for it. I emailed this letter and received a response early the next morning stating they would immediately refund the that money, which they did.\n\nI am leaving this review to make others aware.  In our consultation meeting he told me his practice \"is like a game to me.\"  And because  conducting his business in such a way, I feel, is an abuse of his power as an attorney and is extremely unethical.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1528493792927, "text": "We deeply regret that your experience with our office did not meet your expectation. We work very hard to not let that happen. Having said that, you say that you received a \u201csettlement agreement\u201d that indicated you and your husband had agreed to the settlement terms when, in fact, you had not agreed. You also say that this agreement was put together without doing any \u201cdiscovery\u201d or any \u201cmediation\u201d. You initially hired Mr. Wisda to assist you in negotiating an uncontested divorce with your husband\u2019s lawyer. In fact, you produced, for us, a \u201csettlement agreement\u201d created by your husband\u2019s lawyer when you hired Mr. Wisda. That settlement agreement had already been prepared absent any \u201cdiscovery\u201d or attempt to \u201cmediate\u201d. It was clearly the intentions of both parties (and their lawyers) to settle this matter, if possible, without costly litigation. This type divorce typically does not involve \u201cdiscovery\u201d (in the traditional sense) and most certainly doesn\u2019t involve \u201cmediation\u201d. In these type matters we simply go with settlement negotiations to the extent we are able, which necessarily includes \u201csettlement proposals\u201d. Also, in this type situation, both parties tend to agree that they know what the assets are and their values are not in dispute.\n\nThe \u201csettlement agreement\u201d your husband\u2019s attorney prepared, and gave you, was just like the one Mr. Wisda gave you. In reviewing your husband\u2019s proposal it is noted that it also includes language stating that the two of you \u201cacknowledged and agreed\u201d to things that you had not already agreed upon. In other words, both lawyers settlement agreements included the very same language in that regard. In fact, most paragraphs in all settlement agreements are full of language such as \u201cthe parties acknowledge and agree \u2026\u201d. This language is included to satisfy legal requirements and applies to you ONLY AFTER you have actually read it, agreed to it and signed it. It is not intended to mean that you have already seen it and agreed to it. And, it is NEVER INTENDED to deceive. Your attorney, Matt Wisda, did exactly what your husband\u2019s lawyer did with respect to that language.\n\nAs far as the \u201cattempt to fool you\u201d is concerned: you received an itemized statement of the charges. You received two billing statements. The second of those two seems to be where you objected. That statement involves the \u201csettlement agreement\u201d. You were dissatisfied with that charge and objected to that bill and, although you had NOT notified him of your desire to terminate him until after that work was done, we refunded every penny to you of that part of the bill. And your objection, as much as any we can tell, is founded on your belief that it included the \u201cbogus\u201d settlement language indicating that you and your husband had agreed to the terms that you had not agreed to.\n\nWe strive to handle cases the way our clients direct us. And, while the services you received were not satisfactory to you, Mr. Wisda DID NOT bill you for services not rendered. His conduct was not unethical. His ability to communicate effectively with you, I will agree, must have missed the mark. For example, we are not sure how, exactly, you did not understand that the \u201cacknowledged and agreed\u201d language in the settlement agreement did not mean you had both already agreed to that agreement. That was no more the intent of what Mr. Wisda provided you than it was the intent of what your husband\u2019s attorney provided him. It was merely two lawyers doing their jobs and adding the language that was going to be necessary at some point, in advance. Perhaps THAT is why it looked copied and pasted.\n\nWe would encourage ANYONE who is dissatisfied in ANY way, with ANYONE in our office, to meet with any of us. WE ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE to meet with that person and do everything we can to alleviate their concern and fight for your cause. Your case matters to us. And, YOU matter to us. Best wishes moving forward during this trying time.\n\n~ Russell Crumbley & Matt Wisda"}, "gmap_id": "0x886214b5eb6aa54b:0x60d777fdf93ee41a"}

Mr. Crumbley is the most exceptional, top notch attorney in the area and will exceed your expectations each and every time under his representation. He has represented me on 4 separate cases (3 misdemeanor and 1 felony) and has impressed me more and more each time with his results with all 4 of the cases being dismissed with NOT GUILTY verdicts when I was very GUILTY as a matter of fact. As soon as he walks in the courtroom you should know that you will be taken care of. This mans representation is like the results of having the combination of Peyton Manning in the regular season and Tom Brady in the playoffs which in other words is about as good as is gets when in comes to criminal defense representation. I honestly do not have enough words or ways that I can use to describe how high level of an attorney he is and worth every dollar of the premium cost to afford him to represent you because you get what you pay for so you won\u2019t be disappointed no matter how guilty you are of your charges. Don\u2019t hesitate to call his office as they are more than happy to assist you with whatever questions or concerns you may have in regards to your case. Mr. Crumbley is hands down the best attorney in our area for any criminal matters. Do yourself a favor and make sure you hire him to take care of yourself because I\u2019d honestly be hesitant to have anybody else to represent me in a potential criminal defense situation besides Mr. Crumbley. To Teles Walker, you won\u2019t find a better attorney or receive a better result than having Mr. Crumbley by your side and am sure you received a contract as Mr. Crumbley is always sure to provide one so everyone out there should disregard any negative reviews because those folks are more than likely either trolls or generally unhappy with their own lives and you can tell the literacy of the individual by reading their review from a grammatical standpoint. To the rest of the folks out there, be sure to disregard the ignorant individuals reviews as that is a false representation of Mr. Crumbleys services. As GUILTY as any individual may be, I can guarantee that you will receive the best possible legal result with Mr. Crumbley by your side and I say that with no doubt in mind. There is a good reason as to why you see his billboards all around our area and it\u2019s for his consistently exceptional results.

EVERYTHING must be ALWAYS viewed with the proper perspective. I appreciate your strong, heartfelt words but they weren't necessary. We take cases all across the board and that includes cases that are very difficult and filled with a multitude of considerations, possibilities and opportunities - even for failure.

Involved in a case that had never been before the Alabama Courts, we had no idea if we should fight or roll over and (pay)dead.  I am far from being a quitter but sometimes you feel that there is nothing or no one that can help you and the ones you care for. Sometimes it seems that the Justice system is anything but just. This is exactly how we felt all the way up to our final hearing. We new we were going to need an intelligent and thorough attorney. We researched and asked people who we should use and was referred to Mark. We went and talked with him and he took our case, but told us he couldn't promise anything. He told us that he would do the best he could, and that was all we could ask for. We just wanted what was fair and felt it was worth the fight. After trying to go to court without an attorney and seeing how that was going we just knew we had to have representation. Our finances were extremely tight and we worried that it might just all be for naught. It seemed the law just didn't have anything to protect us. Mark Gober searched and searched and found cases in several other states that supported our side, and gave us some hope. Still we were concerned that it could go either way. We even were concerned that the truth was not going to come out because everyone kept saying that it was all irrelevant. Even with all of the negative things we were hearing  we stuck it out and kept fighting because we felt that it mattered. We wanted our case to maybe help someone else in the future. Mark surpassed anything that we could have expected when we got in the courtroom for our final hearing. We were amazed by how thorough he was without even having to bring every detail into it (which could have taken a lot more time and cost us a whole lot more money). I could not believe it when he actually got them to admit things on the stand that showed exactly what was going on. Justice was truly done as much as it could possibly be thanks to Mark. This was a case for me of right vs. wrong and the good won out. Thank you so much for all that you have done for our family.
