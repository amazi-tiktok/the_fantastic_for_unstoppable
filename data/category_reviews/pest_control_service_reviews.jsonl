One day after they had treated my house I was already seeing a big improvement. I'm barely seeing any bugs already! They are coming back in a month to treat again but they require no contract and this time of the Corona Virus it meant a lot to me. Knowing that people who have hardly any income can call on Magic City Pest Control to help them rid their bug and mice problems without worrying about a month to month payment. They also had on masks when they knocked on my door! I truly commend the gentleman and the work ethics of Magic City Pest Control!

I live out of state, but used them for my second home in AL.  I specifically asked them from the beginning to put my primary out-of-state home address as the billing contact.  For years, they would conduct the service and send the bill to my primary address out of state.  I always immediately paid for their services via credit card over the phone.  For my annual ant and terminate inspections this year, I just happen to call them to schedule things, and they said, \"we closed your account because of failure to make a payment.\"  ???  I told them I never received a bill nor knew there was an outstanding balance.  I asked what the billing address was...never got a straight answer.  Eventually, the phone representative admitted to the possibility that Bama may have sent it to the AL home where the service was being performed.  Also not true, because my mom lives there and sends me all bills that come to the house.  The phone rep even had the nerve to say \"we were sending the account to collections.\"  I never even knew there was a bill due!  And they obviously make no attempts on their end to keep in touch with the customer.  That was issue No. 1.  Nonetheless, I immediately paid the outstanding balance and that issue was resolved, despite Bama's sloppiness and failure to communicate.\n\nIssue No 2., they have an absolutely unconscionable provision in their agreement that says something to the effect of, \"Customer must give 30 days written notice before getting out the the Agreement.\"  The very next sentence in the Agreement says, \"Bama may cancel the contact without notice at any time for any reason.\"  What?!\n\nBesides the fact that such a provision would never hold up in court if there ever were a dispute, it is a completely onerous clause.  They're not selling gold, they spraying chemicals on the ground, for goodness sake.  No need for such an unfair clause.  I asked the representative for a reason for such an unfair clause.  She responded something to the effect of, \"we need that in there for customers who don't pay.\"  What????  Well, in my opinion, such language is waaaay over broad for such a limited scenario as nonpayment.  Anyway, I refused to agree to it, Bama Exterminating refused to change or delete it, and we parted ways.  I signed up the same day with their competitor, who actually ended up being cheaper...and more organized as well.  I have been happy so far.\n\nThere is a fine line between a mom and pop operation and a sloppy operation.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888603267877fefd:0x2a05ac8851bf106c"}

{"user_id": "105911283207854552760", "name": "Dr. Lindsay Greenlee", "time": 1404351846234, "rating": 1.0, "text": "This company is unprofessional and their customer service is severely lacking.  In my case, they made several mistakes and refused to admit to or even rectify their own mistakes.  I purchased my home four years ago and it came with a termite bond with Bama Exterminating.  This year (2014) they mailed me a contract to sign regarding that termite bond with dates listed from 2012 to 2014.  In essence, because they made a mistake and did not have me sign a contract when I purchased the home, they were trying to get me to agree to terms for the previous years to cover themselves legally while disregarding the legal issues for the customer.\nI called their office manager, Kim Ousley, to inquire about this contract and she was unable to explain why I was receiving this contract four years after the home purchase and why the contract had a start date listed as 2012.  After getting frustrated with my questioning and being unable to answer the questions posed to her, she hung up the phone.\nThen, I spoke with another employee, Mr. Bridges, who did manage to explain at least why I was receiving this contract at the time I did.  However, he did not see any issue with me agreeing to terms, in writing, that were two years in the past.  He also did not see any issue with Ms. Ousley's behavior even though she was unable to explain their contract and hung up on a customer after getting flustered.\nSo, there are a serious of problems here that are all the mistake of Bama Exterminating and the company refused to rectify their mistake.  First, they should obtain a new contract when homes are sold for the new owner.  They failed to do that in my case.  When they realized their mistake (in 2012), they continued to let the contract go unsigned.  In 2014, they mailed a letter and a contract dated for 2012.  In the letter they stated they could not renew my termite bond UNLESS I signed the back-dated contract.  This seems reasonable except the mistake was on their end and I shouldn't be required to sign things I am uncomfortable signing and they refused to fix it.  I offered to sign a current contract but they would not do that unless I signed the back-dated one.  Finally, the way the office manager, Ms. Ousley, handled the call was unfortunate.  If she did not have the proper information or could not communicate effectively with the customer, she should have found someone else to help rather than hang up the phone on a long-term customer.\nIn sum, there were multiple errors made this company and even after I offered to sign a current contract, they refused to fix their mistake or even take responsibility.  I would not recommend doing business with this company until they refine their business practices.  There are many more companies that offer the same type of services and will offer better customer service.\n\n***Update - I hired their competitor for half the cost yearly and I would suggest doing that.  From what I have learned about pest control, Bama Exterminating is using older bait stations which is why they need to come service them four times a year.  Companies that use more modern equipment are lower cost because the stations need to be serviced less often.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888603267877fefd:0x2a05ac8851bf106c"}

Our salesmen have no part in training or overseeing the employees, so any parallel between the salesman and technician was purely coincidental.  Part of the inspection process we provide includes replacing broken or missing top caps.  This is done at no charge to the customer.  The exception to this rule would be for the concrete core caps, which we will replace for free if the core caps were damaged due to any negligence by our company. However, if the homeowner is responsible for damaging the concrete core caps, we will replace them at cost.  The Sentricon top caps and bait tubes each contain a unique barcode, which is scanned in upon each service then subsequently downloaded onto our system each day, therefore ensuring each station was checked. We are happy to provide a record at your request.  Furthermore, checking the stations and doing proper inspections are a vital part of maintaining your termite protection, since we would be liable should infestation occur.  We appreciate the business you provided us.  If we can be of any further assistance, or answer any questions, please feel free to call our office at 256-764-2452, or send us an email at contactus@bohannonpestcontrol.com."}, "gmap_id": "0x887d48136875d739:0xf2bc8358a5f12d48"}

Even though we paid them boat-loads of money, they COULDN'T help us with a rodent problem.  This is a pest-control service that advertises regularly on local TV.  The spokesperson, who I think is now the owner, also treated my elderly, blind, widowed mom with *much* disrespect.\n\nOnce, back in the 80's, prior to having a termite contract, we had a termite swarm break out into one of our rooms.  It was *NIGHTMARISH!*  We had to cordon off that section of the house!

When  I protested, they said this happens, that there wasn't much they could do about it and that I would just have to deal with it.\n\nI put my foot down and they sent a team out that day, but can you imagine how they must have bullied some of their other customers?\n\nCOOK'S PEST CONTROL IS ***AWESOME*** !!!!!\n\nThey took care of our rodent problem IMMEDIATELY and with ease.  When I told them that this other service didn't even try to help us, their rep said that Cook's is a pest-control service and that rodents are pests, so he didn't see the disconnect.\n\nI didn't either.\n\nCook's actually DOES WHAT YOU PAY THEM TO DO.  What a concept!  Their staff are *VERY* professional and oh-so-courteous.  They treat their customers with kindness and respect.  They always call before they come to service our property.

In less than 2 hrs I had a call from a guy saying he was on his way. So in less than 3 hrs I called and the yard was taken care of.

However, over time, we noticed the results became less & less apparent, and the invoices seemed to become higher & higher.  Then, finally at some point last winter, there was some apparent weed spraying along my property\u2019s entire fenceline that left behind a 3-foot wide swath of dead grass, which became painfully obvious when the lawn came out of its winter dormancy in late March 2021.  All TruGreen tech had to say was that it must\u2019ve been from a cold winter & some other BS, and that maybe it would eventually grow back; however, none of our many other neighbors that don\u2019t use TruGreen, but do have the same type of centipede grass, the same type of shadow box fence, and the same type of winter weather showed no signs of this kind of problem.  So, I have to call B.S. on this lame-brain & accept-no-responsibility explanation.  TruGreen management was notified numerous times about this complaint, and we never got a reply from anyone about it.  Needless to say, we were forced to cancel this expensive & negative impact lawn service.  Now, I have the wonderful task of ripping-up thousands of square feet of dead grass along my entire fenceline, and purchasing expensive & dirty sod to put it all back myself.  Then, I have the wonderful task of watering it all back to health very early in the morning for the next several weeks.

Please give us a call at the office  at your convenience so we can discuss this further and develop a plan of action."}, "gmap_id": "0x889bb537334acc33:0xed0870650194176"}

Please stay far away if you want an honest assessment and accountability. I will explain the events and you can judge for yourself.  The experience started off quite well, Christian was quick to come out for a consult, where he made the assessment that flying squirrels were the cause of our attic sound.  He then proceeded to hand my husband a contract for $2400 without explaining charges.  My husband questioned the cost and he quickly removed the multi year warranty which lowered the price to $1400. He was then told it would be a week before any exclusion work would be done.  He agreed and waited. The company placed barriers on roof and a one way door to allow squirrels to leave on their own (work happened on a Tuesday).  So we waited some more.  The next Monday.  A week later we were still continuing to hear the SAME noise.  I called the company (twice) before someone named Greg came out to do a check.  He only checked the roof and not the interior of the attic where the sound was, said everything looked good and was working correctly.  We voiced our concerns and he said sometimes they take 3 weeks to leave but that there is a possibility that since the excrement looks similar it could be mice instead but if that was the case it would require a different company. He said they could set traps but would just wait until the follow up the following week. Mind you the amount you pay up front is not refundable AT ALL. so that Monday night once again we hear the noise (2 weeks into the process now and the sound is right above the master bedroom so two weeks with no sleep).  The next day I go to Home Depot and get traps myself.  Place the traps after work (about 7pm) and by 10 pm the have a heart had caught something! But to our surprise.  It was not a squirrel but a mouse.  We release it the next day and reset the trap as well as two old school back cracker style traps, the next morning we\u2019ve caught another.  Still no squirrels.  I call the company obviously irritated (once again takes two calls to get a call back). Greg calls back and is super defensive won\u2019t admit there is a chance that they did not assess the full situation correctly (house was built in the 70\u2019s so sure maybe there was a chance there was old poop up there from something else).  Once again extremely defensive, belittling, opposite of good customer service.  Says he is the boss there is no one above him to discuss my concerns with.  They are currently still supposed to come do a recheck and spray some sort of an enzyme mix to stop squirrels from coming back (that we\u2019ve already paid for at this point) but if Squirrels were not the problem what good is that?? I think even an admission that the initial assessment could have been wrong would have gone a long way but no.  they basically said there is no way to prove that squirrels didn\u2019t leave...even though the sound is still present so the situation is obviously not resolved oh and the icing on the cake, the company does not trap mice.  If your in the Vestavia, AL area please pick a different company if you don\u2019t know for sure the specific animal you have a problem with because this company will be honest upfront.  If Christian had told my husband..look here is what I think but there is a chance 50/50, 75/25 whatever you want to call it that this won\u2019t work to solve your problem because you may have a different problem or two problems...then we would be looking at a different review.  I\u2019m not unreasonable I just expect accountability.  I still have a phone call in to someone at a higher level at the company hoping for some answers  or resolution before taking further action but my hopes are not high.

I held off on reviewing after my first service so I could also review the products that they use. The technicians: My first service was with Nathan, and he did an excellent job addressing my concerns and thoroughly treating the outside of my home. Today was my 30 day follow up of the initial service and I am equally, if not more so, impressed with the thorough job that Daniel did, as well as addressing any and all my concerns. Both men seemed to take pride in their work, were nice and polite as can be, were prompt, and went the extra mile to provide outstanding service. They are a credit to the ClearDefense company. As for the products used: I have noticed a drastic reduction in spiders in the garage, ants around the perimeter of my home, wasp activity, and insects in general. The glue traps they put down had minimal pests, unlike another company I previously used where the traps would have activity the day after service. I believe their products to be outstanding so far. As for the mosquito treatment, I will have to update this review at a later date, once I have determined the efficacy. I am a \"biting critter\" magnet and cannot step foot outside my home without repellant on, but so far, so good. I will continue with ClearDefense for my quarterly service, and would highly recommend them. Keep up the outstanding customer service guys, and you will have a lifetime customer.

I called again very politely  and no one came. Finally,  a week later I called the 1 800 customer service line and someone came.  Again, this same month I began to have problems with fleas due to my neighbors dog who is practically a straw.  He tries to sleep on my porch and often lounges into yard. They did come once, but when I asked for follow up--- in person, the secretary mentioned that my service was 10 days away anyway.  No ma'am.  My 4 year old son is getting bit by fleas.

Issue with them is that they actually don't care about anything except making sure you get a quote for about 4000 to 8000 dollars in water proofing nor will they give you a report with the details of the moisture readings.  My agent called Ecopest and Dustin came out to do an inspection.  He did moisture readings throughout the crawl space and recommended a series of steps to return the crawl space back to its usual condition.  He explained everything in simple terms and I learned a lot from him.  When the work that needs to be done isn't something they do he recommends highly capable people with the same integrity as those that work at Ecopest.  This job ended up costing $4000 LESS than the supposed crawl space experts and now my crawl space is back in its original condition with no waterproofing solution necessary.  Thank you Dustin!

Seems like an honorable guy running an honorable business.  He responded to questions and was even accommodating to my special requests to see the contract in a form that was readable.  Imagine that!  The $ fees for install of a start up of Sentricom Termite bait stations were half of the more recognizable named companies' fees.  And he includes double the inspections to monitor and keep our homes and outbuilding structures secure.  Charlie, the installer, was also polite and professional, punctual and communicated well.  The install went fast and was nonintrusive.  Only negative was, I am not a fan of having the bait station housings flanking my home entrances.  It's a small issue, but an esthetic one.  I know the system requires training and standards for installs so this might not have been preventible.\n\nMay 24 2021 Addendum:  So this business is remarkable!  The owner is set on running his business with a mission that every customer is completely happy.  I have to say I was more than impressed when my prior review prompted him to contact me.

Told me the reason for it and that it was resolved.\n\nI don\u2019t own a home, he didn\u2019t take this time because I was profitable for him.

We never were told that by any other exterminator and we've had a serious mosquito problem as long as I can remember.  He also pointed out the pears that we let fall from the tree and rot were feasts for mosquitoes and roaches.  We even had holes in some of the wood panels of the house that we were unaware of, that were caused by carpenter bees which he killed!\n\nOn top of all this about thirty minutes after he left the roaches started to come out.  Two to be exact.  The spray got them and they seemed to be on their last leg.\n\nThe man is thorough 10/10, informative 10/10, and professional 10/10.

He will do a better job than the big company\u2019s like Wayne\u2019s, for the same price or cheaper, and give you WAY better customer service. Mike is also a firefighter which is freakin awesome.

We found out he was on call that weekend and would not be our regular exterminator, however.\nAfter a few weeks we discovered some ants dying off and the trails in the kitchen lightened but only because they had began to invade my bathroom that was on the other side of the kitchen wall. So we called to request another visit. As it turned out the flexibility I was promised when I called for service information was not very flexible so we had to wait some time to be serviced when I would be home.\nThis time my bathroom was serviced and same as before, the ants pushed back over to my kitchen.\nThe same game of cat and mouse, they ran back and forth as opposed to killing them off.... which became even more stressful because now I was paying someone to take care of an issue and was not getting results.\n\nBut what was even more infuriating was that I received an email one day while I was at work saying that my house had just been serviced.\nI\u2019m sure this was the outside portion of my house that was serviced but what about the inside where I STILL had ants crawling around everywhere even though I had already spent a pretty penny to get rid of them?! They didn\u2019t so much as even give me a courtesy call to say they would be coming by my house nor did they leave a slip of confirmation on my porch so that I would know they had physically been on my property (sorry, an email can not confirm that).\nSo my sugar ant problem continued.\nFrustrated, I found a DIY trick to clear ants.\nI was at work AGAIN and received an email that my house had been serviced while nobody was home. Without a courtesy call stating someone would be servicing my house. Without any confirming papers left at my residence so I would know they had physically been at my property.\nWhat about the inside of my house? I hadn\u2019t even reported to Orkin that I cleared my ant issue at this point so wouldn\u2019t they need to be able to service me where they\u2019d have access to the inside?\nI called customer service immediately and explained my frustrations and how I would like to cancel services because I don\u2019t even know if someone is actually stopping by my house because nobody is ever home when they come and we are never aware that someone is coming unless we pre-schedule it not to mention they didn\u2019t get rid of my problem.\nServices were canceled.\nI was told the local branch manager in Huntsville, Eric Westmoreland, would be contacting me but never did. A few weeks later I received a bill.\nSo, I called customer service again to get information on why I was being billed but was told they couldn\u2019t answer me and that they would send a message to have someone from my local company contact me. Nobody did. I received ANOTHER bill from them. So this time I called the local branch to express my frustrations.\nIt was a Friday about 3:45pm and the girl I spoke with said she could not answer me regarding why I was being billed but her manager could. She indicated her manager had already left for the weekend but assured me she would take note down and have \u201cEric\u201d contact me first thing Monday morning. Monday came and went without a call and to date I haven\u2019t been contacted by anyone. Orkin sent my bill to collections after this without once being willing to talk to me about the issue at hand. I have paid it for the sake of my own name. But the lack of professionalism in this company is appalling.\nI\u2019ve spent my whole working carrier in customer relations and management and at no point have I EVER known of a manager to be so dismissive to paying customers.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b8d6292587f:0x34b604f65769e91e"}

He was extremely knowledgeable and efficient in treating my residence both inside and out. After treating my residence I spoke with Kierra and was given an awesome welcome from Orkin.

Regardless though, the technician said he wanted to come back at the end of the 30 days. I thought this was going to be great, and at first it was. They give great service on their first visit. While he didn't show up right during the scheduled time frame, he was close. The poison was strong, and I was pleased. However, for the second appointment, the office was unorganized. I scheduled an appointment and the technician called on the wrong day to ask if I was home. For the actual appointment day, I waited at home for hours for him to arrive without a show. I called him and he not only denied my call, but never called me back. Since it was the end of the day, I called the office the next day and arranged the visit for the same day. He asked to come out in the next 30 minutes, which was little time for me to get off work, but I did so because I was nervous I wouldn't get him again. I ran home, only to be stuck waiting again. He was another 30 minutes late. This time, he didn't even spray, just put down more traps. All that waiting and for what? The \"guarantee\" was such a waste of time, in my opinion.

I am not sure what has happened over the past 3 years, but their service and kindness has deteriorated so bad that I can hardly believe they are still in business.   They are VERY unorganized in their accounting department which is frustrating, but an even more significant issue is that they messed the outside of my home up by drilling holes all over my brick home to place screens and charged $3,320 to keep squirrels out of my attic.  The manager informed me that a new rep had done the work.  No joke!  Of course, the squirrels continued to get in my attic and Arrow never did a thing about it.  I called them out MANY times.  My husband was catching them himself with a large trap in the attic, and this service was supposed to be guaranteed.  A total waste of $3,320 and a damaged home was what they gave me.  We forgave them and tried to move forward, because that is what the Lord would want us to do.  That was the first real issue, but since then, (that was June of 2017), I have been even more appalled.  They are extremely rude, and could care less whether they keep your business or not.  The latest issue: we paid for a termite bond updating it every year for one of my businesses in particular.  The contract was signed 1/13/15.  I cancelled my monthly services with them in November due to their rudeness.  I called today to get a copy of my termite bond knowing it will need to be renewed with the new pest control company.  The manager tried to tell me that I cancelled ALL SERVICES  back in November.  Why would I have cancelled a termite bond that I had already paid and it did not renew until 1/14/2020?\nThey have lost their minds.  I have found a new pest control company for my two homes and all three of my businesses.  I hate to write bad reviews, but I also hate for someone to receive the horrific service that we have.

No one is ever in that can answer a question. They promise a call back but we never got one. I even emailed them but never got a reply that way either. Over the period of 2 weeks we probably tried to get a hold of someone 6 or 7 times and never got to talk to anyone who could help us.  As to the actual pest control at the home, we have wasps INSIDE the storm door arm hinge cylinder thing and late at night my husband said he keeps hearing skittering in the attic. This is after them doing an 'inspection' before we bought the home. We couldn't be there that day so cant say for sure they actually came, or if they did if they actually looked around. They obviously don't care about keeping accounts. This would have been an easy account for them to keep but because they have 0 customer service they lost us and hopefully anyone reading this thinking of using them. I'm going to look around and maybe use a smaller company, someone that appreciates customers and can help and answer questions if we need them. At this point if we needed them to come out and take care of pests I have no confidence that they would come out.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862317830948fc1:0xa065904d6601ade8"}

After checking our attic and seeing that the squirrel had not yet made an entrance into our house, they told us there was nothing they could do.  The guy didn\u2019t even have a ladder to check our gutters!\n\nSo we call Jim from Exclusive Wildlife & Pest Control.  He laughed when I told him the previous encounter with the Critter Capture company and then proceeded to get his ladder (that he brought himself!) and take a look at our gutters and ensure that the squirrel had not damaged our roof yet and also took the time to double check our attic. No damage was noted except for the fire pit cover we caught the squirrel tearing up the previous weekend.\n\nJim gave me two options on how to get rid of our furry new houseguest; we could capture him alive and release him elsewhere or set a trap similar to a rat trap that should kill him instantly. After much discussion my husband and I decided on the rat trap since the evenings here have been very cold and the poor squirrel may freeze to death in a live trap. Jim was so very patient as we weighed our options and was able to give me the pros and cons on both methods.\n\nAfter one failed attempt to trap him (the trap caught his tail instead of his neck) Jim text me throughout the evening to reassure me that he would get him the next day and that all would be OK. Jim returned promptly the next morning, set the trap again and was able to get the squirrel instantly. He disposed of everything and cleaned the nest out of the gutter.\n\nJim was so very pleasant to work with I will definitely be calling again if any other squirrel decides to make his home here!\nI would recommend Jim and Exclusive Wildlife to anyone who is looking for good, quality, and prompt service.\n\nThank you Jim!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBbVC-1NoRZZKkz46lqwpMR0kKMUXVSo0HNWyH=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpMImbqi6WT6TFmbGFntrWu9R1ePdVJL0QITRP=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1548888877159, "text": "Thank you Mike & Stephanie Freeman, it was my pleasure helping you rid your home of your unwelcomed guest and it was nice meeting you."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a1b2dea85547d:0x4c0bde02d4614206"}

I was short on cash so asked them to wait to provide service later this year after I saved the cash.  They convinced me to make payments, and let them do the service in March.  I post-dated checks and gave them to ATEC to hold/deposit at the first of each month for four months.  Last month they deposited a check 2 weeks early, before my paycheck to cover the check was in my checking account.  I caught this because I routinely check my accounts.  They said it was an oversight and it would not happen again.  I just checked my checking account and the check that I post-dated for 5/1/14 was cashed on 4/21/14, and again my pay will not be auto-deposited until this Friday.  I live by my word and people can trust what I say to be true, and I only do business with people and companies that I can trust in return.  I do not trust ATEC to do what they say.  As with all/most termite service companies, I have paid them many hundreds of dollars up front to provide bonding, so I am in a quandary.

We bought a new house a little over a year ago that was bonded against termites through terminix.  I had a terminix representative come over shortly after we moved in to talk to me about their options, and I signed a contract with them to keep my house bonded against termites.   About 6 months later I noticed that I had not gotten contacted by them for our twice a year termite check.  I called the company and found that they had no idea who I was.  They still had the address listed under the previous owners.  They figured I had just gotten a quote and not actually signed a contract.  After I scanned in and emailed a copy of the contract to the manager they apologized and explained that the employee that had signed me up had been fired - and he had never turned in my paperwork.  The manager thanked me for sending him the contract and assured me that it was all corrected in the computer.  He also sent someone out for our termite check.\n\nFast forward another 8 months...  I realized that it was a little over a year since we moved into our house, and again I had not heard from Terminix.  I called the company to get a very long run around. After all you can't just call the local people - all numbers go through the 800 call center.  Terminix still did not know who I was, and was calling me by the previous home owners names.  I was also told that our contract had been cancelled.  I was told the problem could only be solved through the local branch.  I waited several days to hear back from them but never got a return phone-call.  I called the call center again and they \"Escalated\" the problem. I asked them how long it would take to get a response and was guaranteed it would be withing a couple days.  Needless to say I still have not heard back.\n\nNow, due to state law, I have to pay another company to dump termidor around the house in order to get bonded through someone else.  I thought Terminix, being such a well know company, would have their act together and be able to handle something as simple as a termite bond.  I am guessing that even after more than a dozen phone calls they still have no idea who I am.

I called a wildlife person and they said to call Terminex because I already have a termite contract with them.  So, they came out and a man (I think supervisor, Devon) told me the cost would be $1,400.  Lordy, I nearly fainted.  They added insulation to my attic and sprayed the insulation with a strong disinfectant that they told me was so strong, it would kill AIDS.  They also checked out all points of entry/exit and put caps over all vents.  Devon said this equipment would allow critters to get out but not to get back in.  They also set a baited trap.  Devon said they'd be back now and then to check trap.  The only times they ever came out, I had to call them.  Once, I thought something was in the trap so I called them.  Nothing was in the trap.  It's is now the end of May, and nothing has ever been in the trap.  Devon came to my house maybe twice and before he left each time, he'd say to me, \"We won't leave until the last squirrel is gone.\"  Funny, I believe Devon was only at my house twice - seems to me that after he got the $1,400, he lost interest.  Every morning, the squirrels or whatever they are, are between the walls marching along to go outside.  Then, they return late in the afternoon and I hear them again, marching along in between my walls.  One of the critters hangs out in my office (I can hear him in there).  This weekend I dog sat for my son's dog and Stitch went straight to my office and sniffed about.  He also smelled all around at entrance to my bedroom door.  Again, at night I can hear them outside my bedroom door.  Sometimes it sounds like they are playing.  So, here I am at the end of April and short $1,400 but I still have the problem.  They wake me up when they are leaving very early in the am (when Devon told me, they'd only be able to get out of my house, not in) and I hear them return late in the afternoon.  I'm very concerned because I know they are urinating and defecating between the walls and maybe even in the attic.  Also, you can bet they are multiplying.  I just don't know what to do about this problem.  Clearly, Terminex didn't find all entrances/exits for these critters because they are still using my house as a home base and they leave and return every day.  To say I'm disappointed would be an understatement; I am very angry that after 3 months I still have the same problem.  I've wasted my time and money.  Also, scheduled appts. seem to mean nothing to these people.  First of all, they give you a range of hrs. for an appt.  (ex. 1-3) so that means you have to be home sitting around waiting for them for 2 hrs.  On 3 separate occasions, I made an appt. and they never showed nor did anyone call me to advise of some problem and to set a new time so 3 times I had to call them and tell them they didn't keep my appt. so I needed to make another appt.  Seems as though their office people (who answer the phone) could have made a simple phone call to me to let me know they couldn't make my appts.  To say that I'm angry wouldn't even begin to state how I really feel about this company!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8862651e67ffaf09:0xbb7c5b9c6a39bbd2"}

I know a lot of people say \"I don't normally leave bad reviews on here but...\" I actually don't. Anyone can see that I usually leave really good reviews, but this company has left me frustrated and when I canceled with them the guy didn't even spray the last time he came by and I know he didn't because I went outside after he left and the ground was completely dry. And to top that one off I still got charged for it... So I essentially paid the guy to come remove spiderweb and then I guess stare at my house for a few minutes and then leave because I don't know what else he did besides that. Also unlike other pest control companies I've worked with you need a contract with Cook's so that you have to stay with them even if you don't like their work and it's $40 per month and that's just to spray outside, it's an extra like $35 per month if you want them to spray inside and that's just way over charging. The company we're switching to is only $60 and that's every 3 months AND they spray inside and out. Also they require no contract though they do ask that you get on a schedule with them so that they guarantee they'll see you when you need to get your house treated. If you made it this far into this review then I'll tell you who this awesome other company is. It's LEWIS PEST CONTROL. I highly recommend Lewis, but not Cook's.

They come out inconsistently, they would call and say they would come out and not show- and it wouldn\u2019t be just a few days later because of \u201crain\u201d.  They would show weeks later unannounced so we would have to call again to ask them to come spray the backyard, after we called several times to get in the schedule in the first place.\nThe front office staff is atrocious, inconsiderate and extremely rude. My husbands phone number was blocked and we had to call from other phones to get the front office to even answer and then they would not schedule our service. They would claim to- but no one would ever call- this final straw came after we called several times over EIGHT WEEKS!\nDo not hire this group unless you want to waste your money and be disappointed!\nAs far as the actual treatment goes, that was fine. I would rate one star purely based on how terrible it was to get scheduled and actually get an answer.\n\nUpdate:\nSo we fired this company over a week ago- after we called and called, even called the Huntsville office to try to get someone at the Birmingham location to help us. (Huntsville was very responsive by the way and it turns out not related to the Birmingham office). This is what leads to my theory that either the front office blocks phone numbers or is just so lazy that she doesn\u2019t answer the phone.\nSo we finally get the front desk worker on the phone and we tell her we do not want the service for the above reasons and to remove us from the quarterly rotations. The manager did try to call to confirm why we were leaving service, but we were fed up with trying to deal so we didn\u2019t respond.\nWELL this week a worker comes out, a week after we told the front desk we didn\u2019t want service anymore,  Without a text, voicemail  or email alert and they spray our front yard AFTER WE FIRED THEM for the same dang reason!! So apparently the woman didn\u2019t even put down that we didn\u2019t want service and we asked to cancel our arrangement! So a worker sprayed and left a bill on our front door and a note that the back gate was locked. Of course, it was locked- we were not expecting service and had no notice service was coming because we had told the front desk worker to remove us.\n\nHonestly, I think the whole thing could have been avoided had TurfDoctor just hired competent front office staff- the woman who seldom answers the phone, but it is ALWAYS her when she does answer cannot get her calendar straight.

First they double signed me up for services so I got charged twice. That took nearly a month for them to straighten out and lots of phone calls. Then when that was finally fixed every time I have a appointment they cancel last minute or dont show up. Forcing me to call yet again. I will say their product does appear to work well. Then recently like many people we were struggling to pay our monthly bill. So I called to cancel for the time being. Found out the guy that sold us the contract lied about we could cancel when we wanted. He was since fired right after we signed up in October I found out. So having found out i was stuck in a contact I went ahead and figured out how to make the payment. Come the end of February/early march I get a notice saying my service was canceled. Even though I told then I would continue to pay and I really wanted to speak to the branch manager, after calling like 5 times in February he never called. I paid stupidity and they still canceled it ...now oits mid march and I'm still trying to sort this mess out. Long story short, AVOID THIS BRANCHS SERVICE!!! corporate level they are great but this branch is the WORST!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1616273434281, "text": "Thank you for bringing this to our attention, Avery.

We have living soil and use lady bugs and other insects to keep unwanted species out of the garden areas.

Bugs killed by insecticide eaten by chickens can pass trace amounts of chemicals into their eggs.\n\nBottom line.. they want the money but don\u2019t want to provide quality service. They don\u2019t make appointments on follow up visits, and they charge you for things you didn\u2019t ask for.. or worse that you told them not to do.\n\nWe refused to pay the second bill. Asked them to terminate the service. They never terminated the service and instead did another follow up visit a third time, once again spraying our yard and destroying our ecosystem.

I show up at one of my rentals and see their truck.  He has informed my tenant that she has bedbugs and that \"according to the law\" it is the landlords responsibility to pay for the 1000 dollar treatment.  What he does not know is that her nasty neighbor tenant sneaked in dogs and filled her apartment with fleas.  So her friend tracks them across the hall.  So she is mad about her friend being thrown out and tracked in fleas and now she calls pest control instead of calling maintenance.  It is a scheme between friends to get me because her nasty neighbor is thrown out.  So this company swoops in and gets right in the middle of it all.  Starts playing attorney offering legal advice   Makes a big legal mess for a fast 1000 dollar hussle.  NOT one of these bugs have I seen.  Zero evidence.  I put out bug traps all of the time to keep tabs.  So with not one bug to show me, they get a major legal problem started using fear mongering with my tenants.  Anybody that owns residential real estate as an investment, send these people a letter barring them from your property.   Some of these bug men carry around bed bug carcasses to then \"find\" on site.  It would not surprise me if they participated in such as well.  It is easy money.  Dump one out, show it, bing bang boom a easy grand.\n\nFollow up.  I put out bedbug specific traps all over the place and they trapped NOTHING.  If you will read their retort, you will see that they were on site doing an inspection and yet do not have a single bug or photo of a bug as proof of their results.  What company does any inspection and offers up NOTHING to support their results?  If they had found bugs, dont you think that a photo or a specimen would have been taken?  I have been in this business long enough to know what fraud smells like.  I have had all sorts of all types of inspections performed and NEVER did they not capture photographic or physical evidence to back it up.  No bug specimen, no photograph.  Just stirring up a legal conflict behind a nasty tenant being evicted.  The evicted tenant probably spends time \"downtown\" with the technician is the more likely scenario.\nFollow up 2 - I did several interviews by withness and even the person that contacted Active Pest Control.\nwitness 1 - they closed the door and opened it in about two minutes.  Did not have time to perform an inepction\nwitness 2 (their customer) - they did not perform an inspection,   They took my wifes word for it.\nFollow up 3 - I sent them 10 emails and their vice president is yet to call me.  They are LIARS.  No telling how many victims they play this scam on.\n\nSo no inspection, no proof,  and witnesses, including their own customer, and they are still clinging to their lie (if you will look at their retort).  These people are fraudsters and I advise anybody reading this to keep them far from your property.

I had my house treated. One year later they scheduled me an annual appointment without consulting me. I had to reschedule for a time when i could be there. They guy came and advised me that it was never termite damage that i had and it was only water damage. He also didn't service my outside stations and stated that he would have to contact me about setting up a different appointment because that required another ticket. I contacted the 1-800 number about my misinformation that i received. they asked me if i was calling to re-schedule my appointment for tomorrow( which i never set up).  I told them that i was calling about the termite damage that i never had. They assured me that they would have the local office contact me. I advised them that they wouldn't call because they never return calls(unless to sell you something). Two days later still no call.  This is only one of the incidents that ive had with them.

There are many misleading comments by a very few people who are not acquainted with Terminix policy nor their managing staff. Terminix will not pay for or fix areas in your home that had preexisting termite damage. This is in your contract. Take time to read it. Nor are they obligated to repair areas that are damage by neglect of the owner when it comes to water damage. Water damage IS NOT BUGS NOR TERMITES so no that is a neglectful situation caused by an owner not properly caring for your property by visually inspecting areas around pipes, in attic roof areas, around doors and windows on the exterior and interior of your home for leaks. It is common sense to take care of minor problems before they become major damage. And one particular person on here slammed my husband's character. I can promise you this, there is NO ONE more dedicated and honest with customers who are under his care than Ron Trahan. To indicate otherwise is a blatant lie on your part brought about by your ignorance of the terms of your contract. You makes threats of \"seeing you in court\", I would love to see you in court to try and undermine the character of my husband because I am sure you will walk away feeling ashamed and stupid for making that mistake. It is also against the law to make such false accusations so I would suggest you remove the public post which can be used to substantiate a claim against you for slanderous remarks against his character.  PLEASE NOTE Terminix has the best contract and policy in the industry for servicing your needs when it comes to bug infestation and termites and no one will treat you better as a client under his care for termite protection, than my husband, Ron Trahan.
