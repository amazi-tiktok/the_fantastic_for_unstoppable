Unfortunately, a lot of equipment brought in for repair is not worth the cost of repair. We decline to repair a lot of equipment. In these situations we offer alternative solutions such as migrating to a new computer, or providing a backup so you can purchase equipment elsewhere.\n4- There is another business in the area with a very similar name that has caused confusion in the past.

I was blown away at the price so I decided to think on it. Shawn told me the part alone cost 50 dollars. I told him I would rather look around for another computer and I would like to pick up my computer. He told me come on by and pick it up the following day. A few days later I decided to pull it apart and see how detailed the work was. As I took it apart I noticed there was no hard drive in it. I called Shawn as he proceeded to say that that happens sometimes and his kid must have forgot to put it back in when they were looking for the issue. Additionally I found the part on eBay new for less than 20 dolllars.

I was told by all four people that the deposit was necessary because people bring their computers there and never come to pick them up. I pointed out that was not the case here.

I said I was fine with that. As the conversation progressed and I pressed for a solid answer on the purchase person number four (apparently the top of the ladder there) he began to to fish tail. He said power supplies can range in price. I reminded him the technician actually showed the power supply to my son that was needed for his computer. The price tag said $80. He said you can bring the computer back and we will look at it before the EOB today. At this point I wouldn\u2019t trust these people to hold a penny. Person number four hung up me. It\u2019s a scam.

Mr Garcia had fallen for a scam artist and had allowed the person access to his computer. The laptop was terribly infected. I cleaned the system of the infections, tools, and changes made to his computer, which I cleaned and worked through midnight on Friday night to ensure he would have it back on Saturday.  To work on the computer I had to set the desktop magnifier back to normal 100% rather than 150% magnification. On opening Monday morning, 12/18, he came back into the shop very angry and abusive, complaining he couldn't see his desktop.  I set the desktop magnification back to 150%, and he told me about the password problem.  I tried to go through the 2 step verification with him to retrieve his password, but since he had previously done this multiple times at home , he had been put into \"time out\" by Google, telling him to come back and try again in a few hours.  He demanded that I call google and get it fixed, which google doesn't do (to my knowledge).  I asked him to be patient and try again later, but he continued to be abusive.  We did receive a message that the password was changed 6 days before, which would have been December 12.  He stated he thought he knew the password, but it didn't work.

To give my company 3 stars just because we are not sitting around waiting on your arrival is not fair. Has it ever dawned on you that we are not sitting around twiddling our thumbs, we are not at the bowling alley having fun, we are not at a social party ,  we are working even when we are not at the store location. It's called out on a service call.\n\nWe have a sign permanently posted to the front door that states if we are not at the store please call the number listed and a rep will arrive to assist you within 15 minutes.  We have been at this location for 10 years, during that 10-year tenure my records show that we have service your computer needs just two times once in 2013 and once in 2014. Here it is 2018 that you show up and leave a negative review because you arrive one or two times and there's no one at the store to assist you. During our 10-year tenure there have been computer stores that have come and gone however we have survived, and the reason why we survived is because we do good work and most people obey the sign that is posted on the door.\n\nIf they come and we're not present they follow the instructions they simply pick up their cell phone dial the number listed and Presto a representative arrives within 15 minutes just as stated. You have been most unfair in your review, has it ever dawned on you that we are the only full service retail computer store that's in operation in Wetumpka also within a 20 to 30 mile radius? Shouldn't that alone tell you that we are busy and there will be times when we're not at the store?  You do know that we have a telephone number that most people call, even to make appointments.\n\nDid you pick up the phone and call us to inquire about where we are what we're doing? All of the previous years that we've service you, you've never taken the time to say anything good let alone take the time to leave a positive review.  But here it is after 10 years of service you choose to leave a 3 star review not in regard to our work or the quality of work,  but you leave a 3 star review all because you arrived and no one was at the location, and you failed to pick up the phone call call.\n\nWe service residental and business customers alike, and we provide house calls and onsite service to both. When a business calls us and states there main business computer is down, we setup an onsite service call leave the store even at times when no one will be left to service the store. Why do we do this?  Its not personal its just business.  There is more money to be made in one business service call then there is for us to sit in the store waiting on residential customers to find the time to bring there computer in.   For you to reply to our absence as thow we are out on lake martin fishing rather than taking care of business is certianly not fair judgment. The good book says \"Judge not lest you be judged, for the same measure in which you judge others, you will be judged\".\n\nMaybe the next time a solicitor comes to your residential door in an attempt to sell you a product and you're not home, maybe that's solicitor should log on to Google and leave you a negative review. Not based on the fact that you didn't buy his product, but a negative review based solely on the fact that you were not even home.\n\nIn closing, I would like for you to exercise your right to choose another store to do business with.  Best Buy would be the closest and is only 45 miles away from your residence.  I just can't see the logic in us continuing to service someone who has Judged us so unfairly. If you would like to discuss this matter further, our phone number has been the same now for 10 years. I hope you have a better day."}, "gmap_id": "0x888c2694964e20c1:0x7e27f6a2f3473c19"}

Told them exactly what (SPSPECIFICALLY AN INTEL PROCESSOR, expandable RAM, motherboards, lcd screen,) I had and they told me to come on. I went to probably irritating lengths to confirm that they bought these highly specific parts. In retrospect, I thought the name,odd, but after a long day didnt put the \"mac\" portion together....or I'd have asked SPECIFICALLY if they bought non-mac items. So,  I drove out from Theodore during rush hour....and they declined everything because it wasnt MAC (wed discussed what I had, mind you) and because they couldn't test board soldered parts.... He said that in refereme to RAM memory chips, a desktop cpu, and my 500gb hard drives...they only take solid state now, he said. And so on, and so on...\n\nI dunno what the game they were playing was, but I think experimac owes me a half tank of gas and an appology. Take the gas from the guy's paycheck (if you're paying guys who think UPGRADABLE RAM is soldered to the board, anyway. And processors and graphics cards for that matter) for so politely convincing me to bring it all out there after being given models and brands.  Everything I could do to maintain some class before I left. Nothing worse than going out of your way to ensure its not a fruitless trip, only to get there and find some genius has given you bad info...and then instead of owning it....lying through his teeth ever so easily with a smile on his face. Aparently my cloths from a day under my cars hood, disguised my occupation as an aerospace engineer.... and I looked like someone who believed hard drives require soldering. In the parking lot now trying to figure gasoline vs. Dive distance.\n\nRESPONSE TO BUSINESS: No, I'm passing. At this point, I believe ive done what's necessary to prevent this happening to someone else. I've made them aware. You know who screwed the pooch, you know what they did...and for that matter, the african American young man who provides the quotes (according to the Liar) knew, and yet hid in the back and let the guy I dealt with do his thing. I'm wondering if THAT is in the fact Cosmo you speak of. In which case, he didnt do anything then, so I dont believe hed do anything NOW. I dont believe your store would have poated a response at all, if not for the star by my name.\n\nYou intentionally ignored my suggestion of gas compensation, and while your words are very well put together to give the impression of being amicable....the previous young mans words were pretty enough to get me out there. Fool me once, sir....yet not twice.\n\nA whole paragraph you've written in response that says essentially... Nothing.\n\n2 weeks Later: See folks? Still no response... Just ran and hid.

Drove 45 miles to their store was told it'd be $300.00 just for parts.  Found another place that fixed it for $85.00 in 45 minutes. I hate being lied to to get business.\nEdit for reply:\nMy wife called Tuesday 1/5/21 and told whoever answered the phone, after telling them my issue (power button on my Samsung Galaxy S10 plus fell off). She was told that it wouldn't be a problem and no appointment needed that it'd be $79.00. As I mentioned before I live 45 miles away, I had to leave work early to make sure I had ample time to get there and to get service.\nYes, you are correct,  there was not a record or service ticket made because the guy there looked at my phone said that I'd have to leave it and that the parts would be $300.00 because the board would have to be changed out that the button was all one unit. I value my time and money as much as everyone else and I left without your service. Yes, I do feel like the initial phone call was a bait and switch just to get someone in the store. You know that $19.99 oil change costs $500 because you need tires,wipers, injector cleaning and \"blinker fluid\". It's just strange that my wife was told one thing and I was told another. I called another shop  told them exactly what was wrong, they said same thing. No problem, no appointment needed.  Took phone, they looked at it and the fixed it for the amount quoted.\nFunny thing that one shop said one thing and the other one did it.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1610116073880, "text": "Jason, I cannot find a repair ticket or record of your name, are you sure you have the right place? If so, I would like to reach out to you to find out what happened, as we do not give bogus pricing to obtain business. Mistakes do happen and if this indeed did happen, I'd love the chance to make it right!\n\nWe have a proven track record of being transparent throughout our entire repair process and we pride ourselves on having some of the best pricing in the industry. I especially appreciate this review because it gives me a chance to explain our repair process.\n\nBefore I start, i'd like to point out one thing, there is a giant discrepancy between $80.00 and $300.00. The only phone parts that cost this much are some of the Genuine Samsung Display Assemblies. If another shop was able to resolve this for $85.00, it was a small part repair, like a charging port or proxy sensor, for example. (If parts were needed.) My point is, our prices would have been comparable.\n\nWhen a customer calls in to obtain a price on a particular repair we do our best to go over the details of the problem or issue they are experiencing. If we are confident we know the solution to the issue at hand, we then will give you a price or at least a ballpark figure, so they know what to expect. If we are unsure what the solution is to the issue, we will ask you to bring the device in to be diagnosed, before giving you a price on the repair.\n\nThe Process.\n\n1. Once you come into our office, we go over the details of the issue you are experiencing with your device. We will then go over repair solutions or inform you that it will need further diagnostics to obtain the solution to the issue.\n\n2. We then obtain all your contact information and create you a ticket. We may at this time give you a price on the repair. Below are a couple normal situations.\n\n*Lets go over a couple examples, an iPhone 8, the screen is damaged, everything else on the device is working as intended (we verify this,) we give you a price on the display assembly replacement and an ETA for expected completion.\n\n*Now, lets say its a Gaming Computer, it is randomly turning off or blue screening. We will not know what the issue is without diagnosing all the hardware. In this situation, we will inform you that we will need to perform additional diagnostics to know what it will take to repair this device.\n\n3. Once we have obtained the device, we then will start the diagnostics or repair in the order that it came in. We have other repairs in front of new repairs. Your device will go into the queue and will be worked on when its ticket is next. There are two exceptions to this. Most phone screen repairs, if we have the parts on hand (which we do for all iPhones and some Samsungs,) are completed in an hour or less. (Time will vary depending on the particular repair.) The other exception is, we offer a rush service, this service is paid at the time of when you drop off the device. This is paid to have the device worked on immediately, otherwise tickets are worked on in the order they are received.\n\n4. Once the repair or diagnosis is completed, we then will email, text, and/or call you, to go over any final or further details.\n\n5. Pick up your device and pay for the repairs. Once a repair is completed you can come by and pick up your device at your convenience. We also offer payment options, you can pay in person with cash or card, or you can pay your invoice through our online portal.\n\n**One quick notes, due to COVID-19, we are not allowing our customers to wait on repairs in the lobby. They must either drop them off, wait in the their car, or outside of the building.\n\nJason, thank you for allowing us to go over this process with you and potential customers that may be reading this. Feel free to reach out to me, Clint Silver, owner at ProTek. I would love to know what happened and would love the opportunity to make it right. Thank you and as always, thanks for choosing ProTek!"}, "gmap_id": "0x886268c27f02ac7b:0xf37cf7fc81bd790a"}

I debated leaving this review because I know how harmful bad reviews can be to a small business. Unfortunately, my experience with ProTek was so disappointing I felt obligated to share.\nWhen replacing my screen ProTek compromised the integrity of my water resistant IPhone XS causing it to be hyper sensitive to moisture. This resulted in my phone being corroded by light water exposure only 3days after the iPhone repair. ProTek then refused to refund me the 200$ for the faulty screen replacement which essentially destroyed my 1000$ phone. Let me be clear that my IPhone had been exposed to water on previous occasions to the screen replacement with no issues. ProTek even assured me that there was no water damage prior to the screen replacement. I had expected to have a better experience with ProTek because I had confidence in their customer reviews. Sadly, I have to say I was dissatisfied with their services. At the very least I hope others will take my experience with ProTek into consideration and proceed with caution in regards to ProTek\u2019s remarkable ineptitude with apple products.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1589823914117, "text": "I am very disappointed by this review, i'll explain why. Unfortunately for phones, we are in the warmer months and people like to be on the water and when you're on the water, these type of things will happen. I want to start off by saying that we repair and/or recover data from thousands of water damage devices. When you first brought the iPhone in for a screen replacement it was because you left the iPhone in the rain and it ruined the screen. (We informed the customer that the screen was the only thing damaged by the rain.) We replaced the screen and put a new screen seal on it, (as we do with all repairs.) The phone then came back with standing water inside the device, this amount of water is concurrent with other phones we see that have been submerged into water. The customer asked for a warranty on the screen, unfortunately we cannot warranty water or physical damage. (Simply putting a new screen on this iPhone would not resolve the issue, given the current condition.) In a case like this, with standing water inside the device, we would need to let the water dry (we have tools to speed this process up.) After the water has dried, it will leave corrosion behind, which will need to be cleaned. We would then remove the logic board from the iPhone housing, clean it with our Sonic Cleaner, and then test the device for further component damage. We then would replace the components needed to repair the device. More than likely we could have saved this customers phone, had the customer let us complete the water damage assessment on this device.\n\nPlease remember that iPhone's are not water proof, they are water resistant, and each iPhone has its own water resistance rating. We have seen water damage happen in pretty much every way, from being in your pocket and sweating, to being on the bathroom counter while taking a shower, and to drops in the ocean. Each iPhone handles each exposure differently, because in each exposure, the conditions are different. If you are going to be around water, buy a water proof bag, put your phone into the bag and use it from the outside the bag, only to remove it if you need to make a phone call. This will drastically minimize the chance of water damage. I hope this reply has answered any questions as to how we handle water damaged phones here at ProTek. If you have any questions, concerns, or just want some friendly advice, feel free to contact us at your convenience!"}, "gmap_id": "0x886268c27f02ac7b:0xf37cf7fc81bd790a"}

Seeing an ad for a national company in Huntsville that did computer repair I took it there. 3 weeks later and I get a call that says they can't fix it locally and need to send it off, $75 please.\n\nDiscouraged, I collect my laptop and buy a new one. But then I realize I need documents that were stored locally on the old laptop. So searching the internet, I find ProTek. I call and they tell me they can recover my  data.\n\nSo I bring my old laptop and then they say, hey, can we try and fix it? Sure, I say. One week later, they've fixed my laptop, and it's up and running for less then what I paid for a new laptop!\n\nFantastic work!

So they call the Verizon retail store in hazel green and the girl told her to take it to ch pc repair and he would do it.  My mothers phone worked FINE when she took it in there.  She could do anything and everything on her phone.  When she went to pick it up the phone would not even turn on.   He said he tried both old and new battery and it still wouldn't come on.  So he took the screen off and put it on another phone and the screen works.  So he is saying that the mother board is messed up.  He can check it out BUT he'd have to charge her to do it.  Momma said he really messed the back up,  like it was melted!!  I met her up there and his attitude is  basically \"screw you \".  He insisted that the phone was not working when she took it in.  I asked him why he didn't call her and tell her and he said because she didnt leave a number.  To which my reply is \"when you work in customer service like this it is your responsibility to get a number so you can get in touch with the person\". He is a total jerk!!  He takes ZERO responsibility for his screw ups.  Said he was not going to make it right.  But he did tell her that he'd buy the phone from her when she bought a new one.  Then he threatened to call the cops on us \"because it was after hours, he was closed and we wouldn't leave\".  He never asked us to leave, period.  He brags about how much money he makes per year and all of his vehicles and house is paid for.  Good for him.  I dont give a \ud83d\udc01but what he has and doesn't have.  And now Marina tells us that her stepfather took a phone to him that was kinda messed up and was going to get the guy to repair it.  When he went to pick the phone up or really was messed up!!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1539369673755, "text": "Carla,\n\nThis issue is between me, and my client Pam Lanford. You came into my office, clearly disgruntled. You then continued to talk over me without giving me a chance to respond or explain the situation.\n\nPam visited my store with her device, which she believed to have a battery issue. She provided an aftermarket battery and had explained that an attempt was made, using a hairdryer, to open the casing and replace the battery, prior to me looking at the device. When the device was dropped off, I was in the middle of an extensive repair, as well as having a conversation with a different client. Not only that, but the device was dropped off quickly, without any contact information, and with very few details.\n\nI replaced the battery with the after-market battery she provided and then attempted to boot up the device, but to no avail. I investigated further but was unable to find a solution. Pam then arrived to pick up her device, and she was, understandably, very upset to find it not working. She wanted it in working order right then and there, and while I understand her sentiments, I can only do so much so quickly. I needed more time to troubleshoot and determine the problem and possible solution, but she would not allow it. I was even willing to reimburse her with a fair value for her device.\n\nI have been in business for more than 10 years now. I work hard every day, and I like to think that I am very good at what I do. I manage hundreds of computers monthly, and I repair and fix many devices daily (thousands of devices yearly). I can remove a device's back/screen in a few minutes with simply a bit of heat and some playing cards, and I have never had any issues. I would never damage a device intentionally. I treat all repairs as if they were my own. That being said, mistakes can (and do) happen as there are many risks involved with these repairs, but I do my best to make things right. To me, it's not just about collecting payment for the services I provide\u2014although that is necessary for me to stay in business and provide for my family. It's about building long-term relationships with my clients, and I deeply enjoy helping and providing knowledge to my clients.\n\nThis is the first complaint I have received with the BBB, and I would truly like to resolve the issue, and have the opportunity to change your outlook on me and your experience with my business. CH PC Repair is my business\u2014it has my name in it, a fact that I am proud of and would never change.\n\nSincerely,\nChad Harbin\nCH PC Repair"}, "gmap_id": "0x88623f52db6fed93:0x398f7a17a9216be3"}

I was asked twice if I wanted a receipt, once by the computer then by the rep (the receipt already came to my email,  along with the $ withdrawn from my account when I placed the order).  I had to sign the credit card panel.  Honestly, I don't have to do all that when I order $200 worth of groceries online for pickup at Walmart.

Instead only asks if I want to sign up for a membership a few times after I decline repeatedly.  She puts my order in the bag and walks off before I can take my card out of the chip reader and back into my wallet.  Didn't even get a thank you for shopping.
