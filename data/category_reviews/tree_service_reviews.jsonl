To begin with, the estimator came out and gave me a price on having 2 trees cut down and having the stumps ground - trees are in the back yard behind a locked gate. I was told to expect a phone call that afternoon for scheduling. After 3 days I called the office and was told that they never received my estimate but they would put me on their schedule. A date was set and then was moved several times. I scheduled someone to come do bobcat work around that date as well. I then received a call asking if they could come that day (Thursday) and do the work. I said yes and left my office to go home and meet them. They finally showed up around 4:45 in the afternoon and got one tree down and told me that they would be back at 8:30 am the next day. I had to call the office at 3 pm to see if they were still coming to finish the work since I had to take another day to stay home from work. I waited to hear back and was told that they should be out sometime that afternoon. The crew finally showed up around 5:30 pm. They were able to get the second tree down but did not have the equipment to grind the stumps and I was told that they would come Saturday morning to finish up. Saturday came and went without anyone showing up and no phone call. The following Wednesday I get a call from the office asking if I was happy with the work and to confirm that they had removed all the debris from my yard, I told the person on the phone that they were not supposed to remove debris but they were supposed to grind stumps. She was unaware of this and said that she would make a note of it and have someone call me. Later that afternoon I got a phone call letting me know that someone would be out the next morning to grind stumps. I waited the entire day at home after taking off work, again, and NTS was again a no call no show. At this point I gave up on having anyone come complete the job. A couple weeks later, the company showed up without calling to try and finish grinding 2 stumps. The guy told my wife that he couldn't finish because there was some concrete and rocks that the didn't initially see and that he would need to come back later to finish the work. At this point I have had to call and cancel on my bobcat guy twice, which has cost both of us money. This job was started in April, and it is now the end of May. If you don't have anything to do and want to work with a company that is completely incompetent with communication, then National Tree Service should be ok.

They did a drainage project for me where I explicitly described the design I wanted and it incorporated solid PVC pipe.  On the day of the job, the workers showed up with corrugated pipe.  When I called the owner, he stated that PVC would be $800 more, so feeling like I didn't want to start over with another contractor, I told him to go ahead.  Then I found out that a portion of the water to be drained to the street running from the downspout  was going through perforated corrugated pipe (pipe with holes).  They assured me that the water would be moving and would not leak out into already saturated ground (yeah, right).  Then I came home to find that the grate to catch water coming off the sidewalk was about 1 and a half to 2 inches away from the sidewalk, requiring the water to run over dirt before entering the grate.  The owner tried to tell me that it would be no problem and the bare dirt would not erode despite water constantly running over it.  I insisted that concrete be put between the sidewalk and grate to keep the water from washing out the dirt.  When I came home, I found they had used a type of caulk between the grate and the sidewalk, and had done a messy job of it, I don't know if that much caulk will ever cure.  After two days it is still soft.  Additionally, where they cut through the curb, the re-concreting was extremely poorly done.  It looked like they didn't even use a trowel, much less a curbing tool.  It looked like they basically packed the concrete on with their fingers and left it.  Part of the contract called for doing a brick border along the sidewalk.  After I paid them for the portion of the contract for the drainage, they informed me that they were waking away from the contract and that I needed to find someone else to do the edging.  The pity is, the subcontractor they had lined up to do the masonry work actually sounded very competent.  Bottom line, this is a company that, in my opinion, cut corners at every opportunity, poorly designed the project, provided shoddy workmanship, and then walked away with nearly half of the contracted work unperformed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626519de7ef85b:0x4b6cae1b92594858"}

I contracted with them to do drainage work, a sprinkler system and landscape lighting.\n\nI was told this would take 3 weeks to complete, with each phase occurring on consecutive weeks. The project as a whole took almost 12 weeks to complete, and this was only because I hounded them with calls multiple times per week.\n\nThe drainage work was the first part, it seemed to be fine, though the French drain was not placed the complete length that was discussed originally. Also the fingers of river rich were put in to stop erosion, but almost no grass seed was put in afterwards, so nothing but weeds grew in between the river rock.\n\nThe second piece was the sprinkler system. This was put in during a day, but the ground was not backfilled properly and they needed to come back out to fix it. We were told that they would put down grass seed after the lighting job was completed. The lighting work was not completed for another 8 weeks, and there wasn\u2019t any seed put down afterwards. They were also supposed to aerate and oversees the lawn, but since they could not get their mower into our backyard, they told us they would come back with a smaller mower to pull the aerator later. This never happened.\n\nI had to call them 2-3 times a week for 8 weeks to get them to complete the lighting. Part of it was landscape lighting, the other portion was putting in a fan and spotlight in/on our screened patio. The wiring was placed so shallow, that it came out of the ground within a week and they had to come back to fix. The light and fan was supposed to be put in by an electrician, but was just put in by the owner and his friend. They put a cheap conduit over the electrical wire that didn\u2019t even cover the wire.  They sent an electrician out to fix the wiring, but he just rigged another kind of conduit on the bare wire to cover it up.  The uplighting for the trees was sold to us at $65 a light. I just found the lights online for $45 for a 4-pack of lights.\n\nWe just gave up with this company and figured we would just be stuck with this work. Over the last year, I kept burying and covering up the wire as it came out of the ground and have been trying to repair the grass in the area where they did sprinkler and drainage work. We are still fighting massive weeds from the lack of follow through on planting grass after their work was completed.\n\nI am writing this review today after I just finished replacing 3 lights that stopped working and half of the wiring that was put in for the landscape lights. Turns out they believe that wire nuts are not necessary and you only need to tape wires together with electrical tape before putting it in the ground.\n\nIf you are looking for a company to do landscaping work for you, stay very far away from this company. You will only be sorry if you choose them.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1533529694432, "text": "Thank you for bringing all of this to our attention.  Unfortunately scheduling can be a challenge when dealing with different elements and sometimes issues arise.  For example the drainage was delayed due to an unmarked water pipe, flooding the drainage trenches.   The ceiling fan was installed by a certified electrician, as was the wiring for the fan, flood lights and outdoor switch.  We would be more than happy to provide the name of the electricians that provided these services.   The contract states that there is a year warranty covering defects in workmanship and materials.   Is regrettable that we did not have the opportunity to fix the issues that you were having with your lights, thus alleviating some of your frustration.

I most definitely certain the grinder I would have rented would not have allowed me to finish in an hour, or as completely. This was a great decision, and I wouldn\u2019t even contemplate doing it myself again.

However, over time, we noticed the results became less & less apparent, and the invoices seemed to become higher & higher.  Then, finally at some point last winter, there was some apparent weed spraying along my property\u2019s entire fenceline that left behind a 3-foot wide swath of dead grass, which became painfully obvious when the lawn came out of its winter dormancy in late March 2021.  All TruGreen tech had to say was that it must\u2019ve been from a cold winter & some other BS, and that maybe it would eventually grow back; however, none of our many other neighbors that don\u2019t use TruGreen, but do have the same type of centipede grass, the same type of shadow box fence, and the same type of winter weather showed no signs of this kind of problem.  So, I have to call B.S. on this lame-brain & accept-no-responsibility explanation.  TruGreen management was notified numerous times about this complaint, and we never got a reply from anyone about it.  Needless to say, we were forced to cancel this expensive & negative impact lawn service.  Now, I have the wonderful task of ripping-up thousands of square feet of dead grass along my entire fenceline, and purchasing expensive & dirty sod to put it all back myself.  Then, I have the wonderful task of watering it all back to health very early in the morning for the next several weeks.

The bow in the wall was due to APEX's contractors putting inch of thin set or mortar behind the tile, inch thick!\nThe floor pan was not sealed or glued correctly. This was pointed out to me two other contractors who have given us bids.\nAPEX also did not install the left counter properly so they cut the stone back splash and side splash to try to make it fit.

Bama Bob's tree service was suppose to be there on a Friday, they called that day twice to give us delays in their arrival. The third call cancelled Friday and confirmed for Saturday.  They arrived around 9 am and we're slow in getting started. Everything was going well until they dropped the trees without removing the tops, which was what they were supposed to do. Bama Bob did not give a written estimate, or written instructions to the less than competent crew. Only one of the crew was working, the other two stood around and one played with his cell phone all day. They dropped the trees, with out topping them, and damaged two other trees and other items in the yard. Then it started to rain then they left without letting us know, they just left. Then through the rest of the following week until the day before I had to return home, he would be at other jobs without completing ours. Also, Bob was not very interested in the damage his crew caused but after much bickering he reduced the price a bit. So after rain delays and Bob not showing up, it is day 11 of my trip and they are finally here. They said they would be here first thing in the morning and they showed up at noon or so, now another wasted day with Bob and his crew, but the job is at least done.

He arrived on-time for the initial survey and promptly sent us an estimate. He also arrived on-time a couple of days later to begin removal. He spent 2 days to remove the trees and do clean-up. He also applied herbicide to all of the stumps to ensure they would not send up shoots.\n\nAfter waiting a week or so for the herbicide to do it's job, Doug returned (on-time!) and ground down the stumps, then did more clean-up. When he was finished, except for a few wood chips and flat, bare earth, you couldn't tell that any trees were ever there.\n\nDoug is a true professional. He's courteous, friendly and easy to talk to.

Yesterday, Chris took down one large Bradford Pear tree and heavily trimmed one large Hackleberry tree for me.  He was able to come out the day after I spoke with him.  Chris's \"Climber\", Mark, worked quickly and safely at very high heights.  I watched the entire operation on both trees and Mark's skill level become apparent very quickly as being professional & skilled.  He exhibited acute knowledge as to the cut sequence, the manner of cuts to be made, and the procedure to lower very heavy limbs to avoid a fence that actually adjoined one of the trees.  Joshua provided the ground operation and worked in conjunction with Mark to ensure limbs were dropped in a safe area.  As an old guy who previously worked in Project Management, I tend to grade companies on Cost, Schedule, and Performance.  Chris' Tree Service performed very well (and as we agreed on), was on time and extremely prompt, and at a reasonable cost.

I was surprised at how much care they took to make my yard look as normal as could be. Now, shout outs. First I want to thank Bob Young.  When I first called Eastern Tree I was told that someone would come to survey my job site and give me an estimate of the cost of the job. I figured that it would be about 3-5 days till I saw someone. The very next afternoon Mr. Young arrives and does a very thorough assessment. I was amazed at his knowledge of trees plant life in my yard. And what a professional and gentleman he was. The cost quote blew me away. Not only was it fair it was honest. The second shout out goes to the 2 ladies that run the tree service office. They are Ms. Donna and Ms. Michelle. If you want to talk to the most sweetest, kindest, knowledgeable (about all aspects of the tree service business), and  the most professional office personnel  you will ever meet; then contact them. Oh, by the way, the other local tree service companies ever returned my calls. I was shocked because I used their services in the past.

These guys are unbelievable.\n\nOur neighborhood was recently hit by a tornado causing damage to homes and property.  Within hours after the storm, a neighbor called Eastern Tree Service (ETS) to come help with restoration.  ETS arrived promptly and began calling in its crew and within hours the properties that were being serviced by ETS were transformed back to a livable state.  ETS started removing trees and debris from our homes before noon and by the end of the day they had cleared the trees and hauled away all debris.  The stumps were removed the next morning.   I was amazed by how well these guys worked as a team allowing them to get the job done as efficiently as possible.  They were very respectful of my property and went to great lengths to make sure they didn\u2019t tear down what was left of trees and shrubbery.   I was also impressed with how the owner was working side by side with his employees.   It was evident they took great pride in doing the job right.\n\nLast but certainly not least this company was very reasonable on its pricing.  Prior to this incident, I had several trees removed by other tree services and ETS\u2019 pricing was in line with what I was quoted previously.  I was very appreciative of this fact since I had heard countless stories of price gouging in storm cleanup.  After all the cleanup was complete, the owner stopped by one last time to make sure everything was handled to our satisfaction.\n\nOn a final note, what impressed me most about this company is what the owner did for an elderly neighbor.  Having found out this neighbor was weak from having chemo treatment, he restored his property at almost no cost.  The owner is not aware that anyone knew about this gift which makes it even more commendable.\n\nGreat job guys!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1555590638949, "text": "We are very humbled by your kind words !

I had gotten a call from my TruGreen rep Jonathan about setting up service.  We had service from TruGreen 2 years ago and stopped mostly because we didn't feel that the service was worth what we were paying.  We would get call around 9 AM for same day services so we hardly ever got our backyard treated, etc.  Also could never get ahold of a person at the Huntsville Office to talk about our service.  Well 2 weeks ago we decided to sign up again.  We signed up for the yearly service and I also asked about getting aeration set up for the lawn. So here we are 2 weeks later and we were told it would be on a Thursday and Friday of the week after we signed up.  Thursday rolled around and it was raining so of course they wouldn't be out.  I called Jonathan (no VM) so I texted him to find out that they would be out on that Friday.  Friday came and went without any service.  Texted Jonathan and was told it would be today (Monday).  So it's Monday and I texted Jonathan to find out when so I can unlock our back gate, etc and was told to go to the app to find out when they would be out. There is no place on the app to check this so I started a chat with an \"agent\" only to be told to talk to my representative on when they would be out.  In the mean time we have had two lawn applications in a matter of a week.  I'm beyond frustrated with True Green and will never recommend them for my friends and family.

I had TruGreen in 2018 and at the end of the year decided to end service. There were multiple times they didn\u2019t show up and I had to call and complain.  And at no point in that year was my back yard treated and it was overcome with weeds. I didn\u2019t think I should have to chase down a service I was paying for. At the beginning of October a sales rep came by and I decided after speaking with him to give it another shot. He seemed horrified by the difference between my front and back yards. He gave me his cell phone number as a personal guarantee that he would handle any issues of the person not coming out. Because of the time of year it was he told me that I would be services every 6-8 weeks. Which, if you\u2019re any good at math, would tell you that at MOST I *may* have two treatments before the end of the year. On October 24th I texted him and said that there must be some confusion because I had already been charged twice, and when looking on the website it appeared I was going to have another one within the next two weeks. He told me he would credit me one of the services I had received and push back my next service. He was going to follow up with me the next day. On November 5th I reached out to him again, I had not received a follow up and already had a pending charge for another treatment. No response. November 6th I texted again, this time he said he was going to get it resolved and a credit issued. I should have that credit within three business days. On November 15th I had still not received that credit, and a technician showed up at my house to treat. I sent my sales rep another text. At this point I had already been billed 109.87 in a month and a half, when I should have been charged less than 80 through the end of the year. I explained what I had been billed, the lack of credits I received after being told it was coming, and the frustration I felt for being signed up for tree and shrub service that I didn\u2019t ask for and didn\u2019t need. I explained I expected a refund of 79.92 for the two treatments that I should have never received, and that I would like to cancel my service. He responded with a \u201cYes ma\u2019am\u201d. On November 20th I sent a follow up text to be sure it was handled. The sales rep has red the text but not responded. It is November 23rd and there is no refund to my account, I have no trust in TruGreen that this will be handled in a professional manner. If this isn\u2019t resolved by the end of the month I will be going to the BBB.

I take extra precautions, in accordance with the International Society of Arborists, to ensure the safety of myself and my crew.

The crew leader on site, Houston, was super professional, friendly, and  and explained the details of our contact clearly before work began. They moved items in the yard we didn't have time to move (because of their amazing quick turn around time on starting the job) without complaint. They ensured we were happy with the job before they agreed to accept payment, and offered to stay for additional work. (We asked for the power lines to be cleared and they obliged.) The owner, Kevin came out and discussed plans the day before, then came back to check the crew's work to ensure it was both to his satisfaction as well as ours.

They showed up late (without calling) to give me an estimate, and then showed up unannounced the day they came to work. But then things took a surprising turn..\n>   They were hired to fell one tree and heavily trim the lower branches of another. To save money and to give me a project involving strenuous exercise, they were not required to do any cleanup work. When they asked about my cleanup plans, I mentioned using my ATV trailer to move the debris to the street for pickup by the city. At their suggestion I moved the trailer into the work area. Suddenly the logs and branches magically found their way onto the trailer until it was full, with the remainder piled neatly nearby. Despite not being paid for it, they worked hard to minimize the cleanup work remaining for me, a fat 74 year old retired soldier.\n>  It was also interesting and entertaining to watch their tree climber work. He knew exactly where and how to make cuts to have the pieces fall right where he wanted them. And while 20+ feet up into the tree being trimmed, he asked me over and over what else I wanted cut. He never suggested being done until I was satisfied.\n>   Finally, when the work was done, they did a last minute walk-around to check for any tools left behind, and to pick up more debris so I wouldn't have to.\n>   The team's work (and work ethics) more than made up for the early communications problems.

Also, I was interested in other services your company might have provided but in light of this entire process lacking professionalism and follow through I wouldn't be confident in ANY work you could provide.

They require that they choose the items you want.  The crepe myrtle they installed in my yard last year is nothing but tree stems this year.  I have called several times and was told by Amanda she would have Micheal come by at a specified date and time and look at everything and discuss it with me .  On the scheduled day, i received a 'Health Check' email from Amanda explaining that Micheal had come by earlier than anticipated and then she went on to explain what he found regarding my tree and the bushs.  First off, if he came by, i did not know anything about it because he surely did not ring my doorbell; Secondly, if he did come by, he trespassed onto my fenced in backyard to look at the tree.  I find this highly unacceptable. When i called these people last year, the owner Jacob came out, whom i consider the 'money man.\"  i explained to him that i dont have a green thumb at all and need some kind of consultation regarding what i need to do to get my yard up to speed.  All he proceeds to do is write down how much everything is going to cost me without allowing someone who knows about horticulture to come out and discuss with me first about what would be the proper plants i need based on my unique environment. Needless to say, i'm back at the drawing board, trying to find a landscaper who will listen to my cries of help and actually help me.

Amanda at the office made the scheduling and transaction a breeze. Tahj and Dan started work promptly the day of the project and hammered out most of the clean out before lunch. After lunch Eric and Pedro joined the team and the entire crew finished the job. In 10 hours they had completely cleaned out and dug-up/removed the weeds and 12 over grown bushes from the front, back, and side beds, removed 5 stumps, cleaned out an over grown play area and had taken out 2 dying trees. By night fall, they had the yard mulched and ready for phase 2 - replanting in the spring. The following morning Tahj dropped by to mow the grass and edge the entire property, just as he had promised. You can tell Tahj gave a damn, and treated the place like his own. Eric brought the knowledge and had no problem answering my questions about plants and things while they worked. Pedro kept them honest, while Dan provided the laughs.
