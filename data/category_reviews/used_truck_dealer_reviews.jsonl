I scheduled an appointment and dropped my vehicle off at 7:00 am on my way to work and was assured that it would be completed by 4:00 pm when I came back.  It was almost 7:00 pm before they were complete, so I sat there for 3 hours waiting.  When they were complete they told me that I would need to come back and get a ball for the hitch since they didn't have an that fit the hitch in stock.  This defeated the purpose of needing a hitch before the weekend, but I borrowed a ball from a neighbor.  When I hooked the trailer up, I noticed the lights were not coming on. Something was wrong with the electrical.\n\n3 days later I called and they said to come in and pick up the ball.  When I arrived they said that they were mistaken and did not have one.  I mentioned that the electrical was faulty, but they could not look at it that day since the trailer hitch guy was not there.\n\n1 month later I called(they never called me back) and was told they had a ball that fit and I picked it up.  Once again, they said no one was there to look at my electrical issue.\n\nA few months later I called to make an appointment to have the hitch fixed.  Their phone disconnected me three times and I gave up after wasting 30 minutes on hold.\n\nWhen I go by the location and finally make an appointment, i'm told it will cost me upwards of $100 to have it repaired since it only had a 30 day warranty.  They said there was no record of me having ever mentioned the issue before.\n\nOverall, this location has awful customer service.

The first time when I moved to this area I dropped off my UHaul equipment here and a middle aged Army Veteran greeted me and helped with the process of the return. He also helped me to figure out the area and gave me some local information which was very helpful. Now when I moved from this area I picked up my UHaul from Quality Used Automotive and I would not recommend picking up from that location but I had to unfortunately and the UHaul equipment dolly and pads were not in the truck and it was incredibly dirty. So I took the truck and drove only 4 minutes back to this initial UHaul location where I had another amazing experience. The General Manager, Clay Reed JR, met me in the store and I told him what was going on. He helped me get a dolly and pads as well as offered to clean my truck for me free of charge. His kindness, professionalism, and overall customer care is the entire reason UHaul still has my business.

I brought the car back in on Monday the 4th and told them the service engine light came on and something under the car was rattling. I was told by the owners son that he didnt know anything about standard shift cars and they would not be responsible for anything wrong with it. Almost 3 weeks later the car starts running hot. When my husband got to me to check it out he opened up the radiator to find that it is full of J.B block seal he runs over 80 gallons of water through the radiator trying to clean it out to no avail. We replaced the thermostat that was so coroded with block seal it was rusted up. I called and left a message with Pierce auto sales telling them that the car was running hot and because someone was trying to cover up a cracked block or blown head gasket and there was so much block seal in the radiator and engine that I didn't know if the car was going to make it home and that I really needed someone to call me back because I had no way to get it home. I never recieved a call back.It cost me $60 to rent a car dolly to drag it home. Now the car came with an outside warranty but because \"whoever\" filled the motor up with block seal to hide a major problem until they could find an idiot \"me\" to take the car off of there hands the warranty will not cover the car. So now I have a blown up car sitting in my yard that I drove less then a month and repo men knocking on my door because they want there car back and still after all this time I have yet to recieve a call from anyone at Pierce Auto Sales.  I recieved more help and sympathy from the repo man in 10 minutes then I have from Pierce in 2 months. I paid $1500 down for a car that didn't even last until the first payment was due. I dont bash people or businesses but i have tried every other way to get them to talk to me. I just want my money back so I can get a car that runs and won't leave me on the side of the road less then a month after purchase.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a56497104639d:0x842e60c3c94517bb"}

MGM told him to take it there. This was a month ago and the car has been parked since. Luckily he has a motorcycle he could use to get back and forth to work, although the weather has not been kind to him in Pensacola where he is stationed. This put him at risk on a daily basis. He did not want to drive the car until MGM advised him what to do at that point. Car is still sitting at this point. He had to get another loan to purchase an engine and get the car repaired. I don't suggest anyone doing business with this company. They have zero integrity and terrible character! There are many more details to this story that back everything I am saying.

It was such a bad experience that I will never use U-Haul again.  On Dec. 30, 2015 I reserved a pickup truck for rental the following day at the location at 3713 Governor's Drive in Huntsville.  I was scheduled to pick this vehicle up at 11:30am.  I showed up a few minutes early and the location was empty.  A few minutes later, Tammy, the General Manager comes in from the back and informs me that my reservation has been moved to the location across town at 4400 University Drive in Huntsville.  I needed to have the truck in a certain location to pick up some furniture by noon of that day and this was already placing me behind schedule considering that I was never notified in advance of this change.  A few minutes later I arrive at the location on University Drive to attempt my pick up.  While waiting in a line of 5 people, I start to become stressed because it is already 11:45am.  The General Manager at this location, Paulette Boehlke, informs me that it doesn't matter when I was scheduled to pick up this truck.  She states, that I will have to wait in line while she continues taking peoples orders and then going outside to fit them for their truck.  I am a bit in a panic because this is not what I expected considering that I had reserved the truck for a specific pick up time for a reason.  I finally left the location because I could not see it fit to pay U-Haul for the poor job they had done with having my reservation ready for pick up that morning.  All this especially considering they have a sign in office guaranteeing that they will have the truck you order at the right location at the right time available for you.  I cancelled my order with U-Haul and was able to reserve a truck with another moving company.  Tammy, from the first location called while I was on the way to pick up the new truck and tried to get me to come by and pick up a truck that was now there at her location on Governor's Drive.  She claimed that the reason I couldn't pick up the truck at the scheduled time and scheduled location was because the call center had double booked that time.  The pick up that was sitting outside her location when I was their earlier, she said, had been left by someone that had not left their keys with her.  Either way, the whole thing was crap.

I got to my appointment 30 minutes early to give plenty of time for a 90 minute install. I had to call and get someone at 1:30 to pick me up after the installation couldn't be completed in time and had to get another ride back to your establishment. During the install a bracket was removed that was not part of the written instructions. Three factory bolts were removed from that bracket and only one was reinstalled. I picked the bolts up off the floor. The manager Mr. Hall ended up giving me $50 off the price but, made sure the shop got the full install money thus rewarding themselves for a job poorly done. He accused me of raising my voice and I apologized telling him I am hard or hearing and wear hearing aids showing him one. He then stated he was done talking with me and tried to charge me for priority shipping when another clerk had removed the shipping because of late delivery. I informed him of that and he decided he'd best call his employee at home to verify. So, more time waiting... I am very unhappy with your operation. It took an hour and a half to finally settle with Mr. Hall and get out the door with him going into his office and refusing to come out after it had been finished and was waiting on me to pick it up...   Finally, at the end of the transaction I thanked him and stretched out my hand and he refused to shake it. Mr. Hall has a chip on his shoulder that needs to be challenged. I remain unhappy with your service. In the past I have rented storage space for 6 months, rented vehicles to move but that business will go elsewhere. I will be needing storage again but another company that can do the job correctly, that doesn't have an attitude that they were doing me a favor by poor quality work...that other company will get my business.

It was such a bad experience that I will never use U-Haul again.  On Dec. 30, 2015 I reserved a pickup truck for rental the following day at the location at 3713 Governor's Drive in Huntsville.  I was scheduled to pick this vehicle up at 11:30am.  I showed up a few minutes early and the location was empty.  A few minutes later, Tammy, the General Manager comes in from the back and informs me that my reservation has been moved to the location across town at 4400 University Drive in Huntsville.  I needed to have the truck in a certain location to pick up some furniture by noon of that day and this was already placing me behind schedule considering that I was never notified in advance of this change.  A few minutes later I arrive at the location on University Drive to attempt my pick up.  While waiting in a line of 5 people, I start to become stressed because it is already 11:45am.  The General Manager at this location, Paulette Boehlke, informs me that it doesn't matter when I was scheduled to pick up this truck.  She states, that I will have to wait in line while she continues taking peoples orders and then going outside to fit them for their truck.  I am a bit in a panic because this is not what I expected considering that I had reserved the truck for a specific pick up time for a reason.  I finally left the location because I could not see it fit to pay U-Haul for the poor job they had done with having my reservation ready for pick up that morning.  All this especially considering they have a sign in office guaranteeing that they will have the truck you order at the right location at the right time available for you.  I cancelled my order with U-Haul and was able to reserve a truck with another moving company.  Tammy, from the first location called while I was on the way to pick up the new truck and tried to get me to come by and pick up a truck that was now there at her location on Governor's Drive.  She claimed that the reason I couldn't pick up the truck at the scheduled time and scheduled location was because the call center had double booked that time.  The pick up that was sitting outside her location when I was their earlier, she said, had been left by someone that had not left their keys with her.  Either way, the whole thing was crap.

Today, I took my vehicle in for a tow hitch at 8am.  It was only supposed to take a few hours.  It ended up taking them until 2pm to finish it, because they kept taking the installer off the job to handle the crowd.  You should have a separation of concerns when running a business.  That installer should've been able to focus on his work instead of having constant distractions.  In that time, he managed to somehow run my battery dead.  After I finally hooked a 5x8 trailer up, I found out that the hitch was slanted towards the ground, making it impossible to use a trailer.  I ended up having to have the movers who were moving most of my stuff take everything, but the stuff they couldn't take (i.e. aerosols, propane, gas cans, etc) which caused my move to take longer and cost more.  My muffler also was rattling against the hitch which was very annoying.  I finally got to my destination and had the hitch uninstalled, and and a full refund was made.  However, the installer at my new destination found damages made to my vehicle from the initial install.  So, now I\"m going to have to take it to my dealership for repairs, which will be getting paid for by UHaul's claim agency.  If only all the time that I put into this whole ordeal could be compensated too!\n\nMy 2nd issue was that my calls to check the status were being routed to their corporate office who kept claiming they were unable to give any status on my install, and they discouraged me from directing my call to the location, claiming they probably wouldn't answer.  Corporate customer service sucks basically.  What they should've done was figure out what was going on with it instead of just leaving me out in the dark, which basically forced me to drive back down there and wait on it.\n\nAlso, don't buy boxes from these people.  In order to get the \"discounted\" rate, you have to buy them by the bundle.  I put quotes on \"discounted\", because Home Depot sells them individually for the same price...actually, cheaper.  Plus you can get an additional 5% discount if you have a Home Depot credit card.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b6847403349:0x2e03344eb6e6a43e"}

We only considered a \"No CreditCheck\" dealer because my mom couldn't get approved due to signing on a vehicle for a family member who didn't fulfill their credit agreement. We were told by the salesman named Austin that we only needed proof of income and a valid driver's license. First my mom was declined due to insufficient income so I agreed to be her co-signer. After giving Austin all of my information, including proving income and place of residence, he told us to give him 20- 30 minutes to get a response back from corporate. We returned to the dealership appropriately 40 minutes later feeling hopeful that my mom would get a car. We sat at Austin's desk and he told us that we couldn't be approved because we didn't live together! I've never heard of anything like this before! We wasted two hours of our time while they concocted up a lie for why they couldn't approve us! It was very hurtful and embarrassing! It took a lot for me to even go into a place like that but I trusted them and swallowed my pride just to help my mom. They advertise \"No CreditCheck\" but it's a lie! They looked on her credit bureau and saw the repossessed vehicle and turned her down without even giving her a chance to explain.

He said ownership was changing and his dad was going to be leaving and to give him a couple weeks and he would give us an awesome deal on it which was fine because we needed to sell our vehicle to purchase that one. After 2 weeks we had a buyer for ours and was told to call the following week and set up time to do the deal on the vehicle I wanted so bad. Well I called 2 days ago and left message for him and told them it was about the blazer, she said ok he will call you back. Never heard anything. My husband calls up there today and he isn't in so my husband asked if blazer was still there. Guy says no we sold it back last week.\ud83d\ude21 Well good damn thing we told guy that was buying ours that we couldn't do deal until the day we was able to get other one.

When we first got the trucks that you were interested in onto our lot we expected titles to arrive within a week or so, but after more than 3 weeks and still no titles we decided to hold off on sales for the trucks until all titles are in.\nI'm sorry that you interpreted our integrity as racism. If we discriminated against people solely based on their color, we wouldn't be in business today as over 65% of our sales are by people of color. We are in the business of selling equipment and treating people fairly no matter their race, religion, etc. which is why we wouldn't sell you a truck without a title. I do apologize that Jay hasn't checked in weekly to let you know we still haven't received titles, but the fact remains just that - we do not have a title to the truck you wanted to purchase. Though I do not have a date of availability, the trucks are still here on our lot and will become available once titles are received.\nThanks again for your interest and feedback."}, "gmap_id": "0x888b12de6a90e3e7:0x86c37a457db0ebfb"}

I am from Pennsylvania so I bought the truck sight unseen. All in all it's a pretty decent truck. The staff at k&s is very friendly and they were extremely accommodating when it came to helping my transport company load my truck. Their invoicing and customer service post auction is also very good, they made payment and logistics pretty easy.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that the description on the auction listing was not very honest. The last sentence of the description read \"Very nice truck, automatic transmission, ready for work!\", but the truck was obviously far from \"ready for work\". My shipper had a hard time keeping the truck running to even get it loaded and when it arrived at my location in PA, the truck would start and shut off immediately, could not keep it running, had to pull it off with my wheel loader. After 20 minutes of diag we determined that the injector harness pushed oil all the way to the ECU and filled the ECU with oil, that's why it kept shutting down, so it needs a whole new engine harness and ECU. The lights on the truck are in complete disarray. The left turn signal runs the 4 ways, the 4 way button runs the right turn signal, and when you turn the headlights on, all of that changes... I've got a lot to figure out before all of that is straitened out.. I understand that with auctions you should physically inspect all equipment in person before buying (which I realize I did not) and that auction listings cannot be guaranteed to be accurate, but the words \"ready for work\" to me, mean that to the best of your knowledge, the truck should be ready for work. I understand that mistakes happen and in reality it was probably a pretty simple mistake, I just want to raise awareness of how important it is to create accurate descriptions of your auction listings. I would not hesitate to to business with K&S again as they seem like a good company who generally sells good equipment, I am simply writing this to be constructive to them. I am a dealer as well and I also have made my fair share of mistakes.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888b12de6a90e3e7:0x86c37a457db0ebfb"}

Debbie even permitted me to get a full inspection by the dealer on the Jetta.  The Tacoma was practically brand new with only 7000 miles on it.

The car had 0% oil life! Once I did that I needed a new water pump , Also I soon discovered  my 2014 Chevy Cruze had a oil leak as well..\nthen the thermostat went out , I had to replace the battery all out these things came of my pocket with in 2 months of having the car\nalso while maintaining my car note and car insurance I\u2019ve never been late or missed any payments due to the fact I work to pay these bills. I\u2019ve only had the car 5 months and here goes the motor just gone out..\n\nwhen we recall all the problems this car had and I was fixing it every time something happen the mechanic and I agreed that it\u2019s been a problem with the motor he also told me Chevy Cruze\u2019s had a recall on their motor!!\nThe dealership never told me this! The mechanic did , now here iam 2 week later without a car , a rental , no communication from the dealership or warranty company just nothing I\u2019m paying to get my car looked at  I\u2019m missing work and I have to do everything alone every time I call GENE HE TELLS ME TO CALL TROY!! Finally I called TROY just wanting to get help with my car getting fixed by this 2 year warranty i supposed to have  because once I sent it to real good mechanic they told him I didn\u2019t have a warranty!! That  I was supposed to have & they don\u2019t know anything!! I had to find the warranty number alone and when I get Troy on the phone he\u2019s \u201csick with COVID-19\u201d so I guess that means hang up in my face because he\u2019s not feeling well BUT NEITHER AM I!! I\u2019m a 21 year old women who pays her bills on time and have to get to work!!  I really need my car due to me having two jobs and was responsible for getting myself to work. I feel like I bought a lemon!! Well proofs in the pudding my advice to upcoming buyers... TAKE A MECHANIC AND LET HIM TEST DRIVE IT !! It\u2019s only one person at Langston motors that tried to help me during this process and that\u2019s Troy daughters she\u2019s a angle and I thank you so Much for trying to do what you can to help me!!!

We bought a 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe(with around 29,000 miles and some warranty left on it) from them that had been wrecked...twice. Even though this was on the car fax, this information was not disclosed to us. We hear a noise in the rear of the vehicle, so we took it to a local Chevrolet dealership. We were told that the vehicle had been wrecked, not fixed completely, and unsafe for my children and myself to be traveling in. We were advised to contact the dealer first and give them the opportunity to make it right. Sport Center Imports wanted us to bring them the vehicle and let them have another Chevrolet dealer take a look at it. We were given a vehicle to drive and was under the impression that they were going to do everything they could to make it \"right\". We sought legal advise. We were advised not to accept the vehicle after they had their mechanics look at it, but give them two options... either find us one that was comparable, or buy it back from us. About a week later, one of the owners contacted us to let us know the Tahoe was fixed...it was just a coil spring that needed to be repaired.  Once we explained that we did NOT want this Tahoe, and this was not we had paid all this money for, we were told they would find us one comparable. So once again, we were under the impression they were going to make it right. When they found us another one, it had over 36,000 miles which meant no warranty....BUT we decided to go ahead and purchase it and put it all behind us (after having it looked at by our own mechanics). They agreed to pay the first one off (as a trade-in), and turn around and finance the second one. They did. However,  a couple weeks later, we got a call from the owner letting us know that a payment was late on the first Tahoe (that we traded back in to them BEFORE the first payment was due) and that he didn't want it to damage our credit. We needed to pay it and he would pay the rest of the Tahoe off. Once again, we had to threaten to get a lawyer. We had to contact the credit union to explain what was happening and that we didn't want our credit ruined. It has been a long, drawn out mess! Instead of doing the right thing to begin with, we had to continuously fight with these people to get anything done.  Now they have this very same Tahoe listed on their website.I am warning you...if you do not want a headache, I would look elsewhere.

I sent my car that was under warranty to Chatom Ford. That was one of my worst mistakes possible. The first week of their service was promising. After that it was all down hill. Shade the \u201cService Manager\u201d was my main point of contact. He would promise me updates and call backs which I would never get a returning call. On October 16th I was PROMISED my car was repaired and ready for pick up. As I had two friends take off work to take me 5.5 hours to Chatom Ford, Shade called me and said \u201cthe car jumped time and is not ready\u201d. The following day I called to get the new date  I could expect my car to be repaired.  Shade then tells me that he had been lying to me and my car was not ready and he does not know why my car is not fixed nor when it could be fixed. During this call he also promised me that the car would be sent to my house in Tennessee. After Shade continued to lie about my car and repairing it, I then moved to speaking with Collin Ward (General Manager)-  I only spoke with him once because he told me \u201c I\u2019m sure what you are saying MAY have happened, but im sure my team has a better way of going about this story\u201d. He also promised I would get a call back from him and I never did. Collin also asked me why I would even send my car here with it being out of state and not send it local (I was on my way back from vacation on the coast when it happened). In my opinion, this should not matter. With no hope, I called asking for the owner, Gene Brown. No one would help me reach him. Then I finally received a call from Kevin O\u2019Brien. He was very promising and reassuring at first as they all were. Kevin worked with my father and I for about two weeks then he stated to not take our calls or call us back as promised. Last, my father began to work with Lara. She was helpful in helping us know what was going on. She is who we worked with for the rest of this mayhem. 99 days later on December 18th Chatom Ford met me in Mississippi to give me my car. This dealership is an ACTUAL JOKE. From day one I asked for nothing but updates and I never once got that. NOT ONE WORKER AT THIS PLACE (I say place because I can not call this a business because this place has no business structure at all.) was truthful in customer service to my father or myself. If anyone at this place has any further questions feel free to contact me as you have my name and number. PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME BY NOT SENDING YOUR CAR HERE. THIS MANAGEMENT IS A JOKE AND ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS IN THEIR PROFESSION.\nThank you for the worst Ford experience I could ever ask for.

The mileage out should be the odometer mileage when the truck is handed to the customer, not the mileage that may be on their records when the truck was returned by a previous customer.\n\nAlso, unknown to me, there was a dolly in the back that I had not even reserved.  I saw it only when I opened the back to load my stuff.  I was surprised, to say the least and wondered if I will be billed for it. Guess what?  I was billed for it even though I had not used it. And how did he know that I had used it? When I called this morning, he told me that the plastic tab that was attached to the dolly was broken. When I try to assure him that I had not even touched the dolly, his response was rude and something like \"we have a lot of customers who say they didn't use the dolly but they actually did.\" In short, he had just accused me of lying!  My question is: why was the dolly even there in the first place? I had not reserved it!  And if there was something in the back of the truck, he should have opened the back and shown it to me.  I would have asked for the dolly to be taken out. Further, how do I know that tab wasn't broken before the truck keys were handed to me? So, this was a clear case of an attempt to cheat a customer.  I wonder how many people this store rep has cheated.  Next time, if I ever rent again from this location (which I very much doubt) or any other, I will make certain to open the back and have them remove any extra stuff I did not order!\n\nAny attempts at talking with the rep over the phone was met with rude, curt, and insulting responses.

This information was not even gathered until they second attempt to receive help from the desk, for the first time we spoke to their general manager, Tavon Scott, who was at the moment in no mood to do his job. As soon as he saw that our last name did not come up in the computer, he looked at us as if we were crazy and then proceeded to profusely rid himself of all blame (\"it was the call center\") and yelled at us for becoming frustrated at the fact that we seemingly had no storage. He was completely unwilling to make up for the fault of his company in any capacity and did nothing but sit there and act annoyed at our frustration. I dropped by one last time to use the restroom and I could hear them quoting us and laughing at our situation until they saw I had come in. I was so disgusted at their attitude about their job that I marched up to the desk to get Mr. Scott's full name to write in this report, to which he replied, laughing \"You can just look up my name if you need it.\" I replied \"take care\" and he replied \"oh I will take care\" and continued to murmur something under his breath to the amusement of his coworkers. I've never held an official job to this date, but if I talked half as rudely to any customer as they did to us, I'd expect to be canned on the spot, and that's exactly what I wish upon this man, Mr. Scott. I'd equate this crew to a group of shiftless, gawky teenagers who are too immature to own up to their own shortcomings.

I went back and what should have been a calm discussion about getting the right battery turned into a very heated exchange when the dealer began to call my mother rude and claiming the battery was fine.\n\nThe battery ( the 12 V startup one) is a specialty type of battery for a hybrid that only the dealer provides and costs about 500$:\n\nWe ended up getting a check from them to get the battery from the dealer (they wouldn\u2019t pay the install price, just the wholesale). The thing is, is that this review would have been 5 stars if they had just been polite and understating when we came to them about the problem.

Great, genuine people here. Drove an hour and a half to the location, test drove the 2014 Nissan and took it to get checked out at a near by garage. It checked out- As any used car it had minor things that needed to be addressed but that's to be expected with any used car. I don't expect a brand new car, besides a mechanic shop HAS to give you a long list otherwise they feel like they have not done their job correctly.

Paid it in cash and made it through the paperwork hassle free in less than 15 minutes. On the way out I ran into  the owner who  explained to me the way that they conducted their business. They seemed to do well and sold many cars at that location. He was a very down to earth person. The reason for my detailed explanation is to make it clear to anyone that looks at online reviews to take them for a grain of salt. Mid-conversation with the owner I watched a man come into this dealership and demand new brakes and tires on a vehicle he bought a few weeks back apparently, and otherwise threatened to leave a bad review!! People like that get on my last nerve. These folks are selling good quality cars for a fraction of the price. If someone wants a brand new car they need to help themselves to a brand new car store. We don't see shops like this anymore, everything is being bought out and turned into a franchise sore where you would pay at a lot more for the exact same car. We need to value these people.

If I could leave 0 stars, I would.\n\nMy mother purchased a car a few weeks ago and today she decided to go on her lunch break and get her tag. Information that should've been provided during her purchase at the dealership was requested from the clerk at the tag/title office. She placed a call and got the owner on the phone and he was attemping to assist her. While he was able to eventually get her the information she needed the process of how she had to get the information from the owner was where she had an issue. She stated that there was a language barrier which she didn't personally mind BUT as she was on her lunch break and had limited time to talk she requested to speak with someone with better English that could accomodate her and articulate the information she needed in a timely manner. The owner became rude with her during her phonecall even prompting the clerk at the window to comment on his rudeness.\n\nI later accompanied her to his dealership as she needed to make a payment on her vehicle as well. Once arriving conveniently the owner was sitting on the front \"porch\" of the lot. When she expressed to him her issue with the process that it took to get information from him earlier and why she requested to speak with someone with better English he became rude with her again, and constantly interrupted her.  I happened to accompany her on this visit and made a comment about his direct rudeness. I guess he didn't take our visit too well because we'd interrupted his flirting with his employee but he then proceeded to invite the both of us into his office and present to us a dusty old box containing his many \"degrees\" which from what I saw were merely laminated certificates as if that gave him the right to conduct business and talk to us the way he did. I made the comment that both myself and my mother carried actual degrees from accredited universities, she even having her Masters which at the end of the day should not matter. Him having the title of \"OWNER\" and his many \"degrees\" should never give him the right to believe that he should be able to be rude to customers or anyone else for that matter. It takes way more than walking around and merely calling yourself a business owner. Its a matter of action as well. As an owner you should be able to take criticism and responsibility for your actions. A simple apology would've been good enough but my mother didn't even get that. I myself began to get upset because of the way he chose to speak to my mother. I simply could not allow it. I began to explain her position yet he attempted ot interrupt me like he did her. I wasn't allowing that either. Our conversation ended up being a mix of words in which he eventually summoned one of his employees into the room for reasons I still don't know. She attempted to explain that the owner was alone by himself at 8 AM until she was able to get into the office and the fact that she hadn't been able to hang up her purse because he asked her to take the phone. This made no difference to me or my mother because 1. She called around 1 PM not 8 AM & 2. As a business \"OWNER\" he should've done a better job with tailoring his business to order to fit the needs of customers. If you had staffing issues then as an \"OWNER\" it was on him to take on that matter himself. Either way it should not fall on the shoulders of the customer to deal with your rudeness and lack of customer service. My mother always raised me to be honest and to speak my mind so here I am speaking my mind and saying that the \"OWNER\" of this establishment is trash and should better spend his days gaining proper accreditation on what it means to be a good business owner and how to deliver good customer service as well taking some time to fix up his dealership because all it takes is for the wrong person to have an accident on that janky \"staircase\" on his lot and his entire business under fire due to lawsuit.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923b189b005c9:0x6db750ee718606e9"}

My husband and I are fulltime RV'ers so our RV is our home and my husband travels for work. So when we found out that our exhaust manifold was cracked we needed someone quickly. So without proper research we took it to these guys. They gave us a crazy estimate but was told that it was JUST an estimate, that it really depended on how hard the exhaust manifold was to remove and if any bolts broke as they were removing it. We dropped it off on a Thursday morning at 8:00 a.m. On Monday at noon my husband was informed that the parts were still not in. Then on Monday at 4:00 p.m. my husband was told that it was ready to be picked up. Since we were over an hour away we told them we would pick it up on Tuesday. My husband was also told that the final bill was $2,990.00. WHAT??? We were flabbergasted because they had told my husband that the exhaust manifold came off easy and that no bolts had broken. My husband talked to the service manager and disputed the bill but the service manager would not budge so in order to get our RV back we had to pay it. Then I did my research and talked to several other diesel mechanics and also talked with some other freightliner and cummins mechanics and was told that they seriously overcharged us for the work that is shown on the bill. The bill states the following \"Pulled unit in shop. removed turbo and exhaust manifold. Cleaned the head and the turbo. Installed and torqued new exhaust manifold and turbo with all new gaskets and bolts. Cleaned inside and out. Ran unit. Checked for leaks none found. Parked unit.\" They charged us $175.00 an hour and claimed 14 hours worth of work for a total labor cost of $2,450.00. No mention of any problems whatsoever in removing the exhaust manifold. In my talks with other diesel mechanics I was quoted anywhere from $1,200.00 to at the most (from another freightliner mechanic) $125.00 an hour for labor. And that it should not have taken 14 hours to do the job if there had been no problems. Another mechanic I spoke with said that if the parts were not there at noon but it was finished at 4:00 then it took them at the most 4 hours to \"install and torque the new manifold and turbo with all new gaskets and bolts. Clean inside and out. Run unit. Check for leaks and park the unit.\" That would leave 10 hours for them to remove the exhaust manifold and that is overboard, especially since there were no issues in removing it. I was given some great advice and I am pursuing this. I was told that in order to hold the Freightliner name that they have to abide by a \"Labor Guide\" and to ask to see it (but we had already paid and picked the RV up so I was too late in doing that) so I have requested the labor guide requirements for this type of job. I have also requested quotes from other diesel mechanics based on what they said they did via the bill. And have contacted the main Freightliner offices. It is sad that we as consumers can not completely trust that we won't be screwed when we take our property to people.\nOn top of all of the above, when we were ready to leave my husband asked for the key and lo and behold they had lost it. They could not find the key to our RV. Really?? What kind of business that works on vehicles loses keys? It was a good thing that we had another key with us. I would recommend to do your research before you make a quick decision like we did.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888602110a7b0ed1:0xc685b4618fec7c7e"}

They are liars and thieves. My husband went to work for WTI in Alabama. Their repair shop is in cahoots with the Freightliner in the same town of Tuscaloosa. Just after a 90 day inspection my husband switched to WTI. They immediately on first day said there he needed over 6000.00 in repairs on his truck. We had no choice st the moment but to get it repaired where he could start work. Freightliner started repair on it. Finished it in THREE WEEKS!! So my husband was out of work for over 4 weeks due to this scam. After he was up & running again here in Pensacola we had to put it in the shop at Freightliner. After a week they found out that none of the parts had been replaced or were either old parts. It took another week to get it approved to not have to pay for the parts and labor on what was done! Then the manager in Pensacola found out that the Work was not even done by a licensed Mechanic in Tuscaloosa!!  Then of course the Pensacola Freightliner found some more things wrong of course. Like they always do. Sigh * we were out of work over 6 weeks due to this. I contacted the owner of the three Freightliner owned by him. One in Tuscaloosa and two in Atlanta area. He wouldn\u2019t call me back at all. If we had had the money and time we would\u2019ve had an attorney. Stay away from WTI in Tuscaloosa & FREIGHTLINER in Tuscaloosa.

I made him aware that this was the only transportation and that my kids had missed the entire week of school and he said \"well! U asked us to fix the car so we are fixing it\" after my husband heard how i was being spoken to on the phone by the owner he told the owner that he didnt appreciate the way he was speaking to me. The owner then called the finance company and purchased the car back from them while the car was in his possession without letting me know what was happening. After calling from several different numbers (because they would no longer answer for mine) i finally spoke with the owner and he was extremely rude and my husband over heard the conversation and intervened letting the owner know that he wouldn't talk to me in that manor. Even After apologizing for him being rude to me or what he thought was getting smart with him he pretty much told me it was nothing he could do about my down payment or the payments I've made towards purchasing the vehicle. The owner is very unprofessional and rude he is not sympathetic with anyone and if i could give this car lot 0 stars i would. I would never recommend anyone that i know to this car lot they are a scam not to mention I've had the car since march and never recieved my tag paper work so I'm stuck paying tickets for a car i no longer have and EVERYTHING that has happened is because of suncoast unprofessional owner and the scams that he pull. I hope the next mother that is working hard to take care of her kids will read this and not waste money with these clowns because if u let them they'll take advantage of u too and take all out your money leaving u and kids stranded while they get richer off of messing over kind people.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da89592edd7:0x7f5e43c6e7fedb73"}

After they found out about it, they blame the auction where they purchase the car from which was Texas Motors. After been inspected by a collision company they discovered that it had poor body work under the so called \"good paint job\". The car looked good, But it was under all that what was hiding. Took it to FORD and they couldn't even activated the airbags because the control panel was tricked. All Parrish (THE INTERNET GUY) could say was \"i dont know anything about the cars someone else does that, I just sale them\". The car suppose to been totled out but wasn't. I had to surrender it cause no one would take it. But in the end I got a better car, for a price FROM ANOTHER DEALER. Will never bring my love ones here NEVER.

I decided not to buy the car which put me on a rental status. The car I was looking at buying had an exhaust leak, it had been in a front end collision and was falling apart. The work that needed to be done was not a issue. When I went in to get my money back the manager Tony took his sweet time in getting to me and was really rude about it. I brought the car back yesterday at 8:15 am and it was 2:30 by the time he decided he would deal with me. He charged me 100$ for 2 days that I didnt even have the car fully (picked it up monday night close to closing and returned yesterday at opening). He told me in the middle of fighting with him about the days that \"this country has laws\" which obviously. He fought with me about paying me back my money when I hadnt even signed the purchase agreement. He told me I was lucky he wasnt charging me for gas, to have it cleaned and washed. I received the car with no gas in it at all and it was dirty. There were mold spores growing on the roof and the roof was cracked on the exterior. Functions in the car didnt work properly and the transmission was on its way out. The brakes had two inches of play in them. 5 miles down the road the service light had come on and the car started shifting funny. Took it to Advanced Auto and had them hook it up. It gave a malfunction code. Which I didnt stress cause it had gone away within a hour, but had called about it. They had lost the keys to it but did have 2 new keys made. The manager of this place is extremely rude, especially towards women. I had raised my voice and told him it was BS that he was charging me for days I didnt have the car and that I had to wait 6.5 hours for him to cut me a check back of my own money. He threw me out of his office after I had to fight the check out of him. This is a place I will never do business. I have never met someone so rude in customer service and called him out on it. I lost 322.56 to this guy and he told me he wasnt making a dime. Looks to me like he made a few hundred. I dont have a issue paying what I needed to pay but I do have a issue of paying for days that the car was not in a possession for the full day. I would have payed less at a car rental company instead of 50$ a day and .36 a mile. This place is highway robbery. They wanted 22k for a 2007 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer Edition with 122k on it that was falling apart. Good thing my husband had no interest in buying this vehicle and we returned it. I couldnt imagine being locked down to this guy for the next 4 years. My recommendation is to not do business with this company solely do to the guy who manages it and he will rip you off. He treats his own employees like crap. The only reason they got 1 star is because not possible to leave it blank.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da89592edd7:0x7f5e43c6e7fedb73"}

Well we thought we did. The entire time \u201cMojo\u201d showed the truck, we discussed the motor as well as the other features. Then when we sat down and talked numbers, he presented a piece of paper comparing it to all the other 2016 model F-150s within so many miles and my fianc\u00e9 noticed the motor was listed different than every single other listing,\u00a0so he asked \u201cthis may be a dumb question but this truck\u2019s motor is listed differently. Is that just the way you guys typed it up? Is this truck a twin turbo EcoBoost like the rest?\u201d Mojo replied with \u201c yes exactly\u201d. So we moved forward and we bought the truck. That following\u00a0Sunday my fianc\u00e9 went to look under the hood at something and after some research he found out\u00a0it did not have the 3.5L EcoBoost motor. He called the following \u202aMonday morning\u202c and talked to Mojo. He stated said \u201cmojo do you remember us talking about the truck being an EcoBoost and showing me the comparison sheet of the surround F-150s,\u00a0and I asked about the motor being an EcoBoost, even though it didn\u2019t match up to everything else and you told me yes it is?\u201d He said \u201cyea, yea I do\u201d then My Fianc\u00e8 said \u201cwell Mojo it\u2019s not an EcoBoost. It\u2019s a plain V6.\u201d\u00a0His response was. \u201cOh $@it\u201d. He then said he would talk to management and get back with him. My fianc\u00e9 called him two different times that day. One telling him that he\u2019s still trying to talk to management but they\u2019re busy and the second time was 8 hours later and all they were willing to do was give us an oil change. Both responses were via\u00a0text messages. He would not answer a phone call. So we then called and spoke to a sales manager and he was nice but didn\u2019t have any more to offer. After a couple weeks we were finally able to talk to the sales manager that was working the day we bought the truck. At this point we were over having to deal with them so we settled for a few oil changes and floor mats since the truck didn\u2019t come with any. He stated \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t be cheap mats\u201d. Once they finally came in we went and picked them up from the dealership, and they were universal Riverchase kia mats that no where near fill up any of the back seat floor board. We bought better ones from Walmart than the ones they gave us and he only gave one more oil change than the original one. We find this to be highly unprofessional and unsatisfactory. There are thousands of dollars difference as well as the evident performance differences. I\u2019ve also bought a brand new Kia from them in 2017 and it\u2019s crazy we get treated this way after spending so much money with them.

My lights were flickering on and off in my 2014 KIA Soul and I was scared to drive at night. My warranty was about to expire and I wanted to get my lights checked out. Early August 2018 I drove over to Riverchase KIA early one morning and I told them what was going on with my 2014 KIA. I also needed and oil changed. I waited over an hour for the shuttle to drive me to work, the shuttle drive did not know I needed a ride and HE was super nice!! I called around noon 5 hours later to check on my car, and they had not look at my car yet. I called again at 2pm and they were not done. They told me earlier that the shuttle stops driving at 4pm, I was scared I was going to be stranded at work. I had to ask my co-worker to cover the rest of my shift so that the shuttle could pick my up and take me to my car...again the driver was super nice! When I arrived all my windows were down and they informed me that my car was ready. I asked about my lights and they said the drove it around and the lights did not flicker while they drove it. I asked if someone looked at my light or looked at the electrical wiring on my lights and THEY DID NOT!!! I was charged for my oil change and sent on my way. At this point I did not drive my car at night because I was scare I would crash when my lights would cut-off or flicker. I received a letter from KIA headquarters about a month later stating that the 2014 KIA Soul had a problem with the multi functioning switch and that will cause my lights to flicker while driving with my lights on. The letter stated I should take my KIA to the closest dealership to get the problem fixed since the warranty was extended on that particular part.  I took my KIA to Riverchase KIA in Pelham  since it was closer to my job....the service technician told me to my face that \"The letter was to keep in my car in case I was pulled over by the cops, not to fix the problem. He also said that they don't know how to fix my car). They made me feel so stupid...I should have been more firm with them about fixing my car, but I thought maybe I did not read the warranty extension correctly.  Two weeks later while driving home from work, my lights kept flickering while I'm driving an it scared me! I need an apology from Riverchase KIA for making me feel like and idiot!! So I did  not go back because you guys refused to fix the problem!!  The next day I took my car to Julio Jones in Tuscaloosa, Al and I showed them the letter I received from KIA. they listened to me and told me not to worry that they would fix the problem. I need an oils change and my tires rotated as well and they serviced my KIA soul with no problem.   I'm so thankful I can drive my car and not feel scared that I might crash.

The service advisor that checked me out -not my SA - told me I was being charged for services never done in the past, except for the fact that my last service was there and the prior one was where I bought the car last year.

Nothing the techs and advisors talked about with the SM were ever done by the SM. He doesn't care. I honestly feel bad for anyone that works for someone that has to constantly put their employees down since he is the only one that would know how to do anything.\nWhen I stopped by he was very rude and even told me in front of a group of people while hanging onto my car door I wouldn't be happy without getting something free...I told him I would be happy with an actual call back. My car is under warranty, and the SA had even told me she would reach out to a used or new car sales manager for assistance since she wasn't able to get a response (they have no control over service but she was trying). Rating mid level or lower doesn't matter on service reviews, no inquiry then either. After I left, I called the dealership to speak to the GM. I had to leave a message which to this day hasn't been returned.\nThe advisors were not the same ones from my previous visit. Maybe high turnover? Either way, consider another dealership for service. The previous advisors and manager were easy to deal with, albeit I have no idea on the work part not being done as mentioned by new SA.

My lights were flickering on and off in my 2014 KIA Soul and I was scared to drive at night. My warranty was about to expire and I wanted to get my lights checked out. Early August 2018 I drove over to Riverchase KIA early one morning and I told them what was going on with my 2014 KIA. I also needed and oil changed. I waited over an hour for the shuttle to drive me to work, the shuttle drive did not know I needed a ride and HE was super nice!! I called around noon 5 hours later to check on my car, and they had not look at my car yet. I called again at 2pm and they were not done. They told me earlier that the shuttle stops driving at 4pm, I was scared I was going to be stranded at work. I had to ask my co-worker to cover the rest of my shift so that the shuttle could pick my up and take me to my car...again the driver was super nice! When I arrived all my windows were down and they informed me that my car was ready. I asked about my lights and they said the drove it around and the lights did not flicker while they drove it. I asked if someone looked at my light or looked at the electrical wiring on my lights and THEY DID NOT!!! I was charged for my oil change and sent on my way. At this point I did not drive my car at night because I was scare I would crash when my lights would cut-off or flicker. I received a letter from KIA headquarters about a month later stating that the 2014 KIA Soul had a problem with the multi functioning switch and that will cause my lights to flicker while driving with my lights on. The letter stated I should take my KIA to the closest dealership to get the problem fixed since the warranty was extended on that particular part.  I took my KIA to Riverchase KIA in Pelham  since it was closer to my job....the service technician told me to my face that \"The letter was to keep in my car in case I was pulled over by the cops, not to fix the problem. He also said that they don't know how to fix my car). They made me feel so stupid...I should have been more firm with them about fixing my car, but I thought maybe I did not read the warranty extension correctly.  Two weeks later while driving home from work, my lights kept flickering while I'm driving an it scared me! I need an apology from Riverchase KIA for making me feel like and idiot!! So I did  not go back because you guys refused to fix the problem!!  The next day I took my car to Julio Jones in Tuscaloosa, Al and I showed them the letter I received from KIA. they listened to me and told me not to worry that they would fix the problem. I need an oils change and my tires rotated as well and they serviced my KIA soul with no problem.   I'm so thankful I can drive my car and not feel scared that I might crash.

Wednesday as I\u2019m driving home, oil light comes on and smoke from under the hood. I made it home and found oil leaking from under the car. I call Wednesday to make an appointment to bring my car in on Thursday to be fixed. Thursday I arrive around 8:20 that morning and drop the car off so I could get to work that I was already late for. I called them around 1-2pm the evening to check status of my car. Season stated they hadn\u2019t gotten to it yet and it was being sent somewhere else were it would be checked out in more detail. So they put me in a rental covered by them. They called Friday afternoon and said my car was ready and I asked why was it leaking oil and they said the plug was stripped and that it wasn\u2019t a Kia plug. If the technician knew the plug was stripped why did he put it back on there, regardless of if it was a Kia plug or not. Also, Wednesday when I came to drop the car off, I told them that I would like to get the recalls fixed on it since I already had to drop the car off. I asked the person checking me in did he need the recall papers that I had gotten sent in the mail and he said he could look it up by the VIN. Saturday morning I come in to pick up my car and ask them for diagnostic report on what was done on the car & they tell me about the plug and I asked were the recalls fixed and they said it wasn\u2019t any notes about a recall needing to be fixed. The guy that checked me in Wednesday stated he didn\u2019t remember me saying anything about a recall and he was sorry, Season said they would get it in to be fixed because of the situation but they normally do not do recalls on saturdays. I already knew that because of the previous Saturday I came in for the oil change and asked about the recall. So I guess the pros would be that she did say they would fix the recalls but cons is that I still have to sit and wait on my car on something that they were supposed to had already done. I also spoke with Tim the supervisor about the issues that I was having. I am stuck in a hard place because Riverchase Kia is the only Kia dealership in Birmingham, and I don\u2019t want just any person working on my car and thought I was doing the right thing by bringing to their service center.

He was so sweet (I almost want to put that into satirical marks) while we talked through wait periods. Good family guy who is proud of his kids and was very generous in his compliments to my husband. This was fine. I would have left a 5 star review with just that interaction. He didn't seem to push us into anything particular or expensive because we knew what we wanted and he knew that too. To be honest, my husband knew more about the cars on that lot than most of the salesmen at the store. To be even more honest, we had no intentions of buying a car that day, but we were talked into it. Not a horrible choice, but not my optimum choice at this time. In the end I wanted to make my husband happy and get a hybrid because it is better for the environment and because we commute a lot. I would have waited a year or two before doing this, but that is out the window now. However, all of that isn't the issue. While we were there, everyone was nice. Stayed there for almost 5 hours getting paperwork done and waiting to be approved for a loan. We're young and like to talk, so we didn't mind. We get a fair interest rate, seeing as how my husband just came out of bankruptcy. This is good. We sign all the contracts, my husband haggles about the extra warranty. All of that is good. We hand over the keys to the car we traded in, clean it out and into our new car, etc. All of the contracts are signed, everything is good. We leave HAPPY. Very happy. Extremely proud of our car.\n\nThis is when things start to go bad. I get a call a few days later because they lost my husband's pay stub. No problem. He sends an email with a new one. This apparently isn't \"clear\" enough \"for the banks.\" Alright. So he sends another one, a PDF copy as clear as day. A human mistake happens and he misspelled Stan's email (missed 1 s). A week almost goes by and I haven't gotten any calls, and neither has my husband. We think everything is fine so we forget about it. Not to mention, it is the end of the semester for me, so the only thing I am worried about it getting homework done, studying for exams, and emailing people from my school email. This, however, is where some of the blame falls onto me. I had gotten 3 emails from Stan on the 4th and on the 5th. The email on the 4th was fine. It just wanted a new copy because he couldn't find an attachment (because of the mess up earlier as my husband was at work and had just made a human error). The third and last email is where I am taking away 3 stars and am very upset about. It is added into this review, untouched outside of cutting away unnecessary bits of the screenshot of my computer screen. Seeing as how the place is a business, I find no issue with giving away the details in this email. In my opinion, I find the tone of the email to be very unprofessional, threatening, and rude. He could have called (in my call logs I received no calls from him and neither did my husband). Calling would have resolved the issue immediately because any decent person would have realized the mistake and apologized and immediately resent the email correctly with the attachment. Yet, it is okay to threaten to take away a car. And I get it. The bank is putting on pressure to get the pay stub or else they will back out and that is bad for the dealership. However, WE weren't the ones who lost the original pay stub in the first place. WE weren't contacted in a more timely manner about it via phone call. Instead, my junk email just so happened to get checked by my husband yesterday while he was handling other business on the phone and he sees all of the emails. He resends what needs to be resent, and now we wait to see if any other \"problems\" will arise. Will our signatures be unclear next and somehow void our contract? Will they try to repossess our car because of any other errors on their behalf? Only time will tell.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

Let me provide you a little setup for my situation that this amazing dealership managed to turn around for me. End of 2014 my old Saturn (yes, the car dealer that went under) with its cracked suspension was traded into a dealership that I thought was reputable. Well put you in a new car they said, don't worry about your credit they said, I end up in the most manual of manuals; roll down windows and all Versa Note. Alright, I can turn this around, I tell myself, they said come back in a year and well get you in something nicer. Year rolls by, go back, \"Nope your credit isn't good enough, you got money to put down? Nope, then cant help you, try again next year.\" Alright, so I continue with this car that I am not happy with, upgrade jobs, still upside down in this car years later. Now its December 2017, still upside down in a car I am not happy with. I hear a jingle on my radio, you all know the one, \"We wanna see yea at Riverchase Kia.\" My wife and I talk and decide lets take a chance, what have we got to lose, if we don't like it we can always walk away. I do my research, and go in with an open mind, telling myself I want one of two vehicles. Optima or Forte. I park at the dealership and out walks one of the best, brightest, and positive salespersons I have ever met. Mr. Lionel T. Lee. I had time to stand and stretch on this cold winter day when he greeted, us. I was not set to meet anyone in particular but I am so glad I met this man. He took us to his desk and talked to us a few minutes about our situation and our plans, asked what I wanted and within 15 minutes he came back. He broke down my station for me but did not send me away.\n\nI am a negative person here folks, of course I was thinking everything had gone to hell and I was just wasting mine and his time, but Mr. Lionel was positive, he said, \"I cannot get you an optima, but I am going to get you in a new car. Trust me. I have the perfect one in mind too. How do you feel about a forte.\" My mind went everywhere but I tried to play the shrewd buyer, I said sure I would be happy to consider if the price is right. And off he went again, another fifteen minutes and back he was to grab his scarf, \"Oh you guys are in for a treat, wait here!\" Five minutes later I was asked to walk outside and man was I blown away! The Forte was beautiful, I mean pearl white, leather, backup camera, you name it it was in there. I was speechless, he asked what I thought, take a seat, get a feel for it because man this is going to be your car. I know it. I sat in it and never wanted to leave, going from a manual base to this luxury model, you know I almost drooled a little. He asked, \"What do you think, anything you want to change on it?\" The only thing I could think, \"Got it in Grey or Silver!\" He just grinned and said, \"Yeah, I sure do. Wait here.\" Exact same model, color I want, hasn't even been an hour and I am test driving the car I could not be happier with! Then the standard numbers talk goes by, no one likes this part but I will state for full disclosure that I was in the negative over 6k on my old car, I was expecting that I was going to have it a little rough but you know it was not nearly as bad as I thought. The discounts were amazing, in fact I walked away an hour later one of the most satisfied kia customers, keys and paperwork in hand and taking a picture in front of my new vehicle. Thank you so much Mr. Lionel for putting up with all my negativity and fighting for me to get me in this new vehicle. Hell I sat in it all day yesterday just playing with all the new toys and features, you are an amazing salesperson and even more so just an amazing person to help someone like me. Thank you again! We will be seeing you again next year to get her out of that jeep!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

My car died during the ice storm, and I HAD to buy a car.  Here are the problems I observed:\n\n1. 12 salesmen standing out front, half of them smoking cigarettes... certainly not illegal, but it just automatically makes any business look really bad fast.  Plus, they obviously overhired, maybe to motivate car sales by putting more hungry vultures on the lot.\n\n2. I dealt first with a guy named Adam.  He was nice enough... the sales manager obviously sensed my hesitation, so he swooped in and began his \"Pushy sales guy\" mode.  At one point when I started to get up and leave because I felt uncomfortable, he told me I promised him I would buy a car from him if the numbers were right for a used model.  I wanted a new car.\n\n3. Don't even bother looking at the prices of Kias online -- when you get there, everything is 5 to 6 thousand dollars more.  See, that's when they offer you the $6,000 trade in on any model.  Then, they'll act as if they're such great guys doing you such a favor.  It's ludicrous.\n\nI went directly to another dealership, found a car I liked at a reasonable price, and drove away happy.

Felt we got ripped off a little and found out they tried to get lending from so many places for the incorrect amount and causes unnecessary credit inquiries. That was annoying to find out weeks after the fact and that they hid it from us. But the big issue is their service. It is impossible to make an appointment for your \"free\" oil changes. When you do arrive they push a pkg that's like $65 so you can get a tire rotation and other crap. Then when you pick about charging that much for the \"free\" oil change they say, they'll take the oil change portion of that off the top like they are doing you a favor. Then they claim you need a new filter or something or other, which they changed at the last oil change 5,000 so I ask how often that's needed and they claim it's needed every 10,000-15,000 not knowing we just had it done the time before.

It was passed time to get her a new ride.  We did a one stop shop.  We knew Riverchase Kia had awesome deals on their new Kias.  However, this was not the market we were looking for purchase from.  We were after a slightly used but still certifiable new to us SUV.  Teddy met with us.  He asked what we were looking for in a purchase today, and said that he would do his best to keep us from going anywhere else.  Teddy did just that.  We were up front with him on the financials that we had and the monthly payment we need to stay around.  My wife was looking for something older with many more miles, but I wanted to have something that had warranty and miles to a minimum.  Teddy brought us a single option, The Right Option.  A very low mileage Sorento with transferable warranty.  The test drive sold it to my wife, and I signed the line.  We got an extremely well kept Sorento, with a detailed one owner record review by Teddy.  He answered the questions we had and some that he knew we should ask but not know to.  He was easy to work with.  He was knowledgeable  and we are a family with a great ride.  The experience was great, our turn around time for paperwork was minimal, our satisfaction was at the maximum.\nThe entire experience was better than I expected.  They treated us very well.  They earned my business.  I will recommend Teddy, when people ask about my wife's new Sorento.\n\nJosh Akins\n2/17/2018", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923bb35b78b6d:0xc5b491b0b598d0bc"}

I understand she have to tell me the fee etc.. but my car is only 2yrs old, and at that moment I didn't want to hear about money, I just wanted professionalism and just let me know it will be OK. I just said make me an appointment for Friday and I will come back. I went back Friday morning and spoke with a pleasant young woman by the name of Season. I think that was her name, b/c it was a unique name. She told me the SAME thing the other lady stated but in a different tone, and made me feel as though she cared. She even let me know by the car being new it may be covered under warranty. I told her my husband can get a gauge to ck it etc.. And she said if we do all that then it's still not working then it's likely a issue that will be fix with no out of pocket expense. I took my car back home again, and my husband did ck it Sunday, and the gauge showed Freon in the car, but stated to take it to the professionals. I then took off work Monday and brought my car back and Season's was there also.. I was happy b/c at this point I was just tired of going into circles. She let me know it may be a wait and was honest about it, and the fee again. I waited 2hrs, but I didn't care b/c I wanted my air fix, and to top it off it was under warranty. Anytime you are dealing with something that is a touchy subject about your car, b/c that is your way of survival and also getting around.... you want people to be knowledge of what's going on, and the situation.

I have been in customer service as a manager for several years. I have always been glad to get negative reviews because that\u2019s how we grew and improved. Although positive reviews are far and few between. I like to write positive reviews when they are due. Holmes Motors deserves a good review. I bought a 2012 Ford Expedition on 11/19/2019. Beautiful vehicle, we got great customer service, the cleanliness was also top notch. On 11/25/2019, I was driving home from work and lost power while driving down the road. The engine light started flashing and totally shut down. I called Kym (sales Rep) immediately the next morning. I figured I would have to get it TOWED to Birmingham (108 miles) plus pay the $100 deductible. This dealership towed it for FREE, charged no deductible, and got us a nicer/newer vehicle the same day. All against what my contract said. This company turned what could\u2019ve been a nightmare into a blessing. They definitely made it right and I really appreciate it. The contract clearly states buyer is responsible to get it to the dealership and pay $100 for any repairs in the first year. I am a dad to five kids and this made me a life time customer.\n\nAMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE.

She talked me through different cars and overall was just very friendly and helpful with anything that I needed. She explained details about the car that I bought, showed me how to work the radio and other features, and even went so far as to check on me after a few days to be sure that I was still satisfied with everything about the car. Not only did Meredith do a wonderful job and make the experience feel more relaxed than I ever would have expected, but also her manager, Jerrod, was extremely kind and helpful through the whole process of paperwork and figuring things out. As a team, Reinhardt was amazing, and on top of their incredible service, I love my car! My 2016 Toyota Corolla drives smoothly and is as comfortable and efficient as I could ever want! My experience at Reinhardt was friendly, welcoming, and understanding, and I will definitely be recommending people to buy there!

LONG REVIEW BUT A MUST READ REVIEW.\n\nIf i could give them 0 or even take stars i would. BEST auto sales? Ha more like worst. I bought a 2012 nissan altima from this establishment, 2 months later it blows a head gasket. IM NOT DENYING THE MOTOR RAN HOT, BUT THE TEMP GAUGE NEVER SHOWED THAT IT WAS. But why would you sell a car either knowing that it had mechanical issues, or without doing diagnostic tests (they either knew about the motor problems, or didnt care enough about their customers to see what was wrong with it when someone traded it in) After almost a week of going back and forth over whos responsible for repairs, we agreed that they would do the engine swap free of any labor charges if I paid for the motor. Once i was told repairs would begin shortly i called back frequently to get and update. Jimmy, a sales rep, told me time and time again, \"it'll be ready this week.\" , \"give it till wesnedsay\", \"ill call back today to give you an update\" well jimmy never did, the ONLY updates i ever got were given after i called them repeatedly, or drove across town to go in the office. Well after about 3 and a half weeks being jerked around and told itll be done soon, i went to the office on a day that jimmy happened to be off. After talking to a member of management he informed me they had just started on repairs 2 days ago and it wouldnt be done for a week or so. FYI i was in the middle of a move to FL and stayed in a hotel and rented a car during this time frame which totalled around 2 grand. The car also had a good bit of my own personal property in it. So i decided to go ahead and move to FL, still waiting for my car to be repaired. After a little over a week they call and tell me the car is fixed and ready to be pucked up. So i drive the 4 hours back to auburn, had my bank refinance the car, and had a check for $9400 in my pocket ready to pay them off. When i test drove the car, i could hear a rattling sound from underneath the dash that was at its worst while idling at stops, and when i get back and ask about it they had me pop the hood while they fiddled around with the car (changing gears, accelerating, etc) and i see the motor itself moving, back and forth when he would change gears (its an auto trans but you can slide the shifter over and keep it in a certain gear). So i tell jimmy that he needs to figure out what that sound is being caused by and i want to hear from him the next day. Well good ole jimmy did what he does best and didnt call back. And after a few days of not hearing from them i figured it was time to move on. So i come by today to get all my stuff that was in the car......and its all gone, things of monitary and emotional value. Not only did they throw away all my stuff without a  call, now theyre telling me its going on paper as a repo. HAHAHAHA yeah right they can expect a call from my lawyers here soon. They are THE MOST CROOKED BUSINESS I HAVE EVER HAD THE DISPLEASURE OF DEALING WITH, IVE GOTTEN BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE AT MCDONALD'S. AND I HAVE NEVER FELT SO CHEATED, DISRESPECTED, AND LIED TO IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. They will sell you a lemon (POS) and then screw you over when it brakes down. They take advantage of people with poor credit, give them outrageous monthly payments (was responsible for 300 a month on an altima and only 70 of that went to my principal), then repo the car as soon as they can.\n\nSAVE YOURSELF A HEADACHE AND DRIVE RIGHT PASSED \"BEST\" AUTO SALES. DONT EVEN CONSIDER DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM. IF YOU READ THIS AND STILL GIVE THEM YOUR BUSINESS YOURE JUST AS STUPID AS THEY ARE.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cf3ea539432e3:0x180be2342ff1bbdb"}

I think it is very unfair to post a car for one price to get the customers up there and then once the customer is there the price is 4-5 thousand dollars more than what you expect to pay.

They went to pick it up as well, which was great.  There are a couple things that were overlooked as one of the tires was out of balance pretty badly and the detail job left swirl marks when they washed it (it's a black vehicle, so you can notice everything on them). I had to take it somewhere else to find and correct the tire issue as the dealership informed me that new tires ride a certain way the first 500-750 miles.  I've purchased a number of brand new vehicles, and never encountered a vehicle shaking/vibrating like that.  After I requested that they check again (leaving it with them), I was informed that the tires had too much air. After the issue still existed, I took it elsewhere and it drove so smoothly once the out of balance tire was fixed.  They stated that they would reimburse me. The people are nice at the dealership, but taking a little more time to ensure things are done and checked correctly would have made the overall experience a lot better.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888ddb9c8ae8a53:0x80ac5f7468ac5e67"}

The next day when seeing the financial department, they tell me my monthly price was $75 more than the salesman's quote. So an extra $125 than I was told. Very deceptive but I wanted that vehicle. So I got it. Then the salesman tells me \"Hey, we got it pretty close.\" No not close at all.\n\nThen was told at 7000 miles I would get a complimentary oil change, rotation and balance by the same salesman. Well guess what? Not so, they said I would have to pay for the balance.\n\nBefore my free oil change, I ran over a small screw and my back left tire was loosing some PSI. Called the dealership and they told me I would have to pay $250 + for a new tire and work. They said they couldn't patch it. So I called 2 other professional tire shops and they laughed when I told them what the dealership told me. I got it fixed for $8 and took less than 10 min. And it's like brand new. No issues.\n\nIf you want to be treated right and not be deceived and lied too, please,  don't come here.

Here is what she said\n\n\"As a spouse of an armed service veteran, I recently purchase a 2012 Mini Cooper countryman from premiere Chevrolet. The day of the purchase one of the warning lights was on, the dealer ship couldn\u00e2  t figure out why it was on and how to get rid of it, That was my first incident  with the car, but since I drove over an hour away to pick the car up I trusted the dealership in that the car was good and they said that it was just a sensor. Two days later the check engine light came on , still thinking that it was the sensors, I over look at the magnitude of the situation. Exactly 4 weeks after having the car, it started smoking so I had to get it towed to Mini Cooper. Mini informed me that I have an oil leak, my turbo went out, and other things. My grand total for repairs come to 13,000 dollars. I think that it was very unprofessional and dishonest that You sold me a car that needed so much work done to it. I would not recommend buying a used car from this business.\"", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888ddb9c8ae8a53:0x80ac5f7468ac5e67"}

Michael said he would have me in and out of the dealership in less than an hour.....and that's exactly what happened.

Apparently this is a widely known problem with GM vehicles and a $1000+ repair cost to the owner that should be covered under a recall or part warranty because of the shear number of failures. Just look it up it is not hard to find. If it were a safety issue it would already be covered.\n\nI will say that the service writer did everything that he could to get my vehicle back to me the same day and was apologetic of the fact that the local dealership has seen a huge number of these repairs. He even went as far as check to see if my 2016 Yukon may be covered with some discount related to the same failure but it appears that GM thinks that it is OK for a part to fail at 60k miles but not at 61k miles.\n\nDealers should be doing more to convince corporate GM to protect their potential customer base. Someone paying as much as I have for 2 GM vehicles should not be hit with the repair cost for a well documented part failure that continued to be used even AFTER it was identified.

Wish I could give them 5 stars because that would mean I had a great experience. But buyers BEWARE of the management here. If you buy a used car or happen to get a lemon, you may be in for a huge headache. I bought a used vehicle on Friday, 2/19, and on Monday 2/22 I already had it being looked at by my mechanic. This was AFTER I tried to get management to respond. Vehicle's fuel pump wasn't working, and Stivers said DO NOT tow it to our place because we don't work on Rams. My mechanic found out that the fuse box had been heavily rigged to send extra juice to a failing fuel pump, just enough to get it to run. He said that this was easy to spot once they looked at it, meaning that Stivers doesn't check out the vehicles well enough. I have tried, repeatedly, to get them to return my call and talk to me about the issue, hoping they will at least acknowledge it. And additional $2000 later I've got the van back, but NO thanks to Stivers. My mechanic, on the other hand, is going to get the SECOND Google review I've ever written, and it will be 5 stars.\n\nAs of the date of this review, we are just a month past the date I bought the van, and I still have not heard from them. This was after my salesperson and the manager BOTH said he would get back in touch with me. They have three different phone numbers, and not a single message or call has been made. I will keep trying, and I hope that someone in their marketing group will see this and get back with me. I'm hoping there has been some minor miscommunication there and that I will get some assistance and help covering the expenses soon.

I drove 2 hours to the dealership to look at a used van.  When I arrived I noticed that the van had a rear liftgate which prohibits the installation of the ladder rack I was going to add to it.  I told them it wouldn\u2019t work for me, then inquired about a new van.  We couldn\u2019t find it so my salesperson said let me check on this.  A few minutes later he came back and said it was at a lot a few blocks away.  He asked me to wait amd said he would go get it. I agreed.  Thirty minutes later I was still waiting.  I called my salesperson to see what was going on and got no answer. I finally left to start the 2 hour drive back home.  I texted him and told him I was leaving.  He said he found the van and would send pictures.  Frustrated at this point, I thought I can see pictures online but whatever.  This was on a Monday.  Finally, on Saturday I agreed to the terms of purchase.  They asked when I could come down and sign the papers and I asked them to email them and I would sign them electronically.  The manager didn\u2019t know if they were setup to do that yet but would check and let me know.  (Another reviewer on here said they did their hole deal online!) I didn\u2019t hear back from him so I reached out on Monday and asked for a proposal with the final terms.  I got that email and did not hear back from them again. I reached out to them on Friday and was told they were trying to figure out how to get me the paper work.  I didn\u2019t hear back so Saturday evening I told the manager that I wasn\u2019t going to purchase the van.  So far, I haven\u2019t gotten a reply.  We had a deal, the financing was approved and yet it seems they were not interested in finishing the deal.  I have never experienced such at any other dealership.  I spent three years in automotive sales, when someone said we\u2019ve got a deal we were always quick to get them signed sealed and delivered.  I\u2019m still stunned by this outcome.

I\u2019m very confused as to why cause I was not given a proper reason! So all day today I\u2019ve been trying to get in touch with the general manager to ask why I have been fired, because Daniel was texting me asking me about the test, and how everything was going. Apparently Ford isn\u2019t the right fit for me and I\u2019m not a good candidate according to Lydia. I have 7 years of customer service and the job offers training so I\u2019m not sure how that made sense. In my attempt to contact the General sales manager aka Daniel Flatt he has ignored me and now blocked my number. So I\u2019m hoping this gets the dealerships attention. I was really counting on this job to help me pay my bills that are late (due to covid haven\u2019t been able to find work) not only would it have helped paid my bills.

It is with my F150 purchase were I am becoming more than frustrated and if not dealt with at this dealership will be moving any and all my business ASAP!  My F150 has 23K miles on it which are almost all highway miles.  Complained about the truck vibrating at speeds over 70 mph which has yet to be fixed or even addressed to my knowledge.  I also have a vibration when braking and was told my rotors need to be turned at a cost to me of about a 170 bucks.  Now I have owned many a car/truck and have never had to turn the rotors after only 23K miles of usage.  In fact, I don't think I have ever had to turn rotors on a car/truck I have purchased since I had a real job.  I am not sure if this dealership is willing to lose my business over 166 bucks, but I am damn sure willing to move it for that amount.

She was sure to search for a car that had a carfax and found several she liked online. We live over 100 miles from Adamson Ford and probably could have bought a car a lot closer...but because of the online reviews...she chose Adamson. Well this week, she had to have her entire brake system replaced at the local Ford dealership. They told her that the underside of her car was completely rusted out. This happens when cars are from Northern regions where they use salt on the roads to melt ice....or beach towns where there is natural salt in the air. in places like THAT....it is standard practice for a mechanic to check the underside of a car. My daughter's car was a late model 2014. The vehicle was most likely purchased at auction and came from another area in the US outside of Alabama. She was not expecting to have to pay for  new brakes and other rusted out parts on the bottom of her car. She called Adamson Ford about it and they said it was not their problem. Typical! They are nice and polite BEFORE you buy from them....but if you have a problem they change mighty quick. This was my daughter's very first vehicle. She tried to ask all the right questions and STILL got burned. No help from THIS dealership! And worse...no acknowledgement that they did not check the bottom of the car before selling it to an unsuspecting 21 yr. old kid. Yeah...I am one angry parent! Shame on Adamson Ford. We will NEVER use you again. You COULD have helped with the cost a little. But once you made the deal...you abandoned your customer!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b95166e0335:0xefbc2a3c0352ab5a"}

My father managed the parts department there up until 2 years ago (because the new owners were crooks & he couldn\u2019t stand to work with them any longer). Since, my sister bought a car from Adamson & was very happy with her experience. So in December, I decided I\u2019d start getting my oil changes there. I work @ UAB so it was convenient around my work hrs. My 1st experience was great! The guy that took care of me made sure the guy that drives the shuttle got me to work by 7:30. I picked up my car & paid leaving as a happy customer. My 2nd experience wasn\u2019t so great.\nI decided I\u2019d get my tires rotated as well. A different man took my order & I went inside to sign up for the shuttle service. That same man comes in & openly complains about how several people are out with the flu & says \u201cthis is just going to be a great day\u201d in an annoyed, sarcastic tone. As I\u2019m signing up for the shuttle, the guy that drives said, \u201cshuttle rides don\u2019t start until 8\u201d. To that I responded, \u201cThe guy that was here last time made sure I was at UAB in time to clock in & you were the one that drove me\u201d. He said, \u201cthat should be fine as long as a lot of people don\u2019t sign up\u201d, & then after asking if I should walk 15 minutes later, he finally drove me (10 minutes after asking). Mind you, I didn\u2019t have that problem at all the 1st time. As I\u2019m working I get a call from them saying \u201cMa\u2019am when we were rotating your tires we noticed that they are in big need of changing. Can we put on new tires for you?\u201d He didn\u2019t expect me to not be na\u00efve & mindlessly say yes (being a single young female). I asked, \u201cHow much would that be\u201d & he said, \u201cOh uh\u2026$1,600\u201d. I said, \u201dAbsolutely not!\u201d & instead, took my car to a place in my hometown & got 4 top brand, brand new for $950.\nLast week I decided to give them another shot thinking if that guy was there that served me the 1st time, it should be okay. I saw him, but was served by a man I hadn\u2019t seen before. I ordered an oil change & tire rotation. I avoided the hassle of the shuttle & made the 15 min walk to work. I got a call from a female saying \u201cwhen we were rotating your tires we noticed a nail in one of them & if we took it out the hole would be too big to patch, can we replace that tire?\u201d I, of course, said no & to that she said, \u201cokay well we can\u2019t rotate your tires then\u201d. I told her that was fine. But I thought the whole thing was strange because I hadn\u2019t once received a \u201clow tire pressure\u201d warning. When I went to pick up my car I noticed on their write up they documented the nail. So I took my car to my parents so dad & his friend could look. NO NAIL! I tried calling the following day to speak with the manager, & the lady that I spoke with was rude, & on top of that, REFUSED to give me her name. Apparently, they don\u2019t have a general manager, they just have a manager per department. I wanted to be fair thinking maybe the head guy didn\u2019t know about his workers, but if it\u2019s the manager of the parts department, they know, which is why I\u2019m turning here. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to try to screw people over to get more money, my grandfather didn\u2019t run his business that way. & the best thing I can do is caution other people from going. At least to the parts department.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b95166e0335:0xefbc2a3c0352ab5a"}

After getting the vehicle home and detailing the car thoroughly, we noticed that the passenger door sounded hollow (like an empty garbage can).  We immediately took the vehicle to Myer's Auto Collision to have the car inspected --after inspecting it, he found the vehicle to have had over $4000 worth of damage (passenger back door had so much bondo it couldn't be read on his meter, passenger door was a hollow shell (aftermarket part - not factory), the hood had also been replaced with aftermarket part - not factory and wetsanded and painted with trash in paint.  We also ran a Carfax and found out that the vehicle had been wrecked and the airbag was deployed and vehicle was undriveable and had to be towed.  We went to Adamson and talked to the manager, Mike Gargone on 2 different occasions about this and was told he would not cancel the contract and also told us that the vehicle had not been wrecked.  He also said that the vehicle had been bought at Manheim Auction in Georgia and that they do not have to divulge the information of any wreck to a vehicle and that he did not know the vehicle had been wrecked (we have had reliable sources to tell us this is not true -- that if a vehicle is wrecked and airbags are deployed, it has to be divulged to the buyer).  It is hard to believe that a supposedly reputable dealership that is well known in the city of Birmingham would conduct business the way they have.  We feel we have been violated by fraud, lied to, and deceived.  How would they as experts in cars not know this vehicle had been wrecked and how are they not liable for not divulging that information to  us as a consumer?

I have bought 2 vehicles from them. David G. The sales guy, Hes great, but the problem came when I bought an 06 f-150 from them in November of 2015. I purchased an extended warranty through them and less than a week later I cancelled it (after I read the fine print). So I am entitled to a full refund. So the dealership sends off the forms to cancel the warranty while I do the same through email. I have to talk to David A in financing and he is the problem. He told me for a month that he hadn't heard from the warrenty company and I told him that I had and that they told me that they cancelled the warrenty. So he tells me to send the email stating that to him and so I do. Well then he says that I have to sign the form and him send it in and I reminded him I had the form so I sent him the original form I sent to Alpha warrenty. I finally tagged him in an email with Alpha Warrenty to get it all straighted out. Then Alpha calls me and asks who to send the email to, I Tell them David in financing and so they DO!!!! I call Adamsonford again and guess what? David in financing tells me that he got the email and is sending the check. Thats was December 14, 2015. So I call my finance company on Jan. 4, 2016 and they haven't received a payment. I email David in financing again and he says he's waiting on alpha from a fax he sent on December 14, 2015. I call the dealership and now someone else is \"helping\" who I won't disclose at this time. And he is waiting on a response from alpha warrenty. ...... really??? I've BOUGHT 2 VEHICLES FROM THIS PLACE AND WAS GOING TO AGAIN..... all I can say is things better go right or I will discourage everyone on every page and website, social media and whatever else I can. If a customer calls with a problem you don't just email or call the place then leave it, you keep calling or emailing until it's fixed especially when I buy more than once......\nAfter submitting this review I had a lady contact me named Melissa. She looked into the problem and found that they never sent the money for the warrenty. She has been a pleasure to work with and I wish I would have done this sooner. Sadly I won't be buying another vehicle from them as long as David A. In financing or Shaun(syan) works there as their apathy and laziness is appalling. Everthing is sunshine and rainbows until u have a problem.Everyone else at adamsonford is great, but if the finance guy who pushes a warrenty doesn't send the money, what else are they not doing?", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b95166e0335:0xefbc2a3c0352ab5a"}

On March 25, 2016 I was at malfunction junction when my 2007 Mustang just stopped working. I pull over & immediately use my road side assistance then google the nearest Ford dealership because I was fairly new to the area. I called the service department & not sure who I spoke with but he was friendly & I told him I would be having my car towed to them for diagnostic work within the hour. He said ok bring it in. Ok me & my boyfriend  follow the tow truck there & speak with Jay in service. He assured me that would try to figure it out. After sitting there for 30min, he comes to the break room & said it was my battery. I said ok replace it. Did that & it still would not crank up. So him & another gentleman almost tore up the starter by trying to crank it & I literally had to say PLEASE stop doing that. So it was around 3 on a friday so Jay stated that the head tech was out & leave my car for the weekend & Monday he will call me by 10am & let me know whats the problem. I said ok. Well Monday I called in to work so I could be available about my car. I called him at 1030 am because I hadnt heard from him. He said they still working on it & try back at 12. Called at 1230pm & he replied they cant get my car crunk up so they dont know whats wrong. That they will start from the bottom up to find the problem.I said I need to know the problem because thats my way to work. He said as long as it doesnt crank up they cant find out. My dad is a retired mechanic so I ask why is that because most car issues often doesnt allow the car to crank up. He said they know its misfiring but dont know from where. I said the diagnostic machine should tell you. I was informed then they dont have a diagnostic machine to put my car own. I about passed out. I said well how long will this take because I need a car to get to work & I need to know what to do. Jay told me that I may need to call enterprise because they dont give out loaner cars & cant fix it until they figure out whats wrong. I said my dad & brother fix on cars & I have never heard of a Ford dealership not able to tell me what was wrong with a Ford car. Jay reply was why dont you get them to look at it. I was just angry. So I called my dad & brother out of town & they instructed me to get to a local Pep boys to get diagnostic testing. Informed Jay of this on that Monday that a tow truck would be to get my car that Tuesday morning. Jay informed my road side assistance that I owed them no money but I didnt want to use them because I didnt want to pay them. By now I was livid. My boyfriend was too. So the following day the tow truck driver went there 2 times to get my car for them to not be able to get my car because it wasnt accesible. I called them & informed them if they dont have my car accesible a 3rd time I was coming with the police. 3rd time tow truck was able to get my car.  Took it to Pep boys & they had a diagnosis within 2hrs. Well in May I left the same review on their facebook page & whoever is over it apologized & offered me 2 free oil changes. Well I have tried to get these 2 free oil changes for me to get there at 2pm on June 28th for Jay to yell out they done with oil changes for the day. So the gentleman at the desk asked could I come back the next day. I said I work all day. He said can you drop it off at lunch. I said sure. I called the next day at lunch to say can you bring it at 2pm. I said no. Tried to bring it again then no time. Its sad that you offer me something for bad service to get bad service on the free offer as well.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b95166e0335:0xefbc2a3c0352ab5a"}
