When my time came it started off with misinformation from the national customer service and hours of frustrating back and forth.  But, as luck would have it,  when my husband and I made a trip to the Fairhope office  that all changed. OMG!! With the personal assistance and professional service of Britney and Cheryl it's done!!!  I mean what a joy and stress free!  Britney listened to us  to help and understand my situation from start to finish.  Then she directed us straight to Cheryl.  Cheryl's knowledge and experience was obvious from the first moment!
