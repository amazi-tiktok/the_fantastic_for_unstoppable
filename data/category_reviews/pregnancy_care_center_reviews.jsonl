I noticed a pattern that a lot of reviewers complained of the wait time and I will say that I did have a couple appointments where I waited a little longer to be seen. It really wasn\u2019t that long so it was barely worth mentioning but I figured I would since it seems to be an issue with other patients. But knowing what I know now I understand why. Dr. Voss is amazing. I came in for my pregnancy and ended up being high risk. She explained everything in great detail and what the plan would be for my pregnancy. She even addressed why there may be a longer wait time sometimes, which I didn\u2019t even bring up, but I thought it was nice that she did. It shows that she\u2019s aware of patient concerns and doing what she can about it. They see patients for regular appointments but also unscheduled appointments if there is an issue that isn\u2019t severe enough for the ER but still needs to be addressed quickly. This was me on a couple of occasions. I called in the morning on 3 separate occasions and was seen within a couple of hours due to complications with my pregnancy. So I really appreciate being seen so quickly and will take waiting a little bit longer for scheduled appointments because of it. The entire staff is very friendly and attentive. When things got serious with my pregnancy Dr.Voss was on top of it and I couldn\u2019t have asked for better care. Things could have gone a lot worse for a lot of reasons but her quick action due to her vast knowledge made sure that the outcome was best case scenario. She followed up with me a couple of times after everything to make sure I was doing okay and I really felt like she took her time. She spent a considerable amount of time talking with me about everything, which is not always the case with some doctors. Very often I feel rushed when I am seeing a physician so in the situation I was in it was nice to feel like I had her ear and care. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to come back to Dr. Voss for future pregnancies or any other needs.

After filling paperwork out for a new patient visit,I was asked to urinate in a specimen cup. I went to the bathroom,sat my cup in the lab window however,I noticed about 6 other cups full of urine with patients names labeled on them as I also work in the medical field,I thought this was VERY dirty and also a HIPPA violation,I proceeded anyways. I was called to the back fairly quickly,there was only one other patient waiting. I was sat down for the nurse to get vitals,then told to sit at the chairs near the lab until I was called. I waited there about 30mins. The nurse then took me to the exam room, as I sat there for at least another hour maybe a little more. I became anxious but,tried to be patient. Dr.Voss walked in,she was very polite however,I felt as soon as she come in and I gave her my reason for seeing her she was showing me all these brochures about weight loss and dermatology products. I weigh 100lbs.,I was not interested in any of this but, listened. She spent about 20mins or so in the room with me she explained everything in great depth and reassured me questions that I worried about were nothing to be concerned about. I then got dressed,went to check out,which was 2:00pm. I had a good experience other than the urine in the bathroom and the long wait time. It wasn't a horrible experience but,I suggest they change some things.

Rude staff and cold hearted physician. *update* being that I was so far along I decided to stay with Ladies First. I will never use them in again. At six months I began having pain in my lower back hip and leg. I called the office countless time and mentioned it to Dr. Bush and her nurse only to be treated like I was a bother. it took me being seen by Dr. Malone (while Bush was on vacation) to learn that I was having sciatic nerve issues. Dr. Malone said she would recommend Bush set me up with physical therapy. I mentioned physical therapy to Bush at my follow up appointment only to be told\" I never heard of pregnant women doing physical therapy\". Then out of nowhere I received a phone call from a therapy center letting me know ladies first had sent a referral *tada* three weeks before my due date. I went to one appointment and the therapist was shocked that they waited so late to finally send me and stated that there was not much (if anything) they could do for me. not to mention that it was not safe for me to do physical therapy do far into my pregnancy. on the day of my due date I went in for my check up. I told the medical assistant that I was having minimal fetal movement she just said ok and left the room. Bush came in assessed me and we discussed induction. I left the office only to be call back to return. When I spoke to Bush She said that she was unaware that I told the medical assistant a having minimal movement from my baby. (do they not communicate with one another??) I was sent for a BPP an was informed that I would be induced that day due to low amniotic fluids. these women for the receptionist to the nurse practitioners to the physicians care nothing about their patients.
