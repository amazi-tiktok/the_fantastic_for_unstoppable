I ordered the Spicy Thai Pork Noodle Bowl--which was FABULOUS, even though we were not permitted to sub out the kimchi for additional soba noodles.  Those noodles are craveworthy, and I'd love to see them as a standalone menu item!  My husband had the Pinchos de Pollo--which was also very good, but an extremely small portion for the money.  He was offered a drink or dessert to compensate for the lack of dinner (which we appreciated), but another skewer of chicken or a vegetable would have been far better.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a075c0a38c1ff:0xd5e3f0c36521c63a"}
