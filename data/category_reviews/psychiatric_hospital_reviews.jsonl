Now, they made me an appointment at first, and I canceled my last 2 appointments because I was feeling much better, no need to go back in my opinion. I found this to be such a lack in empathy.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ced42be3d76b3:0xefe03d81510ea513"}

Then he semi-retired and I was handed over to the young and inexperienced Dr. Hadley.  She was pleasant at the first visit, but it wasn't too long before she showed her true colors .  She betrayed me in a multitude of ways including  the worst a medical doctor can do; she lied to me.  Repeatedly.  New doctors are coming to the office soon, so if you really need help l would recommend you hold on to August.  DO NOT see Dr. Hadley.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888ced42be3d76b3:0xefe03d81510ea513"}
