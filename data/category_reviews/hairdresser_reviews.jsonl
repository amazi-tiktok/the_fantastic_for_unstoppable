They got me in at a moment's notice, and I was very pleased with the outcome. Salon Elite definitely lived up to it's name and I will definitely be returning! Now I can walk next door to Kroger and finish my grocery shopping...definitely a convenient location off Hughes Rd! Thx Karen!!!

Recently the student was unfamiliar with highlighting and caused the lightener to \u201cbleed\u201d causing an intense and distinctly different contrast to show up on the root and parted portion of hair. They tried to fix the problem by toning this portion. By toning the hair I no longer had highlights in this portion leaving the hair a reddish dark color on the root in contrast to the blond. They offered to provide additional highlights on another visit but I would still have to pay for the lightener. I was told $13. The next time I came within 7 days to have the lightener done to fix the toned area without highlights. It became apparent the learning leaders only add a small amount of lightener to each extra bowl needed to lighten so they can up charge $13 per bowl. I have noticed this in the past. This time I was charged for 3 bowls. The instructor said these extra bowls were not necessary, however the instructor allowed the student to use this amount. In addition to the bleeding mistake that occurred the previous time without proper supervision, I was disappointed by the poor customer service given by the instructors and poor business strategy taken by charging the customer for a mistake that was done under the lack of care by the learning leader. I have recommended this school in the past, but I will no longer do so.

We appreciate your honest feedback and you're absolutely right-we are a school! Our students are all at different levels of skill based on several factors including, but not limited to, length of time they have been in the program and the specific areas in which they excel. You may not have known this, but we have a 100% guarantee and you can always let us address any issues you might have had with your service. Students work on guests because they need the hands-on experience which is part of their curriculum. Students aren't ready for the salon until they have completed their program, hours, and have taken both their written and state board exams. They are then ready to transition to an actual salon. We also have students who are in a program here we call Phase 2. These students must pass an interview and hands-on assessment in makeup, cutting, color and texture. These \"master level\" students are available upon request and you'll be getting a more advanced, driven student that is much further along in their program. However, these services do cost a bit more. All that being said, we have to remember that we are a school, first and foremost. We love being able to offer extremely low (much lower than an actual salon) prices for our guests because our students need the hands-on experience. We can all remember the first time we tried to accomplish something...sometimes it was great, but sometimes we also had a lot to learn from the experience. But with practice and patience, we got so much better than when we started and that's exactly how it is for our students. We hate that you weren't happy with your hair, but we do appreciate the time you gave our student in letting them perfect their craft."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889220e6dada637:0x717f01db2564dcc5"}

Unfortunately, what you described above was not what actually happened. As I tried to explain to you and your mother, you had layers of dark brown/black box color all over your head. My main goal is to always keep the integrity of our customer's hair in great condition. We could have easily blasted your hair with bleach and a high volume developer in an effort to remove the dark box color. However, that runs a much higher risk of damaging your hair. Instead, we chose to start with Redken's Pre-Art treatment. This treatment removes all types of things from the hair including, minerals, products, and some artificial color. It also helps to ensure that we get the best possible results from any coloring service as it helps to create a 'blank canvas' on the hair. We did that treatment on you twice, and then brought you back to the bowl to start with a 'soap cap' on your ends. A 'soap cap' is a mixture of bleach (lightener), shampoo and water. This allows the hair's integrity to also be maintained as it starts out much less aggressively removing color from the hair. It was during this process at the shampoo bowl that your mom inquired about pricing. We told her that all our color correction services start at $150/hour. She made the statement that you are 18 and booked the service online without knowing what correct questions to ask. She said you thought you would be able to achieve the blonde hair you wanted on a half price color day, so the total would end up being somewhere around $75. I am sorry for the misunderstanding. Going from a dark brown box color to a light blonde, while maintaining the integrity of your hair, is not a cheap process. It requires time, skill, knowledge, patience, and realistic expectations. Your mom said she would simply prefer to pay for the Pre-Art treatment and the soap cap and you would just leave 'as is' because you didn't want to pay the price for the full service. We never told you that you couldn't achieve the result you wanted. In fact, we told you that we absolutely could get you there! But it would be a process. You are not alone in this process. Anyone who has ever had dark colored hair and eventually achieved light blonde hair can empathize with you. It's not easy, and it's certainly not a 1-2 hour process. Trust me, if I could wave a magic wand and get you there I would. But it's my responsibility to you, as a customer, to do it the correct way and make sure you still have hair on top of your head by the end of it. I am sorry that because of a misunderstanding or miscommunication that it made you want to rate my business negatively on google. My customers are very important to me. I apologized over and over before you left to both of you and tried to explain this process and why it was so important that we do it the right way. I hope this helps to clear up any confusion about what happened on our end. I want you to be happy with your hair, and I want to help in any way I can. Please feel free to contact us and I will work with you on getting your hair color to where you want it to be. As I was more than willing to do at your initial appointment. Take care!"}, "gmap_id": "0x88893ff6535421f5:0xe467b9c2cd19892e"}

Not one of them greeted me said \"Hello welcome to Ulta\" or asked if I needed help or anything they all were very smug and continued there conversations. This location has to be the most dirty Ulta that I have ever been in. ALL testers were filthy and not wiped down, the inside and outside of the pallets are just nasty smashed ,crushed and messed over. The outside of the pallets have all kinds of mess on them obviously they dont maintain them. Also a lot of the pallets were not even properly attached to the display  barley touching it it fell off... touch the pallet next to it.. they both fall off.. especially in the Tart cosmetics section it was a mess. All of the lip sticks were smashed and running down the jar it did not look sanitary or properly maintained. If you did take a sample or a swotch of a color there were no wipes to clean your hands ex.. the clean up sections were not properly stocked. The isles were unorganized and had products on the floor in the hair care area. Make up storage boxed that are $60 + strung out on the floor with brushes and what not. The entire time I was in the store not one employee greeted or asked if I needed help finding anything they were very unwelcoming and uninviting and had a dont bother me vibe.  I will not be returning to this location of Ulta beauty.  I go to the location in River chase and theres is perfect friendly, clean and welcoming so I know what to expect from the franchise.  Midtown village location is not hitting the mark. Also the store needs a good airing out because the perfume testing smells were so over powering it hit me like a truck the second I entered the store. It was distracting and over whelming how it felt stuffy as if there is no air circulation in the store and smelled of stale perfume samples all mixed together with thick air. Which the other Ulta locations I have visited do not have this problem. The store did  not have a clean sleek environment that Ulta is known for. Non of the products were properly fronted on the shelf for easy and clear access. I had to keep checking to make sure the correct pallet was sitting in the proper spot and most of the time they were not. Everything was jumbled around not in its proper place not properly fronted for easy viewing. At the end of it all the store was such a mess I just left.

Staying at the residence inn, I Googled best barber near me, and Robert Henry popped up first. Took a look at a few reviews and then booked my appointment online for just a few hours later.\n\nRobert Henry is located inside the Sola Salons community of beauty care, which is a series of suites that are rented by different beauty experts. Walking into the solo suite, I was met by Robert who was gratious and welcoming, as was his work space. Very clean, with a modern feel, Robert started with a brief consultation, asking me what I was looking for, as well as assessing my hair's style. He made some brief suggestions and offered up a bottled water and then we were off.\n\nI signed up for the business cut. From moment one I knew I made the right choice. Shampoo, a little massage and then he dives right into his craft. Robert was talkative and engaging while never being overbearing, he had a comforting chair side manor, and walked me through what he was doing, like a play by play.\n\nHis style is precise and you know, even if you can't see, that you are being treated to a Great haircut. Once he had finished with the overall styling, he conditioned and treated me to a warm face towel. Man, what a touch. A brief scalp massage and then he popped me back up, applied some product and I get the glimpse of the final product. It is Amazing. He shows me the back, where he tiered it a little more in the lower section, remembering how I told him that section grew faster than other spots. Love the attention to detail.\n\nI highly recommend Robert Henry. I have a pretty wild mane, curly in spots, straight in others and some pretty crazy hairlines, and they were no match for this amazing stylist.\n\nMahalo & Namaste,\n\nmpgink", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1528226036488, "text": "Welcome to Birmingham Matthew !!\nThank you for your feedback.

I showed them the picture and neither said they could achieve the simple braid and curl. they explained that the stylist I was scheduled for had called in, but I was not informed of this until I had already made the 45 min trip.

Nicole not only made me feel comfortable immediately the first time I visited; she also managed to form an instant friendship with me. That's not an easy thing to do. She's like the Nerd Whisperer or something.\n\nWhat's more, Vital Beauty Bar is an inviting, comfortable, classy environment that simultaneously makes me feel at home and a little bit fancy.

I have gone over records of your past services with us back in July, and we never charged you to redo your hair. After the initial service, if our clients are not happy with the outcome or the color did not take to the hair as is what happened in your case, we are happy to take care of any charges in the future until your hair is exactly how you wanted it. The initial color charge on July 18th of $105 covered the product used on your hair to achieve the balayage highlights you asked for. We had to bleach your hair from the solid black color you told us you had done at a different salon. You agreed and understood at that time. You came back on July 19th to add more balayage so that the red you then desired would show up, and you left happy. Then finally on July 26th you came back to add even more red. You were not charged for either of those services on the 19th or 26th. We have records of this if you would like the proof. You left on July 26th happy with the outcome. We are so sorry to hear you feel \"ripped off\" a few months later as we truly tried to do everything we possibly could to make you happy with your hair without destroying the integrity of your hair.

I lived out of state for school, and would plan my visits around when I could come to The Masters. Even now, with me living in Nashville, I would schedule well in advance to make a trip to this salon so I could see my favorite hair stylist, Rita. As someone with curly hair, it takes me a long time to find someone who has the skillset to work with curl patterns. I have had many bad haircuts in my life\u2014anyone with curly hair can relate. Rita changed the way I worked with and styled my hair. I even recommended for my mother to start visiting the salon because I wanted to refer her to Rita. Recently, Rita told us she was moving out of state and that she would be referring all of her clients to Kimberly. I trusted the salon, and so I scheduled my next appointment.\n\nKimberly has a great disposition. I explained I didn\u2019t want to deviate from the shape that Rita had left, and I only wanted it a little shorter because I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to be back for a long time. Kimberly asked me if I wanted for her to cut my hair either dry or wet, because \u201ccurly haired girls always have a preference\u201d. I told her I would be okay with what she was most comfortable with, and she decided to cut my hair wet. I noticed she was cutting it in large chunks and not taking her time. When she was finished, she asked me how much product I wanted in my hair because \u201ccurly haired girls are particular.\u201d After she put it in, she separated my hair into clips and said she was finished while she pulled out the diffuser. As she plugged it in, she looked at me and said: \u201cDo you want to diffuse it yourself? Curly haired girls usually like to do this part themselves.\u201d I was taken aback because this has never been asked of me before\u2014especially by a place that charges almost $100 for a cut. I told Kimberly that, sure, I could diffuse my hair myself. After I was finished, I looked at the result. The hair fell like a triangle; she easily had cut off 4 inches. I quickly paid and went to my car. I decided that I couldn\u2019t leave a place that charged so much to do a substandard job. I pulled up a picture of my hair after I received my last cut, and went back to the salon to see if it could be fixed. When I came back and showed Kimberly the picture, she was apologetic. I sat back down in her chair, and she proceeded to ask me to tell her where I thought she should cut my hair to make it look right. If I could cut my hair myself, I would. But I cannot, and that is why I spend more than $20 to go to a place that emphasizes professionalism and a higher skillset of stylist. Seeing that I was just going to have to leave with a bad haircut, I left.\n\nI called management to ask for a refund. My mother had given me a $50 gift card and I had put the rest on my credit card. They told me the owner was out of town and that they couldn\u2019t refund my money without his saying that it was okay. Instead, they offered me two haircuts. I explained that, although I appreciated this gesture, I wouldn\u2019t be returning to the salon to get my hair cut again. They insisted that it would be okay and that I should go to the stylist who trained both Kimberly and Rita in cutting curly hair. When I declined, they said they would try to talk to the owner. A couple of days later, they returned my phone call to say they had not heard from the owner and they still suggested I take the original offer. I had no plans on going back, but my mother has straight hair and usually has no problems when it comes to getting it trimmed. I asked if I could transfer my two cuts to my mother, seeing as she had purchased the gift card and it was also her money wasted on a bad cut. I would feel better knowing that she could do something nice for herself. But, they said no. I never heard back.\n\nI had to write this for all of the curly haired girls out there who \u201care particular\u201d or who have a \u201cpreference.\u201d Do not come to this salon.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1566598422101, "text": "Hello Brittany, first off if this was to happen to one of us or a member of our own family, we would not be happy.

When I came in and asked for something different the manager and son of the owner stepped in and decided to do the formulation and process himself. This man is considered to be extremely good with color. My hair came out neon orange when I asked for dark brown. He then tried to fix it the same day and it was still very very wrong. At this point I had been at the salon for seven hours. He then asked me to come back that Saturday for an \"adjustment\". I came out of that no better and my hair was damaged and breaking off. They also still charged me $450. I have never gone back. I also witnessed failure of management on managing clients and appointments. Brett has set up the salon where clients are passed around to whoever is free to work on them. So what you can expect is someone else possibly starting your appointment and another stylist finishing at. I experienced it myself and with other clients and it not only frustrated the clients but their stylists and employees themselves.

My job pays me to look good and I couldn't even walk into my work place feeling confident (which is one of my favorite things about getting my hair professionally done the \"confidence boost\" you have after)  I research beauty and hair consistently I guess because of this I felt like I knew more about what needed to be done to my hair than the staff which I should not be able to say because they have had actual schooling in this. I could have done what they did myself and it probably would have looked better not to mention this all costed over $200 my usual stylist has been fully booked for some time now so I thought I would try someone new not only is the outcome with her phenomenal and EXACTLY what I ask for every time but she also costs half the price.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1482178905911, "text": "Dear Alexzandria,\nThe Masters places a very high emphasis on each and every guest receiving the very best of what we have to offer.

I came as a walk-in because I needed a haircut very badly and everywhere else I went was booked. I walked in and the people were pleasent enough but they all seemed to not give a care. The girl who cut my hair was kind of rude. She never introduced herself(I had to find out by looking at her cosmetology license) and she made me feel uncomfortable and like she could care less that I was giving her business. She also never started a conversation with me and when I tried to start one with her she never answered me back. Yes, I understand they need to concentrate but, my previous hairdress who retired made an effort to make me feel good about myself while I was in her chair. She spent maybe 20 minutes on my hair and she didn't even style it with a flat iron or blow dryer. Mind you, she dry cut it, which to me is a no-no and she should have put in the effort and asked me my preference. I would have paid extra. I didn't realize until after I had gone to work that it was everything I told her I didn't want. Choppy haircut and and chunky layers. I'm so upset and if I could get my money back I would.
