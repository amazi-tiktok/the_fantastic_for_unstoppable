There was little to no direction by the \"instructor\" who made it VERY clear that she was not supposed to be there that late and informed us that the girl who was supposed to teach the class couldn't make it.\nLike many other establishments like this, they offer a variety of painting classes at different levels of difficulty. You also have the option to \"upgrade\" your painting by purchasing a larger canvas.\nAnother thing that most of these places do is sell the paintings that the instructors do during every class. I wish I could say that they're affordable and worth the price, but that definitely is not the case. When I inquired about which paintings were for sale and about the general cost, the woman got snarky with me. After paying well over $100 to for little to no instruction and having an overall bland experience, I did not want to give this place any more of my money.\nPAINTER'S TIP:\nI would suggest stopping by Walmart (or ordering off Amazon) and getting a cheap variety pack of paintbrushes (I posted a photo of the pack I purchased). I found that the brushes they supplied were a little worn out and often I couldn't get my lines as thin as I wanted them (I have a heavy hand).", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88628b429faac5db:0xb11d47d73171010c"}

Nothing held back; Stacy is invested in her students having as much success as possible in the process. She was accommodating to my flight schedule and carry-on restrictions and worked with me on the things I could not bring on the plane. The class was fun and I got to meet and make new friends with a great bunch of clay folk. And, I made a crazy octopus bowl to boot!\n\nLater in the summer, I was able to take another class, Slip Trailing, on my way to a work seminar. This was a tremendous compliment to the octopus work, and will have applications in a lot of my other work. It adds a dimension (literally) that is not available through glaze or underglaze. She was detailed enough in the chemistry that I was hooked, but not so much that the class was lost. The demos and slip play go a super long way in understanding the intricasies of the process.\n\nNow to the area. Alabama is just lovely! The hot sticky weather that they were having was perfect for my cold northern blood. The flora in Alabama is completely different to mine, and I enjoyed driving around to take it all in. The Mills are an amazing space dedicated to the arts and I could have spent days wandering the booths. And!! Anyone visiting Stacy who is gluten free or paleo; I found the most delightful bakery and eatery. Their dedicated gluten free facility has some of the best stuff, and that includes BEFORE my diagnosis. Try the jalapeno cheddar scones at Mason Dixon Bakery, you\u2019ll never want to leave.\n\nSo seriously, if the opportunity comes to have class with Stacy and S.P.Morgan Studios, take it; you will have no regrets.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIe6G8pfkAKvVmaeVWdTqCVFZ-KmMOg_B6chwA=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOv4tW9XFJaxXLyvtizsXfGb3AaEk10zOiKZ9RQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5voVbbuE5ouJtKV0l6OBBXkc-PMB3pbehYnDF=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626cbcca324b2d:0x6d862a64a6cb230d"}
