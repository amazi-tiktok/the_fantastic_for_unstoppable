I had more freedom of movement in this knee than I had felt in a long time.

I no longer have any of the aforementioned pain related problems. The blood flow in both legs has improved dramatically. I now sleep soundly as the veins in both my feet & legs have greatly reduced in size.\n\nThe amount of pain involved in the procedures vs the results do in fact warrant having the procedures performed.\nYes, it's worth it. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Kenneth L Todd and his TRULY GREAT STAFF for anyone who desires an evaluation and/or subsequent treatment for vein problems.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892927a3a417219:0x734fe3cd0d3bbfca"}

Therefore their profit margin is much more important than patient care and treatment.  Some of their policies reflect that also. For instance, if you go to the ER needing surgery, if there is not a DR. to do that surgery on duty, you will have to wait until one is scheduled if it \"probably\" won't kill you to wait.  My husband waited 3 days for an orthopedic surgeon for a spiral break in his femur, which is a very dangerous bone to break. It's where our blood supply is made and when broken, releases air bubbles and clots into the blood stream so he was kept on blood thinners for 3 days before major surgery.  Now, not only did the hospital get to charge us for those 3 extra days and all his normal medications, because you are NOT allowed to take your own from home, but they did NOT have to pay a surgeon overtime or vacation pay to come in when off duty, so we are cash cows to that hospital.  The nurses are horribly underpaid and badly treated, but with Huntsville Hosp. owning all hospitals for 8 counties, they really don't have a lot of choices. Most of the nurses were wonderful, however the Dr.'s, especially Dr. Wright, made us feel like our health was secondary to profit, pushing hard for procedures we are very hesitant about and offering no real evidence they would even help. In fact he told us straight out that it probably would not help, but it just might.  Just be aware the Dr.'s are Huntsville Hospitals life blood money and do your research, ask lots of questions, ask about safety and recalls for any hardware they want to implant. In our case the Defibrillator manufacturer was being sued in a class action suit because the leads were corroding and impaling the arteries, but they were still using these defibs and when we asked about them Dr. Wright's answer was, and I quote \"they all have problems\". Now that's not exactly comforting.  We told him we wanted to do some research and think about it, but that did not stop his office from calling us EVERYDAY for 3 weeks until I asked them not to call us ever again, we would call them if we changed our minds. Then we were told it was their job to \"recruit 12 to 18 surgeries PER DAY\".  Yes after 35 years of marriage, it is an \"us\" decision.  We both feel very uncomfortable with it all. We are going for a second opinion at Vanderbilt. I'll update and post what they tell us.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88621354836d54b3:0xc3a7a40a6be15cbb"}

I am sure that the doctors there are great at their job.  I think Mother has had ok care.\nAfter several calls and no return calls back, we have managed to get the job done.  My Mother was in the hospital in January and ended up on a ventilator, the day she was released from the hospital the heart center was to come down and review her medication.  Never showed, but we had an appointment with her Doctor in a week so thought all would be good, but that appointment was changed, and then changed again.  Yesterday she went into see the dr and he had no idea what meds she was taking and what milligrams, are you kidding me, your nurse practitioner never showed up to review medications.  She is on coreg which needs to be taken two times a day, but the orders said one.  They changed her meds to hydralazine along with the coreg, the hydralazine is to be taken three times a day, but again the orders said once a day. Yesterday they took her blood pressure in the office and said it was 120/70, and my sister said that is strange. It has been running high, and she snapped back well not today.  Then the dr took it and it was 200/94, really.  On the way home from work last night my sister stopped to pick up meds and only one was there, a water pill, not the increased dosage of coreg or hydralazine.  Either this office is very incompetent or they have way to many patience.  Our Mother is very precious to us, and she has been through hell and back.

Customarily post procedure, most everyone returns to work and daily activities the very next day or two at the latest.  We understand not everyone recovers the same, additional time to to feel back to normal may be warranted.  We would have been more than happy to extend your time off with a work excuse...not a problem at all.  If you experience post procedure discomfort, you are welcome to try heat or ice to the area that is bothering you.  Yes, this would be difficult while at work, this is intended to be done while resting at home.  Compression hose is to be worn for 2 weeks following the ablation procedure.  We want you to resume walking and regular day to day activities within the next day or two at the latest while wearing the compression hose, just not strenuous exercise or running for 2 weeks.  This will aid in your recovery and prevent post procedure swelling plus minimize the risk even further for blood clots.  We don't want you to sit around not moving for 2 weeks, that will only prolong the recovery process.   Compression hose is covered by only 1 of the 50+ insurance companies that we accept....and only on a case by case basis with that one carrier....after we submit your medical records for review by the insurance investigator.  The majority of the time this charge is denied.  We charge the patient for the compression hose up front, if insurance happens to reimburse us for the hose, we will refund the purchase price to the patient immediately.  Unfortunately, this happens only 3-4 times a year.  Some patients attempt to recover the charge on their own by submitting the charge....they are sometimes successful, however, it is only with the one insurance company.  I promise you will receive a reimbursement for the hose if we receive a reimbursement from the insurance company.  Again, I'm terribly sorry you are disappointed.....we would be delighted to meet with you in the office to discuss your concerns.  I appreciate you taking the time to review us....we strive to be a dedicated center of excellence.  Reviews help us improve our patient care and office policy.
