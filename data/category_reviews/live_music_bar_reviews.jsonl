The only time prices would increase is when a particular product price is raised from wholesaler to us.  We do not simply raise prices arbitrarily on everything in house.  I would be happy to look into something in particular if you care to let me know.\n\nThe other issue is with the former Madison store, which is not \"gone\" per se.  We sold that store to another couple and they decided to change the name of the business to Madison Taproom.  It still exists, but under new ownership and name now.  It is important to me to make that distinction between selling a business and simply going out of business (which did not happen).\n\nYour business is very important to us.
