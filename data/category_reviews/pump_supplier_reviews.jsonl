Two years ago, directly after purchasing a house that had sat dormant for 3+ years, the septic system decided to act up.  The Tice's came out late at night and found out that my tank was 100% overgrown with tree roots (reminded me of the scene in the Creep Show episode with the meteor).  They pumped down the tank immediately so that we could shower, and within a week they had come out and completely cleaned out the root system (chainsaw work INSIDE my tanks).  They did an amazing amount of work for a great price.  Yesterday, the old system started acting up again.  They came out first thing this morning so we could shower for work.  As we had suspected 2 years ago, the roots had gotten into the drain system as well. Absolutely amazing folks! Will always use them.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1597804364349, "text": "Thank you Mr Amaro. See you soon."}, "gmap_id": "0x88896512f3750d81:0x1bb51a0a83c5bbf4"}

We came out to your house and you had only dug up one side of your tank (1 lid) and you had another lid broken. We pumped all we could out bc we couldnt get to the other side that was not uncovered. We flushed out your field lines going back 125 ft bc they were stopped up and we were trying to save the lines for you bc you didnt have the $$ to upgrade your tank. He stayed out there with his HEAD down in your tank trying to help you out. Again, bc you didnt have the $ to upgrade he was going to go as far as bring you a concrete lid of ours to put on your tank in place of your broken lid. You talked to him the next day and he told you that he would come back out there and finish pumping the tank if you got it all uncovered and bring you another concrete lid with no charge. So that is why your tank did not get fully pumped out that night at 11pm."}, "gmap_id": "0x88896512f3750d81:0x1bb51a0a83c5bbf4"}
