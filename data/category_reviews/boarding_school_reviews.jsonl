I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that a lot of the girls I attended with are still struggling. I think this facility needs to reevaluate their methods and treatment of their students and make some serious changes. All the good reviews are from parents that they probably urged to leave these reviews in the first place or they are from students that are freshly out of the program who haven\u2019t been given the time to process the actual trauma of it all.\n\nPlease think very hard about it before putting all your money, time and energy into this program.

I CAME OUT WORSE THAN I DID GOING IN! This program was very traumatizing for me. Although I am thankful for certain aspects like the fine arts program, branded, and other extracurricular activities. I found it extremely hard to participate in these activities unless you were perfect and conformed to their idealistic beliefs of what the \"perfect\" woman was. I mainly went because I had issues with depression and suicidal thoughts. However, instead of recieving the \"therapeutic approach\" the website claims to have. I found myself being punished for my depressive thoughts and they continuously threatened to take away my privelages because of this. This lead me to believe I should deal with my depression in quiet. Throughout the program, I delt with bullying not only from the peers but from staff as well! Also, I found my counselor discrediting some of my thoughts and beliefs as if the weren't enough to be accurate. I never recovered from self harm, instead I did it in the dark and out of sight which was hard enough. I did not speak to the opposite gender for 16 months, this lead to sexual confusion and now I find myself having a hard time saying no when I'm uncomfortable in a situation. Another aspect that is concerning is finance. I am no stranger to the amount of money parents have to spend for their daughters while they go through this program. It's almost like it goes down the drain. The food was terrible, I can't eat Shepard's pie, grilled cheese, or lasagna anymore because I used to throw up after every single meal there due to the extreme amounts of grease. Also, the girls ran kitchen cleanup, yard maintenance, car washing, and even scrubbing a dumpster with a rag! These were considered \"chores\", we did not earn a single penny. Isn't this child labor? All in all, please think twice before you send your daughter here. I don't know a single girl who has came out as the angel there parents were expecting.

My husband and I did everything we could for our daughter but she still continued to resist and rebel against us. We took her to therapy, we tried talking with her or disciplining her when it was necessary, but nothing worked. After her running away, we knew we needed to do something more for her. When we brought her to Teen Challenge we were torn at leaving our daughter behind but also confident that this is where God had led us. The team they have there is incredible. They not only helped my daughter but also helped us as parents! It was not easy leaving my daughter there, but we knew if we stuck through with it we would not be sorry. My daughter met the Lord there and made a complete turn around. She is now in college pursing a Bachelor's degree and is also recently married! The relationship we have now is completely restored and we are still growing together as a family. We praise God for what He has done through Teen Challenge!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cd9ecc9306f81:0xf4d9596d34c4d24a"}

I want to say that I intend for this to be an honest and accurate representation of my experince for parents considering sending their kids here. I will say that the program DID help me before I start. OKAY, I have a lot to say. First of all, my parents did not tell me they were going to send me. One day, they sprung it on me and dropped me off. I do not recommend this at all, as it was quite traumatizing. I recommend good communication. It is important to note that this is a PROGRAM and very serious. The girls walk in lines, have conversation guildines, and recieve punishment such as work detail. Also, the environment encourages \"accountability\" amoungst the girls. This can lend itslef to toxicity, as girls are rewarded for telling on others. Unfortunatly, many girls adopt a fake persona to get through the program. Many parents are told that there is an extrmely high scusess rate. I do not know the overall statistcs, but I can tell you from observing girls' social medias that I was in the program with, that many girls were actually hurt by the program, and have come out worse. This is not becuase of the staff or the religious emphasis. I belive that these are both great. The staff is wondefful, and I genuiny developed a relationship with Christ that absolutley changed my life. But, there is not much transition from the program to home life when nearing the end. This is a HUGE problem. Girls are dropped into a secluded environment for over  a year and then dropped back into the real world, with no practical coping skills. I think the program is helpful in two ways: First, It removes girls from a toxic enviroment. Second, it exposes girls to Christ. These are great things. But, it honestly depends on the person if it works. My time there was the hardest 15 months of my life, and this decision should not be taken lightly. I would recommend it in certain cases only. ALSO, I want to say that the food offered is from Cysco, and not healthy. And, it is extrmely hard to get proper medical attention. If you are sick, you are taken to a free walk- in clinic sometimes after weeks and weeks of asking. These are all things to be considered. I am greatful for it at the end of the day becuase my life was changed. But that is not the case for evryone.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cd9ecc9306f81:0xf4d9596d34c4d24a"}

I'm not skinny as a pencil, but I'm nowhere near as heavy as I once was. Most girls in the program take every opportunity to pig out even when the food that is provided is optional. Also, many girl refuse to push themselves to participate in the exercises we perform and \"pretend\" to do the exercises. So...many girls gain weight because of the choices they make while in the program, not because of the program itself. I'm not the only girl who has lost significant amounts of weight since being in the program, and I certainly wont be the last. We are required to eat all of our food other than the optional items such as desserts and sides because there are many girls who would starve themselves otherwise, because girls come to this program with a variety of issues, not just substance abuse. (Just for clarification, I myself never had any sort of substance abuse issues). They did not feed us spoiled food. The church is very spirit-filled, but that is exactly what gets through to many girls who wouldn't be open to God otherwise. I've seen girls legitimately have demons caste out of them and then have a total life transformation that was not evident whatsoever beforehand. No girls are required to be prayed over, the only thing required is for girls to stand during worship services and be in attendance, but everything else is voluntary. There are multiple girl I can reference who went back to their old lives, and I'm not surprised, considering their behavior in the program. I can also reference multiple girls who are still walking strong in the world, going on missions trips, and living lives of freedom and joy for the first time in their lives. All of my nightmares, insomnia, unsettling flashbacks, addiction, depression, and rage is now completely gone from my life. I'm pursuing a strong relationship with God and going to Taiwan and India to do missions for the next year before pursuing an unconventional career in ministry. I've already been offered an internship at a local ministry, attend 3 youth groups a week, am applying for a student leadership position at one of these youth groups, and am living life to the fullest beyond anything I've ever known. So...take my word for it, if you daughter chooses to pursue God during her program...good things will most definitely come out. :)", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cd9ecc9306f81:0xf4d9596d34c4d24a"}

I see that most of the reviews are from parents, but here's the thoughts of someone a few years after graduating.\n\nColumbus Girls Academy is a  Teen Challenge Center, meant for teenagers with life controlling issues such as substance abuse, suicidal tendencies, or criminal activities.\n\nThey use Alpha Omega Academy to teach their students. It's all online and teachers in the class room have almost no involvement in the curriculum. It's not a very challenging school and doesn't adequately prepare students for a college education.\n\nThe campus is beautiful, and students live in dorms on the edge of the lake.\n\nThe food is cheap, with lots of donated food from local food pantries and places like Atlanta Bread Company.\n\nDisciplines can be extreme, such as adding multiple months on the already arduous 15 month program and taking more of your money.\n\nThe tuition cost my family around $25,000 for my 15-month program, which I was unable to graduate from due to my religious views. I never got any months added, followed the rules, and I was once an ESL (their internship program). But I didn't agree with how they ran their operation, so they kicked me out without a graduation.\n\nParental contact is very limited. Parents can only call their child every other week for 10 minutes. Children can send 3 letters a week. After you've been there for a couple of months your parents can come see you for a weekend every other month. Once you're in the last three months of your program you can go visit your parents at home for a few days.\n\nOverall, my experience at Teen Challenge was poor. I was sent there because my foster parents didn't know how to raise a kid who had a rough past, having lost both of her parents. I was depressed. I didn't have any substance abuse problems and I wasn't rebellious. I was just depressed. The experience turned my away from Christianity, like many others. If you want to send your child here, think about it first. Teen Challenge should be a last resort, when you no longer know how to parent your child. Try everything else first, instead of wasting all the money.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888cd9ecc9306f81:0xf4d9596d34c4d24a"}
