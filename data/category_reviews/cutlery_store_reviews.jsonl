I've walked through this store and seen items I literally had no clue existed. Staff has been completely friendly and helpful in my experience. Especially with the nice array of FANCY coffee machines that will gladly dispense samples for you.\n\nAlso, toward the back of the store they have a kitchen setup for group cooking classes. Again, imo on the pricey side but check the website because they sometimes have sales! The class we attended was nothing short of spectacular! The teacher was great, the format of cooking in teams worked well and ALL of the food we prepared in this particular class was amazing! So happy that we got to bring the recipes home to try them out on our own (and maybe add our own spin to things)!\n\nCome check the store out for yourself, even if just to simply window shop!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891eb847f706b5:0xf46893ac2b7f056d"}
