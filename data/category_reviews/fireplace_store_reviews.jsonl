I told him I couldn't afford that and he said \"well mam I can't help you with that. There's nothing else I can do for you then.\" I needed my ac running so I gathered up every cent I had and told him to go ahead with the repair. He then came in and told me that the thermostat wasn't telling the unit to kick on so we must have fried the new thermostat also. He left the base plate wired up and told me that it was wired correctly and I just needed to go get a new touchpad and it would work. He is a professional and I trusted his word so I paid him the $600 and he left without it working. It was late Saturday night so I ran and got the new one first thing Sunday morning. I put it on the wall and it would not work. I had to call another repairman to come out and fix it Sunday. There was nothing wrong with the 1st thermostat. The problem was that the Jolly technician wired it wrong. Now I question everything he did that night. I feel like I paid a lot of money for absolutely nothing. I have called twice and cannot get a call back. I should have refused to pay but I trusted this guys word. I will not make that mistake again.
