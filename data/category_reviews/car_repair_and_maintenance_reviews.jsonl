Deceitful and dishonest. Their management told my husband that this was a coincidence and a known issue with the make and model of his vehicle. Then proceeded to give him a quote to repair.

The owner himself installed it and he did it in less than 15 minutes. Great deal right? Wrong. I already had a back up camera installed and hooked up to the old system. Dude didn't hook up the wires of the back up camera to the new system he installed. I was in a rush so left and came back another day. Dude tells me the new system didn't have an back up camera input. Yea Right. I wouldn't have bought the system if that was the case. I take it to an Audio shop that I use all the time to get all my stuff installed including the other after market radio that was replaced by the new one. They call me to the back and show me where the wires where just thrown in the back of the dash versus using just 1 cable tie and where on the back of the system, it clearly has a wire and and input that says CAM. Not to mention they gave me a dash kit that fit the radio so you can't see the gap between the head unit and the dash board. I've gotten a lot of cars tinted here by other workers, but never had the manager himself work on my car and never got electronics installed here and will never again. How you own a shop but your workers do a better job than you?

GO ANYWHERE ELSE! !\n\nIf you don't feel like reading the entire review I understand so the short version is this.\nMy truck left there worse than it went in and I paid them almost $300 to do that. Lights now don't work, instrument lights don't work, if I turn the AC on after starting the truck it resets the audio system. Wires hanging, trash left in the truck and really, REALLY poor service and lack of respect. When I told the owner about the problems and that I simply wanted a refund for labor only  because I don't feel comfortable letting them back into my wiring he said \"good luck bro! Try and get your money back and I'll sue YOU!\".\nI never want back because after checking the receipt it clearly says no refunds which makes sense when you do work like this.\n\nThe quality of workmanship AND professionalism was and still is the worst I've ever encountered.\nI have NEVER written a review and I'm 30 years old and have dealt a lot in business. The fact that I'm writing this review is an extreme for me.\n\nThe stereo system they \" installed \" for me is very cut and dry.  I supplied the head unit, subwoofer and amp for '02 Tahoe. When I called to make an appointment they said come in first thing Monday (I called on Friday ) and this wasn't a problem for me.\nWhen I called Monday morning to find out why my fiance was waiting in the parking lot for 45 minutes just to see someone they told me they're audio guy doesn't work Mondays but \"they'll make it work\".\nAfter 4 hours of \"installing\" she finally left. When I got home from work and inspected the work I found the following:\n\n1) Wires freely hanging run across my pedals.\n2) The sub and amp were installed on the wrong side of the vehicle after being told 5 times and told to 3 different employees where to put it. I even set it up on the side I wanted it on and they put it opposite.\n3) I was told they tune the system before it leaves the shop. They're \" tuning \" involved them turning everything to the maximum capacity and leaving it. Dangerous to any electronics.\n4) They didn't have the materials needed to do a professional installation on my head unit (which is a $650 Kenwood double din) so I still have spaces beside the unit and looks like ass and nothing like a factory install like they assured me it would.\n6) Left trash wire and clippings all through out my truck. When I mentioned this the OWNER told me \"there was already trash there.\" There wasn't. I keep a clean truck. And when I mentioned the poorly ran wiring he told me it couldn't be because he did the wiring HIMSELF! !\n\nI could list more but you get the idea and as I said I don't write reviews.

Since my initial visit to the McGee rd service facility back in December,  which did an excellent job, I have had 2 bad experiences.  1st bad experience was with my wife's car. She had the oil changed at the eastern blvd facility.  Approximately 1 week later her car's check engine light came on and the fault was for dirty oil. She had the oil checked at a local change facility and it was a quart low. They did another oil change, and I have the filter from that change and it is not as clean a filter as you think from 1 week previous. I had also gotten my oil changed in my truck a few days after she did at the eastern Blvd facility.  So I decided to take a look at my oil and filter. The filter on my truck had an install date written on it from the McGee Rd facility of 12/9/19. The date I first got Express to change it. They supposedly changed my oil and filter on 2/7/20 at McGee rd. I will also attach a pic of the filter . Needless to say this is a very bad way to run a business.  Engine damage from dirty oil is very significant possibility from these action.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO43eqZAxl6i36R5mIsoxQpWPbaVCPg79nGVXA2=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": {"time": 1582925050257, "text": "Hi there, Ernest.

They showed me on a print out how the camber was over an inch out of line and how the toe of one wheel was turned too far in.

It was the perfect storm of bad timing, incredibly delayed roadside service, and the literal annoyance of cold and rainy weather. I looked up tire mechanics in the area and happened upon these guys. After a couple of calls to let them know i was still awaiting a tow truck, we realized I might not even make it to them before closing time. And on top of that, if it was deemed that I did need a new tire, they might not have what I needed. It was at this point that the managers asked me where I was located! Wyatt and Sam actually drove to where I was, helped me put my spare tire on, and assisted me safely to the shop. They were busy, and still took incredible care of me. I truly can't thank the team there enough. The customer service is off the charts. Everyone was personable and kind, the shop itself is clean and orderly, and they got me taken care of super fast! Honestly, I am just so thankful to have encountered such a great team. Its too bad I'm not a local, but I'm very thankful that it was in Calera that my tire blew. :) THANKS AGAIN Y'ALL!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1612996890750, "text": "Hi, Britt, thank you for the positive feedback!

Not only was I lied to apart my part, I was also lied to about the person at the mechanic shop that was supposed to be there to fix it.\nAccording to them, they use the same company to transport parts to the different shops and that the drivers all have more or less the same route.  So if someone could please answer me this question;  how is it that you have the same driver, same truck, same route have EVERY PIECE  of glass break on not 1 occasion, but on 5 trips in the same month?  And how is it that that driver still works and has his license?\nMyself, and my husband were also told that a man by the name of Tony was the one that was in charge of my window, since he was not only the supervisor, but he was the man that works on windows.  Well when we both called and asked for him, not only did he NOT WORK THERE, the shop has NEVER heard of him.  Come to find out he was dating someone that works in that office, and apparently they broke up or were arguing and they wanted to get back at him by trying to blame for not only ALL the glass being broken on every order, but by falsifying his employment.\nWhen I did call back and tell them my questions and concerns, not only was I hung up on, but my number was blocked and so was my husband's.  Now even if we call from our work's phone number once we say who we are or mention what vehicle we are talking about we get hung up on and when we call back we get a message that the number is no longer in service.\nI know this because I called just before posting this and when I mentioned my name and vehicle the line got disconnected somehow and when I called back the number a few minutes later I got that same disconnect message.\nDO NOT USE THIS COMPANY, unless you don't mind being lied to and having your insurance company lied to also.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b963351e5bf:0xf32bff8b6892d580"}

The dealership fixed a small electric problem for us and stated that while they could find no evidence of moisture getting in through our windshield, it might be possible that water was getting in.  My husband and I never saw any evidence whatsoever that there was water getting in; however, we took the car into Glass America just to follow up.  The glass technician looked at our windshield and said that it looked good and that there was not a problem, except that there was a tiny place on the passenger side that needed a little bit of resealing.  He resealed it for free and sent us on our way.  A few days later it rained and water was not just leaking...but pouring into our car from the top of the windshield.  The ceiling of the car was sopping wet and water was all over the console and floors.  I called Glass America about this issue and I was transferred to a manager named Brandon (who had never seen our car), and who proceeded to inform me that my car already had a problem and that is why we brought it there to begin with.  He denied any responsibility for the issue.  He talked over me constantly and then stated that the only way in which to rule out a leak would be to have taken off the entire windshield to begin with.  When I asked why that wasn't done to begin with if that is the ONLY way to rule out a leak, he accused me of calling the people at Glass America \"bad people.\"  I have never experienced such rude customer service.  He did not offer any compensation and now we have water damage to our car.  When we called the dealership and spoke with the technician who had referred us to Glass America, he was astounded by what happened because he knew that we were not having any leaks even remotely close to that in the car he had worked on.

I brought my car in a week ago because the front end of the car was not driving properly. RoadMart said that they could not replicate the issue but they did see I needed my tires balanced, I let them balance my tires and when I left I was having the same issues. I brought my car back and then they said the tires were  separating on the inside, so I paid 367 for four brand new tires. Replacing the tires only helped the car drive smoother but the problem was now worse! So I brought my car back today and now there saying that the back tires are the cause of the front tires shifting and that wasn't something they could fix, I would have to take it to the dealership. The guy said he could try to align the front to see if that would help but it made the issue even worse then when I had initially brought the car in. I am now sitting here after closing hours so they can set my alignment back to were it was. I just feel like if they were unable to repair the car in the first place then they should've said so instead of me coming out of 446 dollars for no reason. I asked if I could a refund for the alignment and the guy said that he wouldn't be able to refund me, would have to wait until next call and ask for a refund or he could credited as two free oil changes which is not acceptable for my inconvenience", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889293c0a719e971:0x35d4a5b6c0bf8d4a"}

We actually called this morning to confirm your appointment for next week and you told the customer service representative that we would have to complete your repair within 1 week or you would go somewhere else.  We explained that we cannot commit to that due to the size and complexity of the repair and the fact that dealing with your insurer (name withheld) results in a 100% guarantee that additional damage would be found as they write their estimates without a disassembly to identify all hidden damage.  They typically take 3-4 days to complete a supplement.  I truly apologize that we were unable to meet your expectations, however, we would rather you and all customers know up front that a repair cannot be performed within those expectations when we know that it cannot be done that rapidly.

I was told to come back that Saturday; May 2nd so that a mechanic can look at it. I went that Saturday and had the lights repaired. That same Saturday night my entire driver side taillight went out. I knew they were closed Sunday but I called just in case I could leave a voicemail to give them a heads up about me coming in on Monday; May 4th regarding the taillight. May 4th they tried to repair the issue however ALL of my lights started malfunctioning. They tell me to come back that Wednesday; May 6th so that their mechanic can look at it. They gave me a work order stating that they are working on diagnosing the problem in case I got pulled over for no brake lights, reverse lights, headlights or turn signal. They proceeded to pull my vehicle through the shop and when I got inside it I noticed an airbag sensor that was not there before. I asked John if he could have it cleared out and he said that he would have the mechanic do it on Wednesday and that it should be no problem. I then attempted to turn my AC on (which was on while they were working on it but John said that he had turned it off) but the AC wouldn't come on. I get out of my vehicle and ask John if he could have the code cleared because I felt that it was messing with the operation of my AC and it's been 90\u00b0 lately. John then tells another employee named Skyler to come clear the code however the code does not clear. During this time the owner comes and introduces himself and asked me and another customer if we were being tended to, the other customer stated that he was already tended to then I stated that I was being tended to and pointed to my vehicle. The owner then leaves to never return again. They then proceeded to turn the vehicle off in hopes of resetting it however at that point the vehicle would no longer start. John then told me that I needed to leave and that I could return Wednesday to have their mechanic look at it but at this point, I had no dash lights, interior lights, exterior lights, no AC, no radio, no power steering, and sensors going off. The vehicle would no longer start up. I started to get upset, John claims I brought my vehicle in like that which is 100% untrue, I drove it in with no issues other than the driver taillight but I was unable to drive it away. I defended myself and vehicle over that statement then John pulled their doors closed while several employees including a manager/ assistant manager watched. I ended up having to call the police (because I had no clue what else I could or should do). The shop then claimed that I had a bad battery and that was the result of all of this however when they put a brand new battery in there it did NOT fix all the problems, the vehicle did start up and it did have headlights but that was it. After me refusing to tow my vehicle away and almost 2 hours later Mitch (I believe the manager or assistant manager) then offered to let the vehicle stay and have their mechanic look at it on Wednesday May 6th. May 6th, I went to go pick up my vehicle and John was working the front desk, they tried to hand me my keys in the lot hoping I would just leave immediately but when I asked for a full detail work order on what all had been done to my vehicle, I received attitude and was told that I should be happy that they fixed it for free and that they don't document all the work that's done on vehicles. I sat up there until I received a work order (over 30mins later) but when I received the \"work order\" it stated, \"gave customer a battery and replaced 10 fuse\". I told the mechanic that that was not a detailed work order but I was told that was all I was going to get. I do not believe that they would have fixed the damages their employee, John, caused to my vehicle if I did not have 4years of documentation from the one and only other mechanic I've been to, video footage from my own vehicle and computer readings from my Vivint smart security proving the condition of my vehicle.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888e9b414671032d:0x29e4a24dd6f16484"}

They miss diagnosed it and I paid over $500.00 for repair. I had my truck 2 days before it started doing the same thing again. I called to let them know and got the vehicle back over to them. They had my truck a little over a week and claim it was not doing anything for them and that it was old codes showing up. Well since I have had my vehicle back it once again started doing the same thing showing up the same codes. I decided to take it to another dealership and to my surprise the codes that they told me was old was not old they just cleared them instead of fixing my truck. I'm very upset because they repeatedly lied to me over and over. I will not recommend the service dept at all. They just played around with my truck and I called to let Myla know that it was doing the same thing again and that I took it to another dealership and they showed me how codes had been cleared and showed me the history codes.

She even followed up with me the next business day they were open after my purchase to see if I was still enjoying my Challenger.

I told him they could stop and I'll bring in the light myself after buying it cheaper elsewhere. He tells me I will still have to pay $135 for the diagnostic. No problem. He comes back and tells me it's already in. I ask well where is my car? He says they're finishing up. 45 minutes later he comes back and tells me that they put a new light in and it didnt work.

Things didn't go quite as we had planned. Our SUV was cutting out pretty bad on the highway. It was getting worse the closer we got to Mobile. I contacted my friend who's daughter lives in Mobile to see if she might know of a service place. I talked with her daughter and she informed me that her husband, Kyle, worked for Joe Bullard Cadillac. She gave me the number for the service department and said to speak with Haley.  About this time the check engine light came on in our vehicle. It was flashing on and off, then would stay lit.\nWhen I spoke with Haley in the service department she asked about the service engine light. When I told her it had been flashing intermittently she was immediately concerned and said we should get stopped as quickly as we could to avoid internal engine damage.  She then helped us get started with finding a tow service. We were 50 miles aWay and had four people so their usual towing service couldn't do it, but she got the ball rolling for us. She gave me her direct phone number so I could call if I needed anything.\nOnce we got to the dealership Kyle helped us get a loaner car while ours was being repaired. Haley kept us informed as they learned what was wrong. Our technician, Mike, came in on Saturday to work on our vehicle because we needed to leave to head back to Missouri on Sunday.\nTo make a long story short...God used all of these people to help us during a difficult time. They made this experience so much less stressful than it could've been. THEY WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND TO HELP US! And, they did it all with a smile.

What I didn't like was that the mechanics were excessively rough with my vehicle. I had to have it towed and the towing company left it at the gate. Christian got me a loaner car, which I appreciated very much. When I picked up the loaner there were 2 guys who were trying to get it started to get it up to the shop. I needed to grab a couple things out of my car so I stopped to do that. For some reason they needed to open the back hatch. I was traveling with my animals so I had a large kennel in the back. I watched them put my seats down (rather roughly) and sling my kennel from the back to atop the back seats. It made me cringe but at this point I needed to get going as I had some stops to make and  I thought surely they knew what they were doing, this is a Cadillac dealership afterall and these cars cost a lot. They will surely be careful... When I got my car back, instead of them putting the vehicle back they way they found it, the kennel was still strown across the back. (As a plus though, it was washed! Which I appreciated since I had been on the road and try to take care of my car!) When I went to move the kennel back in place I noticed that there are scrapes across the plastic sides in the back. Greeeeaaaaaat. But, at that point I was leaving to head back to my home state and couldn't worry about it. It was more important to get home safe. They told me in addition to the battery that I needed new air filters, a rear wiper blade, and the throttle body cleaned, all easy enough for me to do myself. So, now I am here doing said maintenance and when I popped the hood I immediately noticed that my positive battery terminal clip has been broken and won't stay shut. Great. I am now back home, 3 states away. I will be back to the area, and am considering moving my family there but if they don't make this right I will find a different dealership to maintenance at.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1517174513045, "text": "Hi Jami,\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave your review and detailed feedback.

It has been solely serviced and maintained by McConnel/Bullard.  It has less than 30,000 miles on the odometer.  It's been the worst car we've owned since our marriage in 1962.  The problem today was a broken window regulator on the rear driver's side.  My wife has been the sole driver of this car.  We have no children in then home.  My conservative guess is that this window has been lowered and raised no more than 10 times in its aborted lifetime.  My wife was told a plastic roller had broken.  A plastic roller in a $50,000 (2004) Cadillac?!  My bill:  $517.23!  I can go back through my invoices and find similar instances of shoddy work and padded bills.  During the second year we owned the car the driver side dash assembly fell off the dash while my wife was driving.  At around the 4-5 year of ownership your service supervisor convinced my wife that she needed to replace all four tires (around 10,000 miles) because they had \"dry-rotted.\" ($800)  I've owned two Cadillac De Ville's prior to this, and have never experienced what has to be either poor construction, low-quality parts, or untruthful service managers.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4da8e0caaef5:0xa8eb3c2a1737d68b"}

We saw one on the interstate and decided to go look at them. When we got there it was freezing and windy and Darren Robinson was in the parking lot moving cars. He offered his help and we told him we were in town to Christmas shop not spend all day at a dealership, we just wanted to try the car on for size. he escorted us inside for coffee and cocoa and went to get the car. we test drove it. we loved it but we were not there to spend all day at the dealership. we left our personal information to be reviewed and were going to shop when Darren notified us that we would be using the cadillac for the day via loaner form approval. we really enjoyed using the car. we Christmas shopped all day and when we returned to the dealership we had been approved for the car with our payments within dollars of request. Jon McCartney had to have been the most professional financial manager i have ever encountered. He was a real person who made us feel right at home and comfortable to speak openly. very friendly and personable. then Roosevelt Harris enters the picture. a gem. a diamond in the rough. so charismatic so joyful and helpful and accomodating. I cannot put into words how much Darren helped to familiarize us with the cue and features. he was so knowledgable of the cars systems. he was an absolute treasure. I cant say but one thing about Joe Bullards team, \"you are doing something right\". I got hugs from everyone when i left. i felt like i was part of a family there. I even got a text message from Darren on Christmas morning wishing us a merry Christmas. i literally spent 2 hrs tops at the dealership and received the most beautiful CHristmas gift I could have ever dreamed of. but the most inportant thing was the environment and kindness that we experienced while there. oh and my son loved the lounge with computers and coffee/cocoa which made his time there enjoyable also. we will definitely reccomend Joe Bullard Cadillac to friends and family and we will definitely be repeat customers ourselves. my only hope is that we have the privilege of having the same staff in years to come.

The office attendant (Mike, I think was his name), was straight-forward, respectful, patient, gave me a phone quote, had the work done timely, with the final bill ending up being a little less than the original quote, even after adding the tow bill & taxes. It was a very welcomed change from the experience I'd had at another local shop I'd been referred to (but later warned about from several other past customers) where I repeatedly had to endure rudeness from the know-it-all mechanic, immediate breakdowns from same issue I'd just paid to have repaired, & ignored voicemails asking to speak to the owner. Guthrie's owner followed-up the very next day to make sure everything was going well with the work on my car. I would much rather pay for a job well done the first time than a little less and keep breaking down, having my car towed, finding another way to work at the last minute to keep my job, and then constantly being talked down to in person & over the phone (while the owner justifies it as him \"being from New York\",... to which I reminded them both that he's now n ALABAMA, & that cocky attitude won't do here, especially with me!!... 3 different types of repairs... never fixed after being told they were!).

We found one online, previously, and wanted to drive one before we drove all that way to Birmingham to see it. They made us a proposal, \"If we  can cut you a deal on a new one, can we have your business?\" Well, of course if the price is right then, yes. We drive a grey CX-5, everything is great, but they are calling this car \"new\" and it has 7500 miles on it. Well, it's never been owned they say its a \"demo\" car. Then my husband tells them he wants to be at $19,999 financed for this car (yes, we were putting several thousand down - we didn't expect a miracle deal). They only get it down to $20,010. Then he says, well if you throw in remote start, we will take it. They came back with each of us paying half so, we decided to buy the car.\n\nThey told us that they could get us a killer interest rate of less than one percent. When we got back to financing, it was another story entirely. We ended up wit ha 4.99 interest rate because \"less than one percent is only for \"new\" cars\" well when you were trying to negotiate this deal you said it was a new car and now that we are financing you've classified it as a \"used\" car.\n\nAfter we left, we began driving to my dad's house which is probably 100 miles away. The check engine light came on before we got there. We had O'Reily's check the computer and they said it was low oil pressure. We called and they has us call the Mazda tow truck to come pick it up and take it to the nearest Mazda which was in Birmingham. (They told me to get a rental during this time and they would pay me back.) They called for me to come pick it up three or four days later saying it was a computer problem and it was fixed. When we got there, 4 error messages were popping up on the dash. We left the car and called the sales manager at Julio Jones Mazda who never called us back and said he never got our message.\n\nI went in to talk to the Julio Jones Mazda sales manager about this problem on Monday. They had me sit there for a while and eventually said they spoke with the technician at the Birmingham Mazda and they said I must have taken my foot off the brake too early and it caused the car to throw up those error messages. So, they blamed me for the problem.\n\nLater, the technician from Birmingham called us personally and said they had screwed up and not fixed it properly to begin with. So, the sales manager at Julio Jones Mazda was either misinformed or blatantly lied to make me think it was my fault.\n\nWell, we finally got the car back and it has been running fine. No more issues. However, they still haven't paid me back for the rental and it's been almost a month. I called about this and they said they lost my receipt and asked me for the amount again. I still haven't been paid and they haven't bothered to call me back. That was a week ago.\n\nSimultaneously, I took the car in to the Julio Jones service center to get the remote start put in on a Thursday. They told me it would take a day, maybe two, to get this done. The service center is telling me that I owe our half of the remote start that was supposed to be included in the deal. Obviously, they didn't include it in the price like they said they would. Also, they had to give me a rental car because they couldn't get the remote start to work. It's now Monday and I have no clue when I am going to get my car back. I called today and they said they still couldn't get the remote start to work.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't wish this headache on anyone and I wouldn't recommend this dealership to anyone.

I brought it in promptly Monday as advised after I dropped it off a guy named Lee explained to me what they were going to check out and give me a call. 3 days passed and still no call so I stopped by and I was asked by a mechanic what do you want and why was I there if I haven\u2019t received a call from them (rude as possible). I explained to him that I was concerned about my transmission and he stated that he test drove it and it has lost reverse so he has to get it up on the rack and then he will call me when they figure it out. Day 4 mike calls and ask how do you start your truck I told him I usually start it with the key. He said that he needs me to come get it started so I went up there and waited for over an hour for Mike to show up. Finally he shows up and he tells me to get it started and he doesn\u2019t know anything about motors he is a transmission specialist. Mike diagnosed the problem as a bad starter I had to wait for a mechanic to take off the starter. While I\u2019m searching for a starter Mike calls and tells me that they are leaving  for the day and they need me to lock up my truck and put the starter on so he can get it fixed. So I finally make it back with the new starter and I had to pay  a mechanic to come meet me at the truck and install it only to find out my bolts are missing. Therefore, I call Mike he doesn\u2019t answer my calls. As a result,  I had to call a tow truck company Friday morning so I wouldn\u2019t have to deal with an unprofessional transmission company.   John and his team of real mechanics from Southern Transmission diagnosed the issue when it rolled off the tow truck which was loose battery cable and truck started running immediately.

Knowing we did not have a lot of extra money to spend after the purchase, Eddie recommended that we take a look at Pull-A-Part for replacement wheels. We actually found 4 inexpensive wheels & tires, so Eddie sent a member of his staff to pull-a-part in the hottest part of the summer to remove the wheels and tires for us. After mounting the wheels, Eddie noted that one of the tires to be dry rotted, so he replaced it with a better used tire free of charge. After the wheel problem was settled, Eddie did a diagnostic evaluation and a good once over to check the car for any major defects. Upon completion, he made a list of identified problems and potential problems that could lead to costly repairs. He made sure the identified problems were taken care of immediately and gave us the potential  problem list, so we could save for these replacements.  Eddie gave us peace of mind by being honest and did not break us by hitting us with costly repairs or replacements all at once. My son drove that car another 2-3 year, before he was hit by another vehicle and the Grand Prix was totaled.\nMy daughter drives a 1998 Oldsmobile Intrigue and is a student at Auburn.

Don't believe it. Made a deal with Eddie to restore our 1974 Super Beetle from good, running condition to showroom quality. Repairs were to include engine rebuild and brakes/electrical/suspension overhaul, as well as complete interior revamp. We agreed to a ballpark price with the understanding that it could climb, and agreed that time was not an issue, since we were moving to another State anyway.\n\nEddie promised regular status updates and talked a nice game of providing pictures of every stage of the rebuild. What really happened is that we received zero updates, regular requests for money, and bad attitude. After stringing us out for several months, we were told that Eddie was no longer interested in performing the rebuild, and that the vehicle needed to be towed elsewhere within one week -- towed, because it had been torn apart, in running condition, then slapped back together such that it no longer cranks.\n\nSo, we had to find a flatbed that could haul what now amounts to scrap metal across State lines, on short notice, at our expense, with no explanation whatsoever. We're out money both ways, out a functional vehicle, and out months of time that could have been spent working on it. To top it off, the driver we found said the shop gave him nothing but grief when he got there; very unprofessional.\n\nThis is a crooked outfit.

This is not my first Hyundai since reinventing itself and blowing our minds. Needless to say I purchased what is now my 5th Hyundai.  However, i'm here to brag on the man who walked my husband and I through this entire process in this humid Alabama weather.  Initially, I came in to take advantage of the $50 GIFT CARD that Hyundai was offering for simply test driving its vehicles, but I also knew that I would potentially be driving off the lot with something new as well. Brandon Blagg was awesome from the gate. He stood and walked over to me, invited me to his desk, and inquired concerning my business. A few questions later, a copy of my license, and \"BAM\" we were test driving a base model Santa Fe.' One would think that this guy designed these vehicle with his level of knowledge concerning them. Recalling that I have own several vehicles in my lifetime, it is feasible to understand that we have dealt with our share of sales consultants. This is by far the first person who not only informed us of what we would potentially enjoy about the vehicle, but patiently explained in detail its benefits, and demonstrated  to us its functionality. He took a base model vehicle and literally painted a picture that lifted it beyond it's level. He hung out with us for over an hour doing comparisons and contrasts. He was honest concerning pro and cons, but never negative.. not one time. For him every vehicle had its benefits, and for every person there was vehicle that fit them. THIS IS WHAT HE DID! He didn't interfere with our choice, but he made sure that we would be satisfied once we left  the lot for good. In the end we ended up purchasing a Santa Fe' SEL 2.4 engine with both the Convenience and Premium Package. He didn't use a hustler tactic to cause us to go for a higher grade, it was simply his transparency and patience that ultimately led to our selection. Recalling that this was in 90 + degree weather, this man didn't stop until the tires shined.  He made me laugh, shared stories, explained who was whom of the CEO vs. COO, and also wasn't shy around me whatsoever. He even blew bubble gum bubbles for our delightful 6 year old who stood amazed at the excellence his gum blowing abilities. Brandon Blagg, job well done. You deserve all that's coming for your hard work and dedication to service. Aside from our direct experience with Brandon, everyone rocked. Their pleasantness was superb, two of the women conversed with me, they offered treats to my babies, and others smiled and waved. There wasn't a rude attitude in the building. The lobby and bathrooms are well designed and clean. As lengthly a process that car buying could be, they have enough going for themselves to make you relax and enjoy your time.\n\nThanks Again, Tae A.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b128e81df3f:0x8980930b2c0cfffb"}

I test drove the vehicle on a Monday and pointed out a few cosmetic issues that I feel should have been addressed prior to placing the car up for sale (only a few hundred dollars to correct).  That combined with the manager coming outside to talk to me smoking a cigarette, should have clued me in to the professionalism and pride taken at the dealership.\nI was asked that if the problems I pointed out were corrected,  would I purchase the car? I agreed.  The following day I recieved the bill of sale and I noticed that the price shown on the internet was not the price shown on the bill of sale. When I asked the manager, the explanation I recieved was that the car was headed to auction the day I saw it and the price on the internet was the auction price, not the sale price (what does that have to do with me? And the price I came intending to pay is the price that I saw advertised ).  I was then told that they would sell it to me at the internet price but I would have to pay for the repairs which would be $400+.  Since the price was still under book value,  I agreed.  I was then told that the car would be repaired, HAND WAXED and ready for me in a couple days.  I was informed Friday that the car was ready. I drove up Saturday only to find the car just as dirty as it was when I test drove it on Monday(they sprayed the dirt off but there was still hair and dirt on the inside of the car.... wheel wells were dirty, etc). Of all the cars I've bought,  no one has ever tried to delivered me a dirty car! I discussed this with the manager who appeared to care nothing about it.  I left with no intention of buying the car,  but the salesman,\nMr. Willie, called and said that he would take care of it...... he took it to a local shop and had it washed and vacuumed.  As a customer, when money is spent, whether it be $30 or $30,000, you want to feel good about spending it. That's not the feeling I left with.  In the end, I purchased what I feel is a great vehicle.   But the service is what will definitely keep me from being a repeat customer or recommending to anyone else.

This was the worst car buying experience ever. My original salesman was nice but knew nothing about a car at all. My battery had a dead cell when I first purchased it. I took it back for the battery to be replace and it took four hours to get a new battery. I asked them to take me to the service center to find out what was taking so long and the guy that work in the front said my battery has been there for two hours. And the guys that were supposed to be working were playing and joking around the next time I needed work done was three days later I noticed the bumper on the car was popped out of place, the 12 volt adapters didn't work, the service light had come on, the key tumbler was messed up in the ignition. I went to try and get that fixed and they told me it would be two days well I asked if they would give me a replacement car to get back and forth to work they told me no they don't do that. Ok so I paid for the work myself. A few days later I discovered my account was overdrawn 500 dollars and when I ask the finance manager why my account was charged and I paid 1000  in cash his response was well we wanted 1500 for the car and u couldn't do that. So they took it upon themselves to take the other 500 dollars. Now after they agreed to give my money back.  I waited a week and called and he said I could pick it up across the street so I went across the street from them and the guy over there didn't know what I was talking about so he called Cleveland Moore the guy I've been having problems with to asked him where I needed to go Cleveland didn't know that he was on speaker phone and said \" she so damn stupid\" he really called me stupid and then when I informed him he was on speaker phone he said so. Meaning he didn't care. So I feel disrespected and I was so upset I called a manager who said it will be handled and I will be waiting to find out the results of this because if they are not satisfactory I would like to speak with the owner myself.

Further more 5 days later, it's still listed on the internet as available. So NOW I'm positive it's to lure customers in. If someone is awaiting approval for financing on this vehicle, the very least Jim Burke Hyundai should do is post a flag on the car saying; \"Sold Pending Approval of Financing\". In my opinion, that would be \" Professional Business Protocol\".\n\nI'm of the opinion that they might possibly do this to get customers to come in when it looks like a certified car is lower priced then average.\n\nI believe they tried to do a \"bait & switch\" maneuver on me by showing me a same priced vehicle that was the same color but a different make and model.\n\nThe sales mgr. also told me he would find me a Pre-certified car in the same price range that same day, however he never followed through or even had the professionalism to call me back one way or the other. I called him later that afternoon, I didn't want the other car I looked at, at another dealership to get sold, & asked if he could call me back by 6pm  to tell me if he had found another car so I could make a decision. He never called.\n\nBottom line... before you make the trip to see a specific car, make absolutely sure it's still for sale.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b128e81df3f:0x8980930b2c0cfffb"}

And if you do, please, make sure you ask them to print and show you any TSB's (Technical Service Bulletin) on the vehicle you are considering. A TSB is not like a safety recall and therefore the dealership is not required to make the repair. Make them prove to you that they have repaired all of the items on each and every TSB. However, I can almost promise you that they will not make the repairs before selling you the vehicle. I purchased a used 2007 Hyundai Entourage van from Jim Burke Hyundai's used car dealership in March this year after having purchased a new Elantra from them last year. I did not make them show me the TSB's because I wasn't aware of them at the time. Unfortunately there are several of them on the van I purchased. One of them had to do with a part that causes called the \"Junction Box Switch\" or Instrument Panel Module that causes the battery to discharge. That means when you go out to your car it simply won't start!! I found the TSB on it and it says in large print that it was issued to all Hyundai General Managers and that the repair should be made before retail sale of the van. Many of us believe that purchasing a used car from what you think is a reputable dealership will protect you from these type issues. Well...this dealership is not reputable and should be put out of business. I have contacted them to give them a change to try and make this right to keep customers happy and try to get return business but they obviously are not intersted in this.

The vehicle in question was brought in because the ignition switch was defective. Due to the connector going to the anti-theft module was not making connection. After I spent 30 minutes on the phone with the chevy dealer I found the connector was not available. I instructed your daughter to go and get a complete unit with a new pig tail. After explaining to them that a code reading would bring no results to identify the issue. I did allow the vehicle to sit in my parking lot until the problem could be addressed. Most places charge several hundred dollars to do this. Several days later they brought in a switch from a junk yard that was ripped out and badly damaged. I told them they could not use part due to being damaged. After a couple days a night time worker offered to help with diagnostics, he brought his scan tool and tried to diagnosis the issue. Found the anti-theft module was not making any connection with the vehicles pcm. He spent over an hour trying to help your daughter for free. He normally charges $70 an hour for this. We have gone out of our way to help your daughter every way we could. Including letting the vehicle sit for over a week. No way did your stand out in the cold while we laughed at her.

All in all, this wasn't a huge deal, but I was disappointed in CBA.\n\nFast forward 2 years, and i take another one of my vehicles that I had just purchased to CBA for a post-purchase full diagnosis (This alone cost $120) which they assured me would cover just about everything i needed to get done to the vehicle to get it to top shape. They quoted me over $5,000 worth of service. This alone wasn't completely insane. It was an older vehicle, and yes, a good few things needed fixing. However, I jotted down the items they told me I needed to replace and decided to do the items myself (brake change, coolant flush, oil change, filters, etc). Took off the brakes. The Pads, Rotors were literally brand new. They said my front caliper mount and caliper itself were in terrible condition. Completely false--it was in perfect condition upon further inspection. Performed the coolant change after they claimed it was dirty and needed changing (btw they quoted me $140 for the coolant change, which if you know, is one of the easiest things you can do yourself for $20 worth of coolant and 30 min of your time max). This also turned out to be unecessary. The coolant I drained was the exact same color as the new coolant I purchased myself. I did this for every item on the list of things they told me I needed to change, and the ONLY thing that actually needed to be changed was the front driver struts and the radiator fan.\n\nA week after I get the $5000 list of things that need to be serviced, I drive to Atlanta. Halfway there on the interstate, my timing/fan belt shred apart, engine overheats, and my car is disabled. Tow it to a garage nearby and they inform me that my water pump was well on its way out, A/C compressor had imploded, and timing/fan belts should have been changed a long time ago. NONE OF THESE WERE MENTIONED BY CBA. Fortunately I did not get into an accident, but I trusted CBA to diagnose what I needed to fix on my vehicle, and they failed to mention, at all, three incredibly easy to inspect components that were failing, and caused my vehicle to stop driving in the middle of the highway. Absolutely unacceptable.\n\nIf you're reading this, CBA, come on, step your game up. If you're going to charge one of the highest rates in the entire state of Alabama, maybe provide service that backs up that rate. I respect you all as individuals, but  as a \"reputable automotive service center\", I am appalled.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1596806181463, "text": "We take your detailed feedback seriously, as our customers' safety and satisfaction are very important to us.

Shortly thereafter, I took the car in for an oil change and tire rotation. When they called me back they suggested that my belts were worn and needed replacement. I no longer trust these mechanics and will be getting work done elsewhere from now on.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1472822132897, "text": "Jonathan, the complete satisfaction of our customers is very important to us, so it saddens us to read you feel this way.

CBA was the only other shop I called, as soon as Danny answered my call he said he knew he had to help me, not to worry, they would do everything they could to get me through this. He did. He helped me get it towed from Prattville to their shop in Montgomery. Kept me updated every step of the way and constantly reassured me that they were there to help. My car, unfortunately, had some very major issues and even at CBA prices still was out of my price range. But, I didn't leave without transportation. Danny went above and beyond to help me find a suitable vehicle that I could afford and I left yesterday the owner of a reliable, running vehicle. The people of CBA are some of the kindest people I have had the blessing of meeting. They are truly doing works that reflect the epitome of Christians.

They are just using \"Christian Brothers\" for marketing purposes, not to show a genuine Christian nature. I went in for an alternator swap. I knew it was the alternator and told them as much; didn't stop them from charging me $48 to \"diagnose\" the problem. That was for an half hour of labor which if you want to count the time it took for them to tell me the price, was not a half hour after I brought it in. So yes, their hourly labor rate is $96 which strikes me as a little high, and yes, they don\u2019t mind rounding up to the detriment of the customer. The rest of the bill was just as offensive and out of tune with normal auto repair prices. A re-manufactured alternator for my car was $117 at the time, they charged $244.20 and kept the core fee for themselves. No, they didn't put a new one in, just a re-man. They then charged me $39.78 for a serpentine belt, which I don't mind that they replaced, but a new one at any auto parts store runs around $20. So paying twice for parts is pretty painful, but then they add on a fee for \"shop supplies\"; I'm not sure what for, wear and tear on the tools? A paper towel or two? Whatever they were, they cost me $37.10. You'd think that \"shop supplies\" would be included when you pay premium for the parts and labor. On top of all of that, they padded the hours they were replacing the alternator. They charged me for 1.5 hours ($144.09) but the guy was only working on it for 45 minutes tops. The rest of the time that it was in their garage it just sat there. That's right, a car in Christian Brothers Automotive's garage is accruing labor costs even if it just sits there, hate to see what the overnight tab would be. Just think of the \u201cshop supplies\u201d that leaked into a car that sat there overnight.\n\nThey have three salesman upfront and only two technicians when I was there. This shows their focus: extract every possible penny from a potential customer, especially if he is from out of town. Why pay extra techs when you are still billing for the time that the car sits in their garage right? Another indication of their less-than-honest nature is that they put all these odd-ball prices on the parts and shop fees. Like what is with the 10 cents on shop supplies, they couldn't round that off? Well they could, but they don't want you to realize that they are just padding the bill. Ten cents looks more authentic. They also have a sign in the back that says: \"Ask every customer: Is there anything else we can check for you today?\" I'd hate to see the proposal for work you get back when you give these guys a greenlight to check out your entire car.\n\nThe technicians were good, the alternator seems to be working out fine. But the salesmen are only good at small talk. They brought my car back out of the garage and it started to smoke. They thought the engine was about to explode or something they turn it off and frantically check the oil. When I get out there they say that the oil pan is empty. Nope, check again. When they checked again they saw that it was half full like I knew it was. The smoke was from the debris that got knocked down onto the serpentine belt. Some debris that my $37.10 in shop supplies should have cleaned up. Guess not.\n\nAll-in-all, I paid $545 for a pretty simple fix, and they quoted me on the phone $250 as I was driving trying to get somewhere before my car died. I guess they knew they had me, but I hope this review saves somebody else the expense and frustration of dealing with these guys. These guys bend you over with a smile on their face. If you want this type of service and pay these type of prices, just go to the dealer, at least they are more knowledgeable about your car.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2db31cb0a5bf:0x2c43880b4b10967d"}

Purchased a used vehicle from this dealership in May of 2020. I was sold when I was told that my vehicle had an Auto Nation warranty of \"90 days or 4,000 miles.\" Sounds great doesn't it? Well after being hurried along in signing paperwork so the vehicle could be mine I was very happy with my purchase. However, less than a month later, and still well within my \"warranty\" coverage period I got a Christmas tree of lights on my dashboard. I was told to take it to its dealership and from there I could then make the claim. When I called to make the claim, Auto Nation's warranty service said there was no vehicle with my VIN in the system. I then called the manager there who told me, \"I never signed any contract stating I had a warranty and it doesn't matter what I was told because it isn't in writing.\" I realized the manager was right about this however, I was being told one thing then they intentionally rushed me through signing paperwork so that I wouldn't catch that I never signed anything for my \"warranty\". The deceptive methods of these people shows that they are talented at one thing and, one thing only and, that is lying to people. These people are clearly slimy and cannot be trusted, save yourself the hassle and do not purchase a vehicle from here. Learn from my mistake, don't come here.

When we got there we looked over the truck thoroughly and then took it for a test drive, when we got back, my husband looked over the underneath of the truck to see if there were any oil or other leaks.  He found oil dripping at the rear seal, so he pointed that out to Jerrica and she called out the \u201cGM\u201d Eric to come talk to us.\nEric explained that he himself purchased the truck and would like to \u201cjust get rid of it\u201d   so he started to talk price.  He went from $15,000 to $12,500.  My husband also told him the ride was really rough and it felt like the truck had a heavy load on it when it was empty, saying it could be from sitting for a long period of time, but he wasn\u2019t sure.  Eric then said to have the oil leak look at it would be somewhere around $1500-2000 he will drop the price to $11, 800 and they will do the repairs.\nWe told him we would think about it and Eric said the price was good until closing the next day which was Saturday 06/20/2020.\nWe decided to call Jerica and told her we would take truck without the repairs being done for $10, 300 and we would pick up the truck tomorrow Saturday 06/20/2020.  Jerrica said they have accepted our counter offer.  We then get a text that we need to hold off until Monday 06/22/2020 to get final approval and they will have the truck delivered to our house once they have to final okay.\nNo final okay, WE FINALLY GOT A HOLD OF Eric the GM who told us he was also \u00bd owner of Serra Chevrolet.  He told us their policy was NOT to sell a vehicle in need of repair, so the truck had to go get the rear seal leak repaired and as soon as it was finished they would deliver the truck to our home, he told my husband he was not trying to pull a fast one but that was the policy and he was not going to renege on his agreement for the $10,300 and they would get back to us asap.\nJerrica called after a week or so and told us that the truck had significant repairs and they were pulling off the market and it was no longer for sale, to anyone.  I had a friend inquired about the truck and was told it is being serviced.  No word from anyone at all.\nFast forward to 07/24/2020 my friend Erica gets a text from Serra Chevy asking if they are still interested in the 2003 Ford F-350?  She answers yes, how much?  Text told her $13, 825.  So my friend asked if the repairs she was told about last month were done and they told her yes, the truck is fixed and ready to go, Drove 2+ hours to go see this truck again. We walked up to the truck and my husband climbs underneath to look at what they did to repair the truck.  He saw NO SIGNS of anyone touching the housing bolts or any difference what\u2019s so ever from the last time he looked at the truck.  Sale agent comes out we say we are interested can we take for test drive and off my husband goes with the sales girl.\nWhen they get back my husband looks under the truck and low and behold\u2026the leak is still there!!  My husband had asked about the rear seal being repaired and the sales agent said it was repaired, my husband showed her the leak and she just said would you like to make an offer?  We went in, she started filling out the paperwork and asked what we think a fair price would be so my husband said we talked to Eric the GM and since the leak isn\u2019t fixed we want to give the price we both agreed to $10,300.  The agent said she would be right back and went to the other end of the building to a man sitting at a desk,  We sat a while,  agent came back she said last night a man said he wanted to pay full asking price and had a cashier\u2019s check.  \u201cWhat the hell is going on here\u201d?\nMy friend Erica sends a text same day after we were told was sold and tells the agent is it okay to come Monday at 5:30 SHE WAS TOLD ABSOLUTELY!!  The agent said the truck was still available!  Erica says  I am not wasting a 2 hour drive, the trucks rear seal is fixed \u201d  The agent said YES, the rear seal was repaired.

I usually get depressed when my car gets sick because RARELY do I walk away without spending a grand. But this visit was very pleasant. The customer service man asked me what was wrong with my vehicle, then asked me for the key. He went out and took my car for a test drive, then onto the rack. I waited in the lobby waiting area for a very brief time and then he came back. He told me I had a couple of options. Option one included replacing brake rotors and option two, pads only. I took the less expensive option two because money was tight. My total bill was HALF of what I assumed it would be. At JacMac, the difference is simple. They don't seem to want to drain your checking account like other places around Tuscaloosa who want to bill you no less than 1000 dollars every time you walk in the door. And I really like that he OFFERED me the different options. Most places dont do that.

We almost made the deal twice. After making our down payment and payment requirements very clear, the sales persons involved went to get approval. When they returned, the vehicle had been discounted, but they added a \"fee.\" That's the only thing he would say, \"a fee.\" They were trying to deliberately be vauge and, in our opinion, dishonest. After discussing their \"fee,\" we never actually achieved full disclosure. We were told the vehicle was at a different dealership within our city and we could go there to finalize the deal. They said that they would call ahead and we should just go over there. Our credit had already been run multiple times, and we had received approval from the credit company. With this in mind, we went to the other dealership location. As we arrived at the other location, they hadn't been given all the details as we had been led to believe. So the process began again, running in circles of double talk and running our credit again... We left at closing time and expected a phone call the next day to complete the deal... That has yet to happen days later. I used to have great respect for Greenway Automotive. It appears that Greenway has only taken over these dealerships at face value, and the same crooks that were already in place are still running things just like they always have. Avoid Greenway Honda in Florence, AL, and Greenway Chevy in Muscle Shoals, AL, if you are planning to make a deal on a used car.

My tires are supposed to hold 35 pounds of pressure, so needless to say I had to do some air pressure adjustments.

Our service technician discovered a large leak in your radiator, which you agreed to have replaced. When you let us know that your vehicle had overheated again, we discussed with you the possibility of a damaged head gasket that was causing the overheating. We believe that this is the cause of the problem and suggested adding water to prevent it from overheating while you are needing to move the vehicle. We would be happy to take a look for you, as we believe this is the cause of the overheating issue. Please let us know if we can help you with this repair.

In addition, the break work was incomplete.  I had to after waiting over 5 hours immediately return to them for noises in the breaks.  But back to the accident, the police took statements from the witnesses.  The report states it was Precision Tune and Auto care at fault.  The employee even stated he was sorry and didnt see the other driver.  They were intially so appologetic. When I tried to contact Precision about repairs the manager Chris said he was waiting on the police report.  I kindly had my insurance make a copy for him and delivered it to him.  I call week later again asking what will happen or if someone will contact me.  He gives a different story getting short with me and saying they arent responsible for anything.  I asked if his company's insurance co will call me he got short with me.  I have complained to corporate but since this is an independent franchise their hands are tied so they say.  They charged me 584 for work performed and my car still has issues and damage to the body because of the employee's negligence and nobody is willing to fix the issue.

We work very hard to provide each customer with honest, affordable and professional auto maintenance solutions. We towed your 2000 Jeep Cherokee to our shop after you could not get it started at a local gas station. After running a few diagnostic tests we concluded the starter was bad and you agreed to have it replaced. Once that was done we continued with our testing and also recommended replacing the ignition switch, which you also agreed to have replaced. When asked if we could put the old starter back into the vehicle, we recommended not doing this, since our comprehensive testing showed the old starter was bad. Autozone ran a test on the old starter as well and came to the same conclusion; the old starter was bad and should not be reinstalled.

Of course there's more to the story but enough has been said to bring the customers awareness up..for it is my duty & obligation to expose such when at the customers expenses.\nIt speaks volumes when you bring things to their attention yet they fail to acknowledge you or allow an explanation....so I chose to terminate my employment and since then...I've been trying to contact those in charge so that I may retrieve my other toolbox at the Pelham location but have yet been able to. Goes to show the level of care when they lose a highly trained technician because the so called service manager has no real knowledge of automobiles but is allowed to make decisions above his experience...but I'm being hindered in accessing all my tools since i can't the owners to meet me there to get my belongings. The Pelham store momentarily closed due to lack of business but yet they don't see as to why when it's self evident.\nPlease take your business elsewhere...even if it's to one like Hellen Keller...you'd have a better chance of getting professional lasting repairs.\n\nAttention to management: I need my tools from the Pelham location and have notified Chris and txt Rick only to receive absolutely no reply.

I took my car to Kia because my air wasn\u2019t working they kept my car for a day and a half. I got my car back the air was working fine. I didn\u2019t pay anything. About a week later I went back in for my follow up appointment because I was informed to bring the car back so they could check my Freon levels. I took the car back and the rep that car up to me informed me it would be 139.00 for a diagnostic reading. I got upset because if you charge to do a diagnostic reading why wasn\u2019t that service performed the first time. I ended up getting a phone call back from a guy named Jaizon, that apologized about my previous encounter with the pricing and he informed me I wasn\u2019t supposed to pay anything for the diagnostic fee.  I took my car back to the dealership and left it. A few hours later I get a phone call from a totally difference representative that tells me I\u2019m going to have to pay 280 dollars for them to figure out what\u2019s wrong with my car. I informed them to have my car ready for me to pick it up then five minutes later the same rep called me back and stated they would knock 100 dollars off of the 280 to make it 170 for the diagnostic fee. I\u2019ve gotten literally four prices for simply finding out what\u2019s wrong with my car. I\u2019ve wasted my time, and gas by making trips up there that was a complete waste of time! I\u2019ve gotten more lies and inaccuracy from this company than any other company in Huntsville thus far. And I\u2019ve only been in Huntsville about 2 years.

I have always gone to Discount Tires ...up until now.  I have never met a bunch of guys with better customer service than these guys.

Each and every one of them genuinely cared about our situation and never stopped trying to help us figure it out and get us back on the road. These guys went out of there way and took care of us and got what we needed done.  If I even lived in a 50 mile radius of this store and these guys they would have my business all day long.

Tyler told me that it would take an hour and a half to get the tire there, but that once they had it, it could be put on very quickly.\n\nTyler had the delivery of the tire expedited for us, because we mentioned that we had to get up north by a set time.

Here is what happened.  Called got a verbal quote of $139-189 per axle for a brake job with rotor's turned which is fair they are just below the dealer which was $200 per axle.  Went the next day to have services done to my car.  Before they began work they inspected it and determine I needed pads all the way and rotor's on the rear and a brake fluid exchange.  Estimate price was over $700.  I declined the brake fluid exchange and they offered some \"competitive\" discounts brought my total down to about $580.  Still more than it should be.  Asked for a printed estimate when I saw the estimate I knew something was up.  They had part numbers and prices on the estimate.  Quick Google search confirmed the part numbers and prices from a local part supply store that they would be getting the parts from.  They are marking up parts pricing 100+%.  Industry standard is between 10-25%.  Then they told me that the estimate was nearly at cost and if he went any lower he would lose his job.  Nothing but scam and scare tactics were used with me and I didn't take the bait.  Tried to email the address on the general managers card it wouldn't ever go through.  Called the corporate office gave them the info and the pictures I have attached here and they said a regional manager would get back with me still have not heard from that person either.  BEWARE OF THIS PLACE AND THE CHECK ANY PRICES THEY GIVE YOU!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1526494624867, "text": "We take pride in our craft and place a great amount of emphasis on pricing ourselves competitively.

We were out of state visiting Alabama when the transmission went out on my SUV.  I didn\u2019t know my transmission was bad or about to kick the bucket.  We called around to several nearby shops but no one seemed to have time to take us in.  We were traveling with our three young kids and the situation was getting grim.  We eventually made it around to calling Bodiford\u2019s Automotive Service.  Frank Bodiford attempted to remedy the situation while on the phone. However, all attempts to get out of first/second or go in reverse didn\u2019t work.  I tried putting an additive from AutoZone in the transmission but it was a no go (mind you I am not a car guy).  Mr. Bodiford agreed to look at the vehicle.  It took about 30 minutes to arrive because we could not go over 10-20 mph.  It was late on a Friday and he obviously had other vehicles to repair, which I know now is a testament to his service and crew.  We basically were at his mercy.\n\nMr. Bodiford immediately took in our vehicle.  His staff ensured we felt like family.  They put on a movie for the kids and made us comfortable as possible.  Although, I was sweating bullets because I figured we were about to get taken advantage of given our urgent situation.  I began searching online for transmission replacement cost, estimated repairs, solenoid issues, etc. and was shell shocked at the prices.  It became apparent we needed transmission work immediately or was not getting very far.  Mr. Bodiford soon emerged and confirmed our fears.  We were weighing our options about how to get back home, getting the vehicle serviced, paying for the diagnostics, paying Frank for the time he took to service the vehicle, etc.  It seemed a bad situation was just getting worse; I was ready to just pay up, get a rental, and be done with the situation.  Mr. Bodiford provided us with all the information needed to help get us situated.  To my surprise they were able to get the vehicle into reverse and the transmission was at least operable.  Apparently, they disengaged the transmission safe mode and used an additive the actually worked.  I stood there with credit card in hand and Mr. Bodiford declined.  He serviced the vehicle as much as he could at the last minute and we were ripe for the taking; however, he wouldn\u2019t take a penny.  I stood there in disbelief and was extremely grateful.  I was thinking about the bad publicity some mechanic shops get and here Mr. Bodiford stood just as concerned, courteous, and empathetic to our situation as if we were his family.  We departed Bodiford's Automotive and traded in the vehicle that evening.  We didn\u2019t want to press our luck with trying to drive home.  Although we took a hit on the trade-in value because of the transmission, we were just elated with Mr. Bodiford and his crew.  Hopefully I do not have any repair needs in the immediate future since I now have a newer vehicle but if so, I am taking it to Mr. Bodiford.  Enough cannot be said when you deal with good people.

I didn't know for sure exactly where or what was causing it, didn't want to spend my only free evening of the week with my wife and kid trying to figure it out, but also didn't want to leave a leak overnight so I took off work early to go get it fixed.  My vehicle needed an oil change as well anyway so I took it in and explained it was likely the filter or one of the lines that needed replaced.\n\nSure they changed my oil no problem, but the guy came around and said he wouldn't fix the leak, that it was a \"missing o-ring that they didn't carry in stock\" and I'd need to take it back to whoever put the existing filter on and have them do the repair.  Now, I replace my filters every 40,000 miles or so and I've moved a couple of times since then.  I have no idea where I was exactly when I replaced my filter last, because it's a small fix.  I got there at 4:30 pm, close of business at 6, so it wasn't like I pulled up at quitting time.  I had to take more time off work the next morning to disconnect everything myself and find it was simply a hairline crack in the filter.  The mechanic that I talked to didn't even verify anything, except what I already knew that yep there's a fuel leak there.  He just spewed some bs that he thought sounded good because he didn't feel like doing his job...

Asked them to put on something they normally stocked on these 4 vehicles, and all road out great, and in and out of the store in a timely manner. They also don't sell the gimmicky road side warranty.

The gentleman looked at my low tire for about 30 seconds and told me there was a nail and because of where it was on the tire they wouldn\u2019t be able to patch it and I needed a whole new tire. Also that the tread on all my tires was getting low so I needed a whole new set. The set he tried to sell me was almost $1,000. Luckily I had my dog in the back seat, so I had a good excuse to get out of there and tell them I\u2019d come back later. I don\u2019t know a whole lot about cars, but I know when my tire tread looks low and I\u2019ve got at least until the end of this year or the beginning of next before I\u2019ll need new tires. And as for the one with the nail, my cousin patched it and I\u2019ve driven to Birmingham and back on it with no problem at all.

Unless they were trying to add more stuff to my bill, I was not updated about the status of my car unless I called or randomly showed up. I was severely over charged. When I picked up my car, all my saved radio buttons had been changed to different stations. Coffee, a notebook and some small car part (not even sure what it was) were left in my car, none of which were mine, all of which I threw away.

I went in to get oil change and a get a quote on new master cylinder for my son's car. My son had a free oil change card that his mother gave him.  This his first oil change of his first car I bought him last year. He's had the card for over a year and it has no expiration date on it. The service tech \"manager\" said he didn't think the card was still good. Again, it had no expiration date on it. He said well it should've been signed by manager, though there's no place for it to be signed by a manager. The \"manage\" said well anyone could've just picked it up and put the date on it and brought it back.  I said I didn't do that nor did my son or his mother. I told him I didn't appreciate being accused of stealing a free oil change card. He said two other people did that yesterday. I said that is not my fault nor an excuse to accuse me of doing the same thing. He could not understand what he had done over a $34.95 oil change. He called the owner and the owner said the card fine, of course. He did not apologize for accusing me of stealing the free oil change card. He said he had to make sure it was ok or it would come out of his paycheck. Again, no reason to ever utter someone could have just picked one up and brought it in unsigned. All he had to say is he had to call his owner to see how to process the card not accuse me of possibly stealing it. With that lack of ability to understand the damage to the customer for your handling of this made me question giving someone like that the responsibility to work on the brakes on my son's car. So, I took my free oil change card from his fingertips and told the inexperienced \"manager\" that I'd take my business elsewhere. As I left he said the free oil change card was \"null and void\". He just had to be right. He would not listen to the customer who was getting ready to pay $559 for work plus and extra $36 for the full synthetic oil change. Hint empathy people. I only do business with people I like period and though I just met this guy he gave me reason not to like him in under 10 minutes. I had never been in a Meineke in my life until today and will never do so again. Thanks to this manager at the South Huntsville shop. I wonder if this is the intent of the Meineke representative who gave this card to my son's mother?", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1622217384048, "text": "Hi Tom, this should never be the impression we leave.

They were able to replace that at no cost to me. Secondly, screws were missing and clips weren't reinstalled. The manager assured me they would be replaced, and they were. Lastly the radiator was mounted improperly (very wobbly, almost hitting the engine). This was initially resolved with plastic zip ties and told by the manager that it was repaired and I was good to go. Obviously this was unacceptable at an initial service fee of $105/hr.

He said,\" yes\", and I ask for a total of my bill he states he needed to do another ticket but it would be around 150, no more. I get there and they have charged me 175.26 (WOW)! for a oil change and to look at my camera to tell me it needed to be replaced.

It's a shame as a woman you can't go by yourself to get your car taken care of without men taking advantage of you. Well you might want to think twice before going there.

It did not solve the problem, so they took everything apart and replaced my coil - saying we will not charge you for what you do not need - nor charge you for the additional labor.

They are very professional, kind, and pleasant to work with.\n\nI had a blow out, on Friday, September 7th on I-459 while driving South @ 5:45 pm. I hit SIRI on my phone and located the closest tire store to my location and I sure am glad she steered me towards Darrin Gilliam and his team. I slowly limped my way to the store and got out at 5:55pm on Friday afternoon and Mr. Gilliam asked how he could help me. I told him I needed a tire that I just had a blow out and was traveling to Hale County and needed to get home. He checked his inventory, but did not have the tire size I needed, but went well above and beyond to find one for me. He had two other guys and himself on phones calling all around to different stores trying to locate one and I was worried about them closing the doors at 6 pm, but he stated they do not close the doors until all customers are taken care of and would not leave me stranded.\n\nAfter locating a tire and having it brought there, Darrin Gilliam, Jasson Trammell and Matt Ramirez installed the tire and rim and helped me get back on the road. I have never ever been to ANY BUSINESS 5 minutes before closing time and especially on a Friday afternoon to receive great customer service like this. These gentleman stayed over with smiles on their faces just to make sure I was taken care of, regardless of the time.  While I was waiting, I did notice this location was very well organized and everyone there worked together as a team. This store definitely has their ducks in a row.\n\nThe management and workforce in this store is \"bar none\" the best I have ever seen. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t live close enough to do business with this store, but I will recommend anyone in this area to make this your \u201cgo to place\u201d for all of your automotive needs. I will check out the store in Tuscaloosa and see if their standards are as good as this store on 5036 Bond Blvd. Thanks again guys for all your professional and kind help on a short notice at quitting time on a late Friday afternoon. This store should win the store of the year award!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1536677351270, "text": "Chad, thank you for taking the time to share your positive Express Oil Change & Tire Engineers experience!
