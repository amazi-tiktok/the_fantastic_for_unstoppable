I bought a car for my daughter recently and could not obtain insurance from my carrier  because of a report they received from this company. They claim that an auction employee reported \"frame damage\" back in 2008, yet no such damage was ever reported to the owner's insurance nor was it noted on the title. CARMAX and several other reporting agencies didn't have a record of the damage either. When I questioned Red Mountain Customer Service I was told that they are under no obligation to share their reports with other agencies, but that she would follow up with me. The next day I received this email response: \"The Auction that sold your daughter\u2019s car in 2008 reports that the damage was to the left apron which was noted as severe damage. I have attached a copy of the AutoCheck vehicle history for your use.\"  The report states \"Frame Damage\", not \"Apron Damage\". Huge difference. So... they reserve the right to \"report\" whatever they want (accurate or not), thus creating issues like I now have with the car, while withholding information from other reporting agencies that if accurate, could be a potential safety issue to the consumer. The rep I spoke with at this company was very friendly, but evasive when I pushed her about the shady reporting.

Only reason I wanted to replace the screen is because it was cracked will glass falling out (yeah I broke it good). Breaking the phone is beside the point because at some point we all do and that is why this place is even in business!\nAfter being in the store an hour I was going to leave with my phone in working condition and noticed that the home button was super sensitive and was going crazy (I knew a risk with the home button was possible but it was pushing itself and the phone was going nuts) Carly the girl I was working with was absolutely wonderful (customer service wise and was super sweet). She was concerned so she opened the phone back up (big mistake) because the touch and the home button went completely out! She was great a working to try and fix the problem and then partnered with her boss who said she wasn't sure what could have happened but they could send the phone off but they thought the phone had touch HiC which is a disease on the phone that means the motherboard of the phone came unmicrosauded to the phone itself (I was told this could have happened when I dropped the phone which is crazy cause the phone worked up until they worked on it). Carly's Boss made sure that Carly relayed to me that they would send it off but the repair was on me and my wallet which I still don't understand. After and update and a factory restore on the phone I left it over night so that the manager could look at it herself.\nThe next morning I got a call from the Manager and she stated she didn't know what was wrong with the phone but the could send it off but again I had already been told I would have to pay for the repair. She said I will put all the original pieces on the phone and you can come pick your phone up (because I wasn't going to send it off and have to pay for a repair to he done to a phone that just needed a simple screen replacement when I went into the store).\nWhat this boils down to is that I Fix and Repair tore my phone up and wasn't willing to pay for the repair and wanted to send my phone off and it would never be the same again. People we take our phones into these places to intrust the individuals will do the repair and the phone will work (keep in mind I mentioned earlier I knew there were risk but no reason as to why my phone doesn't work now when it was working fine when I went into the store) This company in no way shape or form ever admitted to me that they screwed my phone up and took no responsibility in it. After being told I would be responsible for the repair I realized these people do not need to have a contract with IPhone if they aren't going to replace the phone after they basically demolished a phone and wouldn't fess up and take the responsibility. I have looked into this company and know that they can have their apple contract pulled if enough people have issues with them. I urge you to write a review if they have messed your phone up and didn't want to take the responsibility! Do it so people won't go through what I have been through! The don't deserve your business and I will never grace their door again!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892921311c230fd:0x8fe1017aa648b72e"}

I have always been treated very well from them so, NO I did not want to change. After a while of thinking about it SEVERAL MONTHS and my Son hammering me with the RJ YOUNG name, I did it. I purchased a machine from RJ YOUNG.\nAt first I was skeptical and to be honest I really didn't want to give it a chance (The Machine), but I did and after several months and barely using the machine I starting coming more around it and using it a little more & more. Then I began to really like it because it really printed so nice and pretty fast. It only took me  8 to 10 months to like it but you have to understand I WAS A XEROX Man and I thought there was NOTHING out there but Xerox. The Xerox machine has ALWAYS  performed outstanding and the SERVICE was the best, I was spoiled from that. However, I found out that there was more out there than XEROX! I found out that RJ YOUNG was REAL and believe me they have made a believer out of me. The Service that I thought would not compare to XEROX, has showed me they are just as good and if not BETTER. I never thought I would say that but it is so true. I can not believe how fast the Service Technicians reply to the service calls. They are always polite, and get me back up and running in a very quickly manner. They have such good personalities and a smile! As for the Ladies at the Home Office, Oh My How can you NOT like them. They are AMAZING. They always tell me they will have my supplies on the way or a Technician asap. IT IS JUST SO HARD TO PUT IN WORDS what RJ Young has done for my business. This is a very caring company and to be honest I am so glad that I have some of their product and that I was introduced to the World outside of XEROX. RICO machines have made my life SO MUCH Better and I am so happy that I have changed. If you are not a part of RJ YOUNG, you are probably missing out on good PEOPLE and Great Machines.\nDavid Santos,\nSantos Printing Co.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1615567331024, "text": "Thank you so much for your feedback, David!
