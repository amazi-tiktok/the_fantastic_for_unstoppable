We stopped by their office and were given the pitch by one of the owners.  He was very knowledgeable, very confident in his product.  He wasn\u2019t pushy and answered all our questions. After we shopped around, we decided to go with Steel Safe Shelters.  We stopped by, signed a contract and made a small down payment.  The following week they showed up around 9 a.m. and were completely finished by 4:30 p.m.  The work crew was super friendly and consummate professionals.  They truly knew their business.\n\nA few tips for those of you contemplating a storm shelter:  (1)  there are some companies in this area with little experience with installing shelters so be sure and ask how long they\u2019ve been in business, (2)  verify a company\u2019s standing with the Huntsville Better Business Bureau, (3) ensure they are fully insured in the event they damage your home (one company we spoke to said if anything was damaged during the install, WE would have to pay for the repair!), (4) ask how much the company wants for a down payment (Steel Safe only wanted 10%), and (5) ensure the concrete is pushed under the shelter during pouring \u2013 some companies don\u2019t use this process but Steel Safe does.\n\nA colleague of mine recently went with another storm shelter company and was VERY unhappy with the decision.  The company took four days to install their shelter, damaged the shelter and seemed to be very disorganized.  And, they required a down payment of 50%!  So, ask lots of questions from a perspective company before making a final decision.  Steel Safe Shelters lived up to their word in every respect.\n\nThe final deciding factor for us to go with Steel Safe Shelters is that Lowes endorses them.  To be endorsed by Lowes is a big deal \u2013 they don\u2019t put their name alongside any company unless they meet rigorous standards.\n\nOne final tip:  make sure you ask for one of their t-shirts! :  )", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889f80aeb3b02bd:0xd4785d1bbbd0beb6"}
