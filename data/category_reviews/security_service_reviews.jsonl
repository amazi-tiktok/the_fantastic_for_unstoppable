I was told that this info came directly from the TSI owners. They also said my doorbell video and other automations (lights, etc.) will not work if I canceled with them. They say that no other company will be able to use the equipment and it will only work with TSI since it was \"theirs\". They say that you cannot buy the Qolsys IQ Panel 2 online, because it comes from their dealer. This is all false.\n\nThey will also tell you that they don't know if they are allowed to cancel your account and that they don't know how to cancel accounts (and you have to call alarm.com to cancel). After multiple times calling alarm.com, I found out that you do in fact cancel with the dealer (TSI), not with them (they are just a third party software company). The lady at TSI needed to speak to her supervisor (but they were conveniently gone for the day), and she would call me first thing in the morning about if they can cancel/how to cancel my account (wouldn't you know, they never called back, I had to call them). The next morning, my call was passed around to 3 individuals until I spoke to somebody who wanted to make sure I 100% wanted to cancel my account (for all the reasons above). My alarm.com account was gone less than 5 minutes after I hung up. It was a fun few days of conversations.\n\nEdit: Thanks for responding M. Moore. I WAS a customer of yours, so I CAN leave a review on your company (I went to a different company because TSI is dishonest). Everything I've posted is 100% truth.

The cellular device that is built into the Qolsys panel is registered to our company, TSI. You would need another company to replace that device. Of course the Qolsys panel is available online to anyone that would want to purchase it at a retail price. All the other automation devices that were installed in the home are also universal and can be used with any other company. You were not told that. That was your misunderstanding. You were actually told that the automation devices would no longer be free because TSI would no longer be providing that service. That is an agreement between TSI, DR Horton & the Alarm.com builder program. You can\u2019t just have some random company give you a free Alarm.com account. I would think this would clear up any confusion you have. Like I said it\u2019s very simple. You would need another company to replace the device.\n\nAlso please do not reach out to TSI to assist or help you for any other reason. We take our reputation and reviews very serious. We also do not appreciate you, who is not a customer going online as you if you are and giving our company a 1 star review. You are not a customer & do not reserve that right.

When the installation tech arrived I was told that it could not be installed because I didn't have a dead bolt lock on the door.  That I could hire someone else to drill a hole in my door at additional cost.  Already paid $2500 for this security system and now I have to hire someone else to install the door lock.  I  called the salesperson and was told that she could get her husband to drill it. But then he couldn't because he was out of town.  So  3 days later got the hole drilled but when tech came back to install it the lock would jam.  Tech said they never drill door locks.  ADS doesn't pay for that tool because it is so expensive. Very frustrating!  Be careful with the salesperson!  Finally works after spending hours adjusting the door and lock.  Use another security company.

Telephone Representative very helpful in setting up appt. She told me that there would be no charge for the service call as our monthly charge includes the warranty. Service appt. was for the next day - very quick in getting an appt. Service tech - Jonathon Givens - had to replace two door sensors. He then proceeded to tell my wife that our system was outdated and needed to be updated. He offered to update it for a $100 fee. My wife told him she would have to speak with me first before we agreed to anything resulting in a charge. Jonathon then asked my wife how long had we had our system. She told him three years in our current home and approximately seven years in our previous house (total of approximately ten years with ADT.)  He then said he'd go ahead and update our system for no charge, which he did. What was that about??  Offer to update the system for $100?  Would that be considered fleecing a client? And if he was going to update the system for $100, does he pocket the amount, since he updated the system anyway. Kind of \"sketch\" as the kids say these days.  I have not been impressed with ADT monitoring services in the past, and only continued service with them after the 2 year contract (at which time they were going to increase my monitoring price $10/month.) They agreed to keep it at the same rate as long as I agreed to another 2 years.

Unfortunately my mom passed away the day before ADT was set to install. Even under all that pressure I remembered to call and cancel the install while I was out of town. I've been out of pocket for weeks trying to handle mom's business, grieve, and still live so I haven't had a chance to reschedule. ADT proceeded to still charge me two months of service at my old location even though they knew I had cancelled the service at my old house. When I caught it, the call center manager told me that they still bill you 30 days after you cancel. I asked about the other month and she said \"oh we prorated that and took it out of your installation fee.\" So I prepaid $100 for an install that I didn't get. And they took money out of my installation fee for two more months before I caught it. All this while they say sorry for your loss but...at least we gave you back the second month. So instead of $100 back I got about $50. Even during our time with them we were paying several months during one of their glitches and they weren't even monitoring my home.\n\nNo more ADT for me.
