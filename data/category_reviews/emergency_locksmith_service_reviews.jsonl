I didn't really want to go and deal with Lowe's or Walmart because frankly Walmart scares me right now. The kiosk was in the front of the store. I never had to directly interact with anyone which was a plus. It was simple put the key in like you're putting it in the door and pick out which key you want and I was going to get two keys and it said that I could get a key for free so I ended up getting three keys for everything included around $20. It didn't take that long. They all worked in my door and I made sure that I did the fingerprint in case I ever get locked out of my apartment. All I have to do is go to the kiosk and do the fingerprint and get another key. That's worth its weight in gold.

I would use them again..", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1597331535689, "text": "Hello April, thanks for your review.
