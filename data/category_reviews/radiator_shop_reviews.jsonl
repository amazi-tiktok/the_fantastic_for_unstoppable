The technician hooked it up and saw the high side was too high and low side very low. It was plugged. They tried to say they had to pull codes and all this junk and i told them it runs fine except for the a/c. I shut off the a/c and it ran fine, it would bog down when the compressor engaged.

The car seemed ok to me, although I knew there were some issues with the shock absorbers and brakes.  The PPI was the best $55 I ever spent and saved me from getting mired in a long list of reliability problems and expensive repairs that would have equaled the purchase price of the car!  I haven't found the right car yet, but will try to bring a few more examples to Hampton Cove Auto Services until we identify the right one.  As well as having a diligent technical team, I have found Jaquata on the customer service side to be both accommodating and very personable.
