Managers don't care about the residents, they cut the water off without warning most of the time. I understand that repairs are necessary. They destroy property and never come back to fix it when working on repairs.\nThe workers are too lazy to actually check the water and electricity usage of each resident, so they just take a wild guess and charge us for that amount, most of the time being way more. Our monthly bills are never delivered on time and they get mad at us for not paying the specific amount, and if they do deliver it they just throw it on the porch, SOMETIMES they'll tape it to our door. But if they do it'll be a few days late.\nThe repairs call for breaking the road, and the road repairs can take up to months to be fixed. I'll be adding pictures of the roads later.\n\nEdit: 7 months later and surprise surprise!! They haven't fixed the roads! All management has been doing is refilling it in with gravel that goes everywhere and makes the place look worse!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObt_7YfaLbsA0-QhnPWIJR-mzXOGjZz1BI1OIu=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtiGnAWKbwNxvfICcmOgsz8QptMnq4cWzZnUPi=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkatEZ7AIKpAyvoBY03F_s3IpdFR_FUmCxrYcB=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNh5PVwnKajKmgjFbXd5ugQqM3X8YPQI-Jly29X=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889246cf0b20b17:0xf18c1002fc4bf455"}
