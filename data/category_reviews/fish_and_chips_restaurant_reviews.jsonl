The food is very reasonably priced; they give Senior Discounts, have delicious combos for $4.99 and as a VIP member, you can earn Reward Points with each visit.

Rodrick waited on me in the drive-through and he was so pleasant, knowledgeable, and accommodating that I told him he needed a raise. He explained to me that the VIP membership now was by email rewards. I told him I had received an email reward and was there to get my dessert with my meal. He offered me a drink while I waited.

Usually you order on 1 side of the building then drive around to the other side to get your food at the window. Because of this, the wait time in the drive way is extremely slow because they cook everything fresh. So you order your food, pull up to the window and wait abotu 5-10 minutes but the person behind you has to wait until you get your food before they can order because you are too close. ITS TERRIBLE.

The creamed corn is salted, not sweet; I don't like that, but it's a matter of personal taste. The baked beans were good. Right now, it is VERY HOT inside to be eating despite a huge fan and open windows: I wouldn't recommend that you go do that for now, until the A/Cs are back in business, and nobody is doing that for now, and the tables didn't look like they were waiting for people. The place is also somewhat dark inside. No music. Most people just use this place for takeout, for which it seems really successful: you can call and just go pick your food up. The owner is a very very nice person, so far the best thing in the place probably. The second time around I asked a chicken quesadilla with everything. The tortilla of the quesadilla was toasted, a bit crunchy, with oil, the amount was very good, the filling volume was very good for a quesadilla, but the vegetables were burnt black on the edges, so my first taste was that bitter burnt flavor, and the chicken barely had flavor, not salty nor sweet. It was still edible. I had a pickled egg, which I have never had before, and don't know what it is supposed to be like, so I won't give my critique on that. I hear that their fried chicken rocks.
