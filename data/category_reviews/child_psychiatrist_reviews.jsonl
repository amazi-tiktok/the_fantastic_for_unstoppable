Perhaps my previous doctors were influenced by the labels and words used to describe some of my symptoms which caused them to think I didnt need this form of treatment.. I dont know but there are medicines that will help you that you may never have heard of like me.\n\nIt actually makes my brain WORK the right way Versus just numbing it, and covering over the problem .\n\nI am now in a position that I am safely tapering off the medication that I dont truly need to be on(faster than I thought I could) and put that \"mistake\" in the past and I am focused on my life and my future for the first time in years.\n\nNever give up hope! Dont settle for bad help or mediocre treatment that just helps you \"get by\" each day as long as you have your \"meds\"\n\nIf you not thriving or on a path too it dont settle like I did for way too long.\n\nDont assume you know the only things that will work for you and be TOTALLY honest with the Dr so he can help you .\n\nIm even getting back into old hobbies and my next new career goals and even back into My Faith in God.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling please take this as a message of hope that its never too late and never hopeless.\n\nGod Bless and Thank you to Dr. Islam and Thanks to President Trump or whoever in the Government made this Tele-Medicine / new video conferencing option available.
