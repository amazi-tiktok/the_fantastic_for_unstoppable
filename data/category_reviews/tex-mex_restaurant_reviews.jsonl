I was disappointed. The cashier and girl running tables were both pretty rude, as well as the guy cleaning tables afterwards. I had questions about the menu but the cashier gave me short abrupt answers and seemed like it was annoying her that I was asking her about the food. I had 2 of the tacos with steak and chips and salsa. I will say that the portions were pretty large, especially for a taco. They don't skimp on toppings, but the taste of them left a lot to be desired. They were both mediocre, so if you feel like having tacos just go to a true Mexican restaurant, they will be better there. Apparently, their salsa is supposed to be really something special, but it just tasted like average restaurant salsa to me, there didn't seem to be anything about it that stood out. All in all, I don't regret going so that I now know what it is like, but I won't be returning.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1493135911362, "text": "I am truly sorry that we fell short of your expectations.

The seasoning on the meat was non existent and the cheese sprinkled on top seemed like it was kraft taco shredded cheese purchased from the publix across the street. Why not serve Mexican cheese?? It seems all the tacos come with grilled peppers and grilled onions making the menu items lacking any innovation. Just google Torchys Tacos and read the descriptions of theirs, and compare it to the unexciting tacos at this place. If you think this place has the best tacos or best queso, you have never been to El Barrio or even Taco Mama or even the La Cantina food truck.

I get back to work to eat and the quesadilla was not properly cooked and just fell apart. I will never go back. And as an engineer I hope fast food workers are replaced with efficient equipment. And they think they deserve 15 an hour. Yea right.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923a5bb7652f7:0x29bfa66c33b8d370"}

Born and raised in Texas, I know my Tex-Mex-BBQ. If I could give a 4.25 stars, I would.  Being my fist time there, I had the BBQ sampler with potato salad and ff as sides.The sides were perfect.  Flavor was off the chain and the amount given was more than enough, thankfully.  The sampler comes with brisket, pulled pork and sausage.  For the price, I could have used a bit more brisket and a lil less pork but I was completely full at the end of the meal, as I mentioned before the sides were ample.  The flavor was perfect, my only complaint was the brisket was a tad on the dry side, I know brisket is tough to get right fresh off the grill, much less hours or the next day.   I didn't get any desert, I asked where the pecan pie came from and was a lil disappointed to learn is was from Sam's rather freshly made, especially at $6.00 a slice.  My wife had the Southern Bell and Brisket tip Tacos and she said they were amazing.

It is easily one of the most unique dining experiences in town. The menu is unlike any other, and EVERYTHING is good. This is not fast food, and it isn't priced as such,  but the value is definitely there and I think anyone who tries it will agree. It does come to you fast enough however, and it won't cost you an arm and a leg or anything, just don't expect average, low-rate mexican food prices as that is absolutely not what you will be getting.\n\nThe brussel sprouts are to die for. I already liked brussel sprouts, but I've never had any anywhere that are even close to theirs. I can't even begin to describe them, but take my word for it. Even if you think you hate brussel sprouts, you will probably love them. The soft tacos are big and they are lovingly put together and presented \"gourmet-style\" on a large, metal tray that is then covered with wax paper. They're not just slapped together all haphazard and plopped on a cheap plate like at everywhere else. You can mix and match them for a chance to try several different ones in a visit too. There are lots of different ones to choose from and they all are awesome, with like 6 or 7 different fresh ingredients each and then drizzled with unique spices and sauces. The different meats in each one are not ground or shredded into oblivion, but are thick pieces that need to be bitten into, which is good because you can better appreciate the exceptional taste and texture that comes from the extra care that went into cooking it.\n\nThere are also burritos, lots of different sandwiches, and even some more traditional items like BBQ and such. It takes a few minutes to study and understand the menu before you can know exactly which items will be perfect for you personally, but I'm pretty sure it will happen for most everyone just as it did for me.\n\nWell, I tried.

There's random classic funk rock like old Zeppelin and cream playing very quietly as a backdrop to the one tv above the bar with a game on. It feels like the restaurant was decorated for something else and halfway through they gave up and turned it into a taco joint. Identity crisis.\n\nCustomer service: Not impressed. The cashier or server or whatever he was didn't seem to know much about the menu which is a pretty big deal when your making food as specific as this. They also give you a buzzer to let you know when the food is ready... Which is fine if I have to come get my food but if you're going to bring it to me anyways then what's the point of giving me a buzzer? Just seems like a pointless extra step. Once my food got to me I asked which taco was which because all 3 were very different and the server said he didn't know and walked off. That's unacceptable. I had to get up and look at the menu in the storefront again to remember which was which.\n\nDrinks: My date and I each had a margarita. She had the special of the day and I had the catalina. They were both delicious but very alcohol light. They were also served in plastic cups which seemed cheap for a not so cheap drink. There is also the added inconvenience of having to order each drink individually and then get up in the middle of your meal, walk to the front of the store, and pay for your next drink. ??? That is a really bad business model for selling alcohol. As a restaurant your highest profit margin should be from your alcohol sales. You should make ordering alcoholic drinks as easy as possible to maximize your revenue and customer satisfaction.\n\nFood: The food is quite possibly the most disappointing part of my experience. Not because it was bad, but because it was nothing. I ordered 3 tacos with chips and queso. I had the Russian Roulette, The Outlaw, and The Lonestar. Each pretty unique in their overly complicated design and odd amalgamation of ingredients that are essentially slopped into a flour tortilla in an effort to ensure I have the messiest taco eating experience of my life. There was so many different ingredients in these tacos that I was expecting to have a symphony of spicy flavors and aromas accompany these gorgeous tacos, but there were so many random ingredients on each one that just don't work together that I couldn't taste anything. So many flavors working against each other just for the sake of having more \"artisanal\" ingredients on your taco. I had 3 very different tacos and they all tasted the same... Like paprika sprinkled on cardboard. That may sound harsh but it's honestly the closest comparison I can make. You would also think that at a place that serves a cuisine known for its spiciness that I would expect to get a good kick in the mouth out of 3 of its spiciest tacos but I'll be honest.. I had hot wings from zaxby's last night that were far hotter.\n\nOverall not the worst experience I've ever had but this seems like the type of place that trendy hipsters frequent so they can make instagram posts about \"artisan\" tacos and feel Californian for a day.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b8655555555:0xcaa6bcabf907d80e"}

Honestly, at first I didn't believe this was you.  You, the man that would hang out our bar and talk motorcycle travels, family, and military.  Mr. Rodney, we'd spend plenty of time talking about food and our passions.  I'm saddened that you wouldn't recommend our eatery after eating here since we've been open.  You know us.  You know that if there was ever any issue with ANYTHING what so ever that I would want to hear about it straight from you, person to person, and you should know after ALL these years that I would make it right, to anyone, but especially to you.  Mr. Rodney, you know that our staff (my restaurant family) has been through hell this past year due to COVID.  We appreciate you and have always appreciated your support.  If you were trying to get my attention as an owner by writing a vague one star review, well you certainly got it.  But I ask you, as a long time patron and as a person I considered a friend, that you reconsider your review and speak to me in person about your experience.  From a veteran owned business, family owned business, to you a local veteran... at the very least, give me the opportunity to speak with you and try to fix whatever issue might have occurred tonight.  Afterwards if you still feel the exact same as you do now, you may write whatever review you'd like; but I would appreciate the opportunity to try.  I look forward to speaking with you soon, sir.  - LeAndra P. (Owner)"}, "gmap_id": "0x88626b8655555555:0xcaa6bcabf907d80e"}

Born and raised in Texas, I know my Tex-Mex-BBQ. If I could give a 4.25 stars, I would.  Being my fist time there, I had the BBQ sampler with potato salad and ff as sides.The sides were perfect.  Flavor was off the chain and the amount given was more than enough, thankfully.  The sampler comes with brisket, pulled pork and sausage.  For the price, I could have used a bit more brisket and a lil less pork but I was completely full at the end of the meal, as I mentioned before the sides were ample.  The flavor was perfect, my only complaint was the brisket was a tad on the dry side, I know brisket is tough to get right fresh off the grill, much less hours or the next day.   I didn't get any desert, I asked where the pecan pie came from and was a lil disappointed to learn is was from Sam's rather freshly made, especially at $6.00 a slice.  My wife had the Southern Bell and Brisket tip Tacos and she said they were amazing.  To finish up, I'll definitely go back, the atmosphere was great and the staff was amazing.\n\nUPDATE: I went back this past weekend and ordered just a brisket plate and it melted in my mouth.

Sure, the food truck may be awesome but the restaurant is terrible! I waited 40 minutes for 4 tacos and a quesadilla and they only had two tables in the restaurant. There were 4 employees. I kept asking how much longer, and one girl said \"I'm not sure, we got backed up and I realize you may be in a hurry but it'll be ready soon!\" They desperately need to work on their customer service and staff. I can't imagine how long the wait would be if they actually had a full restaurant of customers! Its a good concept but I dont think they were ready for a full service restaurant or all that it entails. I won't be back!\n\nThomas, you are absolutely right! I was in your establishment as a door dash driver. Your employee advised me of your policy and I left and returned 10 minutes later with my insulated bag, per your policy. Upon arriving with the bag, I waited 35 minutes for the food to be ready. It took your employees a total of 45 minutes to make 4 tacos and a quesadilla. Your delivery driver left and returned and I was still waiting for the order. Another door dash driver came and left and I was still waiting for the order. A car side to go came and left and I was still waiting for my order. It became increasingly frustrating because while waiting for the order I was assigned to pick up, I was unable to be available for other orders. This one assignment took over an hour of my time and ultimately messed up the potential money I could have made because the service at your establishment is negligently noteworthy. If I was a paying customer I would be furious to wait an hour for over priced food and mediocore service. First impressions are everything and everyone that visits your restaurant is a potential paying customer. If my experience would have been different, dont you think I would have returned as a paying customer? I can understand why your employees are uneager to service patrons, as the owner has repeatedly rudely reacted to all negative reviews, this pattern, as another patron noted, is highly unprofessional! The restaurant business is not easy and making responses to negative reviews such as you have will not help your business. I'm so glad you contacted Door Dash so I had a chance to respond to your threatening Facebook message for me to take down my negative review.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, please be weary of writing negative reviews to this restaurant because the owner will threaten you privately. The time you took to look me up on Facebook and message me could have been spent training your employees to be more attentive to any person entering your establishment. I am appalled that a restaurant owner would conduct themselves in such an unprofessional manner. The right response would have been, \"I'm sorry you had a bad experience, please let us know what we can do going forward for you to possibly return.\" However, your response solidifies the unprofessionalism and disregard for others opinions and ultimately their money. I wish you the best of luck, as you are going to need it to stay in business for the long haul.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1604108283457, "text": "Jessica.

The meat was incredible, and the combination of their sweet slaw, their pimento cheese, and the mustard was the perfect complement to this hearty, comfort-food sandwich.  While complimenting the owners, they told me about some cool sounding tacos they make with fried chicken and pimento cheese, but they only make it as a special.  They are planning on adding it to their permanent menu but hadn\u2019t done so yet.  I asked them if they would consider making it for me if I came back for lunch the next day, and they totally did!  It was fantastic!  These guys have a real gift for flavor.  And just when I thought they couldn\u2019t be any cooler, they doubled down and made me their fried pickles as a side (also something they have only experimented with so far and wasn\u2019t on the menu yet).  They make their own pickles, they are spicy and thinly sliced and perfect!  Since they are so thin, they fry up like chips and are mind-blowing good!  On top of all of this, they have many gluten free and vegan options.
