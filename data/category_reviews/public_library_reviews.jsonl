During my conversation with the patrol officer the director walks pass both of us, says nothing, walks out of the door and stands on the steps leaning over the rail for about 15 minutes. Now it just me and the patrol officer in the hallway, me and the patrol officer walk into the secretary's office and I am asking the secretary if there was a corporate number or anything. She comes up behind me and the patrol officer and starts yelling again \" GET OUT OF MY OFFICE YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HARRAS MY STAFF AND BRING THEM IN THIS MATTER\" And I turned around and stated \" what? I did leave you office, this is your office to? she yelled \"ALL OF THESES OFFICES ARE MY OFFICE, I AM THE DIRECTOR OF 10 LIBRARIES  AND YOU ARE HARRASING US\". And I stated to her I only asked for the corporate number. The director closed her office, walked outside, walked back into another office that I was in and told the secretary not to give me anything, not to communicate with me. So I said I see this issue has just escalated please call the police, then to director says call the police. The director then stated \"YOU ARE TRYING TO PUSH ME AROUND\" I was mortified I stated to her I have not touched you or yelled at you\", you are literally causing a scene, and other employees are standing in the hallway trying to figure out what's going on. To add insult to injury the person that I was reporting( The assistant director) walks in the door way and just stands there with a laugh on her face and saying what. Now this director in the beginning of the conversation said that she could not have us in the same room and then the assistant director literally stands in the door? (THE PATROL OFFICER HERSELF SAID TO ME, THIS IS CRAZY BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU ARE COMING FROM THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO THE DIRECTOR IS OVER ME AND I HAVE ONLY BEEN WORKING HER FOR 3 WEEKS) Are you serious no one called you at all in the matter and now you just pop up . The patrol officer stated that since the director wants you out of the facility you have to stand outside, so I asked the patrol officer could I get my books because I was studying and she said yes and then stand outside. As I get on the elevator she then goes to talk to the assistant director. I'm sitting outside and the police walk right past me so I know where they were going so when they came back downstairs I said excuse me and the police officers were like oh ok they mean you so I explain the situation and they stated that the could not handle the situation write a letter to the mayor.\n\nWHAT DOES A FAMILY DEATH HAVE TO DO WITH A PERSONAL MATTER DIRECTOR?

Went to story time with my 3-yr old (which was fun), then asked the nice woman who ran story time if there was any children's area in the library (story time was in a side room off the entryway). She suggested my son would like to see the fish tank, so we went into the main area. My friend and I chatted for a few minutes as our kids looked at the fish. The elderly man running the front desk interrupted us with \"THIS is a LIBRARY. You need to be quieter!!\" And stormed off, very offended looking. I honestly thought it was a joke at first. There were maybe 5 other people in the whole library, so it's not as if we were disturbing people who were trying to study (& the kids were quiet, so he was definitely referring to our conversation). Even if we were being too loud in his opinion, I can think of a million nicer ways to tell us!

It made me hit the panic button and go greyhound on four occasions back to Boston to Jackson MS winding up in a psych ward in Vicksburg MS psych ward in New Orleans the following month after I sneaked onto greyhound in Mobile. Then back to Boston returning to Arbor Hospital where I got punched in the jaw then upside the head. Back to Mobile the next day after getting out of Kingston House. Through New York finding Wanda Coach the Korean bus going to Atlanta and even Huntsville AL. The tofu shop near where Wanda coach dumps you of sells odd meat products. Why are some immigrants spending $80 on groceries including animal spleens. How are immigrants in possession of $80 when our senior citizens sleep in cars at Walmart and are homeless we need to restrict access for immigrants here. They probably own nail shops and put paraffin on women's feet for $40. They're going to eat animal spleens. I bought 2 bananas. Walked to MARTA to save money. I couldn't live in Atlanta. The town where Yale University is dreary. And they have low class drug eons answering the phone wanting persons to participate in studies on pharmeceutjcsls evil DNA transmissions  I am going to stay with my friend John Jennings a published research scientist. We are cowriters. So I'm reading in the library someone comes over thinking how dapper they must seem and asked me about taking a shower or going to the women's shelter on Broad. I actually have Danish ancestry and our females including the blonds considered models have no compulsion to conform to others in the shallow ways. Spending $16 figuring out which Tide Pods to get. I should have asked who he was. Also has it occurred to anyone that explorers and pirates like maybe got over it didn't think they were too stinky to explore new lands even Marco Polo or Ghenghis Khan or Jesus. Is it some cultural semblance of normalcy to compulsively slather on cakey white deodorant and impress someone over a $50 of cologne. Do you have any idea who my connections are who I might actually be. I'm trying trying to find a book to connect with in this library been to 47 states international travel Far East Europe. Do you think I'm asking every European woman to sleep with me. Can you be contained. How do you support yourself. Do you animals. The security guard looks like the bossy inventor guy from Alaskan Bush People. He lives in the woods and wants to be logical and invent. Can we restrict your access to certain things. I say we use FOIA. Why are some watching a person shaking their posterior on YouTube. I listen to the Moody Blues on YouTube. Can we discuss David Duke and the Klan Scotch in the same sentence. I'm a little opposed to that dream. I think I will migrate. I need books about Schrodingers multiverse. I think we need more Trump and finding out my former spouse is related to Trump and even Ivanka should upgrade. Trump can be a kindergarten teacher. Mobile is a city for the crumugdeon who doesn't want to walk anywhere\nLaw enforcement is nice there I've talked to 2 different officers on 2 different occasions\nThey probably go places on the weekend to get away\nI'm shocked at home values in neighborhoods where no one walks a dog even. The skatepark is the only place for teenagers. The uppity people at the dog park who went to law school and pay for a groomer to powder their pooch. I think the Internal Revenue Service needs to be notified. They need serious reality checks everyone there. The women with jobs where they sit answering the phone rudely. The librarian who went to library school tells you to look it up. The people on airport Blvd showing their car. They should all lose their money and it can be a great riches to rags story.
