During this time our discussion turned to military divorce with myself being a 22 year veteran and having experienced a divorce while on active duty. The short conversation made me wish Mitchell had been my divorce attorney. Some of our discussion topics were SSCRA, mandatory DFAS verbiage, and the 20/20 rule. These are topics I learned the hard way and discovered not every lawyer who professes to be a military divorce expert is familiar with (for the record I can immediately name 3 locally). I did a lot of research during and after my divorce and can tell you that Michell has a firm grasp of the intricacies of military divorces (and he's even written a book further demonstrating his understanding). After conversing with him and reading his book, I would fully recommend Mitchell Howie as a military divorce attorney and suggest hiring him so your spouse doesn't.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1580534496427, "text": "Richard I am very happy we were able to help you with your general legal consult and thank you so much for the kind review!

During this time our discussion turned to military divorce with myself being a 22 year veteran and having experienced a divorce while on active duty. The short conversation made me wish Mitchell had been my divorce attorney. Some of our discussion topics were SSCRA, mandatory DFAS verbiage, and the 20/20 rule. These are topics I learned the hard way and discovered not every lawyer who professes to be a military divorce expert is familiar with (for the record I can immediately name 3 locally). I did a lot of research during and after my divorce and can tell you that Michell has a firm grasp of the intricacies of military divorces (and he's even written a book further demonstrating his understanding). After conversing with him and reading his book, I would fully recommend Mitchell Howie as a military divorce attorney and suggest hiring him so your spouse doesn't.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1580534496427, "text": "Richard I am very happy we were able to help you with your general legal consult and thank you so much for the kind review!

It was an uncontested divorce except for the fact that my ex wanted child support. Well, I didn't know any better, and I knew she wouldn't sign the papers if there was no child support so I agreed to give her what Mr. Campbell had come up with: $400. My ex originally wanted something like $650 per month so I looked at that as a win. Well, after talking with different people who have joint legal and physical custody like I do, they wonder why in the hell am I paying my ex ANY child support, since I have her week on and week off. And, after talking with two different lawyers, they wonder the same thing. The lawyer I have now told me if I'd taken our case to court, the judge would NOT have awarded child support to my ex. We will be going back to court needless to say, will definitely not be using Mr. Campbell who screwed me over.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1450297464686, "text": "Dear Mr. Kemp, I appreciate the opportunity to have assisted with your case, but I do wish you had taken an opportunity to follow up with me about these concerns.  I did leave a message for you to call me concerning this matter, but I have not heard back from you.  I can address your concerns here.  As you might recall, you came to me to fix the agreement that you had tried to file on your own and that the court had rejected.  Without going into the details of the numbers involved with your case (which details are a matter of record) I can confidently say that you would likely have been ordered to pay around $400 per month in child support if you were awarded true joint physical custody after a trial.  If you had tried your case and been awarded joint legal custody, with your wife being awarded sole physical custody, you would have likely been ordered to pay around $650 per month.  Note that there is a difference between joint physical, versus joint legal, custody.  In Alabama, child support must still be calculated, and the judge still must state whether or not Rule 32 has been followed, even in joint physical custody situations.  This means that one party who makes significantly more than the other may still have to pay an amount of child support, and the method used to calculate $400 per month in your case is one that is accepted by the courts.  If two people make the same income, or have an agreement to deviate from guidelines, it is possible to have an order without child support.  Those conditions were not present in your situation.  The alternative would have been to pay me (or another lawyer) much more money to take your case to trial, and make an argument for custody and support, the result of which would not have been a certainty (and could result in less favorable terms of custody and having to pay more support than your agreement).  I'll be glad to explain this to the other persons that have provided feedback to you, as I fear that they must be either misinformed as to the facts or the law.  I am glad to have had the opportunity to assist you, and I will be happy to follow up with you concerning any questions that you have about this matter."}, "gmap_id": "0x88626b54406e816d:0xec1834fe93991c53"}

I am a very satisfied client and I would highly recommend Mr. Neil to anyone based on my own experience to people needing to file bankruptcy or other legal matters like closing on a home etc.. I didn't know him before I walked into his office. I simply did a web search and he was one of several that came up in the search results. I had already called several Attorneys before I got to him but no one answered at those offices. Not even a receptionist. They all sent me to an answering machines. When I got to Mr. Neil's number he personally answered (that was a good sign) I told him I was nervous about filing bankruptcy due to my financial situation had taken a dive and now I make a lot less than I use to. Yes, I even tried consolidation and refinancing but even with a great credit score of 720 the banks still turned me down because my debt to income was too high which was weird because that's the whole point or refinancing is to get your interest rate cost down so you can keep paying. Plus the government said I owed them $10k in back taxes which forced me into Mr. Neils office. After talking with him, I wasn't nervous anymore. He explained everything so clearly and plainly that even a bird-brain could understand. I learned more in 30 minutes from Mr. Neil than I did from several weeks of internet research. I came in his office thinking (incorrectly) that I would be filing chapter 13 because I wanted to keep all my valuables requiring me to make 5 years worth of payments to the court. That sucks! I also incorrectly thought I didn't want to file chapter 7 because from my research, I incorrectly concluded they take most of your stuff of value and liquidate it and give the money to the creditors when you file chapter 7. Well, all that turned out to be wrong. Mr. Neil gave me great legal advice informing me that based on my situation, I could actually file chapter 7 and still keep everything including my Turbo Porsche and be completely discharged in 60 days and never have to make any payments to the court. I extended trust to him while hoping I wouldn't regret it and in the end he proved to be ligit. He saved me from 5 years of bankruptcy payments and I kept all my property.

David, the person with whom she asks to speak, is constantly dodging her because he is always \"out of the office\" or \"with another 'more important' client.\" I'm sure NONE of those \"more important\" clients have been as equanimous with them as she has.\n\nDavid has apparently trained his staff to dodge her as well since she called them, and Alice refused to answer the phone (probably because of caller ID) but when I called, she answered the phone just to place us on hold to retrieve something so minuscule that it took less than 30 seconds to do...\n\nApparently this lawyer and his team care nothing about their clients--and dare I say clients of color... But this is the behavior that is typical of many businesses in the north central region of Alabama. Once the better business bureau is contacted, however, maybe they will change their tone.\n\nIf she had not contacted the actual courthouse to get her court date, she would not have even known of the impending court date. After calling these people several times, they refused to give her any of her case details.\n\nSo with regard to the other negative review this institution has received, I do NOT agree with the owner that \"it is the work of a competitor.\" I have seen these practices first-hand, and I am far from a capital seeking adversary.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1594754666809, "text": "Because we don't recognize your name and you don't appear to be a client of our firm, based off your screen name, there's no way for us to address this issue without knowing the exact name of the client.

Are you sure you have the correct firm?\n\nIn relation to your comment about \"people of color,\" approximately half of our clients are non-caucasion clients and are \"people of color.\" We have dedicated this firm to representing clients who have been injured, oppressed, overlooked and not been treated fairly, regardless of their designation. Over the years, the lawyers and staff of our firm have also volunteered countless hours of their personal time participating in charities and outreach programs that benefit all segments of our community.\n\nAlthough we're respectful of your opinion, the assertions you've made about the issue of race are reckless and inaccurate and thats clearly proven by 17 years of close relationships with people of all genders, races and socio-economic statuses that are repeat clients. Many people leaving reviews on this very site are \"people of color\" and would strongly disagree with your statement and actually take offense to it. Writing a negative review about a business that's never represented you is one thing but making baseless accusations of racial unfairness about people you don't know and who have spent their careers representing underprivileged segments of our state and communities is something else.\n\nIf your mother is dissatisfied with any service that any lawyer or staff member of our firm has ever provided, then please have your mother, personally, reach out immediately and ask for the head practice manager so that we can rectify this matter.\n\nWe take any client dis-satisfaction very seriously and want every client to be satisfied with our efforts.

He refuses to return phone calls. He called me ONE TIME during my divorce, the day before the hearing. He never even bothered to send me the final divorce decree. I had no idea what my divorce papers said until his secretary emailed them to me, after the THIRD request. I know all of his secretaries because they are the only ones I could ever talk to. Half the time, they didn't return phone calls either. Halfway through the 'mediation' I got the distinct feeling that he was working for the other side. He obviously thinks he can make a living by gaining clients, screwing them over, and going on to the next victim. He must be too young and immature to grasp the concept that most people will need an attorney more than ONCE in their lifetime, and if he thinks he can be successful without the benefit of repeat clients, he is delusional. If he was the last attorney on earth, I would never hire him again. My divorce is final; I'm still missing half my belongings; he's promised me a refund twice and never delivered. On top of that, he suggested we file a contempt motion because of the fact that I was not given all the belongings I was entitled to. He didn't mention at the time that he planned on charging me an additional $1500 to do what I'd already paid him to do. In my opinion, the reason all his pictures on FB look like gangster photos is because he is a crook. He will stand there and 'listen' to you, but he is just pretending to hear you. You'd have more luck talking to a brick wall. Plus the brick wall might return your calls. I read a bad review of his, and I should have heeded it.

Hopefully this review will help others in narrowing their search for legal representation. I spent time searching for the right fit for myself when going through a divorce. I landed with Merrell law firm. I can say without a doubt, I made the right choice. My divorce was difficult at best, but Ed was always a calming force, was honest with his feedback, and fought hard for my rights. Ed is not your \"typical\" attorney. I was unfortunately involved with other attorneys during this process, that were not employed at Merrill law firm. I quickly learned a lesson in law. In my experience a lot of attorneys are concerned first and foremost with money, and concerned secondary with actually dealing with and helping the person behind their paycheck. I never felt this way with Ed Merrell or anyone else at Merrell law firm. Ed has a passion for actually helping his clients and a genuine/honest approach to his job. If you want honest, hard-working, knowledgeable, representation, go with Merrell.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888923b58aedf6eb:0x421fef70b97ec27f"}

One of the many things I love about her though, is once I said that I didn't care about all of that let's go to war, she busted out her notebook and said lets got to war then!  She started prepping for court right in the middle of mediation but thankfully my case was able to settle without having to step inside a courtroom. My ultimate goal was to get split time with my kids due to my ex keeping them away from me amongst other things and as expected that's exactly what I got.

Both Thomas and Melvin were extremely helpful in what was to me new territory as I had never been in a situation like this before. They stood ready to assist any way they could to include retaining their services should the need arise. As a retired Marine with 26 years service I know professionalism when I see it.

I'm pretty sure that conversation should not have been discussed in front of a potential client. As I am sitting there explaining to Mr. Thomas why I am there seeking hes services he was more interested in picking the sores on his leg then paying any attention to anything i had to say, and while he was showing me the bruises from his recent jet ski accident all he could tell me was to seek an attorney immediately. I believe that's what I am here. What he ment was i needed a court appointed attorney because I could not afford him. So with Very unprofessional! My family has dealt with Powell Law firm for many years my aunt has know Mr. Thomas sence hes graduation year in 07. They have been wonderful people always willing to help with a smile. till now.

Everyone at the Zwiebel Law Firm returned my calls and responded to my emails quickly. I even got to enjoy texting with Elizabeth while she was in court on other matters. No matter my emergency or issue at hand, I got answers quickly. She never turned me away. She never thought any issue was too small or too big. She stayed with me through it all. She talked to me so sweetly and kindly that it calmed me down each day. I had never been through divorce before and this was new to me. She understood that. She explained every detail before it happened and she was right 100% of the time. She predicted what would happen and we worked my case like a chess game and won. She showed me how to use every avenue to explore ways to settle but also to make a better case for me. I am so glad I decided to change attorneys in the middle of a case. My child would never be the same without our current custody agreement. If she had not fought for me, I would not have alimony or child support to help me and my child through the difficult times. With her help I was able to find a way to get my child in a better home, better school and afford it all with my alimony and child support.  I am so thankful for her and her staff.

I was always heavily involved in my children's lives but saw that it might change for the worst after that day.  Then I met Elizabeth.  Wow!  She listened to my concerns and gave me excellent advice both legally and personally.  She understood that coaching my son in baseball was a passion that I wanted to continue post divorce.  I did not know if that was possible until I met with her.  She really explained the legal process and how I could maintain that close relationship.  I highly recommend her and her staff.  At each point in my case, we were always ready to make it a final resolution and keeping my goals in mind.  She was always available to answer any question.  I paid good money and got great attention.  She stayed on top of her job.  She mentioned that she \"worked\" for me and I was the boss.  I liked that about her.  She would always explain the legal process with my goals in mind and keep my eye on the ball.  I am so glad that I found her when I needed a divorce lawyer.\n\nUpdate:  Almost a year later, I needed help and called Elizabeth.  She took my call and readily gave me the help I needed.  She was still familiar with every fact in my case to this day.  My goodness the memory that she has is amazing.  She walked me through each issue I am currently having and found a solution that worked without going back to court.  I am so thankful I went with her firm in the first place.  If I had gone elsewhere, I would be facing a new legal case today.  Her staff was friendly.  They understood I was under a tremendous amount of stress with my new issue.  Elizabeth quickly picked up the phone.  She gave me the most current law that applied to my problem.  It was such a relief to know that she is always on my side.  She walked me through how to get my problem worked out.  The people at her firm are amazing at problem solving.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b946a05e5dd:0xe875e887f6e5f4be"}

When I was faced with mine in 2019, I was referred to Dani Bone through a coworker and friend that I trusted. I initially hired Dani because I heard he was the very best and he would fight for me. I called and even though they were extremely busy, they saw me right away. After hearing my situation, Dani was honest with me and said, \"You need Sam. \" My case was very complicated having both personal and business issues, assets and properties to divide, custody and other court issues . Sam took it as a challenge. He stayed with me and guided me through the whole divorce process. It was not easy, it was extremely tough but Sam knew how to handle every situation that came up. When going through a 2 yr battle, you need to know and  feel confident that your attorney has your back and has your best interest at heart. I emotionally fell apart many times and he helped me to learn to stand up for myself and it made me a stronger person through this process. All I wanted was what was fair- he got me exactly what I asked for! I was extremly pleased with services of Sam, Dani and their dedicated and caring staff. Amanda, Fredrick and Osha were just wonderful to work with. The whole staff made me feel comfortable and at ease through a very uncomfortable life circumstance.  While the other party had 5 attorneys through the process , I had one.  I only needed the one team- I had The Best with Sam & Dani Bone. Sam was honest, upfront, bold and encouraging. He never had to be ugly or raise his voice in court or trial and never once belittled anyone. I recall him saying, \"It doesn't have to be ugly\". Being a Christian, a professional, a self employed woman, a Realtor and a mother of 2, this was imperative to me. Sam treated both parties with total RESPECT always . That was very important to me.  I did my part and provided the true facts, evidence and proof- he did his part and presented my case with true professionalism , Integrity and no one was disrespected in the process. I would \ud83d\udcaf percent recommend Sam & Dani Bone if you want to be represented by someone who will always have your back and is not afraid to fight for your best interest.

I no longer lived in Alabama and was unsure of where to turn for legal advice. After consulting with Mr. Sam Bone, it was clear that he had a deep understanding of law and how it applied to my particular situation.\n\nMany attorneys will promise the moon, without being able to deliver a star. Sam will be honest about your case, talk with you about the possibilities, and develop a plan to protect your best interests. Phone calls/emails are answered promptly and you are made aware of appointments and court actions. Even though my case was regular family law issues, it was treated as a priority.\n\nWhen emotions run high and people play dirty, you need an attorney that will keep you focused. It was nothing short of a blessing to have Sam\u2019s counsel during this time. Sam will listen and use what will benefit your case most, helping you to make the best decisions.\n\nThrough my experience, I learned that Sam is wise beyond his years and holds a unique combination of qualities that make him an excellent attorney. He is a younger lawyer in comparison to many of the veterans in the area, but his expertise speaks through shrewd discernment, both in and outside the courtroom.\n\nIn retrospect, I know that employing a professional, well-versed attorney who gave honest legal advice was a valuable asset to me. My case only involved family law, but I would recommend Sam Bone in every area that he practices. My children and I are thankful for the Bone Law Firm.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a3c1ebee7a0d1:0x403ca2131c0a695b"}

Just today, our order was issued. Once again, his hard work and character and one of a kind skill prevailed. I still have sole custody and I am assured a meaningful relationship with the most important thing in my life. I can never repay Jim for his decade long dedication to making sure we're protected.

We chose Tim since he was  a member of our legal plan to represent us in a civil case. After telling us that the plan would not cover our case, we paid Tim a $2500 retainer. During this time Tim would be proactive and mail us copies of whatever documents he would send or file with the courts. I looked over our legal plan and found that his charges should have, in fact, been covered by our plan.Our legal plan's counse determined that this was so and advised Tim of the same. Since being notified that his time would be covered by the plan and  to not use my retainer for covered charges, I stopped getting any correspondence from his office. No copies of any documents,  no phone calls, no more updates, nothing. Tim never even told us that there was a hearing for summary judgement. The  only reason we found out was from a copy of the order from the  court, itself.  After the hearing, we found out that Tim didn't even argue our case as we had discussed. We eventually lost our case. Tim didn't even bother to notify us until over a week later. When asked about our options, Tim determined that he no longer wanted to represent us and referred us to another attorney who wouldn't even return our calls. When asked about the refund of the $2500 retainer, Tim put us off for over 6 weeks until he finally acknowledged he was trying to \"come up\" with the money. Our legal plan counsel had also been contacting him to return our retainer without further delay. Throughout this time and during our case Tim would never initiate contact with us. We had to initiate contact with him. Even then, it would take anywhere from a week and a half to a month before he would respond.  Tim eventually decided after 46 days that he was no longer going to refund our money despite knowing that his charges were covered by our plan. I have yet to get a breakdown of how my retainer was spent, much less anything else. I would never refer him to anyone. Now he is running for circuit court judge. If Tim is representative of our judicial and legal system, then we, as citizens, have very little when it comes to faith in our legal system.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889227564f164c7:0x27248d728f74b2d4"}

I needed an lawyer back in November 2010 after I was involved in a car accident on my job. I found THIRY & CADDELL, LLP on the internet on a Saturday night.  They actually reach out to me that Sunday morning. I had a face to face meeting with Mr. Richard Thiry the following Monday. Mr. Richard went above and beyond my expectations. He was very passionate about his clients and it shows in his work and spirit. The legal process was easy and stress free, I was very informed throughout the whole process by Mr. Richard and his team, and I felt at ease asking any questions I had. Richard Thiry was very diligent and got me a settlement quickly. Fast forwarding on June 14,2018 I was again involved in another car accident on the job after only been employed 2 days. I immediately reach out to THIRY & CADDELL, LLP. Mr. Richard no longer practice law because he had retired but his daughter Renee Thiry also is a lawyer there.  First, I'd like to say THANK YOU to Renee Thiry and the staff. They are very professional, personable and very helpful team.  Renee always keeps her word and came through for me when I needed her most. I hired Renee for my workers comp and personal injury suit.  Renee always made me feel that she had things under control and was on top of the case. My job terminate me after 7 months because of permeant injury due to the car accident. She help me get my unemployment to help me out until my case was settle. As a single mom with two kids it help out A LOT. My workers comp case has now been settled and i am so relieved and will be forever grateful. I know that she is also going to do a great job with my personal injury case as well. I honestly don't know what I would do without them. If you want the best then you definitely want to hire Renee Thiry.  I cannot thank her enough for all she is doing for me. I don't believe any lawyer could have done any better, that's why I truly believe they are the Best!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4e0ca3cc162f:0x4a8dd40058aae01e"}

First, after we settled with Mom on visitation and ect.. we got the paper work and she had omitted an entire year of child visitation, she filed to have it corrected and filed it wrong, then we discovered she omitted another VERY important agreement that was made between them. I emailed her about it and she told me to email the Mom's attorney (unprofessional), I did so and copied her. A few days past and I never heard anything back so I emailed her again, she then told me it was not on the agreement made between them and sent the paper work I had sent her and the Mom's attorney. I told her I was confused, it was at the bottom right of the 2nd page, to which she replied oh I see now-ok, I will get an amendment filed. The next day, I asked her if she had reached out to Mom's attorney and she replied: Respectfully, there is no need to send ongoing emails, she said she would only communicate with my son going forward. She never even said she was sorry for messing up the papers 3 separate times. When we hired her, I explained that we knew we were not her only clients but this was very important to us. At first things seemed ok but once I paid the final bill and we discovered she left stuff out of the papers her attitude changed. When you make a mistake you apologize for the mistake and correct it, not make the client feel guilty for asking for it to be corrected.In addition to all of this, we were having my son added to the birth certificate, Margret told us to give it 2 months after the judge signed off on it and we could just get a copy at the Health Dept, when my son went to get it Vital Records had the birth certificate on hold because \"our attorney\" did not pay the $49.50 fee to have it changed nor were we EVER told about the fee. It took him 3 hours to get it straightened out. I would NOT recommend her to ANYONE. Respect goes both ways. When we met with her, I told her I knew we were not her only clients but this was VERY important to us.

While my charges were from 2017, I was not arrested until 2019 because I was sent to the hospital on the date of the offense instead of jail and diagnosed with Sudden Traumatic Shock exasperated by alcohol.  Being arrested was completely out of the norm for me.  I did not know where to begin, what to expect, and was consistently imagining the worst possible outcomes and scenarios.  Based off my charges, my bail agent highly recommended that I contact Mr. Crumbly for counsel.  I had an initial meeting with Mr. Crumbly within a week from the first time I contacted him.  The initial meeting did not take longer then an hour and during that time Mr. Crumbly was able to explain all my available options to include representation options, payment options, court expectations, and expected timelines.  Perhaps the most beneficial thing Mr. Crumbly discussed in the initial meeting was the overall stress of the situation.  He told me that it was human nature to imagine the worst possible outcomes and to not worry about that as it was him and his teams job to make sure those outcomes don\u2019t happen.  He was absolutely right and ,during the entire course of my case, I constantly imagined the worst possible scenarios; however, I always made myself think back to that initial conversation with Mr. Crumbly and remembered that is why he is there.  After that initial meeting, Mr. Crumbly and his team handled everything for 6 months up until my court date with the Judge.  Before I even had to go before the Judge, Mr. Crumbly had secured a deal with the DA for me to enter the Pre-Trial Intervention Program (PTIP) and have charges dropped following the completion of the program.  I was more than happy to enter PTIP as it took all uncertainty and stress off the table and I was able to hold everything going forward in my own hands.  As of May 2020, I have successfully completed the PTIP program and am currently working with Mr. Crumbly on having my charges expunged.  I am very pleased with the services I have received from Mr. Crumbly and his team and would highly recommend them.

This led to several serious concerns I had as to what negative impacts this DUI might have regarding maintaining my current place of employment, a valid Alabama Driver\u2019s License, and the potential for increased auto insurance rates. In addition, I was uninformed of all the specific issues pertaining to Alabama State Law as they apply to a DUI charge especially, with respect to possible fines, imprisonment, unknown future adverse impacts, or establishment of an unfavorable permanent criminal history. The level of stress in my daily life was extremely high, to say the least, due to this situation and these concerns.\n\nI was referred to the Law Office(s) of Russell W. Crumbley to try and sort all these issues out. Russell put me immediately at ease and clarified for me, in a no-nonsense way, what needed to be done to effectively address the DUI charge against me. He also kept me informed as to the current status of my case as it made its way through the Alabama judicial process and provided reassuring personal representation at any and all court scheduled hearings or appointments. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND retaining Russell as your DUI Attorney should you ever find yourself in a similar situation. He is a completely knowledgeable and competent attorney in the area of Alabama DUI Criminal Law and you can rest assured that he will obtain the best possible outcome regarding your case.\n\nSincerely Yours-\n\nGreg Kaltz\n\nP.S. \u2013 Due to Russell\u2019s expertise, he obtained a DISMISSAL of the DUI charges against me!

When I explained I was busy I was asked if I would speak with him over the phone. I agreed and I was transfered to Mr. Crumbley.  After listening to me explain my why I left the review and my account of my interactions with Mr. Matt Wisda, Mr. Crumbley asked me several questions.\n1. Would I consider removing my review?\n2. Would I consider moving it to Mr. Wisda\u2019s webpage?\n3. If he (Crumbley) were to fire Mr. Wisda would I then delete my review! I said no.\n4. Was there ANYTHING he (Crumbley) could say or do that would result in me removing the review? To which I responded \u201cNot ethically\u201d, because I felt he was trying to \u201clead me\u201d into asking for a monetary resolution.\n\nDuring our discussion Mr. Crumbley stated he was not at all happy about Mr. Wisda\u2019s conduct. And that he was considering actions (including termination).  He asked once more if there was anything he could do To get me to retract the review against \u201cCrumbley, Blackwell, & Wisda Lawfirm\u201d.  I explained to him that when I researched Divorce Attorneys/Firms I based my decision in part on the reviews of his Firms website and information regarding the lawyers and therefore would not consider removing the review. We said goodbye and I hung up.\n\nI spent that day wondering if he would call again. I just knew \u201cIT\u201d wasn\u2019t over.\nSo this evening I checked on my review out of curiosity...and wouldn\u2019t you know it there is this long drawn out explanation that it was I who was misinformed etc.  Never once mentioning any unethical behavior on behalf of Mr. Wisda!\nI want to SHOUT from the highest rooftops what a sleazy slimeball you are! Shall I post more? Shall I post information Mr. Wisda freely disclosed to me about a clearly VERY SENSITIVE divorce and custody battle where the children involved had been...!\nYou disgust me!\n\nI retained Matt Wisda to represent me for my divorce.  I feel he acted unethically.\nI contacted his office after receiving an invoice for services that were not rendered. When I followed up with an appointment a few days later not only did he begin by talking about another case he had been working on (this was the 2nd time he mentioned details of this other party's case!) but he also presented me with an official Settlement Agreement\" that clearly stated me and my spouse had both agreed to - WHICH NEITHER OF US HAD!\n\nWe never went through discovery at all! No mediation - nothing!\nThe entire document looked copy and pasted, and all of the assets and then some were to be awarded to me!\n\nMr. Wisda was trying to fool me into thinking he had been hard at work on my case and that I was entitled to everything when in fact he hadn't done anything. Additionally It was never my intention to try take my husband to the proverbial cleaners. I just wanted a fair settlement.\n\nI didn't even look at the \"Settlement Agreement\" he'd drawn up while at his office. I had already decided to sever our business agreement and told him so.  I asked when I could pick up my remaining retainer and he said it would be about a week.\n\nWhen I went to pick up the monies, enclosed with my check was an invoice of almost $700 for the bogus \"Settlement Agreement\" that had been drawn up without consultation or discovery.  Coincidentally the new invoice showed just one line item for the preparing of said agreement which was dated after the phone call I mentioned above.\n\nI immediately drew up a letter refusing to pay and insisting I be refunded.  Additionally in the letter I called him out for trying to fool me and get paid for it. I emailed this letter and received a response early the next morning stating they would immediately refund the that money, which they did.\n\nI am leaving this review to make others aware.  In our consultation meeting he told me his practice \"is like a game to me.\"  And because  conducting his business in such a way, I feel, is an abuse of his power as an attorney and is extremely unethical.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1528493792927, "text": "We deeply regret that your experience with our office did not meet your expectation. We work very hard to not let that happen. Having said that, you say that you received a \u201csettlement agreement\u201d that indicated you and your husband had agreed to the settlement terms when, in fact, you had not agreed. You also say that this agreement was put together without doing any \u201cdiscovery\u201d or any \u201cmediation\u201d. You initially hired Mr. Wisda to assist you in negotiating an uncontested divorce with your husband\u2019s lawyer. In fact, you produced, for us, a \u201csettlement agreement\u201d created by your husband\u2019s lawyer when you hired Mr. Wisda. That settlement agreement had already been prepared absent any \u201cdiscovery\u201d or attempt to \u201cmediate\u201d. It was clearly the intentions of both parties (and their lawyers) to settle this matter, if possible, without costly litigation. This type divorce typically does not involve \u201cdiscovery\u201d (in the traditional sense) and most certainly doesn\u2019t involve \u201cmediation\u201d. In these type matters we simply go with settlement negotiations to the extent we are able, which necessarily includes \u201csettlement proposals\u201d. Also, in this type situation, both parties tend to agree that they know what the assets are and their values are not in dispute.\n\nThe \u201csettlement agreement\u201d your husband\u2019s attorney prepared, and gave you, was just like the one Mr. Wisda gave you. In reviewing your husband\u2019s proposal it is noted that it also includes language stating that the two of you \u201cacknowledged and agreed\u201d to things that you had not already agreed upon. In other words, both lawyers settlement agreements included the very same language in that regard. In fact, most paragraphs in all settlement agreements are full of language such as \u201cthe parties acknowledge and agree \u2026\u201d. This language is included to satisfy legal requirements and applies to you ONLY AFTER you have actually read it, agreed to it and signed it. It is not intended to mean that you have already seen it and agreed to it. And, it is NEVER INTENDED to deceive. Your attorney, Matt Wisda, did exactly what your husband\u2019s lawyer did with respect to that language.\n\nAs far as the \u201cattempt to fool you\u201d is concerned: you received an itemized statement of the charges. You received two billing statements. The second of those two seems to be where you objected. That statement involves the \u201csettlement agreement\u201d. You were dissatisfied with that charge and objected to that bill and, although you had NOT notified him of your desire to terminate him until after that work was done, we refunded every penny to you of that part of the bill. And your objection, as much as any we can tell, is founded on your belief that it included the \u201cbogus\u201d settlement language indicating that you and your husband had agreed to the terms that you had not agreed to.\n\nWe strive to handle cases the way our clients direct us. And, while the services you received were not satisfactory to you, Mr. Wisda DID NOT bill you for services not rendered. His conduct was not unethical. His ability to communicate effectively with you, I will agree, must have missed the mark. For example, we are not sure how, exactly, you did not understand that the \u201cacknowledged and agreed\u201d language in the settlement agreement did not mean you had both already agreed to that agreement. That was no more the intent of what Mr. Wisda provided you than it was the intent of what your husband\u2019s attorney provided him. It was merely two lawyers doing their jobs and adding the language that was going to be necessary at some point, in advance. Perhaps THAT is why it looked copied and pasted.\n\nWe would encourage ANYONE who is dissatisfied in ANY way, with ANYONE in our office, to meet with any of us. WE ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE to meet with that person and do everything we can to alleviate their concern and fight for your cause. Your case matters to us. And, YOU matter to us. Best wishes moving forward during this trying time.\n\n~ Russell Crumbley & Matt Wisda"}, "gmap_id": "0x886214b5eb6aa54b:0x60d777fdf93ee41a"}

Mr. Crumbley is the most exceptional, top notch attorney in the area and will exceed your expectations each and every time under his representation. He has represented me on 4 separate cases (3 misdemeanor and 1 felony) and has impressed me more and more each time with his results with all 4 of the cases being dismissed with NOT GUILTY verdicts when I was very GUILTY as a matter of fact. As soon as he walks in the courtroom you should know that you will be taken care of. This mans representation is like the results of having the combination of Peyton Manning in the regular season and Tom Brady in the playoffs which in other words is about as good as is gets when in comes to criminal defense representation. I honestly do not have enough words or ways that I can use to describe how high level of an attorney he is and worth every dollar of the premium cost to afford him to represent you because you get what you pay for so you won\u2019t be disappointed no matter how guilty you are of your charges. Don\u2019t hesitate to call his office as they are more than happy to assist you with whatever questions or concerns you may have in regards to your case. Mr. Crumbley is hands down the best attorney in our area for any criminal matters. Do yourself a favor and make sure you hire him to take care of yourself because I\u2019d honestly be hesitant to have anybody else to represent me in a potential criminal defense situation besides Mr. Crumbley. To Teles Walker, you won\u2019t find a better attorney or receive a better result than having Mr. Crumbley by your side and am sure you received a contract as Mr. Crumbley is always sure to provide one so everyone out there should disregard any negative reviews because those folks are more than likely either trolls or generally unhappy with their own lives and you can tell the literacy of the individual by reading their review from a grammatical standpoint. To the rest of the folks out there, be sure to disregard the ignorant individuals reviews as that is a false representation of Mr. Crumbleys services. As GUILTY as any individual may be, I can guarantee that you will receive the best possible legal result with Mr. Crumbley by your side and I say that with no doubt in mind. There is a good reason as to why you see his billboards all around our area and it\u2019s for his consistently exceptional results.

I have fought for clients for 21 years but, as far as I know, this is the first time a client has fought for me. I never really thought about clients reading other people's reviews before they write their own but I guess they do. I think you were more upset than I was. But, I have learned over the years that people see things, view things, expect things and interpret things differently from each other. As they say: \"one man's trash is another man's treasure\". EVERYTHING must be ALWAYS viewed with the proper perspective. I appreciate your strong, heartfelt words but they weren't necessary. We take cases all across the board and that includes cases that are very difficult and filled with a multitude of considerations, possibilities and opportunities - even for failure. Sometimes the absolute best outcome still falls short of the perfect outcome. I think most people understand that. Having said that, God Bless you young man.

I was very nervous about my situation, but within minutes he had me at ease and feeling confident we would win this case. During our meeting, Mr. Crumbley was very professional and knowledgeable and easy to talk to. I followed his advice and we took the case to a jury trial in the higher court. We were scheduled court dates several times and each time I went, the court wasn\u2019t able to try the case at that time and would reschedule at a later date. Jump forward 6 years (that\u2019s our court system), and the court finally scheduled a court date. So since it had been 6 years, I had moved a couple of times so the court didn\u2019t have my current address so I was never notified of the new date. Mr. Crumbley still appeared in court on my behalf, he informed the court that he had tried to contact me but was unable to reach me. The court was talking about doing several different things, but Mr. Crumbley kept fighting on my behalf to reach a solution that was in my best interest.

I googled lawyers and FAQs, anything to help me figure out what my first step needed to be. I found Adam Jones and Associates and while looking over their website, a chat popped up asking me if I needed to chat with them. I figured it was some ploy or scam to get my name and number that would lead to a flood of annoying calls, but I decided I had nothing to loose, so I chatted about my situation. It turns out, I was chatting with my future lawyer! That same week I met Niki and as soon as she shook my hand...I knew she was the answer to my prayers. Hands down, an amazing woman and a powerful lawyer. After my divorce, I brought the company I work for to Adam Jones and Associates. I can honestly say, on a personal level with my divorce and on a professional level with the cases I deal with at work, Adam Jones and Associates is my lifetime firm. One chat session lead to one phone call, one hand shake lead to one case, and now they are my lawyer, my family's lawyers, and my company's lawyers. They really do cater to their clients needs. I can not express my support for this firm enough! I remember emailing my lawyer at 3am and she was not only there for me legally, but as a friend as well.

We have also been in the position many times wherein we\u2019ve taken over for another attorney and have been able to finish things relatively quickly due to most of the work already having been done, as it was in your particular situation.  Again, I\u2019m very sorry that the process was made so unnecessarily painful for you by the opposing party. That said, if you ever need support, if we can help you in any other way, or you just want to talk about all of this in more detail, please feel free to call us on our cell phones as we\u2019re always more than happy to answer your call. God bless,  Jennifer"}, "gmap_id": "0x88891b96bb3bf559:0x75ea9f559fa010f1"}

Although you were paying the legal fees for someone else, you were not the client yourself and as such there's a limit to what we were allowed to divulge without express permission from the client. I can say that unless otherwise directed by a client we always seek settlement as a first option to minimize costs and give our client an assured outcome. That said, although we are very proficient at drafting and negotiating settlement proposals, we can't actually force the two sides to agree to them against their will. We do take retainer fees and we do charge for our time which includes things like phone calls and emails; however, these are standard legal fees and discussed upfront with our clients in person and covered in our brief retainer agreement. We are very transparent in the work we do and everything that we bill for.  We work hard to finish our client's cases quickly but some things that are out of our control such as the court's schedule and opposing side's cooperation as well as the details of the case itself can hinder the speed we can complete the job.\nGod bless,\nJennifer G.

Although we\u2019re all human, I personally would not easily excuse or have faith in any attorney that forgot a file even if it didn\u2019t have any outcome on your final case disposition. I have very high standards for myself and anyone that works for me and I can assure you I would have dealt with this former associate had you made me aware at the time. Regardless, I sincerely apologize. Although forgetting a file was totally out of character for him, I hope you can take some solace in the fact that he is no longer with the firm and has not been for over 5 years.  Although many years have passed since your case, you might recall that I was dealing with a life-threatening medical issue when you hired the firm and was not able to take your case on myself and thus the reason you used my associate at that time.  As far as multiple attorneys are concerned, I assume you are referring to our collaborative approach to law. We often have a primary and second chair attorney on a case working together. While this doesn\u2019t affect the overall cost of your case, the benefits to you can be immense. For instance, though all our attorneys are great we will use each attorney\u2019s greatest strengths to your advantage, so if someone is a better writer or researcher they might be assigned to that portion of your case. In addition, when it comes time to strategize on your case, instead of one attorney coming up with a strategy, you might have three or four working out the best strategy though you will only get billed for the time of one. In effect, you get the knowledge and expertise of multiple full-time family law attorneys for the price of one. This is something most firms can\u2019t offer. I apologize if this process wasn\u2019t clearly explained at the outset of your retaining of the firm. I will make sure that going forward we outline the process in writing to make it easier for clients to understand. Thank you again for your input, if you\u2019d ever like to talk about this in further detail my office door is always open and my phone on."}, "gmap_id": "0x88891b96bb3bf559:0x75ea9f559fa010f1"}

The firm had to postpone my last court date because my attorney had another client that had a case to carry over from the previous week. When I questioned Mrs. Rose about hiring a new attorney and putting her on my case she told me I hired the Rose Law Firm not her.

You are charged for each email to and from as .10 of an hour unless there is an attachment and then it is .20. If you have a meeting scheduled and they have to cancel then you are charged for them to call and tell you. You are charged for them to park for court. Over a year and a half and all that has been done is cases postponed, deposition, emails, phone calls, 4 or 5 subpoenas, and a temporary order  that had to let my son live with his mother until another court date could be scheduled and I promise people would not believe what  I have paid for this service.

I can appreciate how that made your wait that much more frustrating. In this situation it was the last day before Christmas break and one of the two attorneys that were due to be in office that day had to leave as her child became ill. The remaining attorney decided that instead of cancelling client consults and making them wait another week until the holiday break ended that she could meet with every consult herself. She was on schedule until a current client called her at the end of the day with an unexpected emergency issue that she had to be handle before the courts closed for Christmas. She took care of this client's issue as quickly as possible but this still put her about 30 minutes behind for your consult.

False advertisement Really!! My true story: My now ex husband and I went through a chaotic divorce and his lawyer was Mr. McGhee. My experience is based on what I dealt with in phone and email conversations as well as what was told to me by my ex husband and McGhee's  Secretary and how the divorce was handled. First Mr. Mcghee, does not like to speak to people that are \"Pro Se\" (representing yourself) so even though you worked for over 10 years in the law field as a paralegal and you can easily save your money by doing the settlement and divorce yourself, Shawn McGhee will make sure to give you a hard time. Not only does he lie and says there is a conflict of interest, which is why he won't speak to you which by the way, THAT IS NOT TRUE, but he will not answer any of the calls. For whatever reason he was not able to speak to me which to me seems very unprofessional, he would often have his secretary let me know what was needed for the divorce to be settled. I think because I do know what I needed to do legally, and trust me lawyers hate people that have worked in law fields you cant pull a sheet over legal assistants or paralegals eyes easily, we know all the tricks.  Now his secretary had given me some information that had holes in what she said that included the discovery process and hearings as well as the laws. Because of the communication between me and her and then what she told my ex husband of what I said, which were twisted, this made the divorce messy and long . And I believe the reason was for trial which is very expensive, but lawyers love expensive. Now one thing which is grounds for a grievance is that Mr. McGhee gave advice on the amount of payments for child support that should be paid which is unethical and should only be done by a referee. Mr. Mcghee, has no compassion for children as he informs his clients that they don't need to be responsible parents and pay for the kids until a judge says so, which to me makes me wonder about his character. Being out of state I was not able to do much, and my ex did not even live in Alabama as law requires in order to file but as usual somehow McGhee got around that. I have worked for law firms since I was 16 years old I could never work for someone that does things that are unethical, shady and down right wrong  he has no moral character, and I would be scared if my papers would be questioned by a judge with the amount of lies that my ex and his lawyer gave to me.  Please look at other Law firms that will look at your case and care enough to not control your decisions and won't run up your bill for no reason. Me and my ex husband  managed to settle together without the hearsay talk of his lawyer. The issue I have is there are amazing lawyers out there and Mr. Mcghee is the reason that lawyers have such a bad reputation. Make sure you chose a lawyer that will care about your interests and especially the kids, don't let the kids get lost in the divorce they are the most important thing, don't let the lawyer stress you or the other party or you will cause more harm and extend something that is not good for anyone.

Involved in a case that had never been before the Alabama Courts, we had no idea if we should fight or roll over and (pay)dead.  I am far from being a quitter but sometimes you feel that there is nothing or no one that can help you and the ones you care for. Sometimes it seems that the Justice system is anything but just. This is exactly how we felt all the way up to our final hearing. We new we were going to need an intelligent and thorough attorney. We researched and asked people who we should use and was referred to Mark. We went and talked with him and he took our case, but told us he couldn't promise anything. He told us that he would do the best he could, and that was all we could ask for. We just wanted what was fair and felt it was worth the fight. After trying to go to court without an attorney and seeing how that was going we just knew we had to have representation. Our finances were extremely tight and we worried that it might just all be for naught. It seemed the law just didn't have anything to protect us. Mark Gober searched and searched and found cases in several other states that supported our side, and gave us some hope. Still we were concerned that it could go either way. We even were concerned that the truth was not going to come out because everyone kept saying that it was all irrelevant. Even with all of the negative things we were hearing  we stuck it out and kept fighting because we felt that it mattered. We wanted our case to maybe help someone else in the future. Mark surpassed anything that we could have expected when we got in the courtroom for our final hearing. We were amazed by how thorough he was without even having to bring every detail into it (which could have taken a lot more time and cost us a whole lot more money). I could not believe it when he actually got them to admit things on the stand that showed exactly what was going on. Justice was truly done as much as it could possibly be thanks to Mark. This was a case for me of right vs. wrong and the good won out. Thank you so much for all that you have done for our family.
