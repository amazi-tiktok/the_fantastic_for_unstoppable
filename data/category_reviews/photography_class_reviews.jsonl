I contacted her over two months before my baby would arrive, to see if scheduling would work for a newborn shoot. She responded with an email of her package pricing and the services provided. My wife and I felt we could work with her, so I replied letting her know the package we wanted, and if she would be able to also do the maternity shoot for my wife. I made attempts to contact her via phone for a conversation to fully understand her process, and communicate what we were looking for. Getting her on the phone was nearly impossible. The failed attempts were due to her workshop held in Canada in late April. I made additional calls, with no success, and no capability of leaving a voicemail, as hers was full. My only other option was to send another email. She replied a few days later in between her workshop with one available day in May for the maternity shoot. She did say it would be difficult to fit my wife in for the maternity, but would try. My wife and I initially agreed to the date, and Amy sent an email with an invoice. Throughout this whole interaction, no phone conversation took place. I paid for the maternity shoot in full since the date was about 3 weeks out, and placed a deposit for the newborn shoot. I did this to make sure we could get on her calendar, despite still not talking with her. After I paid her, I still was not able to make contact to coordinate the maternity shoot. I also made her aware that we live in the metro Atlanta area, and would be driving to her. Due to the lack of communication, and not being familiar with the Auburn area, her studio, caused my wife and I to cancel. Again, not being able to get her on the phone to communicate this, I texted her to about a week and a half prior to the maternity shoot to cancel. I asked if the balance I paid could be moved to a larger newborn package, and she was pleased to do so. Fast forward to June 14, I contacted her to let her know the exact date our baby would be born, understanding that we would finally have a phone conversation. Still no success on that front. She responds with one date for the newborn shoot that did not work for my wife and I. I then asked if she would be able to do the shoot on a different day, and that too did not work for my wife and I. It wasn't until I sent her an email letting her know I wanted to cancel everything was when we finally spoke on the phone. I let her know I wanted all my money back and explained the reasons why. She offered no apology, no option, only another date, that still did not work. Her only response was to take it up with PayPal, so I did. I never write reviews of this length, or do review at all, but Amy brought this on herself. She texted me 3:50 AM, then again at 5:03 AM, clearly upset about the outcome of the PayPal dispute. If she did not decide to harass me, and move on, I would have done so as well. There is always 2 sides to a story. I disclosed everything to PayPal, also citing that I was not provided any contract, offered three dates, that did not work, and minimal communication from Amy. Writing all of this took time I did not want to give do so, but having worked with multiple business owners and professionals from different industries, Amy lacks attributes of a business owner. Primarily that of being ethical. Doing research provided me insight on what Amy's true passion is, and that is holding workshops. He lack of availability is due to the abundance of workshops she is scheduled to hold. If she disclosed this material information to me from the very beginning, I would have made the decision to work with her or not. There are so many workshops planned for the remainder of this year, as well as 2020, both domestically and internationally. It's also clear that workshops are her passion, when 100% of her positive 5 star reviews are from workshop attendees. Amy I truly hope you use this as a learning opportunity to improve your business model, and just stick to doing workshops, or fully disclose how you work.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1561641320879, "text": "This gentleman sent red flags from the very beginning so having a phone conversation with him was definitely out of the question. I knew I needed a paper trail to have proof of our conversations via email and text messages. I\u2019m so grateful I have the documents that I\u2019ve sent to PayPal. I was more than professional and when he cancelled his maternity session I was more than happy to let him transfer that money to his newborn session. This is after sending pictures of all of my maternity gowns and giving him several dates for his maternity session. They simply didn\u2019t want to make the trip to Auburn. I was more than flexible by giving him 3 available dates for the newborn session. Baby hasn\u2019t even been born yet! His assumptions about workshops are false. My family will be on vacation on the exact date that he wanted which is why I always advise my clients that we both remain flexible because we never know when babies are going to make their appearance into the world. My passions are my own family and newborn photography.  Workshops are how I put food on the table. I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t speak to this guy in the beginning because I wouldn\u2019t have all the documentation of our many emails and text messages to prove how above and beyond I went for him.
