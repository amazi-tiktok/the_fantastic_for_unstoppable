I tried our primary care provider first who didn\u2019t have any openings that afternoon and upon their referral I called Urgent Care for Children on 280.  I was informed I could be a walk in our schedule an appointment time online so I opted to schedule a time because general that means you don\u2019t have to wait as long.  I arrived for my daughter\u2019s appointment early to complete any necessary paperwork since we\u2019d not been there before.  I signed in told reception we had an appointment he looked and confirmed but then said this: \u201cI know you have an appointment but....\u201d. Wait what?  Why would you say that to a mom, who took the time to fill the forms in online and make an appointment?  \u201cI know you have an appointment but\u201d there is a walk in, \ud83e\udd14 yes there is but I made an appointment for which I showed up on time.  So NO, it is not acceptable to say this to a mom and who has a kid with fever in your waiting room with who know what the others in the waiting room have.  We are in the middle of flu season and multiple other viruses and I made an appointment and those with an appointment come first especially when I walked in at the same time as said \u201cwalk-ins\u201d.  Needless to say he was not apologetic for dismissing the fact I called ahead and made an appointment and came at that time.  And for that I would give 1 \u2b50\ufe0f, the nurse and Nurse practitioner were what drove the rating up.  They were pleasant and helpful, my daughter thankfully only had a virus so we didn\u2019t end up with meds and thankfully nothing else she may have been exposed to by not being taken back when she should have been.  But that\u2019s my rating for all it\u2019s worth.

It was so wonderful to find an urgent care facility that is strictly for children! Many ER\u2019s are ill equipped to deal with children so it was so reassuring to know we\u2019d be seeing a Dr whose primary focus was pediatrics. The waiting room was very clean & colorful, it had two big screen TVs with children\u2019s programs playing, smaller tables and chairs for the children, and well lit with large windows. The receptionist was extremely helpful and kind (which is rare these days) and answered each and every question I had enthusiastically,and not as though I was an intrusion on her time. She offered a pack of goldfish crackers and Gatorade to my grandson & I noticed many other varieties of snacks and even pedia-Light that was available for the waiting patients. Including check in, paperwork, & waiting to be seen we sat maybe 15 minutes total. An added plus was they informed us that my grandsons records for his visit that day would be faxed to his regular pediatrician in our hometown so they\u2019d be aware of his visit. The nurse who called us back and took vitals was very kind and gentle and listened to all our concerns without interrupting. The physician we saw was very informative and thorough and answered each and every question slowly and completely. They have a lab on site so we were able to confirm, during our visit, that he had the flu. It was very nice that all paperwork and co-pays were done beforehand so we could leave immediately following the examination. I highly recommend this facility and hope they continue to offer the same service in the future. I\u2019m very thankful to know they are there as I visit the area quite often.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1515032453744, "text": "Thanks for the review and thank you for choosing Urgent Care for Children."}, "gmap_id": "0x888917ae78be94c9:0xad8267a044a80fac"}

She came back and got us checked in. We waited to be called back. Once we were  called back we sat in the exam room for over an hour. No one ever came back to check on us. I stuck my head out the door to see the nurse/front desk receptionist had left to get what look like a prescription & was just returning. She told us the physician would be in shortly, but that never happened. We ended up leaving without being seen. Common courtesy is everything. If a patient has been waiting for awhile it doesn't hurt to check in on them from time time.
