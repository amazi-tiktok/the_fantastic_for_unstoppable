While checking out she says \"oh yeah\" or something of the sort. She walks away, comes back with cup while telling me I'd left it. Glad she cleared that up cause home invasion had popped in my mind. It is a Cars cup after all. I apologize to Trussville PD explaining false alarm and hang up. That's a joke, they have me blocked. Anyway, I thank her a bunch, tell her how happy I am to have it, 4yo says \"thank you\" cause he should. I'll allow note taking just this once. We leave, I hear something fall off car.

Lol , not surprised.  It pisses me off, though, how these employees... @ the Shell/Circle k store#:21569 in Theodore...& I'm talking about  the ones @ this store ONLY, especially the older brown lady that worked on the night of thursday Nov 1st 2018 , is the worst of them all, bc many times, in line, I've witnessed her, and other employees, show their ridiculously rude attitude, being completely unprofessional..& they all have their jobs still!!??? I mean the position requires top notch customer service...actually, I'm lying,  it doesn't even require \"good customer service\", bc customer service doesn't take much effort at all!! If you are even the slightest bit capable to understand how to smile, respond to a question with that smile, and be available to do YOUR job, like YOU were hired to do when YOU APPLIED (no one asked you to apply for the position...especially when you are not capable to atleast do those extremely simple things/requirements), then, anyone, who is anyone, can work in customer service if they allow themselves to be genuine. Anyone will easily  outshine  the current employees. As well as, a difference in profits will most likely  be seen, bc these current employees obviously are  not fit one bit due to their lack of simple professionalism.  As long as ive lived here, in Theodore, I've only come across 2 girls that are not part of the problem. 1 of the 2 girls still wrk there,  and she was working on the 1st as well but she was off by 8pm. The gas station could be a 5 star, but the ppl chosen to be the face of your location, are far from great choices.. unfortunately !! if it's employees weren't so extremely rude, lazy, and unprofessional & theyd look at you like you're literally stupid because you asked a question they don't feel like responding to, like you're interrupting their damn day!. Anyway,  it's almost like it's always been the gas station that's known for hiring the same type of wrong ppl, that carry themselves very unprofessional bc they just don't care!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb52c75736c01:0x4ca6007283e7edec"}
