Shortly after entering the building I was greeted by a congregant who made me feel comfortable and right at home. The congregant immediately  realized I was new and introdiced themselves and let me know I was welcome! As I entered the sanctuary the service was already in progress, however congregants still took a moment,smiled, and wished me a \"Shabbat Shalom.\"  After the service congregants went out of their way to introduce themselves. I can go on and on! The congregant deserve more than 5 stars however that is the maze number of stars allowed!!
