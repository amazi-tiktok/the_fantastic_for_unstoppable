Don't miss the Puppets and the petting zoo, but watch out for baby camel bc he likes to snuggle! We suggest buying the ride pass for $25 and just ride everything until you get dizzy and fall down. The parking is very close  to the entrance, it was clean, the rides were in great condition, people were friendly given the heat, not once did we feel unsafe!  Plenty of \"fair\" food available!
