Things are different today than they were before and you have to watch your children more closely. Please do not leave your child alone with anyone that you dont know, even if its a dentist or doctor! To add to this, this dentist said 3 of my children had cavities and that 1 even needed root canals. I could not see the cavities so I took my children to Dr. Hypes and NONE of my 4 children need fillings ESPECIALLY not my 3 year old!
