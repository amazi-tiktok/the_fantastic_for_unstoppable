He prescribed me the most expensive nasal spray on the market and sent me on my way. I suffered for a while and just tried to take different allergy medicines. I then started having more frequent vertigo attacks. A year later I decided something must be going on and asked to be referred to a different ENT.\n\nI have now been diagnosed with Meniere's Disease. In the beginning of the disease there is a period of fluctuating hearing loss. If caught in time there is a chance to save the patients hearing.

He was very casual and treated me like a hypochondriac. We rely on doctors with \"specialties\" to be able to help us when things go wrong.
