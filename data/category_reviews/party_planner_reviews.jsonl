I brought my girlfriend here to partake in splatter painting as one of our anniversary activities. The reservation process was quick and effortless on their website. You walk in and have your temp taken, you're given a squirt of sanitizer for your hands and then you sign your waiver if you did not already complete this step online. After completing the waiver a super friendly employee directed us to a table that had been set up with a cute anniversary sign, decorations, chocolate, champagne and our blank canvas. We were then able to add designs with tape that would be peeled off post splatter painting while enjoying our glass of champagne. Once we finished our champagne, part 2 of the fun began. We were taken to the splatter paint room where we put on our protective wear over our clothes, shoe protectors and goggles. While an employee went over the basics, we were given a bluetooth speaker to play music,  they exited, turned off the lights, we blasted our music and the anniversary paint party began! You reserve the room for an hour so you can splatter till you can't splatter anymore. Once finished, one of the owners came in to grab our masterpiece to place on the table to have the tape peeled off and allow it to dry a little. We took off all protective gear, wiped what little paint got on our faces off and decided to sit at their cute bar station to have a couple margaritas and a beer. They have a decent selection of snacks and drinks. The strawberry margaritas were sooooo good. You can easily kill some time while your paint is trying to dry. My girlfriend and I got the pleasure of meeting and speaking to the owners who happen to be husband and wife. They were nothing short of a delight! Wonderful personalities, warm and welcoming. They informed us about their various craft classes that another group was doing. This particular group was making candles and they let us know what a great and fun experience they had. My girlfriend and I will certainly be back to try one of the crafts out. If you're looking for something fun and different,  come here. The owners deserve all of Bham's business! Can't wait to return. Thank you all for such an amazing experience!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888917b632a9ec61:0x6a33f26353436292"}

All the plates (while small compared to the high priced) were creative, well presented, and delicious.  This is a tapas place, meaning you should expect small amounts of food that are a little overpriced.  The stuffed mushrooms, while great, maybe leaned into this idea a little too much.\n\nNow to the cocktails.  The PB&J drink was surprisingly one of the best cocktails I've had.  The other drinks I had were above average for the area and price.\n\nThis place is new and definitely worth a visit or two.  The location is great and easy to get to from the highway, but the parking lot is absolutely terrible.\n\nCome here if you need a break from the 10,000 \"look how unique we are\" hipster breweries around town.

I sometimes like to sit and grab a bite between classes. The food is bit bland, but I have never had any problems with my order. One day I did and was treated horribly for the complaint. I ordered the Camile club with no mayo. When I received my sandwich, it had mayo. So, I calmly went back up and explained that I didn't want mayo. I was told it could be fixed.\n\nWhile waiting on my sandwich, I noticed the staff watching me and speaking quietly, but I ignored it. 5 minutes later I was called back and when I went to check my sandwich again, I noticed the residue from mayo. It looked as if someone had wiped the mayo off and changed the bread. Again, calmly, I went back up (once again noticing the staff snickering) and asked to speak to the manager for a refund. Said-manager whose name I couldn't get, claimed she was there the whole time they \"remade\" my sandwich and it was fresh. I told her that couldn't be the case because it was now cold, it took her less time to make it than originally and I showed her a piece of lettuce that had mayo in it.\n\nShe then rudely asked me if I still had my receipt, which I did. I was given a refund, but I don't appreciate the way I was treated. If I'm paying for a meal, I expect it to made the way I requested it. I didn't ask them to make me a sandwich befitting God. I just didn't want mayo.  I am never stepping foot into that cafe again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb2afbea10877:0xed45de7077e2373c"}

Even received extra with beverage purchases... the hint providing service was slow. Secondly, before the game started we were informed that the room had a tough lock to open where every group struggled... understandable... we received the hint to open the tough lock but failed to open so we called for assistance. Hilariously enough, even the game master struggled to open the lock... this whole process of opening one, tough lock took approximately 15 minutes\u20141/4 of our game time. With the intention of completing destroying the lock and my foot on the wall, I had to pull that one lock off with all my force after the game master left. But the game master assured that the time would get frozen\u2014cool.\nThirdly, when time was up... the game master does not hesitate to end the entire game by punching in the last code spoiling everything. There was not a single thought in the game master\u2019s mind to ask us whether we desired just a bit more time to crack the room... Game master simply walked in, punched the code, and we all stood there awkwardly, confused, & disappointed.\nWe complained about the lock... their response was there was prior information given before the game\u2014true. We recommended them to please replace it immediately\nWe asked if there was anything that could be done to remedy our dissatisfaction with the room and the fact we paid $200 for one hour to elapse so unfortunately. They informed us that it was up to the owner to perform refunds, but the manager informed us with a possible discount sent through our email. It\u2019s been a week... nothing. Obviously, their customer service skills need to be reevaluated.\nWas a real tragic end to a group\u2019s Friday night honestly.

The 1 min issue you mentioned is a feature where games are no longer bookable within 60 minutes of the start time--this protects us from someone booking the 4:00 room at 3:55 and we're not prepared--once that time has passed the room 'falls off' of the website.  As for you having trouble reaching someone we are rarely in the building during the week (unless a room is booked Wed or Thurs) and we're there answering calls during business hours Fri-Sun when it's busy.  Beyond that we check our voicemails X2 daily and respond to calls as quickly as possible.  We're so glad you enjoyed our rooms and would love to host you again, I recommend email or FB messenger if you don't reach anyone on the landline (if we're there we'll answer!).  Thanks for coming in!"}, "gmap_id": "0x888cf2abcd659339:0xf3ac36f480162009"}
