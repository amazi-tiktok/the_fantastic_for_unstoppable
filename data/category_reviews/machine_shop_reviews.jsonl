NOT TODAY!!! So I did a Google search and came across HESCO, the reviews were great, I spoke with Joe Molina and he arranged to have it tower to HESCO \"DESPITE being in the middle of changing locations\", they got it in checked it out, started it up, \"No white smoke from the tail pipe\", turned out to be the water pump, THAT's ALL. I can't recommend Joe Molina and the guys at HESCO Automotive highly enough, they are highly professional, extremely efficient, keep you informed at every juncture of the process, and very reasonable. I am telling ALL my friends and family to take their vehicles to HESCO Automotive.

This business is very unprofessional and lacks the ability to communicate with their customers. I also feel that I was taken advantage of because I am a woman.

I am not a professional mechanic but I am learning how to do things I used to pay someone else to do.  Jack and his wife are very gracious, kind, and, best of all, patient!  Just the other day, I had to replace a front drive axle on my wife's Subaru.  They had the part in stock and made sure I had all of the small parts needed to correctly do the job.  Jack even answered some novice questions for me.  It really helped me maintain the confidence I needed to get the job done.  And, in case you are wondering, their prices are in line with everyone else and they can get the parts you need if they do not have them in stock.  They also do machine shop work and Jack has a super cool water jet metal cutting machine in the back that he might show you if you are lucky.

I do not have any record of any transaction and we keep great records.

I would be happy to sit down with you and go over what was replaced and what warranty options you have.  Of course this would require this to be a legitimate review that has actually done business with us. Having only 3 reviews all of them one star and hundreds if not thousands of miles apart seems suspicious.
