We had intended to buy dance shoes x 2 and at least one cute dance outfit. We were greeted immediately upon entering the store.  They have a wonderful selection. We mentioned the shoes first and the lady working asked if we were ready to buy them. We hesitated because we hadn't even seen the shoes, nor did we know how the fit and feel would be. She informed us that they don't fit shoes until people are ready to buy. We just didn't know what to say so we took a quick look at the shoes and then turned around and walked out. We just couldn't commit on the spot to buying shoes for a toddler without seeing and trying them on especially since she is between shoe sizes. So disappointing.
