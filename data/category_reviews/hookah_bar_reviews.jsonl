My boyfriend and I had to sit in the rocking chairs off to the side. I didn't mind our seating arrangement cause the chairs were very comfortable. However,after going to the restroom and returning, my chair leaned backwards into the hookah causing the coal to fall into my lap and my boot. Luckily, I was able to remove the coal quickly enough from my lap, but it had embedded deeply enough into my boot that I could not get to it quickly enough. The flames have caused second degree burns on my foot and my ankle. I am not bashing the company. I always have a grand time when I go,but I do feel that as a place with open fires and hazardous equipment the owner/manager should have a first aid kit for accidents such as mine. When i asked the server for some ointment she said they didn't have any. They were kind enough to give me a bag of ice at least. However, I just feel that the situation could've been handled better. After the incident happened and the ice was given my server continued her duties and I had to end my night early to get the proper medical supplies for the burns on my foot. IF YOU INTEND ON GOING HERE BE WARNED NOT TO SIT IN THE ROCKING CHAIRS WHILE SMOKING A HOOKAH OR TELL YOUR SERVER TO SET THE HOOKAH FURTHER AWAY FROM THE CHAIRS. my overall experience and respect for this place has plummeted. Accidents do happen, but with the proper customer service somethings could be looked over.
