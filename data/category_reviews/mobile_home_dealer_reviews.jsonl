I had a terrible experience and I was a 1st time buyer. I was excited to be buying my own new home. That wonderful experience turned into a nightmare. Don't get me wrong the staff was wonderful it was the owner Cliff Davis, everytime I came in asking questions to the sales person I was working with when thing didn't look right he'd always take over and give along speech and side track the original question. They never would give me all the paper work at one time I'd have to keep coming back because there was always something else needing to be signed. He makes it seem like he's helping you out but the whole time he's trying to get you for as much as he can. In the end I was still over charged for my home and I'm sure I was over charged for the dirt pad too. I was suppose to have gotten a discount for my home because it was the display, they charged me the regular price and made it seem like I was getting a discount. Once I finally realized this it was too late the purchasing process had been completed.  When I got my home finally it took forever to get everything finish, I almost lost my house insurance because they took so long to put it up. I called them so many times and sent pictures of repairs that needed to be done. My stove had a huge dent in the back and my floor was messed up from where somebody previously tried to move it. He said he would replace it and they didn't. I wouldn't advice anyone to buy a home from here, if your inexperienced and a 1st time buyer please be careful.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c29b864f5019d:0x800517837663f66"}

We were supposed to get a washer and dryer from them, they tried to con us out of it. We signed a contract that we had to get our own contractor to do the dirt pad.. the owner sent his family member to our house who 1. Did not know the measurements of our trailer, did a horrible job. 2. Just to try to con us out of money and we ended up having to pay another contractor to fix what they messed up.

My wife spent a week (a solid 40 plus hours) trying to satisfy the requirements of the mortgage company. She couldn\u2019t so she called to tell the salesman that we would be unable to purchase the home. He replied with, well send me what you have, I usually deal with them anyway. So the mortgage got approved. I was told by my salesman that he had gotten us approved with no payment for 90 days. One of the guys at the mortgage company actually laughed when I told him I was told 90 days no payment. We go sign papers 4/21 and cannot sign the papers in our home because they have started prepping it for delivery. We had to be out of the house we were renting so ok, this should be quick and easy. We were told a few weeks to MOVE in. It took a month just to deliver a ready home!That was 5/15. We moved in 6/10. I asked the salesman while looking him in the eyes if I would need to arrange to have the power, water, or septic tank connected. His reply to me was \u201cno, we handle all that and it\u2019s financed in\u201d.\nSo Regional sends a man out to make our dirt pad. Supposed to be paid for in the mortgage. Guy says we need 17 loads of dirt and that we will have to either get the dirt or we could pay him around $2000 on top of what Regional was paying him for the pad work. Our lot is not that Unlevel to start with. We hired our own guy who did the pad and supplied the dirt for what Regional was going to pay their guy. They called our guy 4 times a day for a week till it got done. We are then told it was going to be another week before they delivered our home. That week comes and we are told for 5 straight days \u201c it\u2019s gonna be delivered tomorrow, I promise\u201d and it didn\u2019t show till the end of the following week. And my wife drove an hour one way every day to meet them as she was told one of us would need to be there.So we get the septic tank installed and the water meter installed. We call our salesman to let him know and we are told that we have to provide someone to hook that up. So we get power and make the call to get our AC installed. No reply for over a week. We try to reach the general manager and can only leave messages because he is always busy and apparently doesn\u2019t return calls between meeting (or ever). On day 3 of asking for him, the guy says, you keep calling, is there something I can help you with?. So we find out that he is the guy who arranges the AC and underpinning and finish work. He claims he hasn\u2019t been told we had power and were ready for AC install and underpinning but he would get right on it even though three days before my wife had texted the salesman and he said he\u2019d let them know.He called back 3 days later and said he had it set up for Monday. Monday comes and is almost gone so we call him back. He says he doesn\u2019t know where they are and gives us the number to the AC company. They advised us that they had nothing scheduled for us to install. They simply told him they would have the unit in stock on Monday. Now the AC folks did a great job. They had a cancellation and came a day earlier than the appointment they made with us actually. I am about to make my second payment and the house is still not underpinned and we have heard nothing from the manufacturer as to when they are coming to fix all the broken drawers and the screwed up electrical. If you turn off the light outside the laundry room door to the outside, none of the lights in the living room will work.\nLong story I know but I will live in a cardboard box before I buy another home from Regional Mobile Homes in Northport. We are now being told it will be another 2 to 3 weeks before they come do our underpinning. Oh and there is absolutely nothing holding this home to the ground. No straps or anchors. The Alabama Mobile Home  commission  says that it acceptable , but I have never seen a mobile home in Alabama that wasn\u2019t strapped and anchored. They will do the minimum they can do. Not above and beyond like they say on the website. I wish I could give them negative stars.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1597778398373, "text": "Hey David - I\u2019m sorry you were unhappy with the service you received at Regional Homes.

Our sales person, James, was not knowledgeable enough to be on his own yet and got openly angry and upset that we had questions and asked for clarification on important steps. Financial person, Heath, flat out stated that they didnt care about our business because they were busy already. Information about the buying process was not shared up front. And prices 'increase' suspiciously. We even called other companies to check this info and this was not the case. Beware! Buying a home is a HUGE decision that costs a lot of money! these people are not professional and are not trustworthy. Go somewhere else!\n\nThis company will waste your time and are sleazy as grease. dont let them get a hold of your money! We were almost ready to sign with them after months of strained communication and a growing uneasy feeling in my gut, when they threw out some pretty big requirements we were never told about over 6 months of talking and preparing for a real, serious home purchase. contractors were lined up and everything. We were told prices had increased magically per foot in the house the week prior and that it required a 10% deposit on the value of the home before building...we called around to other mobile home sites and they reacted like this was the normal, to get these phone calls about this company, Cumberland Homes. Evidently we are not the first people they have done this to. the other mobile home companies in Alabama STRONGLY cautioned us that no prices had changed due to the annual convention, everything was status quo, and what they are suggesting is an unethical and NOT practiced requirement of a 10% deposit on top of the down payment for your home mortgage. You have been warned, people.\n\n**update in response to company comment**\nno sir, I am simply being thorough in my review. i have not used any \"fictitious name\". i simply left the same review on facebook and google. what my review states is truth. you seem to be having the tantrum because people are responding to my review with similar experiences until you took down the reviews on facebook. Let me be clear. I am not worried about you. I have not given you a second thought. i simply shared my experience to warn others. looks like yall are still stuck on it. interesting. you can speak whatever things that make you sleep better at night.

STOP WASTING MY TIME AND MAKING YOURSELF EVEN LESS PROFESSIONAL. learn from your actions. evidently yall have reputation  that follows your company name. so sad.\n\nAlso, the \"cousin\" you mentioned is aware of everything and has been very cautious with you. he stayed simply because of pricing, not because he was impressed by your business. i hope you treated him better, though! it seems like it.

Yes deposits are required on special order homes that nobody else would ever want if for some reason you can't or don't go through with the purchase is not unreasonable in our opinion.  This is the type of behavior that helped us make a decision not to do business with you and we don't regret that decision by any means.   It seems like the timing of this review is very suspicious since your cousins home will be delivering very soon and they have been very reasonable and great to work with through the whole process and we truly hope they enjoy their new home for many years to come.  We also would like to thank you for referring them to us.  Once their home is delivered we will mail your referral check.   Good luck to you in the future,  best wishes.."}, "gmap_id": "0x88860354a69fb363:0x9dee5470811c1f82"}

That said, who knows - maybe things have changed internally and they'd see this as an opportunity.\n\nA lot of the headache around our purchase (and the subsequent bad review) probably could have been avoided with better communication both internally (within their company) and externally (with contractors they hired and with us).

Good morning, have you been here before? We said no,and was going to say \" we just want to look around\"  and she immediately charged us through to an office, told us to fill out a form so we could see houses. We stated we had seen the houses on line and there was one in particular we wanted see, we were so excited to know there was one locally as we were possibly moving to VA in the near future Then she said, \"well if your not going to buy from Us then Im not showing you any homes, as we have to be here for our customers that are going to buy for us, we have had 7 customers this morning and dont have time for you if your not buying. My jaw hit the floor. My husband ripped up the form and said lets go. I thought for a minute she was joking, but the look on her face was that of disgust for us asking to view the home. He walked out, I asked her seriously you not going to show us 2 homes? She said no and walked out. All this happened within the first minute of the conversation.\nDisgusted and appalled at her lack of customer service skills and thoughtlessness  for people wanting ideas for their home, I can honestly say she should be fired. I have never been spoken to like that before. My husband, being in the AF for 21 years was looking for a place we could settle down in, but it won't be from your company. We then wandered around the lot, going over in our heads \"did we do something wrong\" and found Jennifer moving furnture we asked if we could poke our heads in the door and she was very kind enough to let us. We then saw another sales person, Mary Jane and she was unlocking the house we were so excited to see. I asked her if she minded us looking inside and she was most pleasant and said of course, not \"are you buying from us, not, sign this first\", just great customer service. Thank you for teaching that sales person some respect of others.\nWe then went over to the green house as Terra had just gone in, and I tried the door handle, and it was locked! She came to the door and held it so close to her that I couldnt see inside if I wanted too. She said if you go back to the office and sign the form I will let you see the houses, I asked \"did you seriously lock the door so I couldnt poke my head in the door\" she replied \"yes\". Again, floored by her attitude and I laughed out loud because it was just so childish. I hope her customers knew they were locked in with her!  She then said I have nothing more to say, and shut the door in my face!\nApparently at some point In the office I used the word \"darn or dam\" as I was so disgusted by our treatment, and she said you can go now, I won't have someone cussing at me. I'm from England and this isn't particularly a cuss word.\nTo summarise for those of you thinking of buying from Clayton Homes in Athens dont bother. You may get lucky enough to speak with Mary Jane or you may get Terra. Good luck. Yes, I have a call in to the boss Roddy and yes I will be notifying the better business bureau. We are no headed to Mundy homes to find our forever home...\nTracey.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88628c8294abcf89:0x515d7db201f97467"}

Managers don't care about the residents, they cut the water off without warning most of the time. I understand that repairs are necessary. They destroy property and never come back to fix it when working on repairs.\nThe workers are too lazy to actually check the water and electricity usage of each resident, so they just take a wild guess and charge us for that amount, most of the time being way more. Our monthly bills are never delivered on time and they get mad at us for not paying the specific amount, and if they do deliver it they just throw it on the porch, SOMETIMES they'll tape it to our door. But if they do it'll be a few days late.\nThe repairs call for breaking the road, and the road repairs can take up to months to be fixed.

Bright smiling faces eager to answer questions and show you around the lot. Ms. Angie Cannon was our tour guide.  We gave her our ballpark sizes and numbers and things the home must have.  In just a few minutes she had a list of 5 homes for us to look out. We looked at all 5 homes, Really beautiful homes buy none of them had a solo, walk in shower.  As we stood on the steps of the last house she said that she did have one more home that we might like, but it was jus a little over our budget(only $3,000.00),  When we walked in the front door we were hooked.  Massive rooms, kitchen and living room.\n\nour goal was to buy a 3-2 with a nice master and a second bedroom as large as possible and a great common bathroom,. This home suited our needs and then some. It was a 4-3.  We asked Angie Cannon what the price was with out taxes.  She told us.  My wife and my eyes lock on each other,  The hair on my neck and arms stood up like an Arctic Blast had just hit me.\n\nMy wife and I had a 2 minute huddle and decided to buy in.  What a relief to finally find the perfect home for us  So we all go back to her office to start the paperwork.  After less than 30 minutes we were the new owners of a 2021 Riverway,  2340 square feet, 4 bedrooms and three full baths.  Great baths.  Especially the master Bath.\n\nThe flow and openness of the home is so relaxing.  You can stand in one room and look all the way through the  home to the opposite end.  I think the Laundry Room, backdoor entrance was like 12X12 with a 7' square in the middle of the room for dropping laundry or fresh caught grouper on.\n\nDaniel Wilson was the \"paper work Guru\"  he breezed through all the required paper work in only about 20-25 minutes,  He explained warranties and who to call if various items needed a touch up  He even gave us the name of the mover so he could get an idea of what the setup site and surrounding trees and bushed might hinder the installation and set up. and where the site actually is.  And then we were set free to go.\n\nThe communications between Angie, Daniel and us was terrific.  They even listened to some of my war stories and joke's. So refreshing compared to the coning zombies down in PC.  That became a night mare after I had signed the contract and given them a very sizable down payment.  That night I was looking through the \"numbers\" and found a $1,200.00 addition that my wife and I had clearly told the guy we absolutely DID NOT WANT their insurance, and another small $350 charge I was not going to pay.  Bottom line, I called the agent at his home Saturday night and told him I would be at his office Sunday at noon to pick up my deposit check.  The agent didn't how up but the number 2 man did.  When he opened the front door and changed the sign to open he had had time to listen to his voice mail.  I entered the office and called out his name.  He told me to come on in to his office.  I said, Well, I guess you have had time to listen to your voice mails already.  He said yeah and pointed to the front corner of his desk and said  There is your check\"  He was not the least bit interested in hearing my side of the story or even looking through the office copies of my contract.  He didn't care or offer to make it right the least little bit.  There is over $3,000.00 in fees you really should question and discuss before you sign.  Buyer be wear there.\n\nI need to close with a great big thank you to Angie Cannon, Daniel Wilson and Lisa Strickland for such a stress free place to do some major shopping in!  So guys, Sunny and I thank you all so much for your attentive service and relaxed and non pushy persona.\n\nTimberline Homes Inc,  on Montgomery Highway  will treat you right and do everything they can to find you a home that meets your need.\n\nAWESOME PLACE AND PEOPLE.\n\nAnd Yes, I would recommend them to anyone.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88928de272fbb703:0xc3a1acf3d4883085"}

Let me take a minute, just sit right there. I'll tell you how this business made my mom pull out her hair. (figuratively)\n\nLet's start with Wayne (who is apparently fired and so is his manager) who signed a deal with my mom assuring her they could purchase her property of choice and put the property and trailer together. My mother was approved for an FHA loan and we found the PERFECT property. They told us they got the property owner to lower the price to 20K but really and secretly Wayne had it to 15,500.... not sure if his shady ways was what got him fired but I would say it's a good bet..... anyway... Wayne \"forgot\" to send the money for escrow to the property owner. They were supposed to close on the property on a Thursday in the beginning of April of 2021. The DAY BEFORE CLOSING ON THE PROPERTY we find out that Wayne didn't fill out any information for the corporate office to take care of closing info and he just \"forgot\" all about the closing at all. So then the seller of the property raised his fee (understandably) back to original cost and made big demands for the runaround.\n\nThen we find out that Wayne is fired later and that his manager is too. Now we are told that they are going to put my mom with another guy named Austin (not the manager Austin) who allegedly is the FHA guy on the site. Well my mom already had a lender and was approved. This company INSISTS they will not buy the property unless she uses THEIR lender. And not to worry they do FHA. HA! Here's the rub this place is running the show like a used cars salesman and trying to wrangle deals that can't work for my mom. Her FHA was for 3.5% down...now they want 10% even though she is in the right score for the 3.5%. They tried to say she doesn't qualify or for the right amount her lender said she did. But my mom and brother were doing it together. In the meantime, they are REFUSING to buy this property they originally assured her they could buy with HER LENDER....suddenly that is no longer something they can do.\n\nThey want to force my mom off the FHA loan because they don't make as much and they can't add \"points\" to make money off of. I am not fooled. I worked in the housing industry. Most people buying modular and mobile are lower incomes and this company is using used car, predatory lending practices and it's gross. My mom had been looking for a house since FEBRUARY. It was going to be her very first home ever buying. She was so excited and this entire process has soured everything and she still doesn't have her home or her property and now has to just keep looking for a home because we refuse to let her do business with this shady company who was just looking to prey on my mom's limited knowledge on mortgages to their advantage. Do not go here. If you are lower income, this isn't the place for you. They have zero integrity and no transparency. Run as fast as you can the other way.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1620940553804, "text": "Hi Trina, thanks for sharing your experience with us.

Plus all the baseboards around the windows along the floor and ceiling are messed up and even cabinets look bad because someone decided to use flat paint on the shiny parts so we have patches throughout our whole house,plus our front door is not leveled and it is crooked. If we could go back in time I would definitely of not bought a home from here. I wish they would fix what needs to be done instead of saying they can't do it.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1597781593860, "text": "Hey Holly - I\u2019m sorry you were unhappy with the service you received at Regional Homes in Mobile.

After talking to Tiffany, she steered us in the right direction and gave us ideas on which homes we\u2019d probably like to look at first. It was a Saturday and this place was super busy. We had made an appointment but it was apparent that Tiffany was overwhelmed with customers and she was unable to give us much of her time (although not her fault, she was there with only one other guy who didn\u2019t seem to know much about anything). We were able to tour the homes at our leisure and their houses are all high end and very nice. There was no pressure to purchase anything.\n\nI deducted a point for the state of their sales \u201cyard\u201d. It is packed dirt pocked full of dips and holes and loose gravel so make sure you wear good comfortable shoes.

They bent our frame, the walls have buckles in them, our house isnt even leveled. Ive tried to contaxt them over and over and no one replies.
