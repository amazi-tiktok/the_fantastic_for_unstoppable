I called  HR at work and everything indicated that it was deposited. I call the bank, at about 1200 hours and I inquired about the deposit. West Alabama Bank said they received it and shall be in account by 1700. I waited till today, May 4th, 2020 and called my bank to let them know I still have not received the money in the bank. I don't know how long it took for them to call my wife back to let her know they straightened out the problem. But as soon as I can, I will be going to a different back. I can't stand to be lied to about my money.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88865a4db8c0074b:0x71b0f7f820016aac"}
