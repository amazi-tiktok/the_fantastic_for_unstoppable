The night desk man was very nice and the morning breakfast was cereal, waffles, juice, biscuits and gravy, fruit and yogurt. Being next to a main highway  I  was surprised the traffic wasn't louder. Stayed on a Monday night though. I'd stay here again", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c0c9dcc68f025:0x538d1c909defbcc8"}

The room my son and I stayed in was two full beds. The bathroom had one towel and smelled of urine. My father in law stayed in another room that had NO linens and NO towels. We brought this up to them the next morning and they stated that they only had 2 people to clean 17 rooms and that if they had the cash we would have received a full refund. Because no cash was on hand they said they'd mail us one. Well it came today. Apparently the disgusting rooms we stayed in were only worth a $15 refund on an $76 room. No matter how desperate I am, I would not chose this hotel to stay in again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c0c9dcc68f025:0x538d1c909defbcc8"}
