They said to give them at least 5 days but I should receive it back sooner. 2 days later and they called back! I was thrilled! I was surprised how quickly the turnaround was. I left but the ring was too snug. I brought it back and the entire time the young lady was assisting me she seemed like I was a nuisance. Very unpleasant and I just couldn\u2019t wait to get the heck out of there. Again, they had a very quick turnaround and when I walked in not one word was said to me. I walked up and I almost spoke first but I wanted to see how long this would last. FIVE employees there and not one spoke a word to me. When I got up to the counter still nothing was said.

They were doing research too.\nDeeDee has me considering a Rolex for myself (though I do love my Breitling!) and I will definitely want to work with her again.\nUpon leaving, my son told me that Thelma wouldn\u2019t even discuss the Deep Sea with them. She simply replied, \u2018There\u2019s a waiting list for those.\u2019 He was very glad that he returned this evening and I\u2019m so glad that he met me at the store and had a great experience instead of dismissing them all together.

When you walk in the door you become family.  They will go above and beyond to make you comfortable because Jewelry buying is no small thing.

Meffords was the first place we visited.  My fiancee lives two hours away from Florence and I was not in the habit of visiting jewelry stores, so I asked friends and coworkers who they recommended.  The number one answer I received was Mefford Jewelers.\n\nWe could not have been more pleased.  Toddman Thompson, the manager, spent a considerable amount of time talking with us and making us feel right at home.  He even encouraged us to visit other jewelry stores to see what they have to offer in terms of products and services.  I'm so glad we did.  We saw a lot of nice jewelry and met a lot of nice people, but none that came close to comparing with Mefford.\n\nMy fiancee decided she liked a ring at Mefford best of all.  Ironically, we found a ring just like it at another Jewelry store in Florence, but Mefford had a much better price as well as service.  I was thrilled to purchase the ring from Mefford Jewelers because my fiancee and I both know it's top quality at a great price from a family owned business right in my hometown of Florence.\n\nI would say to anyone looking for a jeweler to do business with in the Shoals area - visit Mefford Jewelers.

I went in for a new battery for my husband's Movado watch. I inquired about a piece being welded back on a gold hoop earring that I had brought in on a Saturday back before the pandemic. The owner was not there but a young man was with an unkempt appearance. He quoted me $45. I told him that was more than I paid for them so I guess I would just sell them for scrap. So currently while in the jewelry shop, I inquired with the owner who informed me they have a $30/minimum. I was not told of that the 1st time I inquired. The owner began chatting saying, \"You know, I went to the dealership the other day, they told me my tire was going to be $150, I told them, no, it should be $10.\" Then he said, \"I went to the grocery store, they said my groceries were $100, I told them, no, it should be $10.\" While putting the battery in the watch, he stated, \"You know this watch has the wrong size battery?\" \"The battery is too big.\" I informed him it was purchased at a pawn shop so I have no clue who put the battery in but it worked for a long time. He said, \"Well, that's what you get buying from a pawn shop,\" in a condescending tone. I never requested a lower price on the earring repair. I will not pay for something only to be spoken to in this manner. His level of sarcasm was ridiculous. I will not be a patron of his business any longer nor will I ever refer anyone to him again.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1617377765626, "text": "Hello, glad you have been using us for many years. Sorry you had a bad experience this time around. Hope the battery that we put into your watch stays working longer than the one you got from the pawn shop. As for your earring. You came in the store without it and you did want a price on how much it would cost to fix it. But we can not give a price on any item unless we actually see it. You said you talked with me before the pandemic and I told you it would cost 45 dollars apparently. And like you said in your comment \"that was more than I paid for them\".\nWe don't do any repairs on earrings for free and we do have a minimum price we charge on basic repairs like those. I know you wanted a cheaper price because you complained to the owner about it. That is why he gave you examples of other scenarios like the ones you posted in your comment. Hes by no means trying to upset you or offend you in anyway. He just wanted you to understand that we don't barter with prices and we can't just give you a price without seeing the item. The owner also is very honest and upfront with any problems with repairs. That is also why he was concerned and wanted to let you know your watch already had the wrong battery put in it. As for me, I am the young man replying to your review and I do reply to all reviews that concern me. I do believe calling me unkempt was rude and uncalled for especially since I never said anything bad at all to you and barely talked with you in our store.

We normally tell customers to send it back to the company they got the watch from. Because we won't be responsible for a $10.20 battery in a $10,000 watch. Same goes for replacing the band on any $10,000. And when replacing battery's in watches we also check the gaskets or \"seals\" as you call them, If they are damaged. However if moisture happens in the watch. Your step dad must be going swimming with it  or taking showers with his water resistant watch. The only watch that can get wet is a waterproof watch. Waterproof means that your watch can be submerged completely underwater for long periods of time, and there won\u2019t be one single drop of water that enters the interior."}, "gmap_id": "0x889bb2652292ca55:0x21841c55b0c7bb0d"}
