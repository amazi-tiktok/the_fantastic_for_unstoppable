The staff helped at the front with changing my membership from another location. There seemed to be plenty of space. I didn't have to wait on anyone, which is number one for me at any fitness center. Social distance measures were decent, as can be expected. The only real issue that bothered me was that one employee was talking to a customer waiting to go into the spa while I was trying to leave, and he walked in front of me three times going back and forth from the other customer and the counter, as if he couldn't see me. He didn't speak to me at all. I didn't find it very professional to be cutting customers off repeatedly and not saying excuse me or anything, just expecting me to continue to move and go around after already changing directions without even acknowledging me there. It would've been much better if he had the conversation with the customer at the counter, at the table, said \"excuse me,\" or even \"sorry about that,\" anything really to let me know I was valued as much as the person he was talking to and not just in his way. Things like that irk me, especially as a customer. Other than that though, pretty great first-time experience. If it doesn't get too much busier without being expanded, then I'll plan on this being my main gym. Oh, one more thing, I wish they had the treadmills like Midtown.

I had known that CrossFit was a community of athletes and I seriously wanted to be apart of something GREAT. Well I decided to google CrossFit in my area and I landed on this location. I was nervous but I decided to give a GO, I called the number above and the reaction and engagement I got was fantastic. The professionalism of their staff had made me feel eager to get down there and begin training. First day I was amazed by the community, I was welcomed with smiles and assistance not just from the coaches but the members as well. I truly felt that I was apart of a Team. The amount of effort you put in you will get the same energy back ! I highly recommend for beginners and for those who are new to the area and want to feel apart of a community. Also for all the athletes you will definitely get a workout and a run for your money. The classes you can schedule at any time to your schedule. I had an phenomenal experience and would definitely recommend! Definitely military friendly!

There were multiple times where we were having problems booking classes because the people that had taken our card information and supposedly switched it did not save/submit it to their system!\n\nLater to find out, they were charging us random charges! These random charges were repeat charges of our memberships repeat charges of 12 and $15. It got to be so bad they were charging us all throughout the months that our bank called us and told us that it was suspicious activity and that they were going to ban orange theory from charging us. we then tried to get in contact with the owner to give them a chance to make it right because we loved it so much! And she was very rude and did not do anything in her power to make it right. When we asked her what the charges were for she couldn\u2019t tell us the exact things that the random charges were for, which was SKETCHY!\n\nIn addition to this, it is very hard to book classes! We were always on a waiting list! And it we didn\u2019t feel like we were getting our money worth! I got so bad that we would try to book classes while we were there in person and sometimes the front desk staff would say that we\u2019re booked for weeks ahead of time and we weren\u2019t!\n\nOrange theory is a great work out overall and we saw great results!

The only downside is that when school starts back, with all the activities and sports, they will probably will not be able to attend as much as they would like.  Simply put, you will not get a ROI for your child.\n\nAgain, I highly recommend the developmental program for young athletes at BlackWatch Sports Performance.  If your child is not training here, they are getting left behind athletically.  But it's not just about being a better athlete however.  They treat my kids like family and work on character as well.

The location is convenient just far from downtown if you're coming that way, and it can get pretty busy after work. I would suggest if you can try and go later in the evening to avoid the crowds and get an appointment with Kyle then hit the sauna afterwards for some small talk and hot relaxation. Also the steam room is great for extra privacy. There's no juice bar or anything like that but Pub 261 is just a minute up 31 and a great spot to loosen up a little bit instead of just going home and straight to bed. Kyle is also very skilled in deep tissue massage due to his strong grip and thick forearms, so if you are sore afterwards it's a good way jumpstart the recovery process and get you in the right mood if you know what I mean. I try to sleep 8-10hrs whenever I can but Kyle has so much stamina he keeps me going all night! It makes me feel like we're in college again. There's also a lap pool and racquetball court.

I spoke with someone to make the appt. for the class but never got a confirmation email, follow-up call, etc. after the initial conversation and providing my CC info. I was told to arrive at 4:45. I arrived at 4:53. Now I understand that I was a bit late, I get that. However, the class did not start until 5:15 so you would think a place looking to make an impression and gain 2 new clients would at least try to make it work or offer an additional time or option for another class.  However, Alyse immediately let us know we were too late. I said ok and started walking away. My brother asked if there was anything we could do (i.e. giving her a chance to offer another option for a class or try to work with us in some way) Her reply was, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, class is starting really soon. There\u2019s no way we can do everything we need you to do\u201d So, we said ok and left. I called back to get the young lady\u2019s name because I was so dissatisfied with my experience. I was baffled that I was flat out turned away without her taking any opportunity to reconcile the situation. When I spoke with her she mentioned my brother told her I wasn\u2019t a resident earlier as to allude to the fact that perhaps maybe this was the reason she was less concerned with retaining us a potential client. To the contrary, I grew up in Tuscaloosa, have been living in Atlanta for the past 9 years and made the decision just this past week to pack up my life and move back because my mom is battling Pancreatic Cancer for the 3rd time in 4 years and not doing well at all. I probably would have signed up on the spot today because for the last year I\u2019ve been a member at F45 in Atlanta and am very serious about transitioning to a gym based in Tuscaloosa that also has locations in Atlanta. This would be so I can workout when I commute back to Atlanta 2-3 days a week as I still hold my corporate job there but will work remotely here in Tuscaloosa for the most part. To say that I am extremely disappointed with the service is an understatement. I was truly hoping to have a great class, lock down a contract with a new gym that would fit my needs during this difficult and transitional time in my life, & then try to enjoy what was left of my birthday. Sadly, this was not the case. Very poor experience.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888a8303485c039:0x950b72dc7f30e396"}

I travel to the Birmingham area for work once a month and was looking for a gym/box that has hours on Sunday.  I had heard some not-so-great things about a few boxes but I hadn't heard of Forge Fitness/ CF Shades.  Not only is CF Shades the only place with Sunday hours, but they were above and beyond wonderfully welcoming when I showed up unannounced during their open gym period.  Upon first glance, the gym was very clean, which is not very common among CrossFit and Crossfit-inspired facilities.  The owner, Rich, jumped up from a staff meeting and gave me a tour and after learning of my CF history, invited me to use any and all of their space as well as invited me back through my duration of stay while in town.  They have an awesome workout space out back with a platform, squat racks and a rig and the running course around the building is super safe.  I also met coaches Caleb, Josh and Rebecca who were all very accommodating and friendly.  When I returned for a class, Rebecca coached and I really appreciated her attentiveness.  I'm a CrossFit coach in Denver and because I move relatively well, I tend to get left alone - but I love being coached when I drop into new places and Rebecca was great.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND travelers and locals to visit.  If you're a member somewhere else in Hometown or Birmingham, switch now.

I was close, but even though I failed, I was offered to apply the money I put in towards a membership... The gym even has given me a rain check to apply it in March after I get my tax return, so it's more affordable for me. (so not really a loss when all is said and done!)\n\nThe people (coaches and members) I met have been nothing but encouraging. The workouts were well designed to keep you moving to accomplish in less than 30 minutes what many other classes, at other gyms I've attended, it has taken an hour to achieve (which is nice when you are low on time in your day!)\n\nI have a knee injury, and in previous gyms, my disability has made me feel inadequate or ashamed that I could not do what the rest of the class was doing. The coaches knew about my injury (and no matter what class I attended (morning or afternoon) with any coach, they were already well informed of my needs without the embarrassment of having to say as much at every new encounter. They were discreet and quick to tell me alternate exercises I could do, so I didn't feel as if I was the odd man out waiting to be assigned something different or taking away from the class by holding up the rest of the members, so that a coach could assist me.)\n\nMembers are at all different fitness levels, and the coaches are very attentive to every one's individual needs, and they are watching you and your progress making sure that you are on point doing the exercises CORRECTLY! (which as long as I've been working out, I hadn't realized how many simple movements I was doing incorrectly!)\n\nI could write a book on all the good experiences I have had just in my six weeks of attending, but I will wrap it up here with a final statement that I highly recommend this gym. It's changed my outlook about what I need for my own fitness journey, and I look forward to returning in March! I actually feel incredibly sad that I have to wait that long to return to my new fit fam!\n\nSpecial thanks to Matt and Zack for your tireless tutelage and positive attitude/feedback (I know I was all over the place lost on too many occasions! \ud83d\ude02) And thanks to all the members who were so very welcoming to me, I'm truly grateful and am already missing you!\n\nKeep at it! 3,2,1 TRIBE!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889218815457ad9:0x2a2e6920b4bf4b44"}

I'm not where I want to be physically but I am well on my way thanks to these fine people. They are not cheap - but the value and the knowledge you learn is worth it.

They scale the workouts to prevent injuries - I was really worried about my knees and they work with you so you don't injure yourself. They know their stuff and want to see you make progress not hurt yourself.  They aren't snobby and neither are the people that workout here - just normal friendly people. They are passionate about fitness not just some other gym you pay your monthly dues and get nothing in return. I was 330 pounds 3 1/2 months ago. Ive lost 45 pounds and feel awesome!

Overall the program itself is really good, and the coaches were wonderful.  I did get excellent results during this time in weightloss, body fat percentage reduction and high lean muscle.  Unfortunately I will not be continuing an affiliation with ITF due to the misrepresentation of this program. I was sold that the 98% of challengers meet their goal, the meal plans are customized and that if for some reason you don't meet your goal you could apply to future classes. What I found is that ITF monthly fees are extremely high even with the so called Challenger discount, There seem to be very few challengers that actually meet the goal and the customized meal plan is merely based on starting weight and goal of weight loss, body fat percentage or muscle gain. There is no consideration of gender or age, which can be a huge factor in weight loss. The only offer is to apply your hefty deposit towards a minimally discounted 12 month commitment, so I am parting ways with ITF. Due to the way I feel they misrepresented this program.  I will be seeking a membership elsewhere, and will never do business with them in the future.

I find it the most difficult, challenging, and fun workout I've done in my life.  I'm still on a learning curve, but I can say that I've also made progress!  Before I signed on, I was very worried about re-injuring my rotator cuff.  I let them know about my past injury, Zech and Jon showed me ways to modify my workouts.  As my shoulder got stronger, I've not needed some of the modifications and according to my chiropractor and orthopedic doctor,  my shoulder has fully healed.  I hate weights...really.  But I'm now swinging the 35 pound kettle ball.   The biggest weight I had lifted prior to Irontribe was a 15 pound dumb bell for bicep curls or deadlifts.  With these guys, I've done a 2 max rep 165 deadlift, and I'm learning to do beginner handstand pull ups!  The group environment is fun.  They keep me going.  We cheer each other on.  I find that when you do something difficult, share a difficult experience, like a WOD lol,  we feel connected to the each other and we want to see one another succeed.  We get excited when someone reaches a PR or finishes a tough workout. I'm a school teacher, so I was initially concerned with the cost.  I've found the monetary, time, and physical investment to be worth it. The coaches are the best, they make me smile because they challenge me, they challenge me to put on more weight or work with me on my nutrition and check up my attendance and progress.  Zechariah and Jon, Jen, Brandon, and Joe really care and they enjoy what they do.  They're not only about the paycheck, they're about making better athletes and building a community.

If you have a question about ANYTHING, ask the coaches, they are there to watch you succeed!!!  They will tell it like it is and what you need to do to stay on track.  They are AWESOME at this.  The second take away is this, STICK,STICK,STICK to the meal plan.  It is there for you to succeed!!!  It\u2019s all laid out and the online community is GREAT, if you have question for them ask about recipes, nutrition items that come up while shopping etc\u2026  The online community is another AWESOME way to stay in touch and stay accountable.\n\nTHANK YOU TO THE COACHES AND ATHELETES AT IRON TRIBE 280!!!

I somehow found the drive and determination to our through...I did 31,238 steps and 14.21 miles of exercise Sunday and 16,062 steps and 6.85 miles on Monday through the holiday weekend.  BOOM!!  It has given the confidence to know, I can do it with some work, focus and determination!!  The friends you make through Squad Fitness also create a support system that was amazing.  Thank You ROCK...he's an amazing trainer with all the right GET TO WORK and YOU CAN DO IT support throughout the process.

I read a lot of reviews looking for something to make me more comfortable with taking on the challenge myself.  After seeing several people in my age range (I'm 52) I thought, if they can do it, so can I. I'm not gonna lie, the first workout was really tough!  But the next one was not quite as bad. It's amazing how quickly your body can change and improve. I had no endurance in the beginning but was completing the maximum effort by the end of the challenge. One of the best things about the program is that everyone is in it together.  We were all eating the same foods, sharing recipe ideas, figuring out the exercises and encouraging one another.  The trainers were all awesome!  Josh, Aidan, Brandon and Heather kept us challenged with every workout. Not one was repeated, so you never get bored with the same old things. I highly recommend the Drop 20 Challenge to anyone who wants to get in shape. I actually lost 10 pounds, but am very happy with my results!

The Camp Challenge is one of the best decisions I've ever made.....was it tough...yes!  Would I do it again....in a heartbeat.  I am so looking forward to this place helping me complete my fitness goals.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888903eb52f00f0d:0x907eeff3156e5c7b"}

When I first started, I was unsure of how well I would be able to complete the Challenge with my work schedule and my childcare. I also really like to eat, so I was worried about that too. For every excuse I could throw out, Romen had a solution to offer. I used to run a good bit before my second child was born, and I had not gotten back into shape since his birth (he's two and a half). Months and months of running didn't do for my body what the Camp Challenge did in six weeks. It's the 20lb in 6 week program, not the 6lb in 20 week program! The workouts are hard, but never boring, always challenging, and (I kinda want to say fun). If there's a part that you hate, you know it's gonna be over soon. Even though it's hard, you get stronger quickly and I find myself wanting more at the end of the hour. It makes it easier to go back the next day and I miss it when I can't make my workout. At week one, I was doing pushups on my knees and couldn't do a burpee. In week 6, I'm doing of pushups on my toes (with good form) and I can burpee and wall sit with the best of them. The trainers are encouraging and push me to do more than I think I can, which is exactly what I need to get stronger and in better shape. I lost two dress sizes, and feel FREE to put on anything in my closet because I don't have to be self-conscious anymore. I didn't hate trying on swimsuits last week, and actually bought three because they all looked good and I couldn't decide. THAT is a victory in and of itself! The diet isn't bad at all if you like veggies, and I virtually stopped having headaches (which I'm guessing were related to my sugar consumption). It takes planning and prepping, but it's totally do-able, and it made me get creative in the kitchen. And if cooking and prep are not your thing, they even have a meal service that you can purchase too! NO Excuses! You get support all the way.

As we walked in, we were told by a member to go talk to two guys in the corner away from the class. They then direct us to go talk to the coaches to get us checked in. As we\u2019re walking away, Dalton (owner) asks if we\u2019ve done Crossfit before and my friend says \u201cno\u201d as Dalton then kinda puts his hand in his face and says \u201cOh my goodness.\u201d I was pretty shocked...as an owner of a box, you have the opportunity to gain maybe two members but after that first impression, definitely not.\n\nWith that said, the workout was great! The coaches were super helpful to my friend and we definitely got a good WOD in for the day. Potentially would go back, but definitely not for who owns the place.

I spoke to several of my friends who were/are members and I only received positive feedback.\n\nThe Shaping U team has been amazing, as well as the other gym members. Unfortunately with other gyms I didn't feel like I fit in and it's probably due to the fact that I really did not know what I was doing.\n\nI had never received assistance from a personal trainer and my only regret is that I did not do this sooner. I pass countless gyms, and I attend at 7 am, and I am still motivated to go. I never thought I would ever say that I really enjoy this.\n\nI'm not just getting the personal training to make sure I have the right form, but also coming up with a meal plan is incredible.

I don't even need to figure out what I need to do next, that is what they are there for and has been extremely beneficial.\n\nI'm a 45 yrs female, I'm very busy with work, and because I am working from home at the moment, being able to get out to a safe and friendly environment means the world to me.\n\nJoining Shaping U has been the best thing I have ever done for myself.

We used to love the Kids Night Out program, but they've made it less conducive for our child who is not into socializing. I wish they had some kind of classes for beginners especially yoga. Administrative people are nice but don't seem to be on the same page with information. Cleaning attendants are friendly and always hard at work. Now that my children are 8 and 11 they do not feel comfortable going in the ladies dressing room which I totally agree with but I do not feel comfortable letting them go in the men's area because there is no privacy for them. I'm not comfortable with them being exposed to naked men or having to expose themselves. Probably a lot to ask for a kids dressing area or family room. There is a changing room/storage room by the pool but I think it's really just meant for storage. It would be great if they would post the status of the pool on Facebook or via text.

It has been a great facility with great training.  They now offer a personal training component. After talking with Chris and Caleb, I decided to try this to work on some areas I felt were neglected. After a physical and dietary evaluation, Caleb put together a personalized fitness routine as well as a dietary plan. After the first few sessions, he adjusted the workouts to isolate certain muscle groups to improve my core, strength and stamina.I have been doing the \"Prime\" classes going on for three months and seeing a change in body composition.

He works with me to help improve my mobility and flexibility.  That really helps me alot.  I am a nurse and work 12 hours shifts three days a week.  Hugheston helps me immensely.  I could keep going on and on but I want everyone to know that the Hoover 24e is a great place to get healthy and fit.  I've never been uncomfortable or felt out of place.

I took the first fit test on day one... I failed the test (I didn't complete the test within the allotted timeframe). The coaches (yeah, there're coaches there every step of the way) told the class that this is a benchmark test. We will take MINUETS off our time by week three. My pride was hurt (so was my lungs, legs, and everything else), but I kept going to class. They taught me moves (they corrected some of what I thought I knew, and introduced me to a lot of new ones), encouraged me, motivated me, and kept me accountable to every rep. I took the fit test again at the end of week three and completed it in 11:42 sec (down from 17:19)! After that, denying the program was out the window. I signed up and attended classes everyday they were offered (unless I was on travel - I still completed my workouts while TDY - they have travel workouts for you).

There's no juice bar or anything like that but Mugshots is right up 31 and a great midway point to loosen up little bit before just going home and straight to bed.

She didn't want to hear that, instead she insisted I go ahead and sign, without reading the terms and conditions. That was an error on my part.

I only went to the free class, I never attended a real class. I spoke with the manager, Abbie, who was no help. She basically told me that 2 months will automatically be charged before it is cancelled on their end. And when I told her I couldn't afford it, her response was, \"that's not my problem\".... Yep, that's what she said. I politely asked if I could get the number to corporate, but she wouldn't provide it. She would have her manager call. Very frustrating.

At the office i'm in a position to make decisions all day, so to come to a place to work out and have someone else making decisions on what to do next is AMAZING. I LOVE being able to push myself but still go at my own pace during the work out if needed.

If you've never been to an Orangetheory class, I can explain it simply - in my own words, it's a 60 minute 5 zone heart rate based group personal training session that includes cardio and weights. I've never been much into cardio but the class provides you ways of doing cardio through walking, jogging or running - you choose. I LOVED that! I really like the group exercise classes, because they always make me push harder than I would on my own. In addition to that the use of heart rate monitoring is unique and something that enabled me to track my performance and challenge myself...which I really enjoyed.\n\nOverall I would def recommend this place to anyone.
