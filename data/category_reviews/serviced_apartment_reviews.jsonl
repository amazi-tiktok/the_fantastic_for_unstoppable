To get to the beach we had to cross a 4 lane highway, which was a little tricky. The room we were in was small,  outdated,  and old looking. Other condos may be nicer. The walls were thin - we could easily here the people above and around us. The pool supposedly closes at 11, however people stayed in it and were loud until 2 am every night.  Our area we booked from advertised washer, dryer, and dishwasher  - but didn't provided any soap for these accommodations. Trash bags were not provided either. I am not sure if that is typical- every other condo or home we've stayed in with these amenities  has provided soap.
