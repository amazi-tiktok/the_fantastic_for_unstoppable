Side note: they don't just focus on skin-- they also made amazing recommendations for me in regard to my chronic migraines! I have been so discouraged after trying countless \"solutions\", programs, and even visiting other doctors/experts that have literally said \"there's really not much else you can do for hormonal acne.\" Dr. Seiler and Leigh Ann have so much great knowledge, and I was so comforted and encouraged to hear their recommendations and plan of treatment. In fact, I almost burst into tears when Dr. Seiler said, \"We are going to get this handled for you.\"\nAfter ONE WEEK of being on the new skincare regimen they suggested for me (which, by the way, is incredibly simple and takes about 1-2 minutes), my skin was noticeably clearer (insane, right?!). I am still in shock by how much my skin has improved in such a short amount of time. For the first time in forever, I am much more confident in my skin and can actually go without concealer if I want to! Also, Leigh Ann is SO fun and easy to talk to, and I always look forward to my appointments with her. Being a graduate college student, finances are somewhat tight. However, they have an amazing VIP program full of so many discounts and perks (never seen anything like it before), and they also understood where I was coming from and provided cost-effective options. If you're on the fence about making an appointment with them, know that IT IS WORTH IT. I could go on and on about how much I love this place, and I want everyone to experience what I have with them.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1626372419443, "text": "Jordan, this is absolutely amazing!

If you compare similar local providers, their websites are less up to date and less informative.

I didn't ask for sleep advice.\nI mean I could understand her saying the nursing could be irritating my issue and that weaning might be something to consider.\nBut talking about how my son doesn't need to nurse anymore and I should really just talk to his pediatrician about weaning him is way beyond her scope and none of her damn business!\nHis pediatrician has no problem with it and nursing till 2 is recommended by the WHO.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88893e50dc905cab:0x5579fabd64bbb096"}

However, as I communicated to you in our conversation last night which you neglected to include in your response, I have waited for a return call to my non-urgent issue way longer than 24-48 hours. My first follow-up appointment where the biopsy was taken was on June 13th, where I was told by a clinician that I would know the results before I left for vacation. I called for results initially 1 or 2 days before I left town June 23rd. I then called back on the 28th, where I was told once again that I would be called back before close of business, yet I was not. I was never informed by any of your staff that I spoke with (both clinical and non-clinical - I have spoken with both) of the 10-14 day timeframe for biopsy results. In speaking with you last night is the first I have heard of the 10-14 day waiting period for results and the results not being discussed until the scheduled follow-up visit. Perhaps some form of training refresher would be useful in ensuring that all of the staff, both clinical and non-clinical are relaying uniform information and setting the proper expectations to the patients.

Let me explain, I\u2019ve been coming into this place to get full-face IPL treatments done for about a year. I\u2019ve had three total treatments done in the span of a year. The first two treatments cost me $150. The second time I came in my specialist informed me that the prices will raise to $200 per IPL session. No problem for me, well... I came in earlier this week to get only CHEEKS and CHIN done and she charged me $350$!!! NO ONE informed me it would be that high! Last time I came in I was told $200. $350 for a partial face treatment is absolutely insane price. I\u2019ve been getting these treatments done all over the country and I\u2019ve NEVER had anyone charge me that much for a partial face IPL. Honestly, she should have told me before the treatment that it would be that much! I\u2019ve seen her three times. I didn\u2019t want to make a big deal about it by the time she charged me because I didn\u2019t want to cause a scene but I\u2019m honestly very unhappy with the lack of communication from this business.

You can't see my eyelids at all and I can't raise my eyes up. Instead of looking better for my trip I looked awful with my nearly closed eyes. Everyone that knows me asked what did you do to your eyes??? Thank GOD Botox does not last to long and I'm praying this is a temporary result that will go back to normal.

He seems to think all my health problems come from smoking. I smoke about a pack of day by the way. I have restless leg syndrome, a jaw condition called TMJ, diabetes and a good bit of joint pain. it doesn't matter what health condition I want to talk about, he blames all my health problems on smoking. My dad was diabetic and smoked 3 to 4 packs a day. He did not have all these aches and pains that I have. My boss is in his sixties, smokes cigarettes and is diabetic. He does not complain of aches and pains at all. I understand smoking may irritate a pre-existing condition. But the key word here is pre-existing condition. There must be something else going on. I was hit by a car and knocked down when I was little. I have had problems with my hip since. Dr Lowe refuses to look at it because I haven't quit smoking cigarettes yet. All of my aches and pains come from smoking cigarettes and I'm diabetic. I  complained about a lot of pain in my right leg on my last visit. He refused to look at it because I still smoke. So I went to doctors care across from walmart  who found that I had a torn muscle and soft tissue damage. But he actually looked at it. I will be replacing doctor lowe as soon as other doctors are allowing new patients. I wish doctors care accepted my insurance. I am sick and tired of getting blown off because he is against smoking. If somebody comes in and complains about something ,it should be looked at. He acts like I have the plague because I smoke. My husband is dying to have a word with him. But I do my best to keep my husband away because my husband will bite his freaking head off. He is very protective of me. I wonder if I can find a veterinarian to take care of me. I'm sure they would do a better job than doctor lowe does. And they probably wouldn't talk to me like a dog as as badly dr. Lowe does.

She relaxes me with her humor & bubbly personality. Can\u2019t say enough about this spa on the edge of town.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88893ddfc9c8f0f5:0x1921265d80499344"}

They are both more than willing to make adjustments if a client is not satisfied, although I have never had to go back for that.  They also call after a procedure to make sure you are satisfied with your results, which is rare for most spas.

I asked the doctor's advice about the coverage, and she did not indicate I would need to buy more units. It has been about a month, and I still have movement in all areas injected.  The wrinkles aren't as strong but still there.  Also the areas over the corners of my brows were not treated, and I have this strange Spock look when I raise my brows. Of course, I called after about 2 weeks to let them know that the treated areas still had a lot of movement, and they quickly explained that they do not do any re-treatment with Groupons.  I understand that I  supposedly got a \"deal\" but I also still paid for a service and was assured when I booked my appointment that I would love the results.. I know Groupons are to get new customers in the door but with this experience, I will not go back. I have used a Groupon at another spa, and they re-treated me to get the results that were expected.

I had a GroupOn voucher & was a little concerned that I may be shortchanged because I was there on a \u201ccoupon\u201d.  All my fears were immediately put to rest from the initial phone call to make my appointment.  I had let time get away from me and had less than a week to use my GroupOn voucher or lose the promotional value.  The lady on the phone, Katrina I think, was understanding & made me an appointment for the next day.  Bonus point because I was able to get my appointment on a Saturday.\n\nWhen I arrived, I was greeted by name & offered a drink.  After paperwork, I was introduced to Jennifer Pyles who explained that she is double licensed and would do both my massage & facial.  I was extremely pleased with this because it allowed me to stay relaxed throughout the treatments and not have to move into a new area.  Jennifer was professional, attentive & through.  Her pressure level was perfect & she checked in occasionally to make sure it stayed that way.  She even surprised me by telling me she could tell I was right handed & spent a lot of time at a computer due to the tension level in certain areas.  That really showed me how skilled she is.  After the massage, Jennifer moved directly into my express facial.  She walked me through the process & gave me a brief skin analysis.  She suggested products & services I could benefit from.  She was also kind enough to suggest some over the counter products when I asked about them.  After the appointment, she left a list of the items & services we discussed at the front desk for me.\n\nAfter my time with Jennifer, I was allowed to wait in the sauna while the nail technician finished with another client.  The temperature was just right for relaxation and I had to avoid nodding off.\n\nNext, Badri Roshan, the nail technician came to get me for my manicure.  She was a very nice lady with whom I enjoyed talking.  I loved her accent & chatting with her about her background and what drew her to Birmingham.  As a testament to her work. I have received several compliments on my nails.\n\nAs I checked out, I neglected to get the name of the lady at the front desk but she was very friendly and helped me run my card to leave a tip for Jennifer & Badri.  I loved that while I was invited back, no services or products were pushed on me.  I am looking forward to all my future visits and spreading the news that Azia Medical Spa is money and time well spent!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88893ddfc9c8f0f5:0x1921265d80499344"}

It was so soothing and calmed my face down as I sat in my car before leaving! She told me if I didn\u2019t get a result from that, bring the other two products back and get my money back! When she said that, I knew she was genuinely trying to help me, and she did! My face has never felt as good as it feels, and looks from using these particular products!

But the nurse who welcomed me in apologized for that and said it\u2019s not normal. Then I had a little incident with my baby who was with me and everyone was so kind and understanding and helpful! And then the main reason I was there was for my acne and the doctor prescribed me things that were safe while breastfeeding. She explained what was going on, too. I\u2019m about 2 weeks in with her suggestions and my skin has significantly improved. I will definitely continue to come here for my skin health needs.\n\nUpdate: I have been to this location 3 times now and each time I have had an hour + wait. So the first time was not an isolated experience. Today is July 13th, 2020. Jefferson county has put a message out saying masks are required to help stop the spread until there is a vaccine. Unfortunately, this location is subject to this \u201crequirement\u201d and after asking if I had to even with the recent announcement that the WHO has come out and said in a press conference that \u201cit is rare for an asymptomatic person to spread COVID. \u201c So now we are in an era where counties and the businesses in them will pander to fear that is unfounded as of today with the death rate of Covid well below 1%. We will see what the future holds for Covid. If it mutates into a more dangerous strand, I will re-assess my frustration with businesses like this. But in the mean time, I will speak my mind and spread truth about what Covid is. I\u2019m sick and tired of being forced to wear a mask that will spike my carbon dioxide intake that has been proven to lower my immune system along with many other side effects. And all in the name of waiting for a vaccine that will still not have a long term trial study under its belt to make sure that there are not any severe long term side effects. And in case you are not aware, there are plenty of vaccines that have side effects that do not show up right away. One example of this is thimerosal (Mercury) was removed or reduced from vaccine use. Heck, Johnson and Johnson just settled with plaintiffs who experienced many different cancers decades after the use of JJ baby powder. BABY POWDER!! So I have serious concern with an inoculation that will most likely be required, like the masks are, to \u201cstop the spread\u201d (of a disease that is recording low death rates) that will not have long term testing to make sure that we aren\u2019t doing more harm than good. But that\u2019s my two cents.  I will most likely end up moving my derm needs to an office that not only can figure out how to not have hour waits for their patients but is brave enough to look the stats and facts in the face and take a stand against the current overstep we are seeing all over the country.\n\nAll in all, the people here are very kind, and the doctor I\u2019ve been seeing seriously helped with my adult acne. So  I will give them 4 stars. I recongize it\u2019s hard to stand against the grain. But the hour plus waits have been very hard since I bring my infant with me to these appointments.\n\nLastly, they also require hand sanitizer and temp check. These are things that do not bother me personally, and I still complied with all that was asked of me.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888602aacce729c9:0x135bb203d88babc6"}

It was my first appointment with Cahaba Dermatology the day I went it must have been a busy day for them, I waited that day about 45 min and people\nwere getting called into see her while I was still sitting out in the waiting room it ended up being me & one other lady that day which she was there before I was , I finally got called in and left her sitting there.\nI met Dr. Groysman and we proceeded with my appointment she biopsied a place on my ear I was having problems with.  My results came back and everything was okay. I still have problems\nwith my ear from time to time was the reason I made the 2nd appointment \u2013 fast forward to May 2018 and I called and made an appointment with her Nurse Practitioner& was told when I called in that I had a balance from 2016 that would have to be paid \u2013 Im not sure about their billing department but I didn\u2019t know about the balance & I told her that I would pay it. If I had known about a past due  and call to make an appointment is that someone that is trying not to pay? So we made the appointment went in today 6/7 my appointment was at 11:00 I get to my appointment she collects my co-pay I go sit down and she calls me back to the front desk and proceeds to tell me that she collected the co-pay not realizing there was the balance due and I would need to pay or I\ncouldnt go thru with my  appointment. I told her I couldn\u2019t pay it all today \u2013 that I could pay it tomorrow and she said she would have to speak with someone in billing \u2013 so this other young lady  comes out and says basically the same thing the other one  did with the exception -she said that someone had called me and left a voice mail for me & did I not get the voice mail? & on that VW stated I had to pay this. Which I said no  & I told her the same thing  - I get paid tomorrow and I would pay it then -  she says I couldn\u2019t keep the appointment if I didn\u2019t pay today. So I had to leave.   This review is not about whether I got to keep my appointment or not, its not about the balance I owe, its about how people are treated, all this was handled out at the front desk instead of asking me to step to the side, step into the 2nd  young ladies office , or go stand out front and wait for the police to arrive to hand cuff me is the way I felt  Just as the 1st appointment  was not good , my 2nd time there was even worse. I was so humiliated that other people could hear what was going on. I owe the money - but I would rather other people not know that I owe that money. I wish I would have paid more attention to the girls names, but I do remember faces. I had not intentions of not paying the balance due.\n\nMy cousin goes to Dr. Groysman - he has all great things to say about her as a Doctor & as a person. He thinks very highly of her & her practice. He is the reason I made the 2nd appointment -he said I should try again.\nMy cousin's name is Don Amick. He was also surprised that I couldn't keep my appointment today. BTW they took my co-pay and took it off my past due amount. My balance was 125.00 and not I only owe 95.00. That's right 95.00 not 200.00, not 300.00, not 500.00. It was 125.00. I've never written a review, while I know this is a long review - I just couldn't let this go.

I felt like my daughter was a Guinie pig! So the last resort was Accutane and after a week my daughter could not move or get out of bed that's how poisonous it was. We stopped it immediately and I took her to another Dr who diagnosed her w policystic ovaries... all she needed was a simple blood test. her face is a lot better now. I don't know how much harm all the meds she took for months did to her body. I'm just furious that nobody even suggested a blood test, they just treated the face, not the whole body. Hope our bad experience will help someone.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888602aacce729c9:0x135bb203d88babc6"}

All staff members have been top notch in their skill and customer service. Dr Rousso made my nose look completely natural again after a previous surgeon did NOT. I highly recommend a surgeon such as Dr Rousso if you plan on a rhinoplasty. You want someone that does facial work and not body work. I also want to add that he recommends an overnight stay at a hotel so you can be checked by his protege in the evening.
