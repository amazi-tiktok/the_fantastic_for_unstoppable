However, two huge issues. 1.) she seemed to be working on an almost assembly line sort of protocol and took a very short time to listen to my concerns and prescribed medications that gave me multiple concerns due to potential side effects I wanted to avoid 2.) the lady with whom they scheduled my appointment also did not have her insurance credentials in order so I ended up paying 155.00 out of pocket. I have excellent insurance and I would have had zero copay if she could\u2019ve accepted my insurance. I paid because they assured me that by the time my follow up appointment was scheduled they would have the situation remedied. I called before I went to the next appointment and was advised she still didn\u2019t have credentials for united healthcare so the visit would cost 90.0. I canceled the appointment and will have to find another doctor. This has also left me dealing with the side effects of those medications without any support in handling that. All around, I do not advise going here. The building is not handicap accessible which makes it more difficult for me as I don\u2019t do that well with stairs sometimes, they don\u2019t seem to have their business in order, they don\u2019t seem to take the time to truly understand your issue and act appropriately, and I was left with a strong impression that they simply didn\u2019t care much. If anything they should have said come into your appointment and we will not charge you and will handle the insurance after the fact. I do not understand why they think it is acceptable to force a patient to pay their outrageous prices for twenty minutes of their time when it\u2019s their fault they\u2019re not getting paid through insurance. Perhaps they have resolved the issue, perhaps not, but definitely call and question absolutely everything they tell you because they seemed to have no problem surprising me not only once with a bill I shoudn\u2019t have had to pay, but they didn\u2019t even call me before the follow up to advise me I would again be required to pay out of pocket.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4c55c7ed58f3:0x2409d699885e9955"}
