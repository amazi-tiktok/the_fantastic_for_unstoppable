Nobody was in the waiting room, keep in mind. We tried to check in, give her the insurance cards, tell her it\u2019s very urgent.... and she\u2019s got her head propped up on her left hand, slowly clicking things on her computer. She gives us the WAIT finger. Doesn\u2019t say a single word. Just \ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb the YOU CAN JUST WAIT A MINUTE finger. We sit down for 20 mins. She\u2019s still clicking away. Looking disgruntled as ever. We go back up to the desk to try to reiterate how urgent this is ansnto basically beg her to take our insurance or whatever it is she needs to get us seen ASAP. We get the finger again. We then called Gadsden regional hospital and they said \u201cYes we will get you in immediately!

Did we interrupt her Facebook scrolling? What did we do wrong but want to check in and get seen ASAP. We were (and always are) VERY nice and understanding. We know nobody is a miracle worker. But this is on another level of disgusting and piggish. What if my family member died while she played on the computer for almost half an hour and never ever got us checked into the system?! The place was empty. I guess she thought she could be lazy that night and was upset by us coming in and having an emergency, in turn making her have to do a little work. This was on 1/19/18 at MIDNIGHT in the ER.  Couldn\u2019t get her name because I kept getting shoes off. She never spoke to us ONCE.

So we had a lot of bizarre and non-sensical testing trying to take place, and even in her last gasps, someone came in with a gurney to take her in for surgery. The neurosurgeon came in wondering why she hadn't gone in for the MRI that morning. The last few days, I felt like I really had to protect my mom because their system is so chaotic and overwhelming.
