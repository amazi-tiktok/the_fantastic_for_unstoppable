The surgery that caused the real issue was a very sloppy fusion surgery that was performed, by an inferior surgeon, in July. When Dr. Hadley went in on November the 6th, he found 3 of the 6 screws either backing out or lose. He removed all of the existing hardware and did a fusion form L2 to S1. I feel better today than I did on any day of 2020. If you compare the post op CT scans of the first and second fusion, the first one looks like it was performed by a shop teacher whereas Dr. Hadley's work is perfectly symmetrical, the screw placement is exact with each one going in at the exact same angle and right in the middle if each vertebrae.\n\nAfter my first fusion left me in terrible pain that surgeon referred me out to a pain management clinic saying there was nothing more that could be done. I am so thankful that I cancelled that appointment and went looking for a referral to get a second opinion. I am not sure how I lucked into Dr. Haley's office but I am very grateful that I did. Because today I was released by Dr. Hadley with no further PT required.

Knowing the complexity of back surgery I chose to seek a second opinion by a neurosurgeon. After several days of research I decided to see Dr. Hadley. At our first meeting he was very caring and explained the severity of my herniation. He calmed our worries that I would need multiple surgeries. He ordered a few tests to determine the severity of the damage done by the herniation and we scheduled surgery. His office worked extensively with us and the Red Cross to get our son home to help me after my surgery, and they have asked each time they have seen me about my son.\n\nThe surgery process was as painless as possible, and the fact that I saw Dr. Hadley on Saturday morning in the hospital before I went home warmed my heart. I can honestly say that Dr. Hadley is one of the few doctors that I have had the pleasure of being a patient of.

Had to have a resent MRI taken. Sent it to Dr. Hadley. His staff contacted me promptly. Met Dr. Hadley soon after and was blown away by he\u2019s professionalism and kindness. I never met another Dr. that showed me without a doubt how much he cared about my situation.I had spinal to-gnosis, I forgot to mention another neurosurgeon had told me 4 years prior.

My mother was losing the feeling in both of her legs due to the narrowing of her spinal canal and Dr Hadley was able to relieve her of the pain and numbness she was experiencing.  Recently in 2017,  I took my mother back to see Dr Hadley because she was having a tingling sensation that started in her hip and ran all the way down to the top of her foot.  She was in constant pain and was unable to sit still for extended periods of time.  She never went anywhere and was never able to enjoy life because of the chronic pain she was experiencing.  Dr Hadley looked at her x-rays and felt confident he could give her relief from her pain by doing a fusion on her lower back (L2-L5).  My mother is 67 years old so I was nervous about her going under anesthesia but Dr Hadley assured me he wouldn't do anything to my mother he wouldn't do on a loved one of his own.  My mother went in for surgery on July 14th and had two rods and three screws put into her lower lumbar region of her back.  In a matter of days, she had relief from the pain she had been experiencing for years!  Today, she is 4 weeks out from her surgery, an inch and a half taller, and she is doing wonderful!  Dr Mark Hadley and Dr David Aldridge were incredibly nice and we are eternally grateful to both of them for their kindness and help!  We are so thankful that Dr Hadley chose to use his God-given talents to help people, such as my mother, feel better and to be able to have an active lifestyle!

This was amazing news.\n\nWhen his office called me back a week later since I didn\u2019t call them back immediately.\n\nI explained that my family had younger children and I would just wait and the office staff was very nice with my choice and gave me all the information once I was ready to schedule the procedure.\n\nWell July 11, 2019 I could not put any weight on my right leg at all. I called his office that morning hoping to get an appointment. They had one very late appointment. We make it to the appointment and he reminds of all the issues with my back. Long story short here. I had to be admitted into the hospital that night to help get pain under control and observation because I couldn\u2019t use my right leg.\n\nThey did an MRI again and realized my back had significant changes in less than a years time.\n\nSomeone from his staff came by throughout the weekend and extended hospital stay.\n\nWe tried another conservative procedure on Monday and it didn\u2019t help.\n\nI still could not use my right leg or go up stairs during therapy Tuesday.\n\nWednesday we discuss surgery possibilities.\n\nTo say all of this he and his office staff went above and beyond trying to help me get some relief.\n\nHad I known how then that surgery would have been a success I would have scheduled the first day of my first appointment.\n\nI cannot say enough words to express what an amazing Neurosurgeon he is.\n\nThank you again for all you do for all your patients!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc82c6f852b:0x1aeab62b48f8cf51"}

He's friendly, knowledgeable, honest about the risks involved with my upcoming surgery, yet very reassuring.  I left feeling that I'm in good hands with him -- something that I needed desperately.\n\nUPDATE:  Thanks to Dr. Menendez, my spine surgery was a breeze, and, with the help of appropriate pain meds, so was my recovery period.  In three weeks' time, I was off the pain meds altogether and back to normal.  The two months leading up to my surgery, however, were pure hell.  I couldn't stand up long enough to brush my teeth and shave without the pain bringing me to my knees -- nearly in tears.  The first chiropractor I visited was treating me for Coccydynia -- a tailbone ailment.  When my PCP finally intervened, he ordered an MRI which revealed that I had a benign cyst growing on my lower spine -- just above my tailbone.  My PCP immediately referred me to Dr. Menendez at St. Vincent's (Birmingham) who, as far as I'm concerned, is a miracle worker.  Needless to say, the rest was history.  Dr. Menendez and the entire staff on all three shifts were SO NICE to me.  I hated to leave.  And, boy, the food at St. Vincent's (Birminham) is absolutely delish -- restaurant quality, in fact.  The morning of my discharge, they were serving Baked Ziti.  Because of the unusually large number of discharges that day, my nurse suggested that I order lunch just to be safe.  I was thrilled for the chance to experience one more of their amazing meals!  Imagine my disappointment when the nurse came to me that morning and told me I would be discharged at 11:00!  My heart sank!  As the hospital employee wheeled me outside to meet my ride home, the smell of fresh Baked Ziti filled the hospital corridors as they were delivering it to each lucky recipient.

No one told me I'd have to pay for parking in the parking garage, they gave me 10 pages of questions only to ask me all the same questions once I got in the room. Did you even look at it? I raised my concerns to multiple nurses only to have them tell me they're sorry, but they never said they would look into it or fix it. Dr. Zywicke just told me i needed physical therapy. She didn't provide a diagnosis until I asked, didn't give me a recovery time until I asked. She didn't schedule a follow up visit even though multiple Physical Therapists have asked me when my follow up is because they expected a follow up with the doctor.

Just make the drive to Birmingham or Nashville where you can find experienced doctors who actually want to help you. I saw Dr. Cho here twice, he's also the new guy they have to write his name in on the appointment cards. The first time I saw him was to evaluate my neck pain and get a diagnosis, then a treatment plan. On the first day they send you to physical therapy, this is just a given with any surgeon exhausting the possibility of anything working before surgery. Then you will also be set up with a pain doctor in their office, which will take you a week to see the first time then a month or two the next time. I expressed that I had no interest in being on pain medication and taking shots to come to find out was not the answer, nor the prescribed treatment for my condition, the only used option was surgery which he will not do because i'm not the most perfect patient for surgery. The condition i have is forminal spinal stenosis and it is advanced to the point over the years that it, as it almost always does, has exacerbated old injuries to my lower back and put me in a ton of pain. Dr. Cho doesn't care if you have a loss of feeling in you limbs, or you are in sever pain, I mean he doesn't even go over your MRI with you in the office, he puts it in his very formal text book response he creates and sends to your pain doctor. If you do any shots don't expect him to evaluate the area because he won't, nor will he do any physical examination to further understand your condition. The most he will do is set there and tell you what he thinks without discussing anything with you and you are supposed to live with it. I had a second and third opinion after my first initial visit, and both out of respect for their profession asked that i return for the second visit with Dr. Cho before I came back to them, because they were sure that he would do the surgery at least on my neck, so I could heal and work on becoming this perfect patient so he could or they could fix my lower back. The second opinion I had wasn't by my choice, it came when I was hospitalized for loss of my bladder and bowl control at my primary physicians office which is concerning especially when I also was having a hard time walking or standing. The third opinion I had locally just to confirm his and the ER surgeons diagnosis. So when i went back i again expressed my extreme disinterest in being drugged up or shot up every week, because two opinions and multiple medical studies i had read by this time all say the same thing. The only thing that fixes my problem with (in any patient) a near 100% rate of success is surgery. You can imagine my surprise when he went totally in the opposite direction. In short i'm scheduled for my surgery next week in Birmingham after seeing one of the surgeons at the neurosurgery center there, who actually had some reservations as to doing it early but consulted with another physician in the room with me (nice to not be left in the dark) and told me the recovery may take a week or two longer but they can fix the issue. Again, In Short save yourself the time of seeing someone who only cares about the money and how long they can keep you taking shot's, pills, and collecting from you and your insurance company. Not to mention i couldn't be released to my job until i was fully medically cleared, and taking pills and shots doesn't get you cleared for normal duty at your job. I've learned to go with my instincts lately with doctors, some you can tell first off if they are genuinely interested in helping you or are just there to collect as much money as possible. (this was my first instinct with Cho, yet i ignored it) and the rest is history, just hope others heed my advice on this guy.

I was rear ended Sept 18th 2015, Dr Tao, found out where the source of my pain was coming from and fixed it ONE BY ONE. First, I had a C 6-7 herniation, I had cervical surgery on that level Dec 1st 2015, didn't have to go to therapy or wear a neck brace. He used Glue to close my incision, no stitches, gauze or bleeding afterwards. Totally took away all of my neck issues.\n\nI lived in pain with sciatic and back pain in the si joint region for 8 months. He could have done back surgery and it would've failed, because, it wasn't in the upper spine, but in the si joint above my tailbone. He explained this to me, sent me for injections in the si joint, the injections relieved the pain for awhile. By doing this, he knew, this was the area that was damaged.\n\nI had been reading about the Triangular implants designed specifically to stabilize and fuse the heavily loaded SI joint.  which is called I FUSE. We discussed this procedure, and June 21st 2016 I had it done. It's now 7/7/2016 and I have no pain in my back or tailbone area or legs. The day of surgery, I was laying there before my surgery and thought I would cry from the back pain, when I woke up it was gone.\n\nI was on crutches less than 14 days after the surgery, It's fusing, and I am so glad I found Dr Tao and the Neuro Center in Huntsville Alabama. I would trust this group of Doctors, especially Dr Tao with my life. If you've had failed back surgeries, in pain, please go see him today. I'm glad I did. I am totally drug free! Didn't take any pain Killers after my surgery. Some bruising pain will happen for about 3 days, nothing like the pain I had before my surgery.\nDon't be afraid of the I-fuse surgery, at the moment I am walking around on both feet and can't even tell I had surgery June 21st 2015", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1468244078054, "text": "Thank you for trusting us with your care.
