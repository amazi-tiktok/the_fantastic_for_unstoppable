Great personality, takes time to explain things, patient with explanations and never tries to hurry through an appointment.  He has performed 3 surgeries on my back and I've always had immediate relief from pain, no complications after surgery, thorough and immediate response to any questions or concerns after surgery and is just an awesome doctor.  His team is also top notch.  They are all kind, patient and prompt.  I've never been left waiting for an endless time and am usually in and out of the appointment within 45 minutes to an hour total.

I received a shoulder injury this summer and was referred by Grandview ER to Dr. Moul.  I went to her office on a Monday and saw Dr. Sudduth who was so kind but felt that I needed to come back the next day and see Dr. Moul to talk about surgery.  I went back the next day and she looked at my X-rays, came in the examination room, and never examined  me.  She told me to take the sling off and go to physical therapy for three weeks which I did.  The therapists questioned why an MRI was never done and felt my injury was more severe than she thought and so did I.  When I returned 3 weeks later for my follow up she told me to stop therapy and gave me a steroid pack.  I told her how bad it was still hurting.  Still no MRI so I went to my regular doctor who sent me for an MRI.  I have a torn labrum and have an appointment with Dr. Andrews surgical group tomorrow.\n\nI had my surgery with Andrews  on 11/20/20 and had a labrum tear repair,  rotator cuff repair, and debris cleanup in my joint.  I am looking at a long recovery now which could have been avoided and already done with a simple MRI four months ago to see what was really going on inside my shoulder.  I am very frustrated because I spent  probably $700-800 dollars in unnecessary PT fees and copays which only made my issues worse.  Since surgery I have started PT but am fixing to experience a break in services because I have used my allotted physical therapy services for the year by being sent needlessly to therapy for a month by Dr. Moul instead of her taking the time to do an MRI to see what would have been obvious.  I am beyond frustrated with the situation above and will be looking into possible courses of action to recover expenses that could have been avoided if she had used reasonable medical judgement.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1605536459814, "text": "We would like the opportunity to address your concerns.

I was able to get an appointment with him rather quickly, which I was grateful for. Once seen by him I told him that I've been dealing with intense pain that felt like someone put a hot knife in my mid back since October. I've tried everything I could think of to help it out, I already take a daily NSAID, I'd seen a chiropractor (he took xrays and showed me that I had bone spurs and what looked like some degenerative discs) that no matter what I was only getting minimal relief from, I've started doing soft yoga, I've used large ice packs, a heating pad, I'm on an anti-inflammatory diet, and over the past year I've lost nearly 100lbs. I brought a copy of xrays of my thorasic and lumbar spine for him to see. His nurse took the CDs to have them imported to their software. After a few minutes he came in, introduced himself, and talked with me. He told me that there wasn't anything he saw that was a cause for concern, that he's a back surgeon and didn't forsee me needing back surgery or an epidural, I'm doing everything right, and that I'd be okay after some more time. That was it, no additional imaging, no PT orders, no real suggestion, nothing. His nurse then brought back the CDs, and on the thorasic spine disc there was a note that said \"Unable to import\" which leaves me to speculate that he wasn't even able to look at it. Of course I left feeling fairly defeated over the encounter.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks I decided to get a second opinion, PT orders were given, an MRI was ordered, and turns out I have 1 fairly large bone spur growing anteriorly, a couple of smaller ones, and 2 bulging discs in my thorasic spine putting pressure on my spinal cord. I'm being referred to a pain management doctor for epidurals.\n\nI will say, Dr. Revels was very nice, he never seemed blatantly rude or impatient. I understand there are people out there who have altered intentions, and I know a 24 year old wouldn't be assumed to have the problems I'm having, however that doesn't mean patients should be dismissed so easily.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d9deccfaa57:0xe49f1d0d8d617bd0"}

No exaggeration. And when you bring it to the staff's attention, everybody wants to pay the blame game but no one wants to take responsibility and apologize and help to correct the problem. This is an ongoing issue. I had an appointment two days ago and because of a slip up with my doctor's office my referral was not sent over. This was corrected within 15 minutes (the mandatory time for it to be corrected) yet still, I was in the waiting room an hour and a half before being seen. I was in the back another hour and a half before seeing the doctor. I explained this to Dr. Crotwell, and that I make my appointments early in the morning because I work at night, and I was tired and should have been out of the office. Instead of apologizing for the inconvenience, he did what he always does, bece argumentive and lied to make it seem like the error was mine, saying it took an hour to get the referral (an office manager debunked that lie, proving that it only took 15 minutes after I was called up, and theanager was outraged because I had been there 30 minutes before I was called up!) Then he wants to rush and hurt out of the office, doesn't sit still long enough to hear out your concerns, and treats you as if you are pill seeking because you ask for some kind of help with pain management! After years of this, it's to the point where I'm ready to start looking for another physician because I have voices my concerns and I don't want to be treated even more unfairly because I have. They talk extremely loud, and the walls are thin. I can hear him talking about other patients health when he's in another room, just like I could hear the nurse supervisor make a comment about me in the hallway.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d9deccfaa57:0x72d31cc6d9f2cb46"}

On Dec 8 2020 Dr. Bonazt entered the room and began talking with the door of the room wide open. I asked if he could close the door while we discussed my injury. His response no because of COVID-19 a violation of my patients rights mind you Dr. Bonazt was not wearing a mask nor gloves so much for concerns. Also, while waiting on him the door was closed the entire time and anyone else that entered closed the door behind them. He ask me what my job title was twice which I\u2019m sure was on my report. He indicated that the fracture was healing pretty good I didn\u2019t need surgery and therefore there was nothing else he could do. I question him because I must be 100% my strength in my hand indicated that I could hold up to13lbs briefly. I asked him for copies of the report he denied me of that also, stating that workman\u2019s comp would have to request it. Forgetting when I visit him the first time he did.

His staff was always attentive, called back regarding any concerns with the patient and his patients adored him. I also saw them recover well from their respective surgeries with fantastic outcomes.\n\nWhen I found myself in need of an orthopedist, I called the one I felt I had seen the best results in, in other patients. Dr Jones IV has seen me and my daughter now for several different injuries (4 different body parts between the 2 of us). He takes his time, listens to the problem/concern, discusses treatment options and respects that we, the patients, know our bodies the best. He doesn\u2019t just throw something quick at us (meds/braces/etc...) and run out the door.\n\nSo for those who have waited a while to see him and gotten frustrated... He would have spent the same time with you. Appointments are made to stagger the number of patients that come in at once- Some are early, some are late, some emergency injuries pop-up (but not enough to warrant an ER visit) and those patients are worked into the schedule in order to be seen as well. Doctors also take call and may be pulled out to treat a very emergent case.\n\nI have waited to see him for nearly 3 hrs once. I have also been in, out and pulling out of the parking deck in less than an hour. It\u2019s the nature of physicians and their occupation.

Few scars....perfect healing...small downtime...and he uses his arm wonderfully today.  It took four years to find Dr. Determen and we are forever grateful!   His staff and rehab is Amazing.  Bone growth is amazing!  We thought he would lose use of his arm.  This is an Amazing Ortho Doctor.   I hope he gets honored and lives well for all he does.  Another thing...he treats you well...very personable...finally trust!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1613777654828, "text": "So glad we were able to bring your husband relief after such a long, frustrating and painful road to recovery.

But anyway, I was scheduled for an MRI and didn't realize how claustrophobic I was until the day of.  I immediately left the hospital and came back to  the office and explained to the nurse the issue I had.  Her was response was we can only give you one pill. First of all, I was new patient and they know nothing about me.  I hate taking medicine, but I was desperate to find out what is wrong with my arm.  I have been on the same job for 16 years and only have to go to the doctor twice because of job related issues.  When I initially met Dr. Determann he seemed like he really wanted to find out what was going on as well. After getting the MRI he only saw a small spot and started saying his office wasn't in to do pain management and that I was able to go back to work as normal lifting same amount weight.  He also stated that I should not be on light duty.  The medicine he prescribed for me made me drowsy and I could not function, so I brought it back and asked the nurse to dispose of them. He mentioned physical therapy and it's been over a week and I have not heard from the office for an appointment.  He mentioned making a referral appointment to see a rheumatologist and I have not received an appointment yet.  It's sad to me for someone to assume and stereotype instead of giving me a real solution other than medicine. This small spot has had me off work for almost six weeks and the office would not even fill out fmla papers so I didn't have to use up all my annual leave.  Dr. Determann told me I had to go the physician that referred me to him for them to complete the paperwork. This really bothered me, so I went to Dr. Goldman at the Daphne received a much simpler solution that gave some much needed relief the next day.  Some people are actually hurting and not after a prescription.  I don't want to be contacted by email, text, calls, or any form of communication from this office.  I have already told some of my family and friends Do Not Come to this office in Fairhope.  The staff and environment in Daphne was like night and day.

My Sports Medicine MD referred me to Dr Gullung for surgery on my neck and back. I had anterior surgery on my cervical disks with the understanding that it may not work completely because the disks were so far out of place. He wanted to use the least painful procedure first in the hopes that it would take care of the pain.\nIt worked great for a few weeks, but then I started having more problems. When I had a CT scan done it showed that the disks were in alignment, but the bone was actually growing on the inside and had all but closed the area around my spinal cord. I had almost zero spinal fluid going through the canal. He pushed me to the front of the scheduled surgeries to prevent my spinal cord from being damaged. He did the posterior surgery then. He removed the bone from two disks and cleared out the excess bone on a couple of more to get my spinal fluid going back to normal and prevent the bone from cutting into my cord. I wore a bone stimulator for twelve weeks and, even to his surprise, the bone had grown back together at the back.\nI still have some pain and numbness at times, however he informed me prior to surgery that it may take a year or so to get complete relief.\nI appreciate everything he did and his staff is always very friendly and helpful. Thank you Dr. Gullung for relieving the pain I\u2019ve had for years. You helped me even when two Spinal Surgeons told me that there was no hope and that one day I would turn my head and I would be paralyzed for the rest of my life or I would sever the nerve that would stop my breathing or keeps my heart beating.\nYou are a God sent doctor and I appreciate you more than you know.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891be6c71875c5:0x69a596228b65a89"}

But I was back to work full time 6 weeks after surgery, walking the cement factory floor and climbing the 20 steps to my office loft without a problem.     I could have made my surgery and rehab even better if I prepared for it better; more exercise, more strength building in my knee, and dropped a few pounds before surgery.\n\nI give Dr. Moore and staff an A+.

The procedure went well at the time as I suffered from Femoral Acetabular Impingement (FAI) and prior to surgery was in severe pain where walking was a major undertaking.  FAI is a debilitating condition where basically the femur is too big for the hip socket and leads to extremely painful bone on bone arthritis (I was 47 when I had my first procedure performed and prior to the procedure walked as if I was in my 80s).  I was scheduled for THR on my left hip in March of 2020 with Dr Moore and despite the Covid-19 pandemic was eagerly looking forward to the surgery.  Dr Moore ended up cancelling my surgery for what he deemed more \"needy and critical\" patients.  I was upset at this decision given my FAI condition and called to discuss my options with Dr Moore.  After a heated conversation with Dr Moore I ended up being banned from Andrews Sports Medicine.  As a result, I went to Dr Shane Buggay with OrthoSports Associates who performed THR on my left hip in May of 2020.  Today my left hip feels great while I have some pain \"flair ups\" from time to time in my right hip. Dr Buggay \"radiated\" my left hip prior to his procedure, whereas Dr Moore did not \"radiate\" my right hip prior to his procedure and I suspect that may be the reason for the differences in how each hip feels today.  For anyone looking at a THR, I recommend Dr Shane Buggay with OrthoSports Associates, he is a great compassionate surgeon who has a working knowledge of his patients, whereas  Dr Moore dropped me as a patient when I needed him the most.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1576190644856, "text": "Thank you for your kind words, and for taking the time to share your experience."}, "gmap_id": "0x88891b49f790dcdf:0x203bf41fc82fe812"}

His nurse practictioner takes on the same attitude, she was as crass and insulting as they come. She is that way because he is that way. There is a single word to describe her that I will for integrity sake leave out. My surgery consultation was on Thursday and he was very willing to schedule my surgery for the following Monday however would not tell me what he planned to do procedure wise. I had many uneasy feelings due to his haughty attitude but continued to ask questions so I could make a well informed decision about my surgery. He talked down to me like I was an uneducated piece of garbage and had no sense. Still trying to overlook the insults, I continued to attempt to ask questions, but was rudely shut down as he walked right out the door with me still asking for information. I was very shocked and upset about the entire experience because my family/I have always had such wonderful experiences with the doctors/surgeons of Andrews Sports Medicine. I am rather taken back that they continue to allow such a fester to be a part of their team. I left there and immediately searched for another surgeon AND facility. He now gives me apprehensions about Andrews judgement in allowing him to continue to practice there. My thoughts were, he may be a good surgeon but who in their right mind would want that hateful and uncaring of a person to DO the surgery and then be THE person they rely on for the next 6-8 months in healing/recovery. He does not deserve the one star I had to choose in doing my review. Please don\u2019t waste your time with him. He & his nurse practitioner are NOT the caring and compassionate people that doctors and nurses are called to be.***Oh...never even saw one of the many X-rays that were taken of my foot.

The Dr. I saw was Dr. Norman E. Waldrop III. Dr. Waldrop was very friendly. His staff was friendly and I have only once had to wait 30 past my appointment time. Dr. Waldrop is the only surgeon that took time to listen and propose an approach that took a less invasive step first. There are times I have noticed his demeanor seems rushed, matter of fact, or less talkative but he has never been rude or talked down to me. I drive 2 hours to visit his office. My drive down is longer than my wait and visit combined. Here locally, the TOC branch has kept me waiting in the lobby 3 hours beyond my appointment time plus an additional 50 minutes in the patient room. I highly recommend Dr. Waldrop.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc9dd09ad61:0x3abf8613961397d5"}

He is one of the most uncompassionate people that my family has ever encountered. It's very apparent that he does not care about his patients, but only the number of patients he sees a day, and how much money he can get from them. My family drives 2 hours just to go to an appointment and within 45 seconds into the visit, he is already standing by the door with his hand on the knob, ready to leave. He has no heart for his patients and seems to be very cocky and arrogant. Once he does any type of surgery on you, and has your money, he seems to wash his hands of you, because he thinks his job is done. He is a \"know-it- all\" and doesn't respect his patients enough to take time to listen to questions or concerns. After several visits to him, with my mother breaking down into tears just in the hallway, we are choosing that \"enough is enough!\". It doesn't matter if we have to drive halfway across the state to find a new doctor,  it will be well worth it, not to ever have to deal with Dr. Waldrop again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc9dd09ad61:0x3abf8613961397d5"}

He told me he was going to have some prescriptions called in to my pharmacy specifically so that I would have the weekend to let them take effect before going back to work on Monday.  No prescriptions were called in. I called the Lemak answering service several times on Saturday.  It took over an hour to get an answer. The woman was rude, talked over me and repeatedly asked  for the same info re: my pharmacy. I finally spoke with someone at Lemak and was told that I would have to wait until Monday, but I could take up to 12 Advil per day in the meantime. She told me to call back on Monday. Which I did, leaving a message for Dr. Sorrell\u2019s nurse. I didn\u2019t receive a return call, but I have received notice from my pharmacy that the prescriptions have been filled. I will never go back to Lemak because of the poor customer service. The person I talked to from Lemak on Saturday should have taken my name and number and had someone call me on Monday since it was their mistake. I should not have had to chase them down. At the very least, I should have received a phone call acknowledging my message of this morning, apologizing for the inconvenience and letting me know they called in the prescriptions.

I had Orthoscopic Surgery on my knee about 15 months earlier.  This was my second follow up appointment with Dr. Eslava since the surgery.\nDuring my examination, Dr. Eslava projected professionalism, confidence, and knowledge.  He worked quickly, but throughly, to access my physical situation and to establish a plan of action based on my goals.  He had a training assistant with him during our review of my case and our plan of action.  Dr. Eslava ordered current xrays of both knees for a comparison of my \u201cgood knee\u201d with my \u201cbad knee\u201d.  He showed me the xrays, which clearly confirmed an increased \u201cbone-on-bone\u201d issue with my \u201cbad knee\u201d.\nI was anticipating his recommendation for a total knee replacement, however, he told me about a new procedure available for patients who were not ideal candidates for such an invasive answer for knee joint pain relief.  He described the \u201cCoolief Procedure\u201d and provided his reasoning for this treatment.  He is referring me to another local physician, outside The Orthopaedic Group, for consultation about having the procedure performed.  Meanwhile, he recommended a joint injection to offer the possibility of immediate pain relief.  The injection was administered and I walked out carrying my walking cane rather than leaning on it.  So, my rating for Dr. Eslava is as high as possible.\nMy 2 hour (+) wait to see Dr. Eslava was unexpected, and could likely have been partially avoided with better scheduling and more efficient paper flow at the receptionist area.  In defense of the \u201cGroup\u201d, My appointment was mid-afternoon and the doctor was working with a training assistant.  In the future, I will schedule appointments earlier in the day if possible.\nI do recommend \u201cThe Orthopaedic Group\u201d and I am very appreciative for Dr. Eslava\u2019s knowledge and skills.

I fell on a flight of stairs and badly broke both the radius and the ulna of my forearm, below the wrist. The bones were badly out of place and I was very shocked and freaked out. We walked into the emergency room and it was a serene and quiet atmosphere. They told me I would be put into a room as quickly as possible and it happened very soon. People started tending to me immediately and I was given pain medicine. An x-ray machine was brought to the room so I was able to stay in bed while they did the films. As soon as they had the information from the x-rays, they gave me a \u201cwaking sleep\u201d anesthesia while they moved the bones back into position (called reduction.). I felt nothing during the procedure, thank goodness.  When I woke back up, the pain was gone and my arm had been splinted so that the bones couldn\u2019t move out of place. They put my arm in a sling and started asking me which doctor I would like to use for the surgery. We had no idea and started scrambling for information. We made some calls, and it was a week before anyone could even see us to evaluate.  The doctor who splinted my arm, Dr Herring, strongly suggested the orthopaedist in the building, Dr Stephen Gould. We looked Dr Gould up and he came from Johns Hopkins Hospital, so we thankfully said \u201cYes!\u201d  Dr Herring had been sending all my films and information updates to Dr Gould from the  time I arrived. He was ready to see me that afternoon!  We simply walked down the hall from the room I had been in and I saw Dr Gould after a short wait. My surgery was scheduled in a few days and it happened at Medical West Hospital in Bessemer. There I had another Excellent experience from the UAB Health System!  The bones and incision have healed beautifully and I am sold - I am changing doctors so that I will be using this health system from now on. Thank you to Dr Herring and Dr Gould and staff who cared for me so well.\nAnne Sockwell\nHoover, AL", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888921a9979e2dbb:0xf969829d4902293d"}

I fight cancer and I have been fighting 9 yrs so I am familiar with the medical field and billing - errors do happen on their part! They are not beyond making a mistake! Radiology at UAB West who did the MRI should have told her the correct copay amount before getting the scan! To assure the patient can pay before services rendered and to assure they get their money. It is common courtesy and practice for a pre-scheduled test or scan like that for the staff to have the correct copay available for the patient! Well they did not and on the phone and speaking to whoever was over billing at UAB West the lady got very rude and and said my mom should know what she should have paid~ I have never heard of such and they need to learn how to treat customers, last I check, patients and insurance companies pay their salaries!

My back kept becoming worse and the pain got to the point I couldnt take it anymore after hurting for about 6 years. Dr. Heck told me that he could help me but i had to have a long and extensive back surgery that was about 5 to 6 hours long. I was ready for anything and I left his office that day confident he would help me.\nDr. Heck came out 3 times during the surgery to speak to my husband to let him know how I was doing, and where he was in the surgery. That meant so much to my husband and me that he had that much consideration not to leave my husband wondering what was going on.\nI came out of surgery that day PAINFREE, after 6 years of constant hurting.  I was Up walking around the hospital floor on the second day feeling like wonder woman, I went home on the 3rd day. I can also walk straight and stand straight. That was a bonus that I didn't know that could be fixed.\nEveryone from the nurse care in recovery, the nurses there on the floor that took the most gentle and sweet care of me. The sweet people that brought your food, the folks that came to your room to get your food order, to the sweet sweet girls that cleaned my room were a joy to be around. GREAT HOSPITAL!!\nBoth of Dr Heck's office staff are great and attentive.

I called their office to find out why I received a letter saying I owed money since I was recently just in their office and they never mentioned this balance before. I found out they recently did an audit on September 28th, 2018 and realized they made an internal accounting error from 4 years ago. So when my account was adjusted back from THEIR mistakes, my account showed an open balance and they sent me a bill demanding payment.\n\nLong story short - Their company made an internal accounting error and they just caught this 4 years later and are now trying to back charge their patients for their OWN mistakes in their accounting department. I went down to their office and they were not willing to work things out with me based off of their own negligence in their bookkeeping department. Not until I told them that my attorney and I were going to sue them and I was going to bring in Fox 6 News on your side (to expose their company with what they were doing behind the scenes to their patients) did they try to eliminate my bill from where they made a mistake (now my patient balance is zero - how convenient).

WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND!!!!  It's so hard as a parent to heard your child crying because they are tired of hurting & there's nothing you can do.

My ENTIRE family uses UOC when we need an orthopedic specialist.  One family member in particular uses them for cortisone injections every few months.

She called to schedule an appointment and was told that it will be Monday Jan. 4TH before they can get her in unless there is a break or fracture.  So she had to go to her primary doctor after the E.R.(pay another 35.00 copay after the 150.00 E.R. copay) to have him order more x-rays.  I called to see if there was any way to get her in trying to explain the situation that she couldn't wait another 6 days even if it wasn't broke or fractured (she can't put any weight on it and its about the size of a softball)  when she originally injured her foot on Dec. 23rd and the receptionist said there was nothing she could do so I ask to speak to the office manager.  I was transferred to Jennifer Germain.  I have never in my life had someone yell at me like she did.  I was a firm believer in UOC until now.  I bet if the physicians knew this is how their practice was being ran they would probably make several staff changes starting with Ms. Germain.  I know that every place of business has rules and I have worked with the public for several years, so I truly get it.  But to yell at someone..... WOW! I don't care if I broke every bone in my body.

Trying to speak to anyone at his office was very difficult. It took almost 2 weeks of leaving messages on their answering service every 3 days (I did not call them daily. I imagine that would be annoying if your were busy) to get my visit scheduled. The visit was great. The doctor seemed nice and was very thorough. I told the doctor I could call to set up my surgery that afternoon after speaking with my wife. He gave me their direct number so I would not have the same problem of not being able to speak to someone. I called 2 hours later to set up the appointment. I was sent straight to voice mail. I left a message, and my call was not returned. I called again Monday morning and left another message. I never mentioned the problems I had about not getting my calls returned. I am always polite and understanding, but this got very aggravating.  My call was not returned Monday either. I called once again Tuesday afternoon. Straight to voice mail. I called the office's main line number, and told them I am having a problem trying to speak to anyone. They put me on hold, and the coordinator I had been trying to reach answered. She was very nice. She told me they were very busy, and would not have a surgery appointment available for another month and a half. I said it would probably be best if I saw another doctor. She then said she may have an opening in 9 days. I told her that would be awesome. She said let her check a couple of things and she would call me back in a few minutes. Minutes! She did not return my call. I would need physical therapy after the surgery, and there is no way I could possibly go through all that to set up more appointments. I think they may be too busy for new patients. I had to go back to their office, and pay for parking to get my MRI back. I wasted 3 weeks, my co pay, and parking fees. Very frustrating! I called another Orthopedic doctor's office, and they returned my call in 30 mins. and set up an appointment to see their doctor for 3 days later. That being said, Dr. Adkison seems like a great doctor, and the staff is very friendly.

I enjoy his friendly manner and laid back personality. He is a great surgeon. His support staff are really good too.\nHowever, not so happy with Alabama Orthopedic. The waiting area is overcrowded with no possibility of social distancing. Even for a morning appointment, the parking lot is full as is the waiting area. Hardly any waiting patients wear masks. Nobody is cleaning seats or attempting to sanitize seats or counters. For my 9:15 am  appointment, I waited in the general waiting until 11:40 then was finally moved to a hallway waiting area for another hour before seeing the doctor.\n\nMy injury required surgery scheduled for a future date.  Seven days proir to surgery I was required to post payment for co-payment. On the day of my surgery I arrived at 11:45 am for a scheduled surgery at 12:15. Due to COVID rules, my wife was required to wait in her vehicle in a parking lot with signs clearly marked \u201cfor outpatient surgery patients only\". All shady spots were filled by unoccupied cars. After three hours with no word,  my wife called to see if I was alright. Was told by the AOC Surgery staff that I was being taken into surgery now (3:45 pm).\nWhile waiting in a hot vehicle in the Surgery Center hot parking lot, several AOC Surgery employees dressed in medical smocks came out and drove away in vehicles parked in the shady reserved spots. That sucks. At 4:30 she was called to come get me. Over four hours in a hot parking lot is absurd.\nAt postop appointment,  I still waited two hours past appointment time to see the doctor. Let me be clear. Again, nothing but praise for Dr. McAndrew.\nI cancelled my appointment for a second postop appointment to remove stitches. I\u2019ll pull them out myself. I live 40 miles from AOC and don\u2019t want to waste any more time waiting to see the doctor. I realize that the Doctors and staff are overbooked, but maybe it would be better to book patients farther out than to overbook knowing that appointment times were not realistic.

It is obvious that his provision of QUALITY care differs from patient to patient. The entire experience was disappointing, from the almost 3 hour wait to be called to the back, to his non existent bedside manner. I will not mention the experiences with the office staff, as I understand he may not be in control of outside occurrences. After the wait, the actual interaction with him felt rushed as he made my back pain feel insignificant by saying \u201cwell my back hurts all the time, stretch\u201d. He spends no more than 10 minutes with me basically telling me to deal with it. He then goes on to make a comment about him being a surgeon, making my case seemingly a waste of time for him, but also not wanting to refer me to someone else. Allow me to let the record show, I have a high pain tolerance and I do not like taking pain meds. I made it clear to him I was not looking for medication and that it took a lot for me to make the appointment in the first place. I am a new nurse who had to take a break from bedside nursing. He proceeds to make a joke of my situation and states \u201cyou know what they call a nurse with a bad back? Unemployed\u201d. But wait! Theres more.. after not offering ANY education about body mechanics, posturing, lifting, etc. or anything worth the troubles I had experienced thus far, he ends the appointment by asking me will I leave him a good review as to not interfere with his 5 star rating and actually points to his 5 star picture on the wall. I don\u2019t ever leave reviews on the internet, about anything, but I am so appalled at the audacity of him to freely and openly make light of my pain.

Normally, I like that. People who are dry are usually blunt and to the point. This time I felt like I was a waste of his time, just another random patient sent in on referral. He asked me what happened and as I started telling him, he put his hand up in my face and told me he didn't want to hear it. Then he lifts up my sleeve on the right arm when I was there for my left arm. I get the shot, the prescription which I filled there, and went home. For the next three days I had severe shoulder pain where the shot was introduced. I Googled it only to find out that the shot can cause that type of pain for usually 48 hours. I was never told that.\n\nMike is funny and has a great personality. The girl at the front desk was polite, busy, and grateful I brought in all the paperwork she needed including copies of my license and insurance card. The nurse was polite and hurried. The doctor needs better manners. Don't ask questions if you don't want answers.\n\nI do NOT recommend this doctor and I will NOT use him again! The ONLY reason I am giving this three stars is for his staff.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb28d5df20b1b:0xbfc8c5f02721826f"}

I have full use of my arm now and it doesn't hurt.\nNow I need to have shoulder surgery on the other shoulder due to bone spurs and guess who my Dr. will be ?????

After my current pediatrician, Dr. Rivas, advised it was time to transition to an adult provider. During the time he was my provider, Dr. Ginevan worked alongside my psychiatrist to continue maintenance of my ADHD and when necessary, he worked with specialists to manage my delicate GI condition. This included references to appropriate clinics and scheduling of applicable tests ie. Colonoscopy, EGD, etc. I truly trusted Dr. Ginevan and was incredibly grateful to have found such a wonderful physician. I never minded the fact that his office was always moving locations or that his appointments had become a nightmare to secure. I still referred only my closest of friends and family to see him. Always assuring them they'd be nothing less than satisfied with him as they're provider. Those were the old days... in 2013 I moved away to live on base with my then husband. I moved back in 2015 and returned to Dr. Ginevan. He and his staff had undergone a complete restructuring as they were now a part of the mega-merger trend and had merged with the tri-cities health giant Shoals Primary Care LLC. Due to the merger Dr. Ginevan no longer had any of my previous medical records from all of my time spent under his care which led to massive complications to my continuity of care. (I now understand the importance of my responsibility to secure medical history documentation and maintain my own current updated personal medical record.) Also, SADLY, due to the implementation of a governmental-esque standard of operating procedures, it is my opinion that Dr. Ginevan no longer maintained the level of patient care he had became known for. His office staff has always been grade-A; to be commended. If you are considering seeing Dr. Ginevan as your primary care provider this review is for you. In closing I want to say that this review in no way, intends to slander or cause malice.

I ignored that fact and still decided to give the doctor the benefit of the doubt because I could understand things sometimes happen. However, upon my scheduled visit as a first time patient it was for 7:30 am, and I arrived at 7:15 am for new patient paper work. I signed in and no one even showed up at the front desk until my appointment time, where I  then asked for my paper work and filled it out. About ten minutes after that, another woman called me by the wrong name and when I corrected her, I was made to feel as if I had done something wrong. Also, you can not hear when you are being called because the TV is loud, so people are talking over the TV, and I have two ear infections. After filling out my paper work, I was then called back to the window, where I was asked to write down my SSN, but I had already written it down twice on the form already. This told me they obviously were not paying attention to the information they were entering. After this, and already feeling on edge from just the front desk experience, I am called back by the doctor's nurse practitioner who tells me to step on the scale, and with a horrible tone says, \"you're going to have to take some of that off.\" Meaning my purse. I ask where I should put it in case of a designated area, which seem to make her even more annoyed and she replies with, \"I don't know.\" Very snappy. I am a new patient and felt like I was asking a very simple and non offensive question. We then walk to the exam room where she informs me that I would not be seeing the doctor and that he also would never been doing my exams or ever seeing me other than a quick peek in the room. Which, as someone looking for a long term doctor, it does not feel comfortable not even meeting my doctor on the first visit. When I tried to explain that I was uncomfortable with the fact she would only be relaying my issues to the doctor, and that I didn't feel comfortable having my health looked after in third person, and that I didnt understand why they wouldn't tell a new patient to begin with when making an appointment that he or she won't be seeing a doctor. She then got upset about it and told me I could reschedule or abort because she had been doing this for 40 years. Which is fine and I explained to her I was fine with her seeing me, but that I didn't feel comfortable having a doctor diagnose me without speaking with me and knowing me as a person. She gets more upset and I said I think it would be best just to cancel because at that point, being someone who has been diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder, I was overwhelmed and ready to go home. She proceeded to then say to me, \"Fine then. Adios.\" I feel as if the entire situation was unprofessional on many different levels. I decided to keep searching for a new doctor. I would not advise this practice if you want to get to know your doctor for long term use, or have anxiety issues, seeing as how it is the only doctor's office I have ever been in where the lobby is loud and over packed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x887d48b48019956d:0x80858f3d5bf2d029"}

I\u2019ve been having shoulder pain that has been getting progressively worse for the last two month. When I called for an appointment, I was given one two days later.\nCheck in was very simple.\nAnd I waited  about ten minutes from the time I checked in till I time a nurse got me to get xrays in his office. After the xrays I was seen by Dr Greco about ten minutes later. Dr Greco examined me and reviewed my xrays  with me and proceeded to explain quite clearly what my problem was. He outlined treatment options with me. This included injecting my shoulder that they did during this visit. I was a little nervous about the shoulder injection but before I knew it, they were done with minimal discomfort. I\u2019m glad to say that shortly after the injection, the pain was gone in my shoulder. I\u2019m scheduled for some follow up xrays and a return visit.\nDr Greco has made me feel so at ease about my problem and his approach to getting me through this. Although I have been putting off seeing someone about my shoulder pain, I\u2019m so glad I saw Dr Greco today. I\u2019d say on a scale of one to ten, Dr Greco is a fifteen.

I had a core decompression on hips that went bad. I could barely walk enough to get to my car and couldn't reach my feet. I'm an active duty police lieutenant and firearms instructor. It's hard to teach on the range on crutches and barely able to walk 25 yards. My officers were begging to stop hurting myself for them and retire. Dr. Ryan advised what he thought was best and explained my options and was honest about which options he thought would work. Unlike other experiences he didn't push for surgery, just suggested it as the best option and would do what I decided,  His staff were very kind and caring. Always seemed to remember me. They were careful to explain to my wife and meet her needs to be my caregiver while I healed. The orthopedic surgery pre-op staff and nurses were kind and went out of their way to check on me both prior and after my surgery. Both hospital stays, at St. Thomas, I had the most amazing hospital nurses I've ever had during all my hospital stays in the past, I've had plenty. They not only took of me, but took care of the family that stayed with me, especially my wife. They were careful to check on her needs too. Physical therapy in the hospital, therapist were careful to explain what they were showing me and  watched for my safety. Wish I would have known about Andrews Sports Medicine and St. Thomas Hospital years ago. I am still healing from second hip replacement. I can now reach my feet, put on my own socks and shoes, pick something off the floor, get in my truck and start looking for a time to ride my Harley. Haven't even to just sit on it in three years. Because of Doc and all the others involved I can walk and serve the public for more years, I can teach on the range, I can play with my grandchildren. I'm going from can't get off the bed to being able to get down the steps to enter my house. Still hurting some, still healing, learning to walk again. I know this is wordy, but I can't thank everybody enough for their professionalism and caring. I can have some quality of life and career  back.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1598622643978, "text": "Mr. Christianson, thank you so much!

It was evident in many ways beginning with his scheduling staff having  to deal with so many unknowns as a result of COVID-19. Personally I was expecting delays in my surgical procedure, but to my surprise, delight and shock my procedure was performed at its regular scheduled time, without any delay. Something almost unheard of with the present state of how COVID-19 has interrupted so many functions of our everyday life.\n\nDr. Ryan's professionalism and bedside manner was phenomenal, from the time he entered the treatment room till the time he left the room, from answering all my questions and concerns to my satisfaction. It also goes without saying I am totally satisfied with how both my surgical procedure went and how fast I have been able to recover. His skills as a surgeon are excellent.\n\nIn closing,  I am a very satisfied patient. therefore in the future and  if I should ever need further orthopedic care Andrew's Sports Medicine with always be the first place I will go.\n\nSincerely,\nDr. Thomas D.

After a surgical consult with a different orthopedic surgeon in early March, left me feeling hopeless.  As the first surgeon repeatedly referred to me as a high risk patient.  Expected to suffer serious complications, if not death.\n\nBy the time I arrived at Dr. Siegel's office, for a second opinion.  To say that I was apprehensive would have been a understatement.   To be honest, thanks to the first orthopedic surgeon, my confidence and nerves were totally shattered.  Only for Dr. Siegel to enter the exam room and quickly put my fears to rest.  Me leaving his office with total knee replacement surgery scheduled for May 5, 2021.\n\nI am seven weeks post opt today.  After a overnight stay at UAB Highlands, I was discharged to recover at home.  By day three; I transitioned from using a walker to a cane.  By day four, I no longer needed opioids to control my pain.  In recent weeks, I have gained the ability to walk a couple of blocks without any assistive devices needed.  I go to outpatient physical therapy twice a week.  My only set back at this time is swelling and the inability to bend my knee more than a 100 degrees.  Which is a little compromised due to a second surgery on the same day, to release and stretch my Achilles tendon.  That was preformed by a different orthopedic surgeon.\n\nIf you are in need of arthroplasty AKA total knee replacement surgery.  Knowing what I know now.  Dr. Herrick Siegel is absolutely the best.  I cannot thank Dr. Siegel enough for helping me reclaim my mobility.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1624480664941, "text": "Thank you very much Ms Crain for taking the time to write a review.

My second visit I left crying because he screamed at me so bad as if I was lying and made my injury up just to get paid under workers comp because he ordered a carpal tunnel test that came back positive be he explained to me the Dr. was wrong who performed the test and that half the people in the lobby would come back positive for carpal tunnel even though they don't have it. My thoughts was why would you test me for carpal tunnel which would include the middle finger, the pointer finger and the thumb only when I have clearly from day one told you my pinky finger and ring finger are numb and painful which would be cubital tunnel. So for his mistake I was scolded like a toddler. He then ordered an MRI which came back schowing a tear in my right wrist on my tfc disk and on top of that an ganglion cyst 16mm by 6 mm that has grown inside my inner wrist. When the results came back he canceled my visit and told his staff to inform me that I need to find another doctor to assist me...WOW IS ALL I CAN SAY!!! All that attitude and harsh treatment and didn't have the nerve to face me because you was wrong all along!!! Humble yourself Dr. Rachael!!!!!! PLEASE BEWARE!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb2bf1602ed2d:0x7ca937ad22323b0f"}

Our appointment with Dr. Wilson was one month ago.  He stated that he could not help my husband's issue and suggested that he see a local neurologist.  We appreciated his honesty.  Since our regular Parkinson's neurologist is in Atlanta, Dr. Wilson said that he would refer us to a neurologist and forward the records.  As of today's date, we haven't heard a word from anyone.....we would assume that if there was an issue with a new appointment, we would have been contacted by Dr. Wilson's office.  I am sure that The Orthopedic Clinic and Dr. Wilson are very good at what they do, but we would have appreciated at least having a follow up of some sort.  Was the referral ever made?  We have no idea since we don't know the name of the neurologist he was referring my husband to, so cannot call that office for confirmation.  I don't feel I should have to call Dr. Wilson's staff to make sure the referral was even made.  We will be seeking help ourselves elsewhere.\n\nUPDATE AS OF OCTOBER 3, 2018  We finally received a letter from a neurologist in Auburn giving us an appointment date.  No phone calls, nothing.  Just a letter telling when to be there.  And by the way, the appointment is scheduled 11 MONTHS after our appointment with Dr. Wilson.  Seriously?  January of 2019.

He was putting on his coat to leave when he finally entered the room.  She had seen a doctor in California who had told her she could never work again, her shoulder was completely torn.  She was in so much pain she couldn't move.  This doctor, in all honesty, never even touched her shoulder.  He prescribed addictive opioids and told her to go back to work on Monday.  He didn't even examine her.  She requested a report from the office, so that she could give it to the next doctor she saw (she would never set foot in this office again) and it said all these things about how much movement, flexibility, etc. she had in her shoulder, as if he had examined her.  Again, he never even touched her.  Normally I would not write something like this, but I was appalled at how horribly these people would treat my lovely kind mother.  When my mom asked him about disability (again, she was in too much pain to move her arm, and my mom is *not* a complainer) he told her to go back to work, and if she couldn't do it because of the pain, to find a new job.  She pointed out that if she did that she would lose her health insurance, and he just shrugged.  So, that was our experience.

Visited at the recommendation of my physical therapist for a shoulder issue. When I got to the lobby I could tell this place is set up for mass production: there were check-in kiosks like at the airport and a bunch of people waiting. When I was called the first time, it was to pay. When I was called the second time, I was led to a second  waiting room with no explanation. The third time I was led to an x-ray room where I found out I was getting x-rays. Surprise! Eventually, I was led to an examination room. No vitals were taken. I waited. Eventually, a doctor - not the one I had the appointment with - showed up and immediately started to discuss scheduling surgery without examination. He discussed two procedures - the second one was news to me. When I inquired, he then tested my range of motion to confirm what he had seen in the tests. I expressed doubts about the second procedure and he left to get the originally-scheduled doctor. After nearly 30 minutes, they both came back. The second (scheduled) doctor explained why he recommended the second procedure as a preemptive option. He did a good job of explaining the surgery and recovery. He left and the first doctor took me to a scheduler. Everyone I interacted with was cordial and professional. I never saw my x-rays nor the MRI I had brought with me. I realize this place is good and they have a lot of people to get to. I known they are all fine surgeons. But still, I felt like one more item to check off on their to-do list. I still have unanswered  questions and it is ironic that being there for 2.5 hours and waiting most of the time, that I felt rushed when it came to the consultation. In summary, one of the best places for surgery, but don't expect \"the personal touch.\"", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1576603498313, "text": "Thank you for your candid response.

I was without pain, discharged, and went home the same day. Ten days after surgery I drove non-stop from Meridian, Mississippi to San Antonio, Texas. Last July he performed Lumbar Laminectomy surgery and removed the debris and spurs that were causing numbness in both legs and prohibited me from standing up straight. Again, discharged the same day, feeling returned to both legs and walking as the Good Lord intended.  There is not another Doctor on the planet I would allow to cut on my spine than Dr. Nichols.\n\nHis professionalism exemplifies what Andrews Sports Medicine stands for.  My family and I were always given  the same care and concern as the professional athletes they have become famous for treating. Simple logic dictates that if world class professional athletes with unlimited resources, who depend on their bodies performing at the level they do, seek out his services, it must be top notch.

My wife is likewise an RN, with clinical and Ph.D. Teaching experience. The location chosen for the surgery was the Grandview Medical Center.\nThe approach to the surgery prep is unusual...called ERAS.under this approach, you drink fluids up to two hours before surgery, you have spinal anesthesia, a mid thigh nerve block, and heavy conscious sedation. After the surgery, you return to your room for a delicious breakfast, and a lot of attention from a great staff. They even feed you a great lunch later in the day! You ambulated with a walker to the bathroom, then down the hall to the PT gym for some easy stair climbing. Pain was totally controlled. Then you go home! And start PT at the facility of your choice, amazing everyone how quickly you are recovering! Phenomenal medical staff, prep and operating room staff, and post op care.smiling, obviously enjoying their work, and exceeding every reasonable expectation. Even had the housekeeper supervisor check on my room cleanliness...and a great young attendant, studying to be an RN took me to my car.\nTotal world class experience, on both the \u201chotel\u201d side and the professional staff.\nDr. Appell takes his time, explains your situation, options, and choices, to both the patient and spouse.

I was asked why I didn't get tested at JSC and explained that it was more convient to have it locally.  She stated that she lived south of Montgomery and came to work every day.  This really upset me!  Long story short I had already spent a whole afternoon getting tested and by the time she called had already begun the prep and had to cancel the procedure.

She diagnosed me with carpal tunnel which was confirmed by a nerve conduction test. At the first visit she wanted to give me a steroid injection but I told her because of health issues my Rheumatologist recommended I not take them. She said it was a local injection and not systemic but I reiterated I could not do it. She was very annoyed I would not get the injection. When I asked her what else I could do for the pain she said there was nothing else I could do for it. I did my own research and started getting massages, acupuncture, and did essential oils. I went back for a second visit and she was nicer and seemed a little more concerned about me since I was still in so much pain. At this point the pain had started shooting up my arm. She said to try hand therapy for a couple of weeks and if that didn't help we could discuss surgery. I did therapy which still did not improve my condition and went back to her for a third visit. This time Dr. McKeon flat out refused to discuss surgery. She dismissed all the notes the hand therapist had sent her and told me she felt like I had mild carpal tunnel and the pain I was having was caused by the hand brace I had been wearing and it was a completely different nerve causing the pain. The pain had not changed and the brace actually made it more tolerable. She told me to stop wearing the brace during the day and only wear it while I slept. She then gave me two doctors' names if I wanted a second opinion. At this point I was crying because I was so frustrated she was not willing to discuss surgery. I did go for a independent second opinion but not to the doctors she recommended. I have an anesthesiologist friend who recommended a hand orthopedist he worked with. I was able to get in to see that orthopedist the next day. This doctor was the total opposite of Dr. McKeon. He listened to me and had compassion for the pain I had been living with for months. He said I had tried all other measures and at this point surgery was the best option to get rid of the pain. I had carpal tunnel release surgery the next week. It is a very simple out patient surgery that takes about 15 minutes. When I woke up from the surgery 100% of the pain, numbness, and tingling was gone. I wished I had gone to the second doctor months before I did but was willing to give Dr. McKeon a chance when she said we could discuss surgery if I did the therapy and that didn't help.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bc9def617db:0x851470cf93fea328"}

I think he treats his own as such and others such as myself as someone he wants out of his face as soon as possible. Maybe it's his personality or because it's a big office that sees lots of people that makes him so blunt or simply he's uncomfortable with patient's of my race.To be as young as he seemingly is i think he should improve on that and not mix his personal views with being professional,\nFriendly, and personable.

The staff and nurses were good just Dr. Busbee is rude and doesn\u2019t care about his patients whatsoever. I\u2019ve never put up a review before but I felt people needed to know before going to see him. I took my mentally handicapped sister to see him because her arthritis in her knee had gotten so bad it was swollen as big as a small melon and her primary care doctor said she needed to see an orthopedic so we contacted his office. Well she was in so much pain she couldn\u2019t walk and has always been completely healthy with no problems at all so she didn\u2019t know how to process pain at any amount especially at the amount she was experiencing. Well the \u201cgood doctor\u201d didn\u2019t care to help her at all and had no sympathy for her screeming every time they touched her knee. Even the nurse went and asked him to give her something to help ease the pain and he gave her a NSAID  which she had already been on with no help! Then he put a brace on her knee so tight that it was purple and hurting even more. He sent her home with absolutely nothing to soothe her pain or help to give any relief after we explained how she hasn\u2019t even been able to sleep and even used the bathroom on herself bc she didn\u2019t want to walk bc of the pain, I\u2019m sure I will be taking her back to the emergency room for some kind of help with her pain! He even admitted it had become real bad on her knee and acknowledged the swelling but did nothing. It\u2019s hard to find a doctor to put themselves in other peoples shoes and really want to help. If it\u2019s not them that\u2019s hurting then they don\u2019t care but I haven\u2019t ever had quite an experience like this with a doctor before and hope in the future he\u2019ll learn to develope a care for his patients especially the ones who are mentally special like my sister because god don\u2019t like ugly and I hope no one else has to go through nothing like this with someone they love and someone who gets paid top dollar to give proper care and not do anything.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1529950371489, "text": "Hi Noah,  we are sorry we did not meet your expectations.

I'm about 9-10 weeks out and I'm thinking the hardware is going to have to come out ...I'm feeling irritation to those muscles  but at least I'm pretty sure that's this problem.but you need to learn where the pain is coming from ..often after the need for the hardware is no longer needed..some folks it doesn't bother ..some I bet dont know it can be removed...(think of where and how your irritation is...you gotta help the Dr. ..talk to him ..he needs to know what you know ) chronic pain ?Take Notes !.some like me know..and while I realize its definitely needed!!
