Arthur is so knowledgeable and Oliver his little Scottish Terrier who rides along on every tour is adorable.  Well worth the $15.  I saw several places I am going back to explore.  We went off season, so we could not get off and back on.  I moved across the bay to Daphne a while ago and learned so much!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889badecd2dabcbb:0x690e9552a43a1350"}

Since the minimum time you can rent is 4 hours ($795) I was very clear that in addition to transporting wedding party from hotel to church and back to reception, I also wanted the trolley to take out of town guests and family from carnival museum to church and return .   The driver took the wedding party to the church and then stayed at the church.  By the time someone told me he was still there, the guests had paid for Uber to transport them to church.  They were unwilling to work with me about only performing half of the contract and offered me $100 refund .  The Uber rides were more than that not to mention upsetting the bride and several elderly family members.   Very disappointed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889badecd2dabcbb:0x690e9552a43a1350"}
