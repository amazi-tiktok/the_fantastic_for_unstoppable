She even took time to help me select another nail polish color other than my norm. Really love the color. My biggest disappointment was the lady who did my manicure and nail polish on my hands. She painted half my nails and did a poor job. She was with me a maximum of maybe 5 mins. When I asked for it to be repainted all she gave was attitude. She did not want to repaint them. Even the repainting was not good. Nail polish is still on my skin, you can tell where the base coat is and the nail polish is. Her last comment to me was that I'm going to ruin them and if I do, then I as might as well never came into get a manicure. Very rude lady.

I was told over the phone that they would not quote me prices because I had little girls getting their hair done so if it was simple it wouldn't cost as much. I also had to give them $100 deposit to hold the reservation (completely understandable until I arrived). One of the stylists was very nice but appeared to be more of an apprentice and had to keep asking for help to do the hair of the 2 younger girls. We were still charged full price for these styles ($75 for a 6 year old and 8 year old). One was a bun and did NOT look good and it didn't even resemble the picture we used. Again, she was very nice but the hair was not close to what we asked for. Two of the styles were supposed to be beachy waves and instead we left with weird curls and half done hair. Both charged $55 and took almost no time making it look even decent. They asked me to send pictures ahead of time for my hair and then clearly had not looked at them. I had to ask multiple times about fixing it (it was for my wedding after all) and while my stylist was nice enough to fix it she did seem VERY annoyed. I left with ok hair that I could live with (not exactly what I had in mind as a bride). And somehow I was charged the same price for mine as the 6 year old flower girl. The owner was pretty rude - she told my sister that she could put the little girls in a room and close the door while we waited. The same girls she charged full price updos for. I guess they were good enough to pay but not make noise in her salon? The last complaint was that the stylists kept stopping with our party to help a mom and bride that were also in the salon. Overall very bad hair and bad experience.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1484446038465, "text": "Thank you for your feedback we appreciate the negative review as well as the great reviews .

She told me she is already offering me to fix the nails but she won\u2019t give me a $10 credit. Worse customer service, if I could put a negative 5 star I would.

Worst pedicure of my life.  Then today, I go in for a gel fill in only (had learned the hard way about pedicures) and my nails were great, just what I asked for...then they charge me $11 more than the menu states, and they start gibbering about me having repairs....this is absolutely not true.  No new nails were put on today and I left with the same tips that I came in with.  One girl came out to look at what the menu said the price should be, and admitted to me that it was wrong.  I stood there waiting to be refunded $11 and the manager hands me $2.  I left at that point because $9 is not worth arguing about, but made it clear that I would not be back.  They rely heavily on acting like they don't understand English well...and get away with it because most don't bother to see if they were charged the correct amount,  and just blindly hand them their card and sign.  This is not the first instance that this has happened here, so I've heard.  It's a shame that they treat customers like that, as we need a good, reputable salon in Fairhope.

The service is pretty fast. Im usually out in 20 mins or less and it's less painful then other places I have been to. My only concern is that for me, the hair tends to grow back wayyy faster when I go here compared to other places I've gotten serviced at. There were noticeable hair stubs all over less than a week after my wax as if I had only shaved a few days before, so I kind of felt like I wasted $50 when I could have just shaved at home which is what I'll more than likely have to do in a week anyway because it's growing so fast. The same thing occurred after my first visit as well, but because the customer service is great and the place is clean and well put together, I returned anyway. I don't know if they use a different type of wax from other places or what. When I've visited other places (before and after going to cabana for the first time), I didn't notice hair stubs until at least 2.5-3 weeks after the wax. I'd still recommend the place to others.

We are not a spa; we\u2019re a wax studio, and we do not advertise a spa environment :) most clients love our simple, no frills atmosphere and speedy service. It sounds like you had a facial waxing service. To be clear, our staff constantly sanitizes their hands between services (for their own protection and for that of our clients), and we have a 100 health rating from the Alabama Board of Cosmetology, which is on display in our reception area. Our technicians do not always use gloves during eyebrow wax services, because sometimes wax can get on the fingertip parts of a glove and get smudged onto parts of the brow line that are not meant to be waxed. In other words, in areas such as eyebrows where extra precision is needed to avoid removing too much hair, gloves can make the process more difficult. Gloves are always used during body waxing services.

First, she\u2019s only been waxing for 5 years? That\u2019s quite a while (and Bri is very experienced), so I\u2019m not sure what you were expecting as far as years of experience. Second, there is no need for a formal \u201cskin analysis\u201d in the room; that\u2019s why we have you fill out a form in reception where we ask, among other things, whether you have used retinol, Accutane, alpha hydroxy acids, etc. in the area(s) to be waxed and whether you\u2019ve ever had a bad reaction to waxing. Even without a formal skin analysis as you call it, our technicians are analyzing your skin during the service and would immediately stop the service if there were any issues. Third, everyone who waxes at Cabana Wax has a current cosmetology or esthetics license, which is what the Alabama State Board of Cosmetology requires. The Board actually visited us a few weeks ago for our 2019 unannounced inspection (we got a 100), and licensure and cleanliness are the two main things they inspect. Your irresponsible comment about licensure insinuates that we are violating the law, which is slanderous, and I encourage you to remove it immediately. Finally, you had a chin wax; the technicians would never leave the treatment room door ajar for a Brazilian wax or any other intimate service.

We would sincerely love to help, but we cannot if we don\u2019t know there\u2019s a problem. Please call if there\u2019s anything we can do to help you! We would love to do so. Thanks :)"}, "gmap_id": "0x88626d987dfed2e7:0xe55536739be2f6c7"}

Recently the student was unfamiliar with highlighting and caused the lightener to \u201cbleed\u201d causing an intense and distinctly different contrast to show up on the root and parted portion of hair. They tried to fix the problem by toning this portion. By toning the hair I no longer had highlights in this portion leaving the hair a reddish dark color on the root in contrast to the blond. They offered to provide additional highlights on another visit but I would still have to pay for the lightener. I was told $13. The next time I came within 7 days to have the lightener done to fix the toned area without highlights. It became apparent the learning leaders only add a small amount of lightener to each extra bowl needed to lighten so they can up charge $13 per bowl. I have noticed this in the past. This time I was charged for 3 bowls. The instructor said these extra bowls were not necessary, however the instructor allowed the student to use this amount. In addition to the bleeding mistake that occurred the previous time without proper supervision, I was disappointed by the poor customer service given by the instructors and poor business strategy taken by charging the customer for a mistake that was done under the lack of care by the learning leader.

It\u2019s gonna be a while for them to work on you, they are learning on you so help them. Show pictures so they can get a better understanding of what you want.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889220e6dada637:0x717f01db2564dcc5"}

We appreciate your honest feedback and you're absolutely right-we are a school! Our students are all at different levels of skill based on several factors including, but not limited to, length of time they have been in the program and the specific areas in which they excel. You may not have known this, but we have a 100% guarantee and you can always let us address any issues you might have had with your service. Students work on guests because they need the hands-on experience which is part of their curriculum. Students aren't ready for the salon until they have completed their program, hours, and have taken both their written and state board exams. They are then ready to transition to an actual salon. We also have students who are in a program here we call Phase 2. These students must pass an interview and hands-on assessment in makeup, cutting, color and texture. These \"master level\" students are available upon request and you'll be getting a more advanced, driven student that is much further along in their program. However, these services do cost a bit more. All that being said, we have to remember that we are a school, first and foremost. We love being able to offer extremely low (much lower than an actual salon) prices for our guests because our students need the hands-on experience. We can all remember the first time we tried to accomplish something...sometimes it was great, but sometimes we also had a lot to learn from the experience. But with practice and patience, we got so much better than when we started and that's exactly how it is for our students. We hate that you weren't happy with your hair, but we do appreciate the time you gave our student in letting them perfect their craft."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889220e6dada637:0x717f01db2564dcc5"}

My sister decided she wouldn\u2019t have anything done if they were not willing to honor the amount that had already been purchased.

We had a consult where my stylist Tammy asked about my preferences, lifestyle, and schedule to make sure she could suggest appropriate styles that would look good at home.

Unfortunately, Olivia A. Salon is not the place for me.  I went in for an acrylic fill with gel on top and while everyone was friendly  I left unhappy with my nails.   The result was chunky, overly thick, and uneven.  It looked worse than press on nails glued and painted by a child.  The nail technician did NOT use a drimmel or motorized file but used a foam hand file to take off my existing and layer of acrylic.\nAt first this seemed nice but I was mistaken.  She was unable to file the smaller sectional of my nail bed and ended up filing skin which hurt.  My nails were embarrassing to look at as they appeared malformed and lumpy.  When she applied the gel she used 3 very thick coats of color that didn't dry under the light and were soft to the touch.  To be fair, I'm picky with my nails and when I saw the manicure going south I didn't say anything.  I should have.  Instead I left and went straight to another nail salon.  At the next salon they showed my Quasi-Modo nails around and laughed.\nThe salon itself is easy enough to find but the level of aesthetics is less than what I like.  They clearly want to be a high end salon but the quality is not quite there.  In addition, the prices were NOT worth it!  They charged $10 over what any other salon does.  The people were nice and they fit me in.  And I want to make it clear, I did not say anything to the lady.  But I'm not sure that she would have been able to fix them even if I had.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2b80bb327d0d:0x763a472c8ef66bd8"}

Although others came in after me and were serviced immediately, I had about a 15 minute wait. The nail tech started on my gel full set and I asked her \"how long do my nails have to be to do the dipped nails?\" She replied 40$.. so I re asked \" Do my natural nails have to be long to get the dipped nails\" she once again said 40$. Later, I was trying to make conversation and asked her if they were usually busy. All she did was laugh,  So by this time I realized she couldn't understand anything I was saying.  She was very rough on my nails. My cuticles are still bright red and I have a cut on my right pinky finger.  After my nails were done, I went to the front desk and told them I want my eyebrows waxed. They same nail Tech that did my nails also is the one that did my eyebrows. When she 1st put the wax on it was so hot I had to move my face away.  Even after she was done I still had to go home and pluck my eyebrows a bit.

As you know that regular polish need a longer time to dry (\"cure\") before you can put the shoes back on.  That is why most clients bring their own flip flop sandals, or we offer our disposable flip flop slippers when come for pedicure.  When you came back, we looked at the messed up toe and decide the best way to do is to remove part of messed up polish and applied new polish in that area only because it needed to match the rest of the toe nails.  We fixed that messed up toe nail, and we applied a new top coat for all your toe nails to make your toe nails look fresh and pretty.  We chatted with you and we were so glad you were happy when you left our shop.  As you know we take our work and reputation very seriously and are happy to fix an issue if a client has problem with their toe or nails. Thank you so much for your honest feedback and giving us the opportunity to make it 'all better'.  We hope you take a moment to revise your review to show that we were happy to fix the problem and make you a happy client.  Thank you and we hope to see you soon.

The guy didn\u2019t run any water or anything. He then begins to work on two people that came in AFTER me. So I asked can I at least soak? And he says \u201cin a min\u201d and continues to work on the person that came in AFTER me. I walked out and went right around the corner to another salon where I was immediately told to sit in a pedicure chair WITH WATER! I will never try this salon again. And please don\u2019t comment saying that they had an appointment. One lady admitted she was extremely LATE for her appointment therefore her appointment should have been void and the other lady said she couldn\u2019t get anyone to answer the phone in order for her to make an appointment so she decided to \u201cpop in.\u201d She \u201cpopped in\u201d after me and was serviced BEFORE me just because she was a regular I guess.\n\nRESPONSE TO OWNER - First of all I don't care about people in the shop shaking their heads. Those people shaking their heads probably didn't know that you just skipped over me!! I was there waaaaay before the clients that you started working on. You said you were letting them soak and was getting them ready for your staff huh? Well why didn't you start my water to get me \"ready for your staff \" BEFORE the people that came in AFTER me (Answer because you intentionally skipped over me because they were regulars) They probably didn't know that when you told me to sit down in the chair you didn't bother to give me a menu or anything! They probably didn't know that you clearly treat your regular customers waaaaay better than new customers. Your conversation was so dry with me but as soon as one of your regulars entered they got waaaaay better treatment (FYI you need to watch how you do that because you never know..a NEW customer could be trying to become a REGULAR. ) I didn't misunderstand a thing. I was in that chair for more than 5 min so stop with the BS. Once again no thanks to the offer for being a client. I will spend my money at a shop where I am treated fairly.

You sat on pedicure chair not even 5 minutes and you asked for water to soak your feet and I asked you nicely to give me a few minutes because I was working on a client to wrap her nails.

Im happy we ended up here. I rarely get my nails done so I had no clue where to go. Any way, my husband and I went together. He wanted a manicure and 2 acrylic nails put on. He's a guitar player and has heard of many great players doing this so it's something he wanted to try out. I think there was some confusion at first because I had scheduled for 2 manicures but when we got there they were setting up the pedicure stations. Like I said I've gotten my nails done maybe 5 times in my life and most or those times were when I was very young, in ohio, with my mom, at a place where cosmology students did it. So I thought maybe a foot soak was part of the pampering. Im happy we ended up doing the pedicures though! My feet look great and my husband was a riot. He was laughing so hard while they messed with his feet that he had everyone else laughing too. They did a great job on hands and feet and the staff was very kind. We were in and out pretty quickly too which was great because I had to get to work. (Took almost an hour to have mani-pedi) cost for both services was $40/person plus a little extra for his acrylic nails, plus we tipped each girl $10.  If I had known I was doing a pedicure I would have picked a different nail color. The one I picked for my hands was very boring because we aren't supposed to wear fun nail colors at work but I love having bright colors on my toes. It makes them look so cute! That's my own fault for not speaking up though. There is a slight language barrier with a couple of the girls but in the end they figure it out.

I felt very bad that we did not have an opportunity to provide you the service that you came for. As you could see, we were very busy that day and importantly, Shawn (one of our staff) had a family emergency where he had to unexpectedly take his sick daughter to the emergency room. There were two clients who did come in after you, but received services before you. The reason was that both had appointments at 1:00 PM. One of those clients had an 11:50 AM appointment that morning for a fill-in, but because we were busy then, I asked her to come back at 1:00 PM, and she did. The other lady had days before made an appointment for a pedicure at 1:00 PM. It ended up being a \u201cperfect storm\u201d, being unexpectedly short staffed and super busy at the same time. I hope you understand that we are taking customer service very seriously, not only for our appointment clients that we are obligated to take first, but for our important walk-in clients whom we always try to take care of as soon as possible too. It was completely my fault that I did not tell you that these two ladies had existing appointments, and I am so sorry that I did not explain.

You are paying for the experience, education, compassion, understanding, and integrity of the stylists and owner, that you will not find anywhere else in Dothan.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8892937ca1bf4de7:0x922059ced4e5e7f8"}

When I expressed how much I didn\u2019t like it, she did say they guarantee their hair do\u2019s and I could come back or scheduled another appt and they would fix it, but obviously, I probably won\u2019t be taking that offer up for obvious reasons, So definitely a waste of money.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888d8c924293249:0x6976741efe104f0b"}

{"user_id": "103804845592874345668", "name": "Tera Shade", "time": 1393167773078, "rating": 5.0, "text": "In response to the \"1 star\" review written 3 years ago.  I responded 2 days after it posted but it never showed up, so I'll try again with my response...When this review was first posted the person included her name (it has since been changed to \"anonymous\").  I called the reviewer and inquired about her time spent at Bliss.  You see, I am the owner and very concerned about our reputation and our guests experience.  I believe the following information will help you decided if you want to take this reviewer seriously.   Let me begin by saying this reviewer called late in the day to make an appointment to have her hair cut.  Even though we were booked until closing time, one of my stylist agreed to stay late and take the appointment.  The two employees behind the desk greeted this reviewer, offered her something to drink, and informed the stylist of her arrival.  Because it was now after closing time, the two front desk employees left for the day.  This reviewer was not left alone or ignored at any time.  The stylist who volunteered to stay late, finished with the client she was with and was on time for this reviewers scheduled appointment.  This reviewer had her hair shampooed, had more of a trim than a cut, and blown out.  She was charged $15.  Her comment about being charged three times what she should have been charged... Well, I don't know where a woman can get her hair shampooed, cut/trimmed, and blown out for $5.  She did say she was new to the area, so maybe she could get the above service done for $5 where ever she moved from...Just to be clear, Bliss does not offer shampoos, haircuts, and styles for $5....  I noticed she did not mention the amount she was charged.   Could it have been she as embarrassed to admit that she thought $15 was \"three times more than what it should have been.\" Because this reviewer posted this review under her name and because we had her phone number on file, I called and inquired about her time at Bliss.  I stated I was the owner and was making follow up calls with our new clients.  I did not  mention I had read her review but instead asked how she enjoyed her visit with us.  I gave her every opportunity to relate any unpleasant experience she might have had.  I was told that Bliss is a beautiful place and was thanked for taking her appointment on such short notice and after hours.  When asked how she like her hair cut even thought it really was only a trim, she responded \"I like it, she did a good job.\" During our conversation, she never said anything negative about her visit at Bliss, and when I invited her to return in the future she said she would.  To be honest, she has not returned .  I wish she had given us another chance so that she could experience what Bliss is really about.  I would also like to respond to the comment about the service being done half-hearted and with no conversation.  The stylist's mother had just passed away very unexpectedly two weeks earlier.  She was still mourning her loss but trying to live as normal as possible and continue to work and support herself.  While this reviewer had no clue what was happening in our stylist personal life, I think because of the comment she made in her review for all to read, its important for you to know why our stylist was not her usual outgoing friendly self.   I am very interested in making each client feel welcome and appreciated.  I personally follow up with as many clients as possible to make sure that their time at Bliss was relaxing and that they are satisfied with their service.  I know this has been a lot to read, but I wanted to give a little more information about the above review.  I am sure I am not the only business owner that is willing to go above and beyond what is normal to make their guest happy.  If something is not what you are expecting, please let us know.

It had been years since she had been treated to a girls day and so today was a special girls day where we could get our hair cut together. We live in Florida and wanted to spend some time in Dothan visiting our favorite shops. We booked an appointment and scheduled our day around town. My mom was so excited when she sat down and explained what she wanted. Instantly the stylist scowled and said \"I'm gonna let you know now... your hair is not going to do that\"  My mom has had this particular cut before and explained that it was okay and that she wanted this cut. The stylist did not wash her hair at all before tearing into it with scissors. The entire appointment the stylist complained that he hair was \"too thick\" and did not stop complaining about how my moms hair \"just wouldn't cooperate.\" At the end of the appointment, my mom did not receive the cut she wanted at all, it was a jagged uneven cut. My mom had beautiful long hair and now the cut was so short that even if she wanted to have it fixed at another salon, it would turn into a pixie which is NOT what she wanted. For me, thankfully she didn't botch my hair like my mom but still she was rude and complained that my hair was \"just as thick as my moms\" I already have a pixie so there wasn't much she could mess up on thank God. At checkout, the stylist even scowled at the fact that i was paying for my moms cut along with my own! as if its unheard of for a daughter to treat her mother on her birthday! Needles to say I left a small tip to be nice because the cuts were not that expensive but honestly i shouldn't have.

I specifically brought in a picture of what I wanted, and she turned me away from the mirror and basically cut my hair however she wanted with NO REGARD to the picture I brought in. My hair is literally 6\" shorter than what I asked for, and when I told her that, NO APOLOGY. She basically told me that in the picture, the girl had extensions and that's why mine was so much shorter. And then said that it shrank because it was wet. She chopped all of it off without even asking anything. I cried for two hours. The boss was very nice, and refunded my money, but now I am stuck with a hair cut that I absolutely hate until it grows out. There's also a HUGE gap in the back where she cut part shorter than the rest. The point of the picture was so I could have the style and the length, and she completely did what she wanted. Every time I see all my hair gone, I cry again. I had waist length hair, and she cut it up to my jaw instead of below my collar bone. If I could give 0 stars I would.

First of all I have long hair, I wanted my split ends off and layered along with face layered. All she did was a face layered and split ends, and then she took a big round tool for the hair dryer and tried to curl up my hair, when I got home, my husband looked and they burned some of my hair so not only was my hair the same, just a snip here and there, but it stayed frizzy all the time, no matter what I did it would still frizzy. So I finally went to options in my town and they did my hair right. My mom went the same day I had mine done at Walmart, this same place. The girl who did hers, was suppose to cut her split ends off and layer it. She did 2 snips on 1 side and the other side and she was done. Then they changed their prices from 15$ (for a wash and cut along with druing) to 20$ for a wash, cut and dry. It's still 15$ for a cut and wash, but you will have to go around with wet hair because in order to dry, you have to pay 5$ more. Oh but they don't tell you that at the counter BTW!! Wound up paying almost 45$ for mine and my mom's hair cuts. They would not refund either. So I could have let my 10yr old niece cut my hair way better than those people and saved 45$. I will never go back. I suggest to anyone else, if you want to goto your salon who does a good job, but decides oh I'm at Walmart, I'll just do it here, don't!

The only thing that I found upsetting after I was sooo very \ud83d\ude0a with the hair, was the total! $600!! Now,  the total shouldn't be a mystery while you are getting it done. It should be discussed about how much it will be when you are describing what you want to the stylist while she is evaluating your hair. And if its too high, then a different affordable approach. I'm not educated in this field, so I have no idea what steps have to be taken or how much those steps are, such as the $150/ hr. that I was charged. I was told differently on the appt. call. That was all the cash I had, barely enough to tip\ud83d\ude12.

We're disappointed that your experience with us wasn't 100% enjoyable and that you had \"sticker shock\" at the end of your appointment! We coach our stylists and Guest Experience Experts up front on informing clients that we can't give completely set prices on color corrections as the service and products used usually changes throughout the time spent on the  correction. However, you should have definitely been updated and consulted THROUGHOUT the appointment to ensure you and your stylist were on the same page the whole time! We will talk to the appropriate members of our staff to ensure this doesn't happen again.

Please have your sister contact us directly. Every lash removal is charged for a lash removal. There has never been a time when our lash artists have approved not being paid for their time to remove a client\u2019s lashes. I would like to speak with her so I can find out who misconstrued that information to her to cause such confusion as both of our Guest Experience Experts that handle scheduling, know that it is a service that always costs since it requires proper training and techniques to not compromise the client\u2019s natural lashes.\n\nThere a multitude of factors that go into lashes not lasting long. And in this case, your sister, I\u2019ll withhold her name too for the reasoning you stated, was informed for the beginning that she had short natural lashes - and going as long as she wanted to go could lessen the amount of time they would last. Getting them wet at all within 24 hours and proper at home protocols not being followed will also shorten the time.\n\nAll of this is explained at the appointment as well as some of it is notated on the waiver signed in the beginning of the appointment.\n\nAgain, please have your sister contact us directly so we discuss ways we can properly rectify this situation with her. Thanks!\n\n***edited to add: I see she was already refunded a FULL refund for her full set 4 days ago. I\u2019m not sure what else we can do to rectify this situation more than we have. I would still like to hear from her though who originally told her there would be no charge. Thank you"}, "gmap_id": "0x886267a5d761a8e3:0xda004ea8eefc3e37"}

I have very long hair that I tried to dye myself, light brown to ginger red. Big mistake. Hot roots, a total mess. I lived out of state and went to a local salon to fix it. They made it look more even and it improved, but it still wasn't the color I wanted. I moved here and found New Look. Jen really took the time to get my color exactly how I wanted it. It was a long salon day, with deep conditioning, all-over lightening, and a toner that made it perfect. I wanted a bright, orange-y/copper, natural ginger look. SHE.DID. IT. All of this was done WITHOUT damaging my hair--and it was a pretty drastic change. I've had my hair lightened before, and there was always a period of super-dry, frizzy straw hair that took weeks of deep conditioning to recuperate. This is not the case now. My hair doesn't even feel like it's been colored at all. It's just as healthy as it was from the start. Also, I now get complements on my hair E-V-E-R-Y day. That's never happened to me before!

I went in for a facial threading, wax, and lash extensions yet when I went home and looked at the work done via my closeup magnifying mirror I saw lots of hair still on my face and many missed hairs on my mustache area despite being plucked as well, so attention to detail definitely royally lacking in this area.\nNow, the service on my lashes was actually even worse. I went in with a picture of what style and length of lashes I was wanting and instead I left with the complete opposite as the so-called technician had admitted that she decided to go a couple of sizes up on length despite what I had requested, as well, she had missed some areas where there were gaps and so I asked for those areas to be filled and lashes trimmed since they were too long (not what I asked for), although she claimed she fixed them, NOT, I was treated with frustration and impatience after the touch up I asked for to the point that she left me in the room and didn't come back to check on me or say anything, she just went out and took another customer which clearly expressed to me that she was done with me despite the fact that she didn't do what I had asked for but instead what she wanted to do. And, after looking closer at them when I got home thru my magnifying mirror they looked horrid as all the glue was visible (not black glue) and stuck to many of the lashes which caused them to clump together and they were still too long. I really tried to deal with them, followed all the instructions (that by the way I was told upon leaving to take a picture of from their taped sheet on a mirror, really!), the best that I could but the length of them was just not natural looking to my face and the horrid clumped up lashes was just to much to deal with, SO, so disappointing.  It was even obvious by every one's look on their face when they saw me and some clearly said so. I finally had to have them carefully removed the next week. I WILL NEVER EVER, EVER RETURN TO THIS PLACE NOR WOULD I EVER RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE I KNOW, and I am not one to give bad reviews but in this case there was just too much of the bad to go around, just shameful! \u2639\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude23\ud83d\ude1f...", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888917afd52227e1:0x2b150ddbd8c8374a"}

The turnover is high which is bad enough but they will cancel your appointment at the last minute and then when I came in for my new rescheduled appointment I wasn\u2019t even acknowledged by the receptionists. Yes plural because there was 2.  The usual receptionist knows me by face so I guess I didn\u2019t think nothing of it when those two said nothing to me since they seemed preoccupied...one with another customer and the other took a call on her cell and stepped away. I waited 30 mins to find out that my rescheduled appointment needed to be cancelled because the tech had a family emergency and she left. Walked right pass me!  I finally got to my breaking point and acknowledged the 2 ladies and they had no excuses that made any sense. One of them said she thought I was someone else so I guess we all look alike to her but ok and the other one said with all honesty she simply said you are right we said nothing to you. She was the one who took the call on her cell. Ok so the only wax tech that was still there had I guess turned her wax up and said she could wax me but I needed to give her wax time to cool or I could reschedule again. I opted to wait another 15 mins to let it cool. I must say she was good and this my first time with her but she was actually super nice and I apologized for getting rowdy to her that is just how good she was. As I was leaving the 2 ladies in the front wanted to offer me something for my inconvenience but I got prepaid wax passes so there no credit that could be given so they opted to give me samples which I took cause no one has ever given me samples at this place. It\u2019s sample though so I dunno if that is something spectacular. I asked for a number for management and they said that the manager would have to call me. That\u2019s been a month ago and no call but my $121 pre paid wax pass payment just hit my card again today.  I see that isn\u2019t being rescheduled!  So I said all this to say I might be calling the number and asking for a manager again and getting funds reversed because I can not keep coming to a sinking ship.

Awkward ...overpriced and unsure of the experience of the technician (this place charges twice the going rate in our area and the service is not half as good as the other places!)\n\nWhen I arrived the check in process was a little intrusive. The girl at the front desk wanted to see my driver\u2019s license? I\u2019ve been to several spas and had many waxes and never have been asked for a copy of my drivers license. That seems a little extreme for a spa service? But okay. I go to the restroom before my appt starts and when I\u2019m walking back to the waiting area someone calls out my name from a room ..It was my technician (first visit at this place and don\u2019t remember her name)? I felt like that was forward (but not so much so that it ruined the appt). However, then I step into my room and the technician tells me to undress from the waist down that she will do my brows first then my Brazillian ?!? So I don\u2019t have a choice in this and have to lay there EXPOSED while my brows are being done?!? Not only that she didn\u2019t go anywhere! She did not leave the room for me to undress and just stayed in there!?! That\u2019s not typical. Every place I\u2019ve ever been (and I\u2019ve been to many saloons and spas) has always left me in the room to undress then they would come in. More so  than that I\u2019m usually given something to cover up with until the service is needed in that area (unless it\u2019s just a Brazillian that we go straight to). I did not like that!! It was strange and the technician didn\u2019t say a word while she was working which makes things even more awkward!! Oh except for the \u201cshave shaming\u201d as if that\u2019s the reason for the horrible pain that I feel when my hair is being ripped out of my skin around my pubic bone! Lol ?!? So the technician had a dry personality (looking back she seemed weird) ..I had to lay on the table exposed while my brows were getting done first (I didn\u2019t have a choice in that or wasn\u2019t told I did). Also, she stays in the room while I change!!! And when it\u2019s over she stays in the room waiting for me to get dressed!! There was absolutely no concern for privacy or customary respect and boundaries. I much prefer the other place that I go (Marci\u2019s Hoover). The prices are better. The experience isn\u2019t creepy weird or demeaning and my technician is friendly and speaks!\n\nOh and heads up anyone who gets a brow wax, the technician removed all of my make up then waxed my brows! I told her that I prefer that she just get the strays outside of my make up. My brows are thinning and I have a particular shape that I prefer! That was not respected at all!! There is NO need to remove the make up first of all. (That\u2019s just some personal preference of the technician). That should be the clients choice! We should be able to change without someone watching us when we arrive and before we leave!! There\u2019s no way this place will stay around much longer if things don\u2019t change! Why would anyone continue to pay twice the price for a worse experience!? It\u2019s a strip mall wax place just like Marci\u2019s ..only they advertise like it\u2019s some type of luxury saloon. It\u2019s not..thank goodness they didn\u2019t try to sell me products or some membership. I hate it when I\u2019m paying for a service and still being subjected to high pressure sales. So that is a bonus. To add to the bad experience my wax took close to 30 minutes! It\u2019s never taken that long anywhere else. I don\u2019t think the technician was very experienced. I also felt it was a little creepy that she didn\u2019t say much at all but that she just stays in the room while I\u2019m changing out and back into my clothes. When I was leaving I felt rushed, she was standing with her hand in the door watching me put my shoes on!! I felt rushed cuz her next appt was there! I mean give a a girl some space!\n\nTo the management: you need to take note of the things I\u2019ve said.

I had never been to Ambiance Spalon before. However, Laura Beth that is a hair & color stylist had done my hair for 8 years when I lived in Rome, Ga from 2003-2011. I was moving to Charleston, Sc and she was moving to Auburn, Al. Although I was excited to be moving to Charleston I wasn't excited about having to find a new hair stylist. Every time she would do my hair when I would get home my husband would always say your hair looks nice. When she was No longer doing my hair it looked nice but I never got the compliments that I use to get when Laura Beth was doing my hair. Every time I would go get my hair done I would think I sure wish Laura Beth was still doing my hair i missed her. My husband started looking for a new job and we found out we were moving to Newnan,Ga. I started thinking, I wonder how far she is from where I was moving to. I got on Mapquest and it was 76 miles. I didn't care, it was worth every mile I drove for her to be doing my hair again. Ambiance is a very nice place and everyone there is very friendly. I met the owners that day and they are really nice. You won't regret going to Ambiance and getting Laura Beth to do your hair. Best decision I ever made to drive 76 miles to get my hair done.

I was in the car trying to quarantine but my husband said she spent the whole time talking to the next family in the lobby.

They grudgingly chopped some more on the front but still left the back a mess. It sticks up on its own and is so uneven you can make out gaps.The woman who did the original hack job mentioned that we needed to update his note in his file to reflect how we wanted it cut. We have been customers at this store for years with the same notes and never have we had a problem before.

So I purchased a very expensive perfect package for my girl as a surprise Valentine's day present at this location bc ive sent her here once before and she seemed to enjoy it. Well the lady at the desk inquired on who it was for and apparently submitted the information under her name where as MY email confirmation went directly to my girl, where she called me informing me she knew my plans for her, spoiling the surprise!!! That should have never happened! I then called and explained my irritation and informed them I was coming for a refund. They called me back like it was no biggy like cool we can just refund this over the phone for you rather than saying hey i'm sorry is there any way we can make this right for you! I'm a funny, chill laid back dude, but if you ruin a surprise, that is my one and only immediate heartbreak bc that ruins the joy of spending lots of money to be able to see the expression on your womans face of how happy she is. Presents are for the givers and for the receivers bc we both enjoy feeling the happiness of THE SURPRISE!! Please resolve this issue, bc i'm a man of morality bc now my woman is upset with me bc I refunded the package but I simply can NOT do business with folks that aren't in it for the satisfaction of those spending their hard earned money! So now, I had Valentine's all planned out perfect to the T, I no longer have the \"kaboom\" gift available, and now there is all this negative energy between me and my woman bc I know she still wants the package but I can not allow it bc the surprise was so important to me i absolutely had to have my money back so that this place would know and preferably remember that they ruined something for two special people! I wouldn't dare ask for something free, I would feel bad for taking anything not earned, but as a man that runs  a business, I make free offers every day to ensure customer satisfaction and that they come back!!

We always appreciate when people take the time to let us know how we are doing. In some cases they do get us mixed up with a Serenity near us that we are not affiliated with. I want to check and see if our reviews are coming from our clients. So I double checked the system so that I'm not reach out to you personally but can't seem to find your information.

We did our research and saw it had a 4.7 star rating so we decided to check it out. Upon entering they were very friendly and the building was very nice and clean. I just needed a fill in for my pink and white and my friend needed a whole new set. Things were great at first but the lady upset my friend a little when she told her she wanted short stiletto nails and she said no they are long I can show you and my friend said I understand but I have had them that short before and she said there going to be ugly that short and so my friend was like ok can you just do square then because she felt as if the lady was trying her best to discourage what she as the customer wanted done. The lady moves to my seat to work on my pink and white fill in and I have been to several salons enough to know how I want them done and how I expect them to be done so instead of starting with shaping the pink power first then working to the white so the white powder could have a rounded shape like I want instead of a straight across shape I started to get a little upset and my friend spoke up for me and said I\u2019m sorry but I thought normally you use the silver tool to shape in the round form of the white and the lady said you can do it that way but we do it this way so finally I got the courage to speak up and point out that the nails she had done looked nothing like that he nails I already had and I wanted them like I had my originals and I didn\u2019t scream or yell at her my voice got a little high tense because at this point I was getting very stressed out and she just stood up and said you need to just leave your to picky I will just charge you a small fee so it will be cheaper and her husband was working on my friends nails and he said yeah that\u2019s best you made her feel bad and I think you need to leave and I was like what I already asked her if she could just quit and paint them a color so your going to charge me for something that\u2019s half done and not even finish the job and he said yes you need to just leave so my friend was my ride and she obviously wasn\u2019t going to make me wait while she finished hers so she told him that she would have to leave also because she was my ride and he said ok that\u2019s fine y\u2019all can both go and don\u2019t worry about paying just don\u2019t ever come back because y\u2019all are obviously to picky for us. WE HAVE NEVER been treated this way before we always leave a nice tip and never been told we were too picky but when you are PAYING for a service you get what you asked for and you let them know what you want. Needless to say they don\u2019t have to worry about us coming back anyways so we went to PERFECT NAILS on south parkway and when we went in we told them a short story about how we were made to leave a nail salon for being to picky and they wouldn\u2019t finish our nails and as soon as we sat down the most awesome girl ever Linda sat down and was like ok let me see and soon as she saw them she said \u201comg what happened to your nails\u201d she had to totally reshape them because the lady at revive had them all different lengths and shapes. I encourage anyone thinking about coming to this place BEWARE THEY DO NOT LIKE PEOPLE WHO ARE TO PICKY ABOUT THE SERVICE THEY ARE PAYING FOR. But I do recommend with a 5 star rating LINDA AT PERFECT NAILS on south parkway.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1581214914355, "text": "We are sorry you were never satisfied when we try many ways to meet your likings and we were sure you were not going to be pleased when we finish with your nails.

From the moment I walked in the door, the staff was incredibly kind, professional, and friendly while helping me fill out their questionnaire and confirming my appointment time. The waiting area was very clean. I brought my cardiac alert dog in with me, and the staff was so courteous and understanding! Usually when trying new places, I\u2019ll have to field some access issues - but not here! They were welcoming to both me and my service dog.\n\nWhen it was time for my appointment, Elizabeth came to escort me to a room and was very attentive and friendly. She mentioned giving me some extra time to get my dog situated (he was in a down-stay out of the way for the whole appointment). Little things like that make the experience for me!\n\nShe made sure I was decent before opening the door to come in, and then began by answering any lingering questions I had about sugaring. We talked about the differences between wax and sugaring, and she walked me through how it would feel before beginning. She was so professional and welcoming - at no point did I ever feel any judgement or anything! She made me feel so comfortable and kept the conversation very light and it really felt like I was catching up with a friend. She made sure I liked the results and offered to tweak the triangle I preferred she leave to straighten it a bit more, then offered me some wipes to get any left over sugar if I felt it while redressing.\n\nAt the front, they helped sign me up for the membership - which was a fantastic deal! Instead of being around $60, I could pay $70 and have unlimited bikini sugaring for the month plus discounted other services. I\u2019m currently scheduled for my second appointment and can\u2019t wait! Not only did the staff make me feel more welcomed than I have ever felt in a beauty salon, but the sugaring itself was much less painful and I like how I only need to wait two weeks for touch ups.\n\nWill absolutely be returning!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888919c2e5b5df63:0x76207c17ae34004d"}

A shellac manicure and regular pedicure bc I am traveling to cancun for vacation. All I can say is it was a disaster. After three hours my nails look worse than if I had done them myself. I asked the technician before if the colors I picked in gel and regular polish were similar and would match. She replied of course and began my manicure. Without applying any cuticle cream or softener she began digging in my cuticles while chatting up all the employees and barely paying attention to what was going on. She continuously had to keep picking at my cuticles after applying the gel and all of the polish looks uneven with streaks and lumps. Finally she did all she could to fix my manicure and started on the pedicure. After she applied the polish and I got up my jaw dropped to see bright red on my toes and salmon on my fingers. She quickly began attending to another client without much else to say to me. I checked out at the front and even tipped 20% of the pre discount amount bc I believe in paying for a service but I definitely will never be returning and will be warning everyone I can contact to stay away from this salon.

The paper work that you signed at the beginning of your service, explains that if you are unsatisfied with your hair, your stylist will be more than happy to come up with an arrangement to get your hair where you would like it to be. We truly wish you would have come to us first so we could evaluate your hair and make it right for you without the additional costs of another salon. We have offered for you to come in and have us take a look at your hair to evaluate the situation, and we are sorry that you did not want to come in to work this out. Unfortunately, due to the time your stylist spent with you, product used, and not having the opportunity to evaluate your hair in person, we are unable to refund you for this service. Upon reviewing your paper work, your stylist noted that your hair would need more than one service to achieve the end results that you were wanting. This is due to the fact that your hair was already previously lightened at home before your visit to us. We are always striving for what's best for our clients. In this circumstance, your hair wouldn't be able to handle any further lightening in one visit. It is our understanding that in order to protect the integrity of your hair, you and your stylist decided to go with a darker blonde until your next service. We aren't quite sure what happened between the time you left the salon and now, but after your service you told us that you loved your hair and even booked your future reservation with us. We deeply value you as a customer of ours and we are sorry to see you go. We appreciate your review and we hope you have a wonderful day."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a61f96ea20655:0x14238b725edd250"}

The fact that they are in Walmart does not discredit their talent and artistic gift. They can do almost anything you want as long as they believe it will look good on you and strive to make the customer happy whereas other stylists tend to stubbornly do what they want.  They always discuss the outcome first with great communication skills and provide services with experience, heart, and soul. Every stylist there is great. There are many requests for specific stylists but give the others a chance. It is their priority to please you and they never rush to the point of just barely meeting the requirements. The newer stylists are always doing their very best to please you and they work as a team if one employee needs help. You can take before and after pictures, create new color ideas, highlight, shadow root melt, ombre, all over colors, perms, stack bob haircuts, undercut fades, layers, color correction, beautiful bangs, waxed eyebrows, a head massaging shampoo and conditioner, great products, and more.

I lived out of state for school, and would plan my visits around when I could come to The Masters. Even now, with me living in Nashville, I would schedule well in advance to make a trip to this salon so I could see my favorite hair stylist, Rita. As someone with curly hair, it takes me a long time to find someone who has the skillset to work with curl patterns. I have had many bad haircuts in my life\u2014anyone with curly hair can relate. Rita changed the way I worked with and styled my hair. I even recommended for my mother to start visiting the salon because I wanted to refer her to Rita. Recently, Rita told us she was moving out of state and that she would be referring all of her clients to Kimberly. I trusted the salon, and so I scheduled my next appointment.\n\nKimberly has a great disposition. I explained I didn\u2019t want to deviate from the shape that Rita had left, and I only wanted it a little shorter because I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to be back for a long time. Kimberly asked me if I wanted for her to cut my hair either dry or wet, because \u201ccurly haired girls always have a preference\u201d. I told her I would be okay with what she was most comfortable with, and she decided to cut my hair wet. I noticed she was cutting it in large chunks and not taking her time. When she was finished, she asked me how much product I wanted in my hair because \u201ccurly haired girls are particular.\u201d After she put it in, she separated my hair into clips and said she was finished while she pulled out the diffuser. As she plugged it in, she looked at me and said: \u201cDo you want to diffuse it yourself? Curly haired girls usually like to do this part themselves.\u201d I was taken aback because this has never been asked of me before\u2014especially by a place that charges almost $100 for a cut. I told Kimberly that, sure, I could diffuse my hair myself. After I was finished, I looked at the result. The hair fell like a triangle; she easily had cut off 4 inches. I quickly paid and went to my car. I decided that I couldn\u2019t leave a place that charged so much to do a substandard job. I pulled up a picture of my hair after I received my last cut, and went back to the salon to see if it could be fixed. When I came back and showed Kimberly the picture, she was apologetic. I sat back down in her chair, and she proceeded to ask me to tell her where I thought she should cut my hair to make it look right. If I could cut my hair myself, I would. But I cannot, and that is why I spend more than $20 to go to a place that emphasizes professionalism and a higher skillset of stylist. Seeing that I was just going to have to leave with a bad haircut, I left.\n\nI called management to ask for a refund. My mother had given me a $50 gift card and I had put the rest on my credit card. They told me the owner was out of town and that they couldn\u2019t refund my money without his saying that it was okay. Instead, they offered me two haircuts. I explained that, although I appreciated this gesture, I wouldn\u2019t be returning to the salon to get my hair cut again. They insisted that it would be okay and that I should go to the stylist who trained both Kimberly and Rita in cutting curly hair. When I declined, they said they would try to talk to the owner. A couple of days later, they returned my phone call to say they had not heard from the owner and they still suggested I take the original offer. I had no plans on going back, but my mother has straight hair and usually has no problems when it comes to getting it trimmed. I asked if I could transfer my two cuts to my mother, seeing as she had purchased the gift card and it was also her money wasted on a bad cut. I would feel better knowing that she could do something nice for herself. But, they said no. I never heard back.\n\nI had to write this for all of the curly haired girls out there who \u201care particular\u201d or who have a \u201cpreference.\u201d Do not come to this salon.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1566598422101, "text": "Hello Brittany, first off if this was to happen to one of us or a member of our own family, we would not be happy.

At this point I had been at the salon for seven hours. He then asked me to come back that Saturday for an \"adjustment\". I came out of that no better and my hair was damaged and breaking off. They also still charged me $450. I have never gone back. I also witnessed failure of management on managing clients and appointments. Brett has set up the salon where clients are passed around to whoever is free to work on them.

Every acrylic,polish and service you can think of. The prices are great for services rendered. Mimi has done so well with Sally her oldest daughter and prodigy.

I have so many memories here!\nLike many, I read the reviews at first and was hesitant, but it\u2019s not bad at all. It has gotten better over time. And honestly although many locals would call it a little \u201cghetto,\u201d this salon has the most hospitality from workers and clients that I have ever seen.

She also told me this is something that really bad nail solans do called \u201crings of fire\u201d because the nails burn like fire. Which I can attest to.\nAnother thing, while he was doing this I jerked my hand out of his, wouldn\u2019t you think this would clue him in? I\u2019ve never experienced this and didn\u2019t realize what happened, I just though the tool was hot on my nail. Silly me. I could not get it off with the %100 acetone remover.

Star , this is the nastiest most unprofessional nail place I have ever been to in the city of of Huntsville , al and the way they treat African Americans is pure disgusting . I came to get my nails done and Wednesday@ around 6:30 p.m. , they broke off . I would go back that night To get them fixed up at the nail place but they  closed after 7 pm , so I waited till the next day which was Thursday to get that nail repair . The same guy who died the nail replaced them , well Friday the nail breaks again , So  again so I called before attending there  to speak with management to see what the issue was , and see if they could fix them . The manager knows I drove here from Athens , al which is now my second time fixing after paying $50. The manager Mimi then assured me to come in to get someone else to fix. So I head to the nail place , as I\u2019m walking and I said hey I have already called  can I get my nail repaired , I am told by MIMI DAUGHTER, yes you may have a Seat ....  well after waiting for a while someone else walks in  abs they ask questions regarding prices , and wanting a full set and they sit her down and do her nails .  Then after I ask the daughter how can someone who just arrives get their nails done ahead of a repair that\u2019s been waiting for 30 mins . Then MIMi daughter began to get loud , and argue with me , telling me that I still need to wait , both not seeking any support or understanding of the situation , then she lies and say I have to wait for the same tech to redo my repair , when after speaking on the phone I was told someone else would be doing  it . I was also told that the nail tech who as doing the full set , can\u2019t do a nail repair . What sense does that make ?  (They can do a fill in , but can\u2019t do a nail repair ) Even as I am explaining myself Mimi began to yell at me abruptly in front of customers even after I give her respect . I am a business owner myself , and the respect you receive here is blatant disrespect. I even told the manager I would be leaving a review after the disrespect I received she yells she doesn\u2019t care \u201c it won\u2019t hurt her \u201c, again this is a business owner speaking to a customer like this . Little do they know I am in the military , and will be sure to spread the word to everyone I know . NOT TO GO TO NAILS BY MIMI , there are way better places who respect there customers . People should watch how they treat others , you never know who your customer is , or who they know , and you can definitely hurt business treating people in such a manner . Again don\u2019t waste your money and attend a better nail salon .", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626afe255df913:0xca431ae7112e8fe1"}

I went and got my nails done myself\nEarlier this month for my birthday and 2 days before my birthday two of my nails came COMPLETELY off ! Like the entire acrylic nail came off of my real nail without any damage. I immediately called \"Nails by Mimi \" to let them know how my nails were coming off , I gave them my name so that when I went to get them refixed , there wouldn't be a problem .. guess what ? There was a problem! Anyways Mimi stepped in and fixed my nails , with a TON OF ACRYLIC . I didn't know the consequences of piling so much acrylic on , So I referred my friends to go to this nail shop. Guess what .. their nails broke too ! My friends went to nails by Mimi to get their nails done before their trip to Japan and while they were over there , their nails broke! My friends called to let them know what was going on so that they could get their nails fixed when they arrived back to the states. Nobody wrote their names down or told Mimi what was going on . When we arrived guess what , THERE WAS A PROBLEM . When we entered the store and my friends started explaining to Mimi what was going on , she pulled out her phone and started recording us \ud83d\ude31 !! She started saying things like \" look at them \" \" look at what I have to deal with \" my friends were disgusted and the situation began to get heated . I stood up and addressed Mimi because I was the one who referred my friends and couldn't believe that she was acting this way. I started to address Mimi and reminded her that I was just up here a few weeks ago with the same problem from the same\nNail technician , so my friend's complaint wasn't unusual or unreasonable. I also explained to Mimi that she was profiling my friends and I by instantly pulling her phone out and recording us , when we were only coming to get a service fixed that we had already paid for . Mimi put her phone away and we proceeded on with the encounter. Mimi asked my friends who was the tech that did their nails , they showed her and  The lady who jacked our nails up started speaking in Chinese all angrily and aggressively! Although we could not understand what she was saying , we could tell that she was being agressive and talking trash about us . I told Mimi that the technician was out of line and that as a customer we should not have to deal with her ranting in Chinese or talking about us .. horrible customer service \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude24. The situation died down and Mimi started to fix my friends nails , she was obviously upset that we articulate what we wanted done and we refused to pay for horrible customer service . Mimi says to us \" one monkey don't stop Mimi's show \" \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31 I was LIKEE WHATTTTT !! I explained to Mimi that yeah one person won't hurt your business but horrible customer services skills and profiling customers will ! I attend Alabama A&M and have told plenty of people to go to Mimi's but NOT anymore ! They rush on your nails and give horrible customer service skills . Your nails will fall off and they will blame it on you , and not on the fact that they use cheap acrylic ! Oh yeah , and if you tell them that you're nails weren't strong enough and broke off  they will slap tons of the cheap acrylic on your nails making them rip your real nails off and leaving you looking like a mutant !", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626afe255df913:0xca431ae7112e8fe1"}
