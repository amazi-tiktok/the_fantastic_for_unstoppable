Our sign, placed in front of the door where you actually have to read it and go around it to access the door states, and I quote exactly: \"ATTENTION - IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A MASK OR FACIAL COVERING, PLEASE STAY OUTSIDE. WE WILL CURBSIDE YOUR ORDER. CALL 334-277-9925.\n\nThe sign also states: \"DUE TO THE RISK OF CONTAMINATION, ALL SALES ARE FINAL - NO REFUNDS.\"\n\nYou were not refused service as you have incorrectly stated - you were refused entrance to the INSIDE of our business since you had no facial covering. You were given the option to our curb side service - which you refused to take advantage of. We provide a nice, socially distanced safe outside sitting area for those without masks or facial coverings to use. We actually have a large amount of customers who prefer the outdoor curbside service and delivery option.\n\nWe require this of everyone - regardless of race, color, gender, religious or political orientation. Why you consider yourself some elite exception in that you feel that you have some special entitlement, are better than all our other customers,  and can disregard our store policy, which has been in effect for many months now, I do not know - and there are no exceptions to our store entrance policy. We are a privately owned and operated local, family business - and we set the store policy here.\n\nYou are not entitled or above all our other customers who follow the store policy and are very, very happy to be able to shop in such a sanitary, healthy and very friendly 32+ year service and community oriented business\n\nAll of us wear our correct facial coverings all day long. We do take short breaks from wearing the coverings when not in the store to allow for C02 reduction and etc - but are right back on when back inside the store.\n\nFunny, but no one here remembers anyone of your mask intolerance issue trying to come in. What ever - there is an outside curbside service area for those reading this post who may have some type of facial mask/covering issue that can benefit from this incident, and know there is an outside curbside service option for them.\n\nWe  hope you find your happy place to shop.

Fresh organic sustainable food, and dry goods that rival any large grocery store. I\u2019ve bought probiotics, prebiotics, vitamins, minerals, alkaline water and so much more. They offer local products too, like honey and candles. The personalized one on one service they offer is above and beyond any local store. They are kind, compassionate and helpful to anyone asking questions when faced with so many choices. Anything and everything they ever suggested for me helped me so much. Now, with the Covid-19, they are asking people to wear masks in the store or plan to call ahead and order what you need and they will bring it out to you, curbside. People complaining they cannot wear a mask have the alternative to call from their car, make an order and literally in seconds they bring it to your car. I also have health issues where I cannot breath if I wear a mask. I ordered a couple minutes before reaching their store and had my purchase soon as I pulled into the parking lot. I don\u2019t understand people thinking the store staff try to push only the products that they use themselves. They have not done that to me in all my times in store. Well. That doesn\u2019t include the time they suggested some tasty tea, though. All in all, there\u2019s not another place around that offers what Healthwise Foods does. Check them out for yourself.

Healthwise is the store you have been searching for!\n\nI have shopped at Healthwise for over 15 years. The owners stay on the leading edge of knowledge related to health and nutrition. They are always available to assist you with answering your questions. They have never rushed me and they take the time to answer all my questions. I trust them for their extensive knowledge of nutritional and holistic treatments and practices.\n\nAdditionally, I trust them to validate and verify that their suppliers are actually providing the product identified on the package. Many large chain stores and grocery stores sell brands that are nothing but sawdust and powder. You can be confident you are getting the product on the label. They also sell grass-fed beef and other meat products that are healthy for you -- not full of hormones and antibiotics.\n\nThe owners require their staff members to train on which herbs or supplements would be the best solution to address whatever health condition you are trying to treat. The staff is very friendly and they are right there to help you if you have a health related question, or you can't find a product you are looking for.\n\nI realize the are other health stores in the local marketplace. I have stepped into some of them as I was driving around town. I was curious about their knowledge of health and nutrition, the suppliers they purchased from, and the prices they were charging for the different products I regularly purchase. I could not find any store who could match the knowledge of owners and staff at Healthwise. The range of products were usually not as extensive as Healthwise and the prices were comparable to Healthwise.\n\nI trust the owners of Healthwise and the quality of the products they sell. I will continue to purchase my health related items from them!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a2e56267227:0xff334b082af99c2c"}
