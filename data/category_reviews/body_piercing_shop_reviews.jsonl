The only time I have ever used anyone else is when she took a short break to finish college.\nThe very first piercings Sarah did for me were my nipples. I was very nervous because I had always been told how painful male nipple piercings, but Sarah made me feel calm and relaxed by assuring me that it was worse in my head, the piercings were a little painful but nothing like I thought it would be. She did such an amazing job, so I've recommended her to everyone. She is always very professional, nice, gentle, and most important quick with a needle.\nSince then, Sarah has also pierced my industrial, several other cartilage piercings, 6 Frenums, and my lobes using 6 gauge tunnels. The most recent piercings she did were both of my daiths for migraine relief; the first time in 7 years I have been migraine free for 3 months!!!\nEvery piercing she has ever done on me has healed perfectly and I have made sure to follow her aftercare instructions to the letter.\nHowever while she was on break I went to 2 different shops nearby for piercings, one with a female piercer and one with a mail piercer/tattoo artist. I had a standard cartilage piercing done by the female piercer. She (along with staff at that shop) was very rude, charged almost double the price, offered no aftercare, insisted on using a ring instead of the bar like I was accustomed to, and told me they were using titanium jewelry.\nI used the same aftercare that I've always used but the constant movement of the ring caused my ear to become so infected that I lost 2 completely healed piercings in that ear also. Later I found out that the jewelry they used was not titanium at all (not even titanium coated), it wasn't even nickel and lead tested surgical steel! When I went to the male piercer/tattoo artist's shop the place so sketchy and he was such a jerk that I left immediately.\nI WILL NEVER LET ANYONE BUT SARAH PIERCE ME AGAIN.

I contacted them through Facebook looking to set an appointment for two scoop tongue piercings. I sent them a picture of what I wanted and I was told they could do it. I had to pay a 20 dollar deposit to book my appointment and pay the remainder when I got to the shop. First, I had to pay the remainder before even receiving my service which I can understand but that wasn't on their website, Facebook page or anything. Secondly, when I went back to get my piercing, the lady pulled out the wrong kind of bar. I stated,\"that's too small. That's not what I want.\" I pulled my phone out to show her the pic I sent and she told me\" yea we don't have that bar for that piercing.\" She was very like nonchalant. We kept trying to make small talk and ask\nQuestions and she just seemed annoyed like she didn't wanna deal with us.  So I became upset, because whoever I was talking to on the Facebook page said y'all could do that piercing. Never said y'all didn't have the materials to do so. So she proceeds to show my thicker bars but still not what I initially went there to get. I'm telling her like noo, this not what I wanted.  She asks if I want anything else because they don't do refunds. So I came and paid 70 dollars under the assumption I would get what I wanted, they didn't have it and I couldn't get a refund. MINUS ONE STAR.  So I tell her I'll wait while my sister gets hers done first because I was upset. She got ready to do my sisters. The dots she placed on my sisters tongue were symmetrical  and even, BUT once she pierced her tongue we both instantly noticed it was more so to the left, way left, then the center of her tongue. My sister said she was fine with it. Cool. So I got back in the chair to get mines. I wasn't about to waste 70 bucks. ALSO I FEEL A CUSTOMER SHOULD NOT PAY FOR A SERVICE BEFORE THEY GET IT DONE ! Seeing as how there are no refunds, which I was told after the fact, and then lied about being able to do what I wanted. Anyways, I get in the chair. She is drawing the dots on my tongue and had to mark my tongue like 3-4 times because then we're not even. When she finally gets it even and placed in the middle. Let me say the ink taste terrible! She proceeds to pierce and I can feel as soon as the needle went in and was not near the middle of my tongue. IMMEDIATELY I notice my Piercing is to the left of my tongue also. So I'm irritated all over again. I kept trying to show her how it wasn't in the middle and she says\"it's just the way you holding your tongue.\" Lmao, this was horrible! So I continue to tell her it's not in the middle and she tells me we can take it out and redo it and I'm like fine. She then Says \"well not right now I have other appointments coming.\"\nLike NO you should finish with the appointment you already are in and I PAID ! So I leave and then I decided hell no. I'm getting this redone. I go back and she tells me to come back at 4. Two hours later. Cool.\nI come back. Have to wait like 30 min. She finally calls be back to redo it. I'm showing her how it's NOT in the middle. The second time hurt like HELL because my tongue was already starting to swell from the first go round. She gets it in a much better position this time. It's closer to middle but VERY slanted. I said thanks and it looks MUCH better then before because it honestly does and I left. My sister wanted hers done over but she saw how painful mines was and neither of us should not have even had to go thru that. It should've been right the first time AND we should've got what we originally came for. So now my tongue is 2x swollen and sore because it had to go thru the trauma  twice ! Her hands were also shakey and normally when people pierce something like a tongue, they stand in front of you. Instead she was on the side which might have been the reason for them being sideways. Like I stated. The place was very clean and had a cool vibe. I just had a bad experience.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886286825a6aa277:0xfa4f89d127fb3708"}

If I could give zero stars, I would. I decided to come to Royal Spade after seeing a Facebook post about Friday the 13th tattoo specials. The Facebook post stated that they would be doing small 2-4 inch simple tattoo designs from 1-10pm and it specifically said Walk-In only. I arrived at the shop around 6:30pm and paid for my tattoo. At that point, there were five other people in the waiting area. As I waited, several other people came into the shop. I waited for a couple of hours as the people that came in before me got their tattoos done. At around 9:45, the receptionist called back people that arrived after I did. I was a little confused, so I went to the desk and asked the receptionist if I was next in line. She told me that there was one couple ahead of me but that I would be next after that. She asked what my tattoo was, and I told her it was the symbol for the air element, which was only a triangle with a line through it. She told me that she would try to squeeze me in next before the couple because my tattoo was so simple. At around 10:30, the couple that was ahead of me was called back. A few minutes later, another couple that arrived after me was called back. I went to the front desk and told the receptionist that I thought I was next. It was at this point that one of the tattoo artists came up and told me that they could not keep tattooing all night and that they could not accept walk-ins all night. I pointed out that people who arrived after me were called back, and that I had been there since 6:30pm. That is when he informed me that everyone that was called back had been in earlier that day and were told to come back later. I was dumbfounded that I was not told this once; not when I came in nor during the four-hour duration I spent waiting. I was not informed about any possibility that I would not be able to get my tattoo tonight until after I had been waiting four hours, and then was told that I could not get my tattoo. It also makes no sense to me why people could leave and come back for a special that was advertised as Walk-In only.

I went back to show them the tattoo and the first thing that was asked was \u201cdid you get it here\u201d .... KNOWING that they had JUST seen me.!! Then I was directed to another artist there who DID NOT do my tattoos and wasn\u2019t even there the day i had got them and he clearly knew that something wasn\u2019t right because he asked \u201cwhat have you put on it.?!?\u201d And I replied \u201caquaphor\u201d because that\u2019s what they recommended and that\u2019s also what I used for my other previous tattoos. And then he tried to get smart saying how long he\u2019s been in \u201cthe chair\u201d and they couldn\u2019t do anything until it \u201chealed\u201d But the thing is when this heals they wouldn\u2019t be able to put ink on the spots that are MISSING SKIN and they KNOW IT. I was extremely polite until they tried to pass it off like they didn\u2019t see my skin and the colored FLESH that was showing because the artist dug wayyy too deep. I was even okay with the artist not making the tattoo the color i wanted because he claimed he \u201ccouldn\u2019t see well\u201d that night so i went with a whole nother tattoo look than i was going for.& I thought it still turned out nicely until things took a turn for the worst.  I know how tattoos are supposed to heal because I have them and have went to MULTIPLE ARTISTS so It\u2019s not me being \u201cpicky\u201d or rude . I at least wanted them to be more concerned but I couldn\u2019t get an apology, an offer to make things right, or even my money back. But I have contacted my lawyer and I will have to make the necessary steps.!! Like I said the man who did the tatt was  NICE as ever but he dug too deep and it left permanent damage on both tats and it could\u2019ve went differently had they at least acknowledged what was wrong. Truly sad the way things were handled/not handled.!! No one wants to have messed up skin especially in a place where it\u2019s visible to people. I trusted them with my skin and the art but got done horribly.. this is why I believe with some places you need to just pay half or pay after the work is done and even if you pay before hand, if something goes wrong because of THEM and you go to them in a polite manner even though this is your body so you have a reason to be alarm and HEATED ....then they should at least do everything in their power to make it right and pay you back and try to fix it. But like I said there\u2019s no fixing this and they knew it that\u2019s why I had to take legal action. Not trying to bash their business or anything because my first initial thought was \u201cthey\u2019re pretty nice people and it\u2019s a cool space\u201d when i first walked in to set the appointment but as far as my experience and things .... I definitely won\u2019t be going there again and the way they handled my situation.. I highly wouldn\u2019t recommend and that\u2019s just me.!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1593571746452, "text": "Looked through all paperwork\u2019s was not ever tattooed at my shop..."}, "gmap_id": "0x888bb172c55c3801:0x63d2bf04b66beb89"}
