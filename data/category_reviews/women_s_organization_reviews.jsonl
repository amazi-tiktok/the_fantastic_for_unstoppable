He had literally told me before we married he really didn't want children. I didn't know who to talk to when I looked up a clinic to visit near me NJWC was my closest hope. I finally told my husband and he went with me to my appointment. I was only two weeks away from the second trimester! It was very overwhelming but the staff was so supportive - their classes are very informative. I knew NOTHING about babies but I felt confident I could care for a child after completing their program. I can still go pick up supplies if I need anything and I have made some lasting relationships with the women who helped me through it all.
