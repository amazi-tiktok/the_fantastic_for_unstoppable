No one called me to inform me my shirts wasn't ready. I live 25mins away. Only went to them by recommendation. Then they said my shirts will be ready by the next day. I decided to call. They were still not ready!! Once again I own a business, so my employees had to wear other uniforms instead of the one's I had in the cleaners. I finally came to get my shirts back. Just to be smirked at and recieve horrible customer service.  She compared my job. Which is great at communicating with the customer.  Then bluntly asked me. \"Do you want your shirts or not?\" I will never use this cleaners ever again & if you want what you paid for. I highly suggest you take your business somewhere else  These people at this company don't care about you or your clothes. May I add. My shirts are not fully cleaned!! First and  last time. I will not give this rufe lazy company any of my hard earn money ever again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888910f4e779593f:0xaac3cbbf09fc4c27"}

Went to the cleaners on the day they said they would be ready was told one of my items was back but the other two weren't.  Called the next day I was told my r 2 items were taken to another site because a machine broke down. Called the next day was told they couldn't find my two items. I told the ladies I was going to report this cleaners to the Better Business Bureau and take them to small claims court if they didn't find my clothes. Called two days later and was told they left a voice mail the following day saying they found my 2 items.  When I got there and the lady handed me the the pants they weren't mine, they were men's pants that had  a P logo on them. My pants were on the right side of the rack there was a paper attached to the plastic over my pants. Written on the Aladdin's paper it had on it EASTWOOD and gray 506. I told the ladies at the cleaners they needed to give me a discount, the older caucasian lady said the next time. I told her that it won't be a next time, she says to me okay then, it won't be a next time. I told her I wasn't being smart aleck with what I was saying to her, I let her know that I don't live in Alabama, I was on vacation. She told the lady to take the amount off for my pants. When I was paying for my two items, the lady at the register ask me if I was serious about reporting the cleaners to the Better Business Bureau and taking them to small claims court, I told her, I was very serious and that I was going to also call the local news station and report how nonchalant and blase they were when I was calling asking about my clothes and their customer service. I told the ladies, I ask for a receipt and didn't get one, that i didn't have anything to do with customers forgetting or losing their receipts. That in the future if a customer ask for a receipt, they need to give them a receipt.  The older caucasian lady started yelling at me to just leave, I told her, I'm not talking to you like a child, don't talk to me like a child. The older caucasian lady yelled at me again to just leave. I said to her and the other lady GOD bless you all and walked out the door.

The lady said it would be done on Friday. I asked for delivery service so I had to go inside and fill out a form.  Then there John or Jason said it would not be ready until Friday, which was fine since I will be out of town but there will be someone at home.  On Thursday night I received an automated voicemail at 9PM; that they would be delivering and picking up clothes on Friday.  Friday comes and goes with no delivery so I called at about 3:00 trying to find out what the problem was.  I was informed by an employee named Katie, that my clothes was ready but there would be no further delivery because \"everyone left for a family graduation\" the graduation for the owners son.  She said that she would leave a note to see about delivering on Saturday, that, \"it shouldn't be a problem\".  On Saturday we called to find what time they would deliver and no one was ever informed and that they don't deliver on Saturday.  My husband had to go to pick up the clothes and was told there was a shirt not ready.  He was told that they would deliver the missing shirt on Monday.  On Monday we called about the shirt and was now told that they do not deliver to our location until Tuesday.  We got the shirt on Tuesday and John (or Jason) called my husband to say the shirt was delivered, trying to apologize.  Unfortunately I had to call him back because he told my husband things that were totally wrong.\nThe bottom line is that this business has a very long way to go to on customer service.  Family companies are great but there is no reason that one order should have so many untruths told in order to cover up for the fact that they left on Friday.  Additionally, all employees need to be able to talk to the companies policies, even if they are only part-time employees.  Because of these problems, we will definitely not be returning and everyone who asks (and some that don't) will hear about our experience.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1369248649373, "text": "Dear Mrs. Skrobis,\nWe apologize for the miscommunication on our side of the issue.

We continued to drive here after we relocated to Pelham/Alabaster for almost 3 years now. Despite the fact that almost every time we have dropped off my husband's shirts, they've had to be redone TWICE because they were NOT clean on the collar or cuffs. But yet they continued to starch and press them when it is always clearly visible that they're NOT clean. We drop off around 10 at a time & we pretreat them each time in an attempt to get them clean on the first try so we don't have to make useless trips. His shirts are only worn once prior to cleaning. So we go this week to pick up last weeks drop. And as usual they have to be redone. We have tolerated this until... I go in and when I check to see if they're clean & they are not, the young lady says to me the owner said that if you want your shirts done \"PERFECTLY\" then you need to dry clean them but they will not be relaundered. & we would have to pay $4.25 per shirt for that! I show her the cuffs and asked if she could see the grime still present & she repeated her statement. The other person assisted and said she would send them back to redo as dry cleaning because we had paid. Then my husband gets a phone call not from the owner but from one of the high school students, reiterating to him that if he wants his shirts done \"PERFECTLY\" that he needs to pay to have them dry cleaned. Now, we see just how much they #1 first and foremost don't care about their image, or the quality of their work. #2 the impact on the environment. #3 losing the business of a committed long term customer relationship.

Now I have to wash my tiny blankets in a massive $6.00 washer that they also use to \"dry clean\" everyones comforters. Which barely works. (I have paid the $50 for dry cleaning and its pathetic) So there is always a line. The attendants will tell at you for closing doors to hard. They care more about smoking cigerattes outside then anything. Hostile place to wash your clothes. I do not recommend.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88861cad4b1be2f9:0x5e22966cef9373d"}

I phoned the owner and left a voicemail re: communication on article of clothing. No phone call returned. Currently I do not have my article of clothing or compensation for lost article.

So, I was looking for a reliable dry cleaner in Mobile as I just moved here. I foind Waite's online, they have a bunch of great reviews and the negative reviews seem to have been addressed by the owner so I felt confident that I would be taken care of and even if something went wrong I'd still be treated right.\n\nSo, I called ahead well in advance to ask if I brought something in by close of business when could I expect it to be done and I was informed it would be ready for pick up the following afternoon. I got out of work late but was still able to make it there by close of business. However, I still went ahead and called when I was about 10 minutes out to let them know I was on my way since I would be arriving right before they closed. They we're very amenable to that fact. I arrived right before they closed for the day and I dropped off my items. I was again told I could expect them to be ready the following afternoon.\n\nI arrived to pick them up the next day and I was told that after I dropped off my items their system rebooted and as a result my items got put in the wrong load and they wouldn't be ready until another day later. This was mildly annoying but not a huge deal. It would have been great to receive a courteous call to make me aware of the mistake so I could have avoided leaving work early to come get my items that weren't actually ready like I had been told.\n\nI arrive the next day to pick up my items. They we're ready this time and clean. I asked if I light get a discount since my items weren't ready when I was told they would be ready. The manager, or some guy that seemed to be in charge came out to speak with me. This is where I really take issue with the service I was provided. Up until this point everyone had been very nice and polite despite the error.\n\nThe guy in charge came out and again explained to me why my clothes weren't ready the day before. I told him I understood that. He proceeded to explain further why my clothes weren't ready as if my lack of understanding of the mistake they made was the problem. He managed to be both very nice and congenial yet very condescending at the same time. To remind you, at this point I had simply asked the front employee if I might get a discount due to the delay, not why there was a delay. He did not even broach the topic of giving me any kind of a discount at this point. I asked if it was normal for a delay in the cleaning to arise and then the customer to not be called and informed that their items had a new pick up date. Because honestly, that was the biggest inconvenience. He told me that he is just one guy and there is no way he could call everyone and tell them that. He also felt the need to tell me that when they tell someone their items will hb ready by 4:30 the next day that's not a guarantee. Which, I also found somewhat condescending because I never implied or thought that it was a guarantee. However, it does seem to me like prudent business practices to follow through with promises you make and make it up to people when you can't, or, if you find you can't keep those promises on a regular basis change the promises you're making to what you can actually follow through with. He then decided to look at my work badge and mention that he knows the CEO of the hospital and that he's sure he would agree with him on how he's running his business. Which was the 2nd most condescending thing he said and certainly the most irrelevant. However, despite how condescending he was his demeanor was very nice and congenial. While he was saying this the woman behind register ran my card for the full amount. Then came the most condescending thing he said; I must have been noticeably perturbed because as I'm grabbing my items he said, \"are you alright, did you want like 3 dollars off or something,\" very flippantly and only after they ran my card.\n\nI was a first time customer; this isn't the way you earn repeat customers. Dry cleaning is dry cleaning, one chooses a place based on quality of service.
