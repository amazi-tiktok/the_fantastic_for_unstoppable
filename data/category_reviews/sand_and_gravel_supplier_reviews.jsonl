Unlike other companies I had contacted, he was able to give us a quicker time frame and set us up for about 2 weeks out. Josh gave prompt replies to questions and updated us as the projected date approached. On the construction day he and his crew showed up exactly on time and started to work on the project without any delay. His crew was also very polite and friendly and accommodated our needs. Josh's crew worked efficiently and never took a break and the job was done sooner than we expected. Josh and his crew are particular about their job and giving it their all to meet or exceed the customers expectations. Josh makes sure to check on the progress in between and again once the job is complete. Customer satisfaction is important to him. It has been a real pleasure to work with Josh and I hope he continues to stay true to himself and the way he treats people. His momma raised him right! \"Thank you\" doesn't seem to be enough to say to Josh and his crew. Right now it's just a \"pile of dirt\", but it is part of making our dreams come true.
