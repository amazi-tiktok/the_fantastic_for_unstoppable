I was blown away at the price so I decided to think on it. Shawn told me the part alone cost 50 dollars. I told him I would rather look around for another computer and I would like to pick up my computer. He told me come on by and pick it up the following day. A few days later I decided to pull it apart and see how detailed the work was. As I took it apart I noticed there was no hard drive in it. I called Shawn as he proceeded to say that that happens sometimes and his kid must have forgot to put it back in when they were looking for the issue. Additionally I found the part on eBay new for less than 20 dolllars. Not to mention the fact that the diagnoses when they originally took it apart would have been an extra screw to replace the DC jack which he tried charging me another 100 bucks. All together a very bad experience and I would rather avoid this place at all cost.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1507037043493, "text": "sir we dont use ebay parts\nsorry for the drive being left out\neverybody makes mistakes\nand the diagnoses you was informed about up front\nu did not have to leave it'\nsorry for ur inconvenience"}, "gmap_id": "0x8892928318bc5bf3:0x74cb69ce96d94207"}

Mr Garcia had fallen for a scam artist and had allowed the person access to his computer. The laptop was terribly infected. I cleaned the system of the infections, tools, and changes made to his computer, which I cleaned and worked through midnight on Friday night to ensure he would have it back on Saturday.  To work on the computer I had to set the desktop magnifier back to normal 100% rather than 150% magnification. On opening Monday morning, 12/18, he came back into the shop very angry and abusive, complaining he couldn't see his desktop.  I set the desktop magnification back to 150%, and he told me about the password problem.  I tried to go through the 2 step verification with him to retrieve his password, but since he had previously done this multiple times at home , he had been put into \"time out\" by Google, telling him to come back and try again in a few hours.  He demanded that I call google and get it fixed, which google doesn't do (to my knowledge).  I asked him to be patient and try again later, but he continued to be abusive.  We did receive a message that the password was changed 6 days before, which would have been December 12.  He stated he thought he knew the password, but it didn't work.  I tried tell the customer that these safeguards were in place for the safety of his account and information, but he refused to believe that I couldn't just pick up the phone and call Google and get this problem fixed.

To give my company 3 stars just because we are not sitting around waiting on your arrival is not fair. Has it ever dawned on you that we are not sitting around twiddling our thumbs, we are not at the bowling alley having fun, we are not at a social party ,  we are working even when we are not at the store location. It's called out on a service call.\n\nWe have a sign permanently posted to the front door that states if we are not at the store please call the number listed and a rep will arrive to assist you within 15 minutes.  We have been at this location for 10 years, during that 10-year tenure my records show that we have service your computer needs just two times once in 2013 and once in 2014. Here it is 2018 that you show up and leave a negative review because you arrive one or two times and there's no one at the store to assist you. During our 10-year tenure there have been computer stores that have come and gone however we have survived, and the reason why we survived is because we do good work and most people obey the sign that is posted on the door.\n\nIf they come and we're not present they follow the instructions they simply pick up their cell phone dial the number listed and Presto a representative arrives within 15 minutes just as stated. You have been most unfair in your review, has it ever dawned on you that we are the only full service retail computer store that's in operation in Wetumpka also within a 20 to 30 mile radius? Shouldn't that alone tell you that we are busy and there will be times when we're not at the store?  You do know that we have a telephone number that most people call, even to make appointments.\n\nDid you pick up the phone and call us to inquire about where we are what we're doing? All of the previous years that we've service you, you've never taken the time to say anything good let alone take the time to leave a positive review.  But here it is after 10 years of service you choose to leave a 3 star review not in regard to our work or the quality of work,  but you leave a 3 star review all because you arrived and no one was at the location, and you failed to pick up the phone call call.\n\nWe service residental and business customers alike, and we provide house calls and onsite service to both. When a business calls us and states there main business computer is down, we setup an onsite service call leave the store even at times when no one will be left to service the store. Why do we do this?  Its not personal its just business.  There is more money to be made in one business service call then there is for us to sit in the store waiting on residential customers to find the time to bring there computer in.   For you to reply to our absence as thow we are out on lake martin fishing rather than taking care of business is certianly not fair judgment. The good book says \"Judge not lest you be judged, for the same measure in which you judge others, you will be judged\".\n\nMaybe the next time a solicitor comes to your residential door in an attempt to sell you a product and you're not home, maybe that's solicitor should log on to Google and leave you a negative review. Not based on the fact that you didn't buy his product, but a negative review based solely on the fact that you were not even home.\n\nIn closing, I would like for you to exercise your right to choose another store to do business with.  Best Buy would be the closest and is only 45 miles away from your residence.  I just can't see the logic in us continuing to service someone who has Judged us so unfairly. If you would like to discuss this matter further, our phone number has been the same now for 10 years. I hope you have a better day."}, "gmap_id": "0x888c2694964e20c1:0x7e27f6a2f3473c19"}

I broke the screen badly the first time and the wonderful people at phone Probs worked diligently to fix it and make it like brand new again.\nAfter leaving phone Probs(extremely satisfied), I went to the Apple store to buy a phone case for my iPhone 7 Plus. The tech accidentally broke the screen on it and told me it was because the people who replaced my phone screen(He was implying Phone Probs) didn\u2019t instal it right. I was mad, as anyone would be, and I was very expressive in telling phone Probs they owed me a new screen for installing a faulty one. Now, I am a very very VERY  verbal person, and even after I fed them my 2 cents, 25 cents, and a few swear words in between, Drew and his wonderful father still stood by my side and tried to assist me. While they didn\u2019t replace it for free, they showed me how it couldn\u2019t have just broke and the Apple guy probably broke it and didn\u2019t own up to it, they helped me replace the screen and I am forever satisfied with this business again.\nThey are good people with hearts of gold. And they put up with a lot. And I meant ALOT. So next time you need a phone repair, laptop repair, or even computer, go see these guys at Phone Probs.
