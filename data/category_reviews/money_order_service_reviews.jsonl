Now honestly Huntsville, I have met my share of rude people, but I cannot and I will not saying I'll make such a comment towards the two nice ladies who works at Easy Money which is located at 4820 University Drive. I don't understand why their ratings are only 2.7 which is ridiculous! From my personal experience Shenikka and DeDe are the most kind and humble hearted ladies I've met and we've been living here almost one year now. We all know that when you go into an office or business you expect people to become magicians but they work in customer service. And there are some very rude people that can come and expect whatever the situation is it should automatically be okay for them to adjust but it doesn't work that way! You have to be very kind to people if you want them to be kind to you. You have to be humble when you want someone to help you and you would get the same treatment in return. So don't be fooled by this low rating that you see on this Google app because it's not true. These ladies will work with you any kind of way they can and is done without prejudice. So when you go into this store you can ask for either of them and I guarantee you they will be nice, they will be kind, and they will be very understanding of your situation and if they can help you they will. But don't go into the office or any business with a bad attitude oh, because of you bring me a bad attitude you may get one in return depend on the situation. So be very nice and kind to them as you want them to be to you. Don't say something bad about someone just because you had a messed-up situation that could not be fixed so you want to get back at a person by giving them a bad review it doesn't work that way. Be nice and kind and you'll get the same results in return. laser doing a real good job I appreciate you and keep on doing what you doing because you doing good work for this community that's so need you. And if corporate does not appreciate you for the work that you do then maybe they should come and switch places with you to see the type of situation that you deal with everyday because I think you all are doing a hell of a job and from my standpoint from what I see with my own two eyes, keep doing what you doing because your proof in the pudding of good customer service and what it's about. If if corporate does not appreciate you just know that we do parrot God bless you keep up the good work and I'm praying for your safety there it is terrible crisis that we are now in but only temporarily.

It\u2019s either mail we ship doesn\u2019t deliver, or packages we ordered don\u2019t come. The only way the packages actually get where they need to be is when we actually have to make a special trip to the post office to sort it out, and even then it takes a while for the mail to get to it\u2019s destination. Whenever you try to call the post office to sort it out you have to spend a while on the phone with confusing recordings, and then on top of that you never even speak to another human. They should do something to fix this, and they should quit having all these confusing recordings, and just have an actual human answer the calls. If someone actually answered the calls instead of a recording, it would save people a lot of wasted time and confusion. Another problem we\u2019ve had constantly is packages being delivered to our house that aren\u2019t ours, and then we have to deliver them to the person they were meant to go to. The only reason I\u2019m giving this post office a two star rating, is because of the excellent work they\u2019ve done in the past.

The first time I went there they did not have post card stamps, and told me, with an attitude that I would have to get them somewhere else. (I'm sorry, I thought I was at the post office.)\nThe second time I went for Christmas stamps, which they had, but when I inquired about purchasing normal Forever stamps, the lady opened her draw, said she had none and walked away from her lane, saying she was closed. This left me standing there, wondering if anyone was going to help me, if she was coming back, or if the other worker even acknowledge what just happened. Thankfully she helped me after she finished with her customer, only to find out that she too did not have any Forever stamps. I resorted to purchasing additional Christmas stamps instead.\nThis location has always seemed inefficient, ill-supplied, and the workers incompetent.

The gentleman I spoke to on the phone today I believe he said his name was Brett. I called this morning from Georgia, unaware of the timezone change. I place my phone on speaker while it rang 9 minutes before they opened because I was at work. The phone rang for 51 seconds before someone picked up and hung up. I thought it was an honest mistake. I called back, this is when someone picks up immidiately to quickly respond with a long phrase to which is was unintelligible but the end of the sentence was \"we open at 9 okay bye\", with no time to even apologize for not realizing the time difference. I call back at 1001 eastern time now being that it is 901 in alabama, same guy answers. I asked him if he was the gentleman I had recently spoken too? He immidiately gets defensive and says we were not open you need to call back at 9 when we open, to which I replied it is 901. He proceeds to attempt to rush me off the phone to get back to loading packages. He is clearly upset with how the 9 minutes prior to this call has gone. I was calling to ask to have my packages held at the location because of how many will be coming in between now and Friday so as to not inconvenience them with a large amount of packages over a few days. Due to him being immediately cynical of how he assumed I was just being annoying with the phone ringing \"50 times\" in his words,, which when would it ever be justifiable to answer and hang up? I'm just going to call back? Why be so negative? I was trying to do you a favor. My packages left the carrier facility at 647 this morning in abbeville, I live 6 minutes away by car. It is 607 at night. Still hasn't arrived. Thats okay.

She also said that Bryan said he may have dropped it off at the store beside us that he couldn't remember. I've spoke to the owner the manager and the employees and they all said that they never received our package and that none of them have received a phone call from her. I figured it may have been the mall manager so I called her, nope not her either. I asked for some kind of proof that it was delivered and they could not give me any form of proof, I asked why he documented that it was delivered to a mailbox and he was saying he delivered it to us (why is the documentation off u know) and she said oh well they sometimes accidentally push the wrong button and file it wrong. So on top of them losing two of our packages and lying to us and having false documentation they are now saying that they are not gonna reimburse us for any of our packages they have lost.

My mail is left with my neighbors mail in their boxes at times. Not always, mind you, just sometimes. And Why is it that our carrier will leave 2 out of 3 packages stuffed inside our jumbo box, and take the 3rd back with him causing Amazon to notify me that the carrier COULD NOT MAKE IT TO MY DOOR to leave my package and that I must contact the carrier to track it down?? My front door is about a hundred or so yards from my  mailbox & the carrier has left packages at my front door before numerous times. However,  yesterday he could not. I called the Post Office, spoke with the supervisor on June 11, 2019, tried to find out where my package was like Amazon told me to do, and  after a brief hold was told shortly & quickly the carrier will bring my package out today and the call was disconnected. How rude.  Why was it not left yesterday with the other two packages that WERE delivered?? Were there dragons in my driveway he just could not overcome??  And for over a month now, for some reason when the carrier tries to leave my mail the door on my mailbox decides to attack and tears itself from the box and flings itself into the ditch. My husband has tried to force it to stay by installing new rivets to hold the door on the box on (2) two separate occasions. We have finally stepped up to using bolts to fasten the door to the box. We sincerely hope this will stop our wayward mailbox from acting so rudely to our mail carrier. Hopefully this will help encourage our carrier to know we care about our mail and packages and appreciate him doing the same. He can leave our packages at our door anytime. \ud83d\ude0a", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a58724b29e4b7:0xebdeace4798d816b"}

You\u2019ll be the problem be the end of the conversation. Our carrier wasnt delivering packages to our door in our complex for about two or so weeks, and when we complained about never receiving the package we were told that our mailbox wasn\u2019t labeled clearly enough and that he thought our building was abandoned bc of mail being piled up in ONE. Our boxes are labeled by a big bronze number to match our doors.. so they are labeled, but we agreed to pull a little weight despite this clearly not being our fault and the staff being a little rude. There\u2019s four mail slots and only one full from vacancy.. which isn\u2019t our mailbox and it wasnt a month ago when that same mail box was full and ours was being checked regularly. The other two people in our cluster were receiving mail fine and this didn\u2019t become a problem for us until about two weeks ago. We have been here for MONTHS. It\u2019s super easy to get our utility bill, but when it comes to our other mail suddenly our apartment was \u201cabandoned\u201d. There is no place for packages so they would have to walk up the stairs to deliver it anyways like they had done before, and as UPS and FEDex does. Come home today to a package shoved in the mail box. Anytime there\u2019s a flimsy package it gets delivered to me because they\u2019re easier to fold and shove into the mail slot, but if it\u2019s a box heaven forbid. The idea of the carrier being lazy or confused wasn\u2019t even entertained.\n\nThis review was posted in the past but I figured I\u2019d give it a little update since some time has passed. Was 3 stars and I think 1 is sufficient. After the situation above, we had a new mail carrier assigned to us after a month or so. New mail carrier refused to deliver any mail to my part of the complex. I would literally watch her deliver to other buildings. The only thing that set our apart was that there were extra stairs from the parking lot to climb before you got to our boxes. Other buildings got their mail but ours never got delivered. We fought with our landlords and the post office over who\u2019s responsibility it was to fix the mailbox situation. No matter how many times I tried there was not getting in contact with the post master. My landlords went as far as replacing the mail box itself because the first excuse was that the mail boxes weren\u2019t secure.  I started to think that maybe the post master didn\u2019t even exist as it was impossible to get them on the phone or even in front of me when I was at the counter. Again, no one wanted to entertain the idea of the mail carrier not wanting to do their job was even an option. To give you a time frame we started having issues in Aug of 2019. We didn\u2019t get a single piece of mail until January 2020 when we MOVED because we couldn\u2019t get any mail and it was clear no one with the power to fix things was going to do it. and guess who I\u2019ve recently seen in pictures disrupting a public event on the property? The good ole post master.

The post office called, asked if I got my package and I said no, so they said they'll call me right back after speaking with the carrier. They did not call back, that was a week ago. I called many times to get back in touch, but like I said - no one picks up. I received an email from USPS customer service saying my issue is resolved, saying my package was in a parcel locker and to check my mailbox for the key. The parcel lockers were empty and there was no key in my mailbox. I tried to call the post office, no answer. After a few days, I went by in person. The clerk took my info and assured me that the carrier will contact me. They did not. I still do not have my packages.\n\nI have reported one of the packages missing to the business I purchased it from because it has been two weeks since it was \"delivered\" and all they could do is start an investigation with USPS. The other, I will wait a few days and if it's not here I will report it missing as well.

So normally anytime a package is delivered to our home (no matter who the courier is) its placed either at the gate of our courtyard or right at the front door (12 feet from the gate)... NOT this time... Instead who ever management has decided to run our route decided to place the large package on top off not only our mailbox but also on top of our neighbors mailbox (2 mail boxes 2 post). WTH!!! Our mailbox is 2 acres away from the house and by the way even though its personal business im a disabled Veteran, (cant just walk to the mailbox so dont try a think im just lazy) so i had to watch and make sure no one stole this large package until my wife or neighbor came home and checked the mail after work... I know this has to be a new deiver because our old USPS driver would have never done something so ignorant and lazy... Please fix this for everyone else in the future and make sure delivery drivers have a little common sense and maybe a little bit of respect for other people and there mail (envelope or box).. oh and by the way for anyone thinking about (it was just a mistake) NOT this time...

WEDDING RING \u201cMISSING\u201d OR LIKELY STOLEN BY EMPLOYEE! 907 Spring Hill Ave, Mobile, AL 36604.  You hate to think the worst, and you would hope to god you could trust the US Postal Service, but this situation screams of scandal.  A few weeks ago On June 26th 2020 we were sending my fianc\u00e9s wedding ring back to Arizona to be fixed.  It was a family heirloom given to me by my now deceased grandmother to give to my wife. Of course this is the type of item which cannot be replaced by \u201cinsurance\u201d money.  The clerk knew the value, as when I asked that the package be sent by certified mail she said she had no forms and no supervisor. It has now been 3 weeks and the ring has not made it to its final destination. When using the tracking number supplied, it appears that the package never left Mobile. I have since gone to 2 other postal locations in an attempt to get assistance with tracking the package. Coincidence is hard to believe at this point.  Customer service will now not return my phone calls, the case made online is being ignored.  When going down to the post office in person I am met with hostility and aggression, not only at this location but at 250 St Joseph St, Mobile, AL 36601 as well. This is awful, we are torn apart by this and the post office has done nothing.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4e2c20c2e645:0xad6ec1c478ddce45"}

If your postal inspector general says that your mail is not considered \"mail\" until it has been scanned into the office, but your postal clerks REFUSE to give consumers proof that they submitted a package, it means that the postal service does not have to pay claims to people when they lose their packages, because there is no way to prove that the package was even received by the post office. I think this is a way for the post office to get away with theft and neglect. This is the second time that I have taken my package into a post office and was told that I could not have a receipt. I have not received confirmation that my package was scanned. My last package was stolen and I was informed that I couldn't submit a claim because they never scanned my package in. So even though the clerk told me to leave it there, it ended up being my fault for leaving it, and the post office would not pull the film unless it was a threat. So I lost my money and items, and received a big fat F you from the post office. I know I walked into that office with three packages, and left with none. And my package was never found. The post office is wrong for this and this is exactly why you are loosing money.\n\nUpdate...they did it again! I ordered boxes from the post office...online because you can get them FREE!!! Why did I go into the post office and the lady at the front desk attempted to CHARGE me for the box?!!!! Then said that she wasn\u2019t going to ship my package unless I paid.

Blatant lie from USPS. When to this USPS center to try and retrieve my package. They woman at the customer service desk argued with me I had no package there. When asked to confirm my tracking number, they told me they were \"unauthorized to release the package\" even though I had several forms of prof it was mine. Funny how it was magically there now. I contacted Otterbox about the incident trying to find away to get my package, and even they where confused as to what was going on. They sent me copies of what I needed to have my package released to me from the USPS center, and now its magically not there again. Imagine that... Luckily Otterbox is replacing the case and paid for new shipping so it won't go through USPS this time.\n\nLast time I checked, theft of mail is a federal crime in the U.S. I really don't understand how these employees still have a job, let alone not having charges brought against them.\n\nAVOID THIS CENTER AT ALL COST!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4e2c20c2e645:0xad6ec1c478ddce45"}

They are dishonest and willing to lie to upsell products and services. I went there on 12/22 to mail my earnest money for a house I was buying. I specifically asked the cashier if it could be guaranteed to be delivered by 12/25. Instead of her informing me that it could not and just advising me to get the regular mail delivery (as all packages would be delivered at the same time) she instead sold me expensive express 1 day delivery for 12/24 that was not guaranteed and even attempted to get me to pay an additional $10-$12 for guaranteed delivery on 12/23 while KNOWING THE ENTIRE TIME THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE. After my earnest money did not arrive, I attempted to get a refund of the full price or at least the price difference in the two services and was told they would not give me anything for my troubles even though it was all caused by their dishonest employee. I hope that USPS as a whole gets shut down because its truly trash. A bunch of over paid people being lazy, dishonest and unwilling to truly help anyone outside of themselves.

Normally I have received AWESOME service at the Brookwood location from the nicest people you can imagine. However, today, Tuesday August 4th 2020, we (husband and I) went to the PO around 9 a.m. to send off a package and the young lady that we dealt with was SO EXTREMELY RUDE...for no reason whatsoever. Just last week my husband had to send off something else and the lady that helped him was SO nice; she helped him seal it correctly and as is normal with NICE and FRIENDLY people/employees, she informed him of when the package should arrive, other details, etc. Today was the complete opposite. I don't know if she was having a bad day or what but she was so rude to us. We realized that the package needed some tape on it (we just come home from the hospital from surgery in the package was in the car and we realized that we should stop by the post office but we saw that it needed to be taped up more...which is usually no big deal) and she literally asked us to pay for the tape....I believe she said \"if it's not Priority Mail then you will have to pay for the tape.\" Which yes of course it was Priority Mail, but she hadn't even bothered to ask at this point. However no worries to you Miss Rude Employee... IF IT HAD NOT BEEN PRIORITY MAIL I/WE WOULD HAVE BEEN WILLING TO PAY THE $0.25 or $5 WORTH OF A FEW PIECES OF TAPE.\n\nAnyway, Little Miss Friendly taped it up herself in a messy way of course because it must have really been putting her out from sitting at her seat drinking her drink that she had to put down to \"help\" us (if that's what you want to call being helped). However with that attitude there was no way we'd dare say anything to her. She flung the receipt and said \"here ya go.\" No, \"have a good day,\" or \"thank you,\" ...nothing.\n\nFolks we're in a different time right now with Covid-19 and there are a lot of people who would like to have a job and having one with the USPS is a very good one so if you don't want to do a job that deals with the public because you're rude and you have an attitude- DON'T DO IT!

Do NOT send valuables through this service. Request UPS or FedEx instead.\n\nI have the unfortunate luck to have this office service our location. My roommates and I have had issues with packages not being delivered before, and the only way of resolving this issue is to go to the office (they will NOT answer the phone). After waiting in line, you will be told something along the lines that you weren't home, or that no one answered the door. This is completely false, as we will usually be waiting for the knock.\n\nI ordered a university class ring from Balfour. They shipped it via USPS. I should mention that they do not have an automated system to email package tracking numbers (really guys?). More than enough time had passed to make and send the ring, so I called to check on its status. They claimed that it had been sent 3 weeks before my call. I was dumbfounded, but asked for them to send me the tracking number so that I could follow up on it. Checked the status of the package: Out for Delivery. They could have \"lost\" the package, but I find that highly improbable if it made it all the way here with no issues.\n\nAttempted calling, to no avail. I then visited their office, only to be told that they couldn't find it. I was also asked repeatedly why I had waited so long to notify them (it had been an hour since I found out). I had to repeatedly explain the situation to each person and it seemed as though they just couldn't grasp it. I finally gave up after some weak promises of finding it. I called Balfour and notified them of the situation so that they could start working on things from their end.\n\nI then called the USPS service number. I was on hold for 55 minutes before speaking to a representative. He was very helpful with setting up a case with the missing package and assigning the task to one of the location supervisors. I requested that they contact me through email so that I would have documentation of our conversations.

I thought maybe they just couldn\u2019t get up the driveway since we had a bad storm a couple of days ago and a very big tree had fallen on one half of the driveway. Our house sits on a hill so if you don\u2019t continue down the road a little you don\u2019t see that the driveway continues all the way up the hill to the other side. I made sure to make a note letting them know that we have another driveway just a little further down the rod. I scheduled for a redelivery for the next day, and received a confirmation email. Next day comes and no package, and no updates other than my confirmation email. I called the local office it was being held at and the lady on the phone was extremely rude. She would cut me off mid sentence, and would ask me condescendingly if I had checked all around the house for it. She wouldn\u2019t let me get a word in edgewise. Right as I\u2019m about to give her the tracking number she cuts me off again to say she had people in the lobby and immediately puts me on hold for at least 10 minutes. When I finally get to giving her the tracking number I come to find out that the reason it wasn\u2019t delivered was because it was TOO LARGE FOR THE VEHICLE. You couldn\u2019t have told me that, instead of leading me around in circles thinking my package was on its way? It\u2019s all of 20lbs and too large??\nI wouldn\u2019t be so stirred up about this if the desk lady wasn\u2019t so condescending and rude.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x886278a2015981d3:0xdb74c502b12dbf84"}

Don't bother paying for 2 day delivery because it will easily take about a week for you to receive your packages. It is remarkable how much they don't care about the mail they deliver. It is apparent every time I visit this office that they lack any understanding of how basic customer service works. They have literally no idea how to run a business. It's dumbfounding how a package that was supposed to be delivered on a certain day cannot be picked up on the same day considering it's in the SAME CITY. All you have to do is look at the hours these people work. 4:30 is your cutoff ladies and gentlemen. If you work a 9 to 5 like everyone else well too bad! You'll have to inconvenience yourself to get the packages YOU paid for. And even if you go they still might not have your mail at the office!

Paid about $180 for international shipping. Good service should be expected everywhere, but it is even more infuriating to have to pay this much while receiving this kind of treatment.

Thank you Daphne post office for listening to my problem and working to ensure good service in the future!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a43d7d461da2f:0xc7eccdfab6fbe1cb"}

Then, it was my notice for my Medicaid that lets me know I need to refile. I had not received it and so now I don\u2019t have insurance coverage. Now it is my debit card and I had one that was supposed to be here a month ago and it is still not here. So I called my bank so they can send me another one after confirming my address, and I am giving them until tomorrow before I go to extreme measures. I have went up to the post office and filed claim cards and talked to the delivery supervisor myself because the delivery people won\u2019t put my mail on the box.

He was apparently working alone. There was a line when I arrived so I had the opportunity to observe him interact with several customers. He patiently answered questions, in one case a gentleman went on and on about junk mail & coupons & forwarding address \u2014 not a hint of frustration from Rico. Another lady left a package on the counter to be mailed. Rico had the presence to ask her to show him the label, which was actually a UPS label, and he gave her directions to the nearest drop-off point. She was visibly relieved by his averting her error. He JOGGED multiple times back & forth to help customers at various stations to attend to them. The electronic payment system was down temporarily \u2014 he was not flustered, and gave full dollar change, rounding up in favor of the customer. An older gentleman asked if he needed to wait in line (several people deep at that point) to ask for forms. Again gracious & adroit, Rico provided the forms to him in the same few second time period it would have taken to explain that he needed to stand in line.  Smiling, pleasant throughout, Rico was giving a clinic on customer service! Rico was so impressive I went back to wait in line again to buy stamps, not because I needed them, but in order to ask his name & compliment him for his excellent service.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObKglf_FhhTn1cCclV04NSPjSnYv7cZ42brkTP=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88890d02d6332eaf:0xf77672fffd995050"}

I even showed her I have no pictures and she still was extremely rude. And another lady who might have been the Post Master, (who didn't witness what this worker did to me) said I didn't need to talk like that but I said of course I'm going to have a defensive tone when I was accused of something I didn't do and am treated like that. All I said was \"are you kidding me??\" And looked around behind me at the lady there in line who could obviously see what I was doing on my phone and we both just rolled out eyes incredously at them. The lady then moved up to turn my package so she could see my address (she was not the one who was servicing me). So then I did take their pictures since they were so adamant about it (and I was feeling petty at that point lol) and legit was weirded out by her looking at my address. I asked her to turn her name badge over so I could have her name and she wouldn't turn it over. I also mail packages frequently almost always prepaid label print already on the package so literally all they have to do is take the packages. and put them in the back to be sorted and shipped. I've literally done all the work. But they still are so rude and act like it's such an inconvenience to bother them to do their job and take the box of packages. My husband has said the same thing when he's gone for me. Thank goodness other post offices don't act like this but unfortunately this is the closest one to home, not worth it after today anymore though.
