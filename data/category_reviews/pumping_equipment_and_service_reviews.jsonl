My family and I used this company for years. The last time someone came out, they put freon in my unit and said I needed a new unit because the leak was coming from within.  I called another guy who looked at the unit and said you have a leak in a hose outside.  He could tell because leaves and dirt had settled in the spot where the hole was. He fixed in about 10 minutes and havent had a problem since.  The time before that, someone came out, and didnt bother to look at anything, and said they could get me a new unit and they would have it built on a concrete block to make it nice.

The next day they called and said the compressor is under warranty but the labor was $750.00.  I had another company come and give me a second opinion and without even touching the unit immediately saw the problem which was a $10.00 part and had it fixed in about 30 minutes!!!!!

They pumped down the tank immediately so that we could shower, and within a week they had come out and completely cleaned out the root system (chainsaw work INSIDE my tanks).  They did an amazing amount of work for a great price.  Yesterday, the old system started acting up again.  They came out first thing this morning so we could shower for work.
