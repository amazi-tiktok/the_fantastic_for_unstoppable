My husband and I waited in the office and walked around looking for someone. Of the several people that were in the office, no one acknowledged us. They just kept their eyes on their computer screens. We finally found another person on a tour and inquired about looking at houses. She gave us a quick reply that they were all locked and we couldn't look with out someone. There was no effort made to point us toward someone. I understand the houses being locked; however, if policy requires that someone open each house for perspective buyers, there should be sales people visible and available to speak with them. I've been to several Clayton Homes sales lots and have been given keys to open the homes and look at them at my own pace. They gave me a card and made sure I understood that they were there to answer any questions we had.  I personally do not like to have someone with me every step. I prefer to take my time and look at each home and weigh out the pros and cons and then speak with someone and ask questions.

Good morning, have you been here before? We said no,and was going to say \" we just want to look around\"  and she immediately charged us through to an office, told us to fill out a form so we could see houses. We stated we had seen the houses on line and there was one in particular we wanted see, we were so excited to know there was one locally as we were possibly moving to VA in the near future Then she said, \"well if your not going to buy from Us then Im not showing you any homes, as we have to be here for our customers that are going to buy for us, we have had 7 customers this morning and dont have time for you if your not buying. My jaw hit the floor. My husband ripped up the form and said lets go. I thought for a minute she was joking, but the look on her face was that of disgust for us asking to view the home. He walked out, I asked her seriously you not going to show us 2 homes? She said no and walked out. All this happened within the first minute of the conversation.\nDisgusted and appalled at her lack of customer service skills and thoughtlessness  for people wanting ideas for their home, I can honestly say she should be fired. I have never been spoken to like that before. My husband, being in the AF for 21 years was looking for a place we could settle down in, but it won't be from your company. We then wandered around the lot, going over in our heads \"did we do something wrong\" and found Jennifer moving furnture we asked if we could poke our heads in the door and she was very kind enough to let us. We then saw another sales person, Mary Jane and she was unlocking the house we were so excited to see. I asked her if she minded us looking inside and she was most pleasant and said of course, not \"are you buying from us, not, sign this first\", just great customer service. Thank you for teaching that sales person some respect of others.\nWe then went over to the green house as Terra had just gone in, and I tried the door handle, and it was locked! She came to the door and held it so close to her that I couldnt see inside if I wanted too. She said if you go back to the office and sign the form I will let you see the houses, I asked \"did you seriously lock the door so I couldnt poke my head in the door\" she replied \"yes\". Again, floored by her attitude and I laughed out loud because it was just so childish. I hope her customers knew they were locked in with her!  She then said I have nothing more to say, and shut the door in my face!\nApparently at some point In the office I used the word \"darn or dam\" as I was so disgusted by our treatment, and she said you can go now, I won't have someone cussing at me. I'm from England and this isn't particularly a cuss word.\nTo summarise for those of you thinking of buying from Clayton Homes in Athens dont bother. You may get lucky enough to speak with Mary Jane or you may get Terra. Good luck. Yes, I have a call in to the boss Roddy and yes I will be notifying the better business bureau. We are no headed to Mundy homes to find our forever home...\nTracey.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88628c8294abcf89:0x515d7db201f97467"}

Let me take a minute, just sit right there. I'll tell you how this business made my mom pull out her hair. (figuratively)\n\nLet's start with Wayne (who is apparently fired and so is his manager) who signed a deal with my mom assuring her they could purchase her property of choice and put the property and trailer together. My mother was approved for an FHA loan and we found the PERFECT property. They told us they got the property owner to lower the price to 20K but really and secretly Wayne had it to 15,500.... not sure if his shady ways was what got him fired but I would say it's a good bet..... anyway... Wayne \"forgot\" to send the money for escrow to the property owner. They were supposed to close on the property on a Thursday in the beginning of April of 2021. The DAY BEFORE CLOSING ON THE PROPERTY we find out that Wayne didn't fill out any information for the corporate office to take care of closing info and he just \"forgot\" all about the closing at all. So then the seller of the property raised his fee (understandably) back to original cost and made big demands for the runaround.\n\nThen we find out that Wayne is fired later and that his manager is too. Now we are told that they are going to put my mom with another guy named Austin (not the manager Austin) who allegedly is the FHA guy on the site. Well my mom already had a lender and was approved. This company INSISTS they will not buy the property unless she uses THEIR lender. And not to worry they do FHA. HA! Here's the rub this place is running the show like a used cars salesman and trying to wrangle deals that can't work for my mom. Her FHA was for 3.5% down...now they want 10% even though she is in the right score for the 3.5%. They tried to say she doesn't qualify or for the right amount her lender said she did. But my mom and brother were doing it together. In the meantime, they are REFUSING to buy this property they originally assured her they could buy with HER LENDER....suddenly that is no longer something they can do.\n\nThey want to force my mom off the FHA loan because they don't make as much and they can't add \"points\" to make money off of. I am not fooled. I worked in the housing industry. Most people buying modular and mobile are lower incomes and this company is using used car, predatory lending practices and it's gross. My mom had been looking for a house since FEBRUARY. It was going to be her very first home ever buying. She was so excited and this entire process has soured everything and she still doesn't have her home or her property and now has to just keep looking for a home because we refuse to let her do business with this shady company who was just looking to prey on my mom's limited knowledge on mortgages to their advantage. Do not go here. If you are lower income, this isn't the place for you. They have zero integrity and no transparency.
