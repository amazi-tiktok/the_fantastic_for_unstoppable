That has its ups and downs.  Ups sit where you like, not where you are lead.  Down:  The server for that section may not know you are there.  After looking over the menu twice and discussing the options provided, roughly 10 mins; we got approached by the waitstaff for drinks.  The place was not very busy, but there were other folks there.  Got our order in. Eggplant Parm, the Italian, and order of cheese breadsticks.  It took a while for the chow to hit the table.  The Eggplant Parm was a big portion  looked really tasty.  The Italian  was wee for a 8-9 dollar sandwich, i would say less than 6 inches of it total.  The meat cuts were great though.  Cheese bread.... can't tell you just yet, as it has not arrived.  My side salad was fair.  The Greek dressing was really good.  However the onions were old as they had become translucent and the red had seeped into the meat of the veggie. My friend had to get up to get his tea refilled.  The waitress did not even acknowledge that she had not returned with his drink.  I scarfed up my sandwich after removing the onions.  Good, but not valued correctly in my opinion at the cost point.  When i had cleaned up my area, just a thing i do having been a server, my cheese breads arrived.  They came with an apology about a mix up in the kitchen. Things happen.  They were the best thing out of all that was ordered.\n\nWhat this place needs to do to stay alive in a market flooded with food options :\n*know that this place is new and are working on finding their rhythm\n\n1.  Bring on better wait staff, and add another the floor\n2.  Re-evaluate their price points on certain items.  There Special was a great deal!\n3.

No problem. But after about 40 minutes I started getting a little antsy. I walked over to the VERY friendly young woman whom I had placed my order with. She advised it'd just be a few more minutes.\n\nShe was right, my food (I ordered the Pasta Linguine w/shrimp and scallops, and a Chicken Ceaser salad), was ready in those few minutes she mentioned. My order was totally screwed--the blame could be placed on me for not checking my food before I left, but that's not my job to know their job.\n\nMy chicken Ceaser salad didn't have any chicken. They had placed the chicken that was supposed to be on the salad on the linguine. And they also placed some vegetable soup with my order. I don't even like vegetable soup. The pasta was totally dry as well, it was supposed to have a tomato, creamy sauce but maybe mine disappeared, because it certainly wasn't anywhere to be found.\n\nI ended up at least trying to eat some of the pasta but it prematurely & intentionally went into the trash. The salad was fresh though.\n\nWith so many restaurant offerings it often hard to give a spot another shot, nothing different in this case.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2a4d65451269:0x9fba3973b50c979f"}

The Benedetto's Italian version on shrimp and grits was shrimp and polenta and looked fairly good. My Chicken Marsala had 4 tiny strips of chicken breast in it, the \"shrimp and grits\" was cold. My wife asked for it to be heated or a hot plate made. 40 minutes later I had finished my bland meal, my wife had still yet to receive and food.

They just opened for business 10 days ago, and are located in Orange Beach above Wolf Bay Lodge Restaurant directly on the water at Zekes Landing. There is an elevator to assist those with difficulty climbing. The decor was appropriately Italian, with lots of charm. The menu was pricey and surprisingly had no veal or eggplant parmagini, nor lasagna. Our waiter, TJ, was pleasant and trying to make the best of a bad situation.  The bread was a sliced Italian loaf, but it was not warm, and they had run out of garlic butter. They did not offer olive oil and pesto as most Italian restaurants do, but TJ did his best by creating an olive oil and fresh ground pepper plate for the bread. Meals were alacarte, and did not include a salad. Nor could you add a side salad for a nominal extra charge. You could buy a tossed salad large enough to share for $12. The appetizers were about $12 each and none were ordered. Each of the eight of us ordered something different for maximum sampling of the food. The tuna special at $26 was overcooked and not fresh. It was sent back. The chicken marsala was overcooked and dry. The pasta did not taste fresh.There was not one of the eight dishes judged outstanding. Prices varied from various flatbread items at $12 to an 8 ounce filet for $32. Each item is pictured in the Facebook FORT MORGAN SUPPER CLUB page with comments from those attending. The desserts averaged $8 and none were ordered. In summary Benedettos has birth pains and was disappointing to all. Service was slow on an almost dead night with only 3 tables of customers in the house. I can only imagine the chaos this weekend when the 100 days of Summer kicks off with huge hungry crowds EVERYWHERE.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a07a7fdc6ad03:0xed7d8f87394eab06"}

But as previous reviewers have said my party was only ones to start and 2 other parties came in during lunch. Only 1 server in place and 1 cook. Food was good but cheese bread even having great taste crust on bottom not brown still taste little raw. Then pizza came out and looked beautiful edges kinda blackened as most pizza ovens do with new rage of oven fired!! But seems to be cooked with outside and bottom middle layer with meat cheese then sauced on top afterwards with grated cheese. So inside is barely warm top sauce not warm at all and crust cooked well done. Again the taste is great very fresh ingredients just not piping hot as you would expect directly out of oven!\n\nLunch was no crowd but had to ask for refills and flag down only server in the place as she waited on just us and before leaving 2 other tables while trying to sit and do something on her laptop the entire visit. Not very attentive to say the least.\n\nSo in review great space to eat, great tasting food just needs to be warmer temperature wise and staff needs to be increased or have more attentive. Would try here again but this place needs a little work to perfect it.

We were seated at a super small table and we ordered bruschetta as an appetizer, my wife ordered the house meatballs, and I ordered their chicken alfredo spaghetti. When the \"Bruschetta\" arrived, our table was now \"full\" with the plate containing the \"toast\" with tomatoes masquerading as\"bruschetta\", and our two dining plates.  Normally, bruschetta is served on some type of grilled French, or \"specialty\" bread. Nope, ours was served on 3 pieces of \"toast\", cut diagonally, and fresh out of the bread wrapper.  Only the first piece was edible because the reason you don't use fresh bread is because it becomes soggy very quickly which is exactly what happened with the following 5 pieces of \"toast\". Oh, they tried to help it out by charing the bread pretty good, but it didn't keep the center of each slice from literally folding over and dumping the bruschetta all over the plate, table AND my clothes as I tried to eat it. The overly toasted crusts were best used to dip my wife's meatball sauce while she wasn't looking.\n\nSoon, my chicken alfredo spaghetti arrived, and it looked nice, creamy, no place to put it however on our uselessly small table so I had to give up my dining plate and just eat my remaining bruschetta straight off of the serving platter...  AND...  WAIT A MINUTE... that's not spaghetti, it's penne pasta. We summoned our waiter, and he apologized but said that he was pretty sure that the chicken alfredo was always served over penne pasta. After requesting the menu again, I pointed out the word \"spaghetti\" in the description of their \"Chicken Alfredo Spaghetti\" and he quickly disappeared. Soon, a woman, whom did not introduce herself, appears at our table and says \"So, you're not a penne kind of guy huh?\". I replied, \"No, I'm not.\"  She then tells me that they are \"out of spaghetti\" and that she'll \"get them to make me anything else on the menu\". What she's really telling me is WoW, you do know the difference between spaghetti and penne pasta, AND noticed that we just substituted what you ordered with whatever we had...\n\nMy wife was about half through with her house meatballs by this time so I told that I was fine and didn't wish to order anything else. And she hopped right up and disappeared as quickly as my appetite had, never to be seen again.  I left slightly ahead of my wife and when our server told me \"Hope to see you again soon...\", I just replied, \"You won't\" as I made my way to the street.\n\nI really don't understand how anyone can find this sort of treatment \"acceptable\". I don't, and they've lost me, my recommendation to my friends and family, coworkers, business customers and clients as a place to get a good meal and have a nice time.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPknd14kfbI_V-pGEeKBWEiBeRUH6MvosxcKf9C=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3i1JY8rXB3PBUrxT7XTT7rsJS_D-aFIyanub9=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMw5HMPJzRLH7SHNL6gSfvklrHFWSIUUMGwMd4z=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891bb5a07760dd:0x9e5262ceb80f18a3"}

However, the path to get this tasty food isn\u2019t always easy or pleasant and could use some improvement.\n\nI have been to this location of Uncle Maddio's at least 5 or 6 times since they opened almost a year ago. \u00a0I have ordered in person at the restaurant (this takes forever), online (they lost my order somehow and when I got the restaurant they had to figure out what I had ordered and re-make it) and then one time I attempted to place an order over the phone (but they didn't answer the call).\n\nTonight I arrived at Uncle Maddio's at 8:00 pm to pick up some food on my way home from work. \u00a0 There was one person in front of me in line ordering a pizza. \u00a0She was attempting to order a wheat crust medium pizza with a pesto base, chicken, pineapple, spinach, and peppers. \u00a0 The lady behind the counter seemed to be struggling the entire time.\n\nFirst she was having trouble with the wheat dough and asked a manager to come help with the dough.  The manager helped with the wheat dough but then left and went back to sanding behind the counter with his clipboard just looking around.\n\nAt this point there are now about 5 or 6 people in line behind me.    The girl behind the counter then the advised the first customer that they didn\u2019t have the pineapples.  After yelling at someone to get more pineapples, the girl behind the counter left and went down to the walk-in cooler to fetch the pineapples.\n\nAfter waiting about 10 or 12 minutes, it was finally my turn to order.  I ordered a \u201ccreate your own\u201d small (the $7.99 variety).  This created another problem because they didn\u2019t have the traditional dough for this and yet again the girl behind the counter had to make a tip to the walk in cooler.  At this point the girl behind the counter seem to be really flustered, but this always seems to be the choke point at this restaurant.\n\nYou would think that as a restaurant you would want to make the first interaction with your customers as easy, fast and pleasant as possible.  This does not seem to be the case at Uncle Maddio\u2019s \u2013 the ordering line is always the very disorganized and slow and usually results in me being VERY frustrated by the delay.  Next I go down to the cashier, who asks me to repeat my order.  This is usually pretty easy for me since I only order a single pizza with three toppings.  However, if you ordered several items or a couple pizzas you might want to bring a notepad and pencil with you when ordering.  I have never quite understood why the people at Uncle Maddio\u2019s can\u2019t write down what you order and just pass that info down to the cashier?  That seems reasonable right?\n\nSo tonight after paying, I go to sit a table while I wait on my pizza to bake in the oven.  This place is dirty.  The tables haven\u2019t been cleaned, trash is overflowing and I just had that grimy nasty feeling like this place is not kept clean.  Again this is not my first time at this location and this level of cleanliness, or lack there of, seems to the norm.\n\nThis place certainly can improve the ordering process, cleanliness, and overall customer experience but that just doesn\u2019t seem to be a big concern for the management team that runs this place.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889bb26c7a0d0a55:0x6e60e6d986ace7d5"}

Very casual, laid back place with a handful of patio tables. I ordered the Greek salad (which came with feta and shredded cheddar cheese?) which was decently sized for a small salad, with a giant scoop of olive salad on top. Good if you love olives!\n\nFor my main I had the pasta primavera which was a huge portion for a small (they also have a large option), and had plenty of fresh slices of zucchini. There was too much olive oil, but it had a nice flavor and will make a nice lunch tomorrow!\n\nPizzas and calzones look solid but the pastas and salads looked the best from what I observed.\n\nService was just ok but pretty efficient. The bar selections are limited to a few beers and wines, but definitely enough to wash down a hearty, carby meal. Will definitely be back for a quick bite.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMduNSwnm3OzuHqWNAvF_McTXeUckLwd41UuXXe=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRgFr2V4qThG5CaOhVoDPBYB1slTjiaOgUzNaC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFV6bJl7ZpYSgbBiTooeWBHPVHk3xS96sOiG08=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fd7562089b5:0x177315578d833c37"}

We heard good things about this place and were in town visiting so decided to try it. We sat down and ordered almost right away, and over an hour into waiting still had not received the side salads. After finally getting the salad, not even two minutes later we got ONE of the two entrees. The pasta dish was cold and lacked anything exciting. The breadstick it came with was stale and could break teeth. 35 minutes later the second entree arrived(a sandwich) that was supposed to be salami and but had bologna on it. Before the sandwich arrived we had asked for boxes and a check. We also ordered half of the items, and was charged for a whole. We had to take our food to go, after over 1.5 hours of waiting, and then did not eat it because of the quality. Save your money, squid inks just around the corner is way better.

Didn't ask for our name or number to call when it was ready.\n\nWe stood around for another 10 minutes waiting for her to come back so we could tell her to get our number to call us when it was ready. She told us it would be about 30 minutes and they would call.\n\nAlmost an hour later, we received no phone call and I had to call them to ask if it was ready, which they said it was.\n\nI walked back over from our hotel, paid for our pizza, only to find out when I opened the box (because they clearly didn't check it) that she had put the wrong order in for our pizza.\n\nAt that point we told them we just wanted a refund.\n\nWE RECEIVED NO APOLOGIES FROM YOUR INCOMPETENT AND UNTRAINED STAFF, JUST AN ATTITUDE.\n\nI don't care how good the pizza is, your service was awful.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fd7562089b5:0x177315578d833c37"}

Not one person looked Italian anyway.\n\nService was another story our table wasn't very clean but the waitress cleaned it better and apologized for it not being cleaner. They were busy at the time. My guess is there is no other \"real Italian \" place here. I do wish we went to carabbas where we went a few days prior.
