Unfortunately I believe you left this review for the wrong company.  None of our vehicles have, or have ever had our company logo or name on them.  There is another company here in town that was previously Gulf Equipment.  They recently changed their name in 2018 to Gulf Services, confusing, I know.   Thank you for doing your due diligence before leaving this negative review."}, "gmap_id": "0x889a4b52136d1609:0x93a3f31558f17041"}
