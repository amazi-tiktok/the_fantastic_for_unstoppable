As an engineer and a business owner I understood that, but thats often part of the process. Then he mentioned he would reuse the existing rotted ledger board on the house. I kept my mouth shut but I was definitely on guard after he said that. Next I wanted him to quote a wooden privacy fence around a pool. We came to an area that required a metal section of fence across my driveway.  He told me it wasn't an option to use anchor bolts on concrete for the posts.  As someone he has a fair amount of experience about anchoring I flat out told him it was if he did it correctly.  Once again he got very irate. Then he told me it would take $7000 to cover the 60' section of driveway.  I pointed out that the metal section across the driveway is the same width as the 20' wide pool I wanted to fence off - it does not require anywhere near 60' of fence to go across a 2-car wide driveway. He got mad again when I told him this - but, I mean it's just so obvious.  He stormed off, saying he and I weren't going to get along and I could find someone else. A frustrating waste of time and certainly did not inspire confidence in me that this contractor was competent. He may in fact be competent, but with people skills like that you might never know for sure.

Though my wife and I wanted to allow our two boxers access to our entire yard we really did not want to put up a traditional fence which would reduce the openness of our property. The Invisible Fence provided us the solution we needed. Our dogs now have access to the front and back yard and don't have to be let outside on a leash. We decided to have our fence separate the front yard from the back as there are times when we don't want our dogs in the front yard. This has worked out great and I'm glad we chose this option. Additionally, we had the fence section off a portion of our yard for a vegetable/flower garden. We did not do this at first but we just couldn't keep the dogs out so after a year or two we had Invisible Fence come back out and run a fence around our garden...problem solved.\nAs far as the quality of the product, in the 10 years we've had the fence the only issue we had to call about was my fault. I ran a plow to close to the fence and severed it. Fortunately it was a quick repair as the technician has the equipment to find the severed line quickly.\nOne final point, my impression of Invisible Fence of Huntsville's owner, Troy, is that he has a genuine passion and understanding of dogs which allowed my wife and I to comfortably follow his suggestions. After over 10 years of using the Invisible Fence of Huntsville myself, nor my wife, have any reservations recommending this business to family and friends.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1594869907044, "text": "Hi Clinton,\n\nThank you for taking the time to review our services.\n\nWe appreciate your business and the opportunity to serve you!\n\n-Troy"}, "gmap_id": "0x8862405eaaf921d1:0x6ddc6dd2237f0e25"}

When we first moved into our house, we were concerned with how to contain our curious, fence jumping hound, Hannibal. Our yard isn't really set up well for a physical fence, plus the escape artist has a 6 foot vertical jump so it just wasn't practical. We found Invisible Fence at a home and garden show and later called to have them come out and give a quote. A week later we had our invisible fence installed and began training the hound! Troy (and Jack Fate) is great at working with excitable dogs and spent a good amount of time working with Hannibal on the first visit. It went so well we only needed the one training session and Hannibal knew where the boundaries were and not to run. When we acquired two more dogs, we had them added to the fence and again training went great. Our neurotic Jack Russell puppy had it figured out in two days which is the fastest she's learned anything, and our Shitzhu had it down pat in 10 minutes. Both are chronic runners if they get the chance so it's a relief to know they will stay in the yard now.\n\nAny time I need batteries, I can call the office or contact Troy and he'll either drop them off if he's in the area or I pick them up just a few miles from my house, usually the same day. That's a huge convenience for me, and a life saver when batteries suddenly die!

Troy worked with our animals and did everything in his power to ensure the safety of our animals. He also worked very hard to ease our minds from the beginning by listening to what our problems were with the animals and recommended different solutions to fix the problems.  I have two dogs, a 7 year old lab and 1 year old lab.  My 7 year old is very timid with invisible fence systems because we had one in the past and it scared her to death. We trained her incorrectly.  Troy listened to her story and was very compassionate with her and very gently worked with her to her comfort and eased her into the training.  She went from a timid dog that wouldn't come off the porch with a correction collar on to a happy safe dog who uses her whole yard.  My 1year old lab, well.. HE's a lab!! He is stubborn, and when the wind hit him just right would be down the street with other dogs and he was being the neighborhood menace.  So, Troy worked with him.  He obviously needed more correction than my 7year old Lab so Troy made that possible.\nHis guaranteed program where the fence works is true! It works because he doesn't leave you ALONE to train your animals. He gives you the tools and comes back and checks to make sure everything is ok.  That is service people!!

I wanted to wait a full week because I had my doubts that it would work with my two two year old Doberman Pinschers.  Troy said it would, as well as work for our older untrained and UNTRAINABLE Shih Tsu!  I had my doubts, especially as one of the Dobies doesn't like bicycles after having been run over by a bicyclist.   We had paid Lowes to install a fence in part of our yard only to discover it was going to take almost 90 days for them to install it.  We called Troy after about 2 months and he said he could fence our entire yard in about a week, at much less than what we had paid Lowes.  Following rhe instructions Troy gave us we had all three dogs off leashes on day 2.   The dogs are happier having the run of almost our entire yard where we had originally planned to only fence 1/4 of it.  Best of all, when Troy came back for follow up training, he brought little discs that we put on either side of our kitchen island and set them so the Shih Tsu could pass through yet the Dobies are blocked.  No longer must we prepare meals while the Dobies hangout in the kitchen trying to eat our dinner before we do.  Better still, we put a disc just inside our daughter's bedroom door to keep the Dobies out so the cat isn't bothered by them and has a safe place.  Oh.....and we have a swampy section that runs across the backyard.   Troy waded through it doing the installation.  Snakes, what snakes?   The system works beautifully and the dogs and the humans are all much less stressed.   I whole heartedly recommend Troy and his Invisible Fence company.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1594811434493, "text": "Hi Miles,\n\nThank you for taking the time to review Invisible Fence of Huntsville's products and services.

Max is a one year old Border Collie.  It had become increasingly unfair to him to be confined to a small space.  Up until a month ago, Max's options were limited to being in the house or waiting for us to come home to let him out and play.\n\nWe finally decided to call Invisible Fence of Huntsville.  Troy came out and to meet Max and us and completed an initial assessment. He is so personable, professional, and most of all kind.  Max really liked him.  Troy took great with Max.  From our conversations, you knew that Troy is passionate about his work with animals.\n\nThe following week, Troy returned for the fence installation.  We marked off the area and he went to work.  From start to finish, it took four hours which included the first dog training (e.g. adjusting the sensation,  reassuring  Max.)Troy returned several days later for the last dog lesson.   By then, Max was acclimated to his new found freedom.  He understood the boundaries and how far he could push before he was \"corrected\"!  He was now free to frolic, play, and \"herd\".  There was also an immediate impact to my family.  We were regimented to take Max out a specific times... and no-one wanted to take him out at night, in the cold or the rain!  All we have to do now is open door. Max takes care of the rest!  Moreover, there were no accidents in the house to clean.\n\nWe strongly and highly recommend Troy and Invisible Fence of Huntsville.

I was informed the entire job would take 3 days.  Equipment issue occurred, and work stopped.  Day 2 (6/19)  Remainder of fence taken down, then the next problem.  It was originally agreed existing posts would be extracted and new posts installed to avoid damages to sprinkler system.  Their removal system was not working, so I agreed to let them saw existing posts to ground level.   Day 3 (6/20) Remaining posts set and cross beams are up.  Work to begin installing pickets but no pickets available.  How can you have a job scheduled, know lumber needed,  and not have purchased in advance?  The company had received half payment for job.  Day 4 (6/22)  Pickets have been purchased,  Sprinkler system has been damaged and needs repaired.  Company paid repair.  The gentleman sawing the posts to the same height of the top of fence was not as tall as the 6\u2019 fence.  This resulted in posts being sawed off at an angle, and numerous adjacent boards were marred because of the chain saw.  In addition, boards were split, some boards sawed into, and others were installed without using a level.  I had 2 gates installed and neither were up to the standards that I expected.  Day 5 (6/23) Finally the finish line.  My wife noticed a couple of small things that needed attention.  The supervisor was not very receptive to her concerns and seemed agitated she would question the workmanship.  We felt they were rushing to get to the next job.  I could not stand over each employee to see that the work was being done properly.  This falls under responsibility of the job supervisor.   I raised these issues with the rep.   On June 25th, rep came out and inspected  issues in question and agreed our issues were not to their company standards.   On a text dated July 7th, I was assured these \u201ctouch ups\u201d would be taken care of and owner had approved necessary repairs.  Almost two weeks later, the crew came out to make  repairs.  They should have known materials needed for this appointment, but once again, the needed materials were not in their possession.  I told them \u201cno problem\u201d, get the lumber and come back in a couple of days.    I texted the rep after they had gone to inform him of the problem, and  was told it would be rescheduled in a few days.  After several texts to reschedule, I finally heard back on July 31st.  I was then informed the \u201ctouch ups\u201d were NOT warranted, and no further action from the company.  So, for 24 days I was misled regarding the repairs.\nWould I recommend Helena Fence and Deck?  NO.\n1.\tYou do not know if they will be on the job early enough to finish on time because they must get supplies for the day\u2019s work.  If the stores do not have the needed materials, then your job will be on hold until store is resupplied.\n2.\tYou would need to inspect all the work as it is being done, because  lack of follow-up to repair any issues that are discovered after they have gone.\n3.\tOne of the supervisors on job is not receptive to suggestions, therefore making it difficult to communicate while the work is being performed.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888926dcf8bf1f31:0xc1ffcc421e2949be"}

I had to removed all the pavers and re-install them correctly. Currently our side gate flexes when you open and closes, they tried to repair the gate two times.

Mine was for my newly purchased home.  Specifically, I chose a vertical wooden fence made from pressure-treated pine, complete with two gates.\nI had several issues during the pre-installation, installation and follow-up periods, which I will outline below.\n\n1.  The estimated time to beginning work was underestimated by about 1 month.  I understand working in the Alabama heat can be taxing and the need for delays in work.  I also understand that some jobs take longer than expected for one reason or another, but 4 weeks (in my humble opinion) is not acceptable.  I suspect that the company takes on more jobs at any given moment than they are capable of completing in a reasonable time frame.\n\n2.  There were several details about my fence specifically that were not done to my request.  I won't bore you with the exact details, but suffice it to say that my requests were clearly written on my contract, which was signed by the owner of the company.  To South Gate's credit, they did resolve these specific issues prior to completion of the project.  However, I think this shows a lack of attention to detail and poor communication within the company.\n\n3.  I was out of town when the fence was completed and was contacted by a clerk in their office being asked to pay via phone.  I was hesitant given that I had not seen the final product, but did want to pay the company for services rendered -- so I did.  When I returned home I found that one of the gates was crooked and not what I deemed to be an acceptable level of work for the price charged.  I called and requested this be fixed.  I was told they would be happy to return to the site and fix \"any issues\" that I had.  This was 2 months ago.\n\nI have emails documenting all of the above, and more specifically the companies promises to fix their shoddy work.  I'll conclude simply by saying that I am not the only person to have issues with this company.  Specifically, I am not the only person who has found it almost impossible to have any recourse with the company after they get their money.  All-in-all a very unpleasant experience, but a learning experience for this first-time homeowner.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8888cc3c0f9820f1:0x4b8af34c23d1de13"}

So I took a chance and so far I am impressed. Yes they have some refinements that they could do but no one is perfect. They did a better job than I could and better than 4 other fence companies I used in the past. To include the one of the big 2 in this area (TV). I did invest time by marking my property line, fence line, and sprinkler heads. I checked the holes before it was filled. Even with my prep work they hit 3 sprinkler pipes that I did not know was in area but they repaired them for free. They accommodated most of my last minute changes. I am truly 100% satisfied with the work. No wood fence  company can give you a trouble free fence but can make any minor repairs easy.

Some of the pickets were missing screws in certain places. Upon realizing these issues we started to measure the distance between pickets and realized that they were inconsistent.  The gaps were so big in between some of the pickets that you could see through the fence from the sidewalk. We spoke to Austin the manager and he sent a few of his guys to look at the fence and the gate.  His guys said to me that there was nothing they could do about the gate.  They manipulated the picket on the gate and said that it was the best they could do. I spoke to Austin the evening and his responds to using inferior material/wooden pickets was that he is not responsible for the material quality and that it is not covered under warranty. Redstone Fencing; managed by Austin is a very unethical person and business.  I would not recommend this company to anyone.

This does not seem fair to the team lead.  The completed project was amateur work, less than do it you self quality if I had the time.  If the team lead wasn\u2019t paid, why were we charged full price for a bad job?", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1570224320997, "text": "Hello Mr. Wilson,\n\nThank you for the feedback. We are sorry that you feel the job was not to your standard. We understand you are not satisfied with a portion of the fence that does not run straight due to sprinkler lines.\n\nAlthough you were not present at your estimate, our primary contact, Mrs. Wilson, who was very friendly and respectful, communicated to us what she believed was expected from you, to the best of her knowledge. We understand that there may have been other things you wish you could have requested for the fence. However, because we did not meet with you at the estimate, where those requests would typically be communicated, our team began your project to the best of our knowledge on what was expected through communicating with your wife.\n\nUpon discovering multiple sprinkler lines running at different angles, our team had to either bring the fence in or build it out wider to avoid damaging the sprinkler lines. We discussed this problem with the you over the phone and you preferred to move the fence out wider. We explained that doing so would not allow the fence to run straight along the property line without intruding onto the neighbor\u2019s property. Despite this, we were told to go ahead and build out.\n\nUpon completing the project as directed, we prepared for the final walk through. Per policy, our team does a walk through with the customer to make sure they approve of and are satisfied with the project. At the time of the walk through, you communicated to us that you did not like the lateral portion of the fence because it did not run straight, as we previously discussed. You asked us if we could deconstruct that portion and rebuild it closer in after you spoke with the sprinkler company. Our team agreed to come back to make any changes after you talked to your sprinkler company. We also planned to improve a few other things on your fence, some being non-warranty matters, and other being warranty issues we are responsible for. As for moving the fence line, which takes additional material and man power, we explained that we can move the fence, but because it is not a warranty issue and would require deconstructing the newly built fence, there would be an additional cost. You told us to give you a price for moving the fence to desired location after sprinkler lines were moved.\n\nBefore we began on the non-warranty and warranty issues of the fence, excluding the lateral fence portion, we double clarified our plan with you and your wife. You said you were leaving, and we asked if you would return for the final walk through for this new fence portion. Instead, you said no, your wife, whom was also present, would handle it. We noticed she appeared confused, so we asked if you were sure that she was responsible for signing off on the final walk through, and again you said yes.\n\nAfter we made all the changes, we discussed with you, we then contacted your wife as instructed. She informed our team that you told her not to do the walk through after all. We explained that the customer has to do the walk through before our team can leave the job site. She explained that she did not know what all you wanted fixed.\n\nFortunately, we had a document stating all the things you wanted to be changed, so she called you, and you told her she could do the final walk through. We walked with her around the fence perimeter to check off and ensure she was satisfied with the final project. Once receiving her approval, she signed documentation which stated changes were made, customer was satisfied, and customer understood and accepted that the right side of the fence was built to avoid sprinkler lines. For completing the additional work of moving the fence line, additional documentation stating that \u201cthis is not a warranty issue and Redstone Fencing is not at fault.\u201d Customer then paid for the work, and our team left the job site.\n\nWe apologize if there was any disrespect or dissatisfaction. According to the contract your spouse signed for the two of you, we fulfilled our promise and you were satisfied with the job. We still hold our duty to fulfill our one year warranty, so please feel free to reach out to us with any warranty issues."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889e37fa5c41619:0x3b8f269072165a3e"}

The fence was to help provide a nice private backyard space for us and to give our dogs a nice place to run around.\n\nI started doing some research to see who might be best for tackling this job. I had previously done business with Lowe's and their fencing contractors and was quite pleased with their work. So, they were naturally in the running. About the same time I was talking to Lowe's to bid this out I found a close family friend that highly recommended Reidar and his crew at All Around Fence Company.Within a couple of weeks I had pricing from several contractors but only had my eyes set on Lowe's and All Around Fence. All Around Fence was 2x as high as Lowe's but after speaking with Reidar I thought that they would have a superior product. We agreed on a price of almost $8000 for this and within a few weeks we had a wonderful fence. That's about where the positive comments end.\n\nWithin a couple of months I had boards warping so bad I you could see straight through them. Some of the gates started warping etc. I was starting to question this wood was even pressure treated lumber. I am still not 100% sure on this today. More on that later. Anyways as soon as I started noticing problems I called Reidar and texted him multiple times. After several months I was able to get him out here to replace a few of the boards even though he showed up without my knowledge and then when I questioned whether he had been out here or not he just texted me that it was fixed. Well, some of them were but not all by any means. However, I let that go at the time because I figured I had a two year warranty and I would just wait to see if any more started turning and warping. And sure enough, we had more, lots more and the gates were still never looked at from the previous time. Fast forward to today and almost a year later I am still trying to get him to come out and fix this fence. Upon closer inspection it looks like the boards are placed too close to the ground, and in most cases they are in the ground which is causing them to wick up moisture which is no doubt causing the issues. I have had plenty of houses and plenty of fences and this is the first one we have ever had issues like this.\n\nI understand that wood does some crazy things, but I have never in my life seen wood do this unless it wasn't treated. Remember, I am still not convinced that this is. So, with all of that being said, I cannot recommend this company to anyone. The work is not holding up, he doesn't communicate well, if at all, and it would seem the warranty means nothing. If this was Lowe's I guarantee you they would have already been out here and had replaced all of this stuff, no questions asked. I should have went with them instead because I know they stand behind their product and said they could have done this for $4000 roughly. I paid Reidar and his crew almost $8000 and this thing isnt holding up well at all. All I want is for him to stand behind his product and replace what needs to be fixed so that I can move on to staining this fence even though I am not sure it will help much as I would be surprised if I wasnt replacing this thing in a few years. The funny thing is, the fence at our old house is 10 years old and looks just as good as it did the day it was put up. Lowe's did that one and I spent almost a grand staining and sealing it. I am sure that has made a huge difference in itself but the fact is it just seemed to be a better built fence overall compared to this one. I can fix these issues myself but after paying All Around Fence almost $8000 I feel like I shouldn't have to. I hope Reidar reads this and we can come to a resolution on this and then maybe I can change this review, but as of right now I haven't had any contact from him after trying to get someone out here for almost a year. Again, there is no way I can recommend them at this time. Take your money somewhere else.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888972592b440001:0x5d457fbffc3a7b7f"}

They came out and took some measurements immediately, then took the better part of a week to come back with an estimate.  In what appears to be a pattern (judging from some of the other reviews here), the estimator conveniently left off an entire side of the yard in his estimate, even after being told to write an estimate for replacing the fence \"around the entire perimeter of the backyard\".  This lead to a surprise change order halfway through the project adding nearly 40% onto the total cost.  The next snafu was actually getting this job scheduled lol--these jokers take your money up front, then promise some dude will call you in 6-8 weeks to actually schedule the job.  There is no communication from their side, unless you press them, until that point.  At the 6-8 week mark, they will call you at 6am to see if they can \"quickly schedule the job for that day\".  Obviously, you'll not answer because you'll be enjoying a yummy breakfast or sleeping while you ignore strange calls because its 6 in the morning!  (Side note: they make up the time around closing, when they leave the office 30 minutes early, so don't bother calling the main office line if its around their closing time).  When you finally get the job scheduled, the installers are ready to do an OK JOB!  After specifically requesting the fence rails be lapped over the width of the fence post and secured with 4 nails, the installers completely ignored this request, butted the rails up to each other, and shot in their 2 nails.  The installer told me he'd been doing it this way for 20 years.  That's nice dude, but you're being paid 40% more than I expected at the initial estimate of this job to put in the nails the way I want you to.  It's a fence, not a complicated engineering project.  The installers also ran the entire line without regard to board warpage or shape, meaning the pickets are distinctly not upright at the edges of the yard.  Thanks for your hard work and dedication TVF!  I won't be using you again in 3 years when this fence falls over.\n\n*****reply to owner*********\nYour response demonstrates the lack of attention to detail that I've come to expect from your company.

The quality of the fence is fine, but the work is completed by a contractor.

I would recommend competing your project and give strong consideration to the independent operators in the area: Barrios Fence, Right Choice Fence, and others. My opinion is that Tennessee Valley Fence does not provide value for their premium price.\n\nUpdate: Tennessee Valley Fence did disassemble the gate and remove the 4x6 posts and set the 6x6 posts on Friday, and the crew said they would return on Saturday to complete the work. Unfortunately, it appears that the work will not be completed until sometime after the long weekend.

I couldn\u2019t have asked for better quality and workmanship. As I commented to the Owner of the company, \u201cIt\u2019s a Privacy Fence To Be Proud Of.\u201d\nAs a result I would not hesitate to highly recommend ALL AMERICAN FENCE BUILDING to any property owner in need of such services. I would give it a 5 STAR RATING.\n\nWalter Fulton\n44 General Canby Drive\nSpanish Fort, Al 36527", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1611702125946, "text": "Mr. Fulton, thank you so much for the outstanding review!

Could not have had a better experience. And you can see for yourselves the outcome of their work.  This is a custom fence that has now completely changed the overall aesthetic of our backyard.  It's like we added a very large outdoor room onto our house.  It may not seem like it is worth the cost to do more than have your typical plain stockade fencing installed for privacy, with a custom fence like this what you will gain is worth far more than the actual cost. And by the way, your neighbors will love you because this design looks exactly the same on both sides.  A win win if you will.  Highly, Highly Recommend All Fence Co.

The most affordable by about 400-1000 dollars.\n2. Had one of the shortest waiting times.\n3. Seemed the most professional when speaking to representatives on the phone.\n\nSo we went with it. It was originally scheduled for a month out, and after a week and a half we got a phone call saying they could come get it knocked out. Then we had about a week of rain, which put a halt on things. We were always kept in the loop on their plans, so any changes we were quickly notified of. After the rain, they were here the next day. They had a team of respectful, young guys come out and got 300ft of fence put up in less than 5 hours! These guys worked together like a team of Navy SEALS. It was truly impressive to watch.\n\nRight before they got everything finished up, I went outside to take a lap and make sure everything looked alright and the owner was outside. We talked to him for about 10 minutes and he was a pleasure to conversate with. He gave us a thorough description of how to maximize the life of our fence (through staining and sealing) NOTE: his business doesn't stain and seal, he was just looking out for us.\n\nBefore leaving he let us know that we were part of the All Fences family, and that if we ever had any issues with it he would run out there and get it fixed promptly. Overall just a great experience. Seriously, I highly recommend!!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1615141761466, "text": "Parker!! Thank you so much for your kind words!

All was good as expected from initial call, to measurements and quotes,and deposit and installation date.\nNot sure how everybody else's process was handled after that point, but ours was completely unprofessional and inconsiderate.\nFirst off we set installation for 3 day period purposefully on my off days, and I'm completely aware of untimely changes in scheduling or things happening out of the ordinary  e.i. the covid 19  and the Easter storms. However, when you are running a business and you make and agreement, you have and obligation to stick to that agreement. And when you cant it's your duty, not the \"Paying Customers, to initiate communication, we for whatever reason did not get that common courtesy.  So after not hearing anything from All Fence on day 1, I called on day two. And was told installers would be out that day. Around  12:30 we knew nobody would come, so I called office and asked to be contacted by owner. When Jack the owner called, he immediately sounded irritated by my request for a call and offered excuses of why installation hasn't taken place, never once apologizing  for delay which we weren't to concerned about but the Lack of Communication which was a big red flag for us. And when I tried to explain this Jack the owner continued to try and over talk me with more excuses. After about 10 minutes of back and forth, Jack the owner offered me a refund on my deposit. Which everything in me said do it, however we where already expecting pup and really needed fence built, so I stuck with All Fence  hoping to get back on track with that reputable record we read so much about., and Jack the owner ensured me installers would be here next day. The following day get a call at 830am, saying installers would be here at 1100am. Apparently they booked another installation earlier and and we didnt see installer until about 530pm, and this was just one single guy unloading material. The remaining crew didn't arrive until about 6- or 630pm. We doubted it, but they were confident they would finish that day. Low and behold, around 9pm guy came to tell us they would not finish, but only lacked wood gate to install and would be back in the morning to finish. Before leaving they asked how everything looked, mind you this is at 900 at night and the fence is black aluminum so impossible to see. But one thing that immediately stood out was the bottom of the chain link was loose like a flap and dogs would easily escape. So I pointed it out to installers, and they said they would install tensioner in morning. Surprisingly they came out first thing the next morning, but on a work day for my wife and I. So when I got home after a long 12hr day I expected fence to be 100% finished. The  fence was up, the gate was installed,  but the bottom tensioner was still missing. I immediately text Jack the owner to call me next day because after 12hr workday didnt feel like back and forth. To my surprise Jack was already heading to my home. After looking over job he called his guys and directed them to come next morning to install tensioner.

They did also have to mod the gate location and inset it a few feet into the back yard, which actually gives the gate a better look imo.  All debris was removed.

On 5/22/20 the customer changed the type of material to be installed. New material was then ordered, but would not arrive until the following week. The job was completed on 6/5/20. After the customer stated he had some issues, we returned on 6/11/20 to address them. We called the customer to let him know that the issues had been addressed. Customer called again 8 days later on 6/19/20 stating that he was still not satisfied with the repairs. A crew was sent out at the earliest possible date, which was the following week. The owner visited the job site on three different occasions prior to 6/19/20. The first time he met with the customer's wife and with the customer via telephone, the two following trips were with the customer via telephone. We made every effort to address every issue that was expressed to us. We called after the last trip on 6/19/20 to inform the customer the job was complete. After several days of no response from the customer, he called us back stating that he would \"pay us when he felt like it\". Despite the fact that the customer's contract states payment is due upon completion, and there is a late fee after 48 hours of non payment, we were patient, accepting and waived the late fee due to issues the customer felt he had with his project. We also gave him a discount for his inconvenience, and waited another week before calling him again. We finally received payment on 8/3/20.\n\nIn short, we were not 2 weeks behind on this job, we were 1 week late and had to be pushed further due to changes made by the customer.

The OWNER! of Shelby Fence showed up and had a work order with exact drawings but didn\u2019t know anything about where he was to start or any other information (Can we say poor planning). I then called our owner he said he would be back at our office in one hour to let the fence guy know he could start unloading the material and he would show him everything as soon as he arrived. The OWNER of Shelby Fence in front of 3 women was totally disrespectful!!! Then just WALKED OUT and said he had other jobs to do and didn\u2019t have time to wait an hour for my boss to arrive. The entire job had previously been walked through already!! The OWNER of Shelby Fence then walked out the door and left. I followed him and \u201csaid where are you going? you can start unloading the material\u201d which is what I thought he went to do. He said \u201cI PASS\u201d I don\u2019t have time to wait I have other jobs.  (Try calling your customers to  schedule a time would be a great start!)  I then called their office the only nice person was the woman that answered the phone!... (Thank you to that lady, she was helpful & kind)..  The owner of Shelby fence then called my boss and told him he that he wasn\u2019t doing the job and that he had just left our office. He told my boss he could COULD CARE LESS about doing the job. I can\u2019t even imagine working for a company like that that straight out says I COULD CARE LESS!

I was assured everything would be wonderful. I returned home only to find concrete all over my yard. I asked the mexican work force why they did exactly what I askd them not to do and they just shrugged their shoulders and mumbled something and left. Never attempting to get it up or make me happy.

Horton home with a fence installed by Shelby Fence Company.  It is very poorly installed, with the majority of it sitting directly on or jammed into the ground.  The D.R. Horton contractor told me that he would have them come out and trim off the fence above the ground.  Months after that conversation, someone from the company showed up at my home out of the blue without my knowledge while I was not at home.  My gate was locked so he could not get inside the fence.  He took it upon himself to saw off 4 or 5 boards on each side of one corner of the fence--he cut the inside boards from outside the fence.  It was cut very unevenly, and so short that my dog can now get out, totally defeating the purpose of having a fenced back yard.  I contacted the company as soon as I saw it.  The receptionist told me to email them pictures before anything else.  Three weeks later, I had no response from them and I emailed them back to complain.  At that point, I was told the fence would be fixed the next day, but that the owner was going to call me to speak to me personally.  Imagine my surprise when he was rude, arrogant, and unhelpful as could be.  Wish I had read the previous poor review before getting mixed up with this joker.  I don't know how this company stays in business.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889288cb0c46479:0xd0dfd75ada74e32"}
