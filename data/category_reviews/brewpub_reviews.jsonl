Ordered the Cajun Ribeye dinner anticipating it to be the same exceptional quality it's historically been and it was pathetic. The ribeye was tough and a poor quality cut, it was drowning in the sauce, and the two sides were unusually bland tasting. I had to spoon the watery cajun sauce on the sides to give them a little more zest. Had I not skipped lunch that day in giddy anticipation of eating here, I would've left. I was blown away by the overwhelming sadness of this $34 entree, especially when some generic steakhouses serve better quality cuts for less money. What happened to this place? I used to brag to people about how awesome the food is here and would recommend it in a heartbeat; however, I hesitate to suggest it now... I really hope they get it together and bring the quality of this dish back to its former glory!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b515e53b43f:0xa1748840b10c8590"}

We then asked for the manger, paid our bill and left.\n\nWe understood that they were busy, but when the larger party ( that was seated AFTER us) at the table next to us was getting their steaks and alcoholic beverages at faster rate and simply receiving better service, we realized that were second rate patrons at this establishment.

Unfortunately, like others have said, the service sometimes can be downright neglectful.\nWe have been about six time now and two of the experiences were amazing, both in terms of food and service.  Two were mixed, one with food being great/service being slow, one with great service/overly greasy and over cooked food... the other two? Slow/forgetful/neglectful service with food that was missing the usual seasonings, condiments, or sides.\nSeriously,  I want to LOVE this place.  I did the first time I went, and, despite the wait to be seated and the huge crowd that night, food and service were outstanding.  Slower days seem to be a big miss, for some reason, and things are just off the majority of the times we have gone back since.\nI DO RECOMMEND GIVING IT A TRY, and hopefully you will have an experience like my first.  It has quickly fallen out of our list of \"usual\" spots due to inconsistencies in both food and service.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b515e53b43f:0xa1748840b10c8590"}

We received our food over a hour after ordering.

When trying to explain that our orders were cold, she basically tells us, it\u2019s OUR fault! We didn\u2019t have a reservation! The problem I have with that statement...Why not tell us that at the door when we initially came in? We would have understood that. But to tell me and our guests it was our fault because our food was cold was not what I was expecting! She went on to turn our tour on Huntsville into a nightmare!

We arrived at 8:00pm and there was a wait but most places seemed like there were wait times so we didn\u2019t mind waiting and having a quick drink at the bar. We were sat at 8:30 outside, which we were thankful about because it was so loud inside. After waiting 20 minutes for a server to come by our table, and watching others get sat and greeted immediately, I went and spoke to the hostess and let her know the situation. I went back to my table and watched inside as it seemed no one knew who was supposed to be taking care of our table. At 9:00 someone finally came by and apologized and said he\u2019d tell the manager what happened and see what he could do for the mess up. No manager ever came by and nothing was done. I was very upset as I\u2019ve worked in a restaurant before and these things happen but you take care of the guests when they do happen. We asked our server for multiple things that he just forgot we asked for. One of my friends finally had to go find some salt on some random table. I am a firm believer of 20% tips but this is one instance 15% didn\u2019t even cut it for me. As far as the food goes, it was delicious! The chef made wonderful burgers and a perfect burrito.

They had wonderful selection of 32 draft taps with craft beers from from Alabama to Germany. They even had 5 house made crafts that would delight any lover of craft beer.  The food albeit  bar food in nature, had an upscale feel. The coffee crusted strip was delicious and the fish and chips was on the money.  You will not regret visiting this hidden gem in Huntsville.

They have an extensive selction of beers on tap, but the menu lacks any description on the flavors or character of each beer. I asked for a stout, and the server recommendd an imperial stout from Denver, which was OK, but arrived as a small 10 oz pour. Then I asked for a pint of Porter, and got the Abita Boubon Street Porter from Louisiana. I'm not sure why they call it a Porter, cause it is not - it's super sweet, like syrup mixed with Bourbon. In short - disgusting. After 2 small sips, I knew I could not drink it, and asked if I could trade it in for a normal brown ale or stout, as this was the only Porter on the menu. \"No\" was the flat answer. So I fessed up \"should have ordered a flight\" I said, \"to sample the options\" - even though the fact they had flights was never mentioned. The answer was still \"No\" to any exchange. So I did something I've never done before, pocketed the tip, and left a full beer on the counter. It would hae been easy to provide courteous service so I'd be writing a good review, but these guys are jerks.

The service is HORRIBLE!\nMy husband and I tried this restaurant for the first time today. My husband got the prime rib, bacon, and potatoes. I got the chocolate gravy and biscuit, hasbrown casserole, and chicken sausage. My husband said his prime rib wasn't good but the other two were good. My food was good but the biscuit definitely could have knocked someone out with how hard it was. The food was good but we wont be back, doesn't seem like they care though because a father and son said that service is horrible every time they go.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b515e53b43f:0xa1748840b10c8590"}
