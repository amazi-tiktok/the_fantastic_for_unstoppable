Recently the student was unfamiliar with highlighting and caused the lightener to \u201cbleed\u201d causing an intense and distinctly different contrast to show up on the root and parted portion of hair. They tried to fix the problem by toning this portion. By toning the hair I no longer had highlights in this portion leaving the hair a reddish dark color on the root in contrast to the blond. They offered to provide additional highlights on another visit but I would still have to pay for the lightener. I was told $13. The next time I came within 7 days to have the lightener done to fix the toned area without highlights. It became apparent the learning leaders only add a small amount of lightener to each extra bowl needed to lighten so they can up charge $13 per bowl. I have noticed this in the past. This time I was charged for 3 bowls. The instructor said these extra bowls were not necessary, however the instructor allowed the student to use this amount. In addition to the bleeding mistake that occurred the previous time without proper supervision, I was disappointed by the poor customer service given by the instructors and poor business strategy taken by charging the customer for a mistake that was done under the lack of care by the learning leader. I have recommended this school in the past, but I will no longer do so.

We appreciate your honest feedback and you're absolutely right-we are a school! Our students are all at different levels of skill based on several factors including, but not limited to, length of time they have been in the program and the specific areas in which they excel. You may not have known this, but we have a 100% guarantee and you can always let us address any issues you might have had with your service. Students work on guests because they need the hands-on experience which is part of their curriculum. Students aren't ready for the salon until they have completed their program, hours, and have taken both their written and state board exams. They are then ready to transition to an actual salon. We also have students who are in a program here we call Phase 2. These students must pass an interview and hands-on assessment in makeup, cutting, color and texture. These \"master level\" students are available upon request and you'll be getting a more advanced, driven student that is much further along in their program. However, these services do cost a bit more. All that being said, we have to remember that we are a school, first and foremost. We love being able to offer extremely low (much lower than an actual salon) prices for our guests because our students need the hands-on experience. We can all remember the first time we tried to accomplish something...sometimes it was great, but sometimes we also had a lot to learn from the experience. But with practice and patience, we got so much better than when we started and that's exactly how it is for our students. We hate that you weren't happy with your hair, but we do appreciate the time you gave our student in letting them perfect their craft."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889220e6dada637:0x717f01db2564dcc5"}

They're not open Saturdays. 2nd time was cut bleach and toner, which was fine. Third time took almost 4 hours from the time I got there to the time they checked me out just to do root colour + toner.
