She didn't even get any pictures of the bride and father dance, none of the wedding favor's table, or food table.  All those pictures came from family who took their own pictures and sent it to the bride. The bride was very upset because of the money she spent to capture her one and only wedding day and to be told that most of the pictures were destroyed only after she kept hassling the photographer for months. Nothing was destroyed, she just realized that she was doing more eating, smoking and drinking and didn't have enough pictures.  Thank god family and friends were there to help capture the moments.

Nothing was destroyed, she just realized that she was doing more eating, smoking and drinking and didn't have enough pictures.  Thank god family and friends were there to help capture the moments.

I couldn't be happier.  She also offered our family and guests a discounted rate for family pics while we we were in town.  We plan on coming back in a few months, as we just found out we are expecting and want her to capture the start of our family.  If we can, we plan on coming back every year and doing family pics.

I was assured both dogs were under strict voice command but they weren't. We spent two hours over two days to try to get a photograph of their baby and dogs.

I bent over backwards for this session and even added a bubble bath at the end. My studio is packed with props and outfits for babies but creativity is challenging when you spend the entire session trying to get dogs to sit. She mentions a contract but she never received a contract so I'm not sure where that is coming from. I explained the timeline to her in person and that I am visiting my parents in Washington State while my mother has a tumor from her breast removed. Her images were going to be two days later than the verbal timeline but she didn't care. I would hope that people could show a little more compassion during this time but there is no pleasing this client. I have enjoyed over a decade with amazing and repeat clients who have been an absolute pleasure to work with but I felt it was important to reply with the truth.

I contacted her over two months before my baby would arrive, to see if scheduling would work for a newborn shoot. She responded with an email of her package pricing and the services provided. My wife and I felt we could work with her, so I replied letting her know the package we wanted, and if she would be able to also do the maternity shoot for my wife. I made attempts to contact her via phone for a conversation to fully understand her process, and communicate what we were looking for. Getting her on the phone was nearly impossible. The failed attempts were due to her workshop held in Canada in late April. I made additional calls, with no success, and no capability of leaving a voicemail, as hers was full. My only other option was to send another email. She replied a few days later in between her workshop with one available day in May for the maternity shoot. She did say it would be difficult to fit my wife in for the maternity, but would try. My wife and I initially agreed to the date, and Amy sent an email with an invoice. Throughout this whole interaction, no phone conversation took place. I paid for the maternity shoot in full since the date was about 3 weeks out, and placed a deposit for the newborn shoot. I did this to make sure we could get on her calendar, despite still not talking with her. After I paid her, I still was not able to make contact to coordinate the maternity shoot. I also made her aware that we live in the metro Atlanta area, and would be driving to her. Due to the lack of communication, and not being familiar with the Auburn area, her studio, caused my wife and I to cancel. Again, not being able to get her on the phone to communicate this, I texted her to about a week and a half prior to the maternity shoot to cancel. I asked if the balance I paid could be moved to a larger newborn package, and she was pleased to do so. Fast forward to June 14, I contacted her to let her know the exact date our baby would be born, understanding that we would finally have a phone conversation. Still no success on that front. She responds with one date for the newborn shoot that did not work for my wife and I. I then asked if she would be able to do the shoot on a different day, and that too did not work for my wife and I. It wasn't until I sent her an email letting her know I wanted to cancel everything was when we finally spoke on the phone. I let her know I wanted all my money back and explained the reasons why. She offered no apology, no option, only another date, that still did not work. Her only response was to take it up with PayPal, so I did. I never write reviews of this length, or do review at all, but Amy brought this on herself. She texted me 3:50 AM, then again at 5:03 AM, clearly upset about the outcome of the PayPal dispute. If she did not decide to harass me, and move on, I would have done so as well. There is always 2 sides to a story. I disclosed everything to PayPal, also citing that I was not provided any contract, offered three dates, that did not work, and minimal communication from Amy. Writing all of this took time I did not want to give do so, but having worked with multiple business owners and professionals from different industries, Amy lacks attributes of a business owner. Primarily that of being ethical. Doing research provided me insight on what Amy's true passion is, and that is holding workshops. He lack of availability is due to the abundance of workshops she is scheduled to hold. If she disclosed this material information to me from the very beginning, I would have made the decision to work with her or not. There are so many workshops planned for the remainder of this year, as well as 2020, both domestically and internationally. It's also clear that workshops are her passion, when 100% of her positive 5 star reviews are from workshop attendees.

I was more than professional and when he cancelled his maternity session I was more than happy to let him transfer that money to his newborn session. This is after sending pictures of all of my maternity gowns and giving him several dates for his maternity session. They simply didn\u2019t want to make the trip to Auburn. I was more than flexible by giving him 3 available dates for the newborn session. Baby hasn\u2019t even been born yet! His assumptions about workshops are false. My family will be on vacation on the exact date that he wanted which is why I always advise my clients that we both remain flexible because we never know when babies are going to make their appearance into the world.

When I started shooting seriously years ago. I didn't quite expect it to evolve the way it has. I was content to just be able to shoot something on a Olin Mills level.

Most of the one star reviews below have to do with making an appointment, do yourself a favor and NEVER make an online appointment with them. Always call to make an appointment and make sure you request a specific photographer so you know you have a good one. We called today and made appointment with Amber at noon and when we showed up we got started immediately. We have made online appointments in the past and they never work out well; long waits, poor service. Amber has been great with our kids and she takes fantastic photos.\n\nAlso know going in you have to take like 100 photos, and it takes an hour to an hour and 1/2. this was very frustrating for me in the beginning especially if we only wanted one photo, but as long as you know beforehand you can plan for it.\n\nAs far as the facility goes, they have a play area for children, clean restrooms, great scene changes / props / background, and it's air-conditioned. If you're thinking to yourself you will just use competition in the area, there's not much. A lot of photographers want to take outdoor pictures which can be very hot and only one scene.\n\nWe bought a rather big package today and it was about $350.. Ouch! So lastly let's talk about pricing strategy. The cheapest way to go is get a single photo for about $20, which comes with about 35 prints (one pose). Not a bad deal and your pretty much guaranteed to get a great picture because you'll have like 100 to choose from. The catch is there's 100 professional photos of your family and you're bound to like more than one. So to get the most bang for your buck, I recommend the very first package that gets you all the digital prints. I believe it's the package with 6 poses + ALL the digital ones and it's around $70. Get home and post all those photos to Facebook and you'll know you made the right choice.\n\nOnce you pay, all your pictures are printed and ready to pick up in about 20 minutes. Same day service is a huge bonus! Specialty items however do take a few days (books, calendars, canvas).\n\nFour stars because there are some real shortcomings here, however if you go in with a strategy, you will definitely end up with frame worthy pictures that will make you smile for a long time to come.\n\n--> If you found this review helpful please give it a like!", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPc6plN6DpWDIoHlmlRv2EAZITkZabf9Ybw4wVT=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhpJ6KMthBqfr9HVTCQqj-Rj4eeH-6mTgyM79d=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHs0_PV1Gctz345AFbgZIKFNhAAQ33oCG7ojGD=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOaXLfgsiBrm02DfC_qJXfzX5LkbclJ9cJ0Qma1=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2F4u_xOMh9bYF1qOoHvpO-M2EBWNpN4hhc-UL=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGwFLnczKFpUdZCSgNa4QPriOixtO0j1tet04g=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqdPW96QvP9--4nKIcub34KVsWZyESDnMAcfc2=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3zTGVHOoQ3h8OYRzGqcHUOf3KtyG0P61j3Iuv=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2c6debc5a42f:0xcab5e9c5166fba5d"}

Yes.... they know that they are overbooked but they can't tell you they are or they'll lose their job. They are overbooked because half of the appointments are made from a call center. True...Its wrong but let's be real. If you have a large group, you can't possibly expect to walk in and out in 30 minutes.It takes that long to look at the pictures. Here's another something about the employees that most of you aren't aware of. Keeping their job is based on their SALES average which has to stay higher than $110. This is something to take into consideration when you only show up to spend $15. Please don't mistake that they do appreciate your business but having session after session spending only the bare minimum means their SALES AVERAGE is well below $110 and now they may not have a job next week. THINK ABOUT IT! How often have you stepped into one and seen a new face or your favorite photographer is gone. That would be why. Them trying to force pictures and products on you is them fighting to keep their jobs....That's the only reward that they get for selling $600 in photos. NO PRIZE.....NO PAT ON THE BACK....JUST  ANOTHER  STRESSFUL WEEK OF FIGHTING TO PAY YOUR BILLS. Yes... they can play with you kids, make them laugh, and get that perfect picture but believe me when  I say that they are stressed out. So please, coming from someone who has been in their shoes, be patient and understanding. They are just a small part of cooperate America... the little guys that take ALL of the blame but has no power to change any of it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888c2c6debc5a42f:0xcab5e9c5166fba5d"}

I was really irritated because I live 45minutes away and would have to come back on a different day to pick up his pictures and that was the only reason why I chose them because part of their advertisement is same day pick up. When we walked in the studio they had about 5 other families in front of us, which irritated me even more because we were on time for my son\u2019s appointment and when I asked the two ladies at the front desk why they were so behind and how long the wait was.  One lady pretended as if she didn\u2019t hear me so I got louder so the other lady said an hour, which wasn\u2019t true they were 2 hours late taking my son\u2019s pictures and I was pissed by this time because I scheduled his appointment according to his sleep schedule and since they started so late he begin to cry because he was exhausted so we only got in a few good pictures. Their customer service was in very poor taste because even though they were not on time, they did not offer any type of discount to correct their mistake because a broken printer has nothing to do with your camera because they were still working so there was no reason they should have been 2 hours late taking my son\u2019s pictures. Another thing, the props they use with the kids need to either be washed or thrown away and new ones need to be purchased because they looked gross. On top of that when I went back to get my son\u2019s pictures they had ordered some of the wrong prints in the wrong sizes or not the correct prints at all so I still have to go somewhere else to have more pictures printed out which means I have to spend more money.

At the time, there were 9 of us, one of the couples being my brother and his wife whom we hadn't seen in quite a few years (and had no family pictures with). The photographer was very nice, however when we received our pictures, every single picture was in soft focus -- we could only order 2 pictures and were very disappointed. THIS IS WHERE THEY EARN THEIR 5 STARS. The manager and then owner worked with me and was very apologetic. They offered to accommodate us for a family shoot if we were ever in the area again. Luckily, 2 years later we were (this past July). I contacted them in January. They booked us with April, who was amazing. She drove all the way from Gulf Shores (2+ hours) for our shoot. The pictures turned out amazing. She was relaxed and fun. We could not be happier with the way this whole situation evolved and turned out.

We were a little nervous taking a gamble on an online appointment, but as soon as we met our photographer Dannie, as well as the owner, we were excited and ready to have fun.  It is obvious all the team members enjoy their work and give each family a special experience. Dannie was wonderful, he is kind and funny, and recommended several things for us to check out on our trip.  He had a great plan of locations and poses, but also let our children come up with ideas of their own, and those photos wound up being some of my favorites. I purchased the package with the flash drive, our photos were mailed within 48 hours and the drive was in our mailbox when we arrived home just as advertised. The photos came out just as I hoped, Dannie really did a great job of taking great shots that captured our family having fun, which was exactly what I wanted.

One of my favorite parts of the day was getting a box of polaroids at the end of the night - along with the film shots later. He can take any space/venue and make it look elegant - even our small backyard ceremony! You can choose a photographer who's style you like, or choose a photographer who's style constantly evolves and adapts with each individual wedding. All the weddings Nick has photographed look amazing, but I don't think you fully appreciate the talent until you see yourself captured by it.

If the person writing this review would care to submit their full name, I will investigate further to see if there is some issue I can rectify.  Due to a family medical emergency (my mother had a stroke on February 24) I have been out of my studio and have been caring for her many hours of my days.  As far as important family members being left out of event photos, I specifically ask immediate family members (mother & father of bride and groom) or any other siblings to assist me in gathering all members of the specific parties to be photographed during any wedding or other occasion that I am photographing.  I have NEVER been accused of being condescending or arrogant and  vehemently object to that characterization.

During that time, I texted him to gain an understanding of what the cost would be. He asked a few questions and then never got back with me. Since I had used him on 2 other occasions (most recently 9 months ago) and his prices were reasonable... and this session would be no more work than the previous sessions, I didn't press the issue and figured we would just discuss it later. Well..when I texted him a month before the event to confirm my date, he mentioned he noticed he had never responded to my text regarding the price.  After asking a few more questions he came back with a price of $800?!?!?!??? This is almost as much as I paid for my wedding pictures and they were ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS with tons of editing (much better than any session that we had with Joel). I have spoken with several licensed photographers since this time and NONE of them charge anywhere near this high. Going price for this type of session was $150-450 for a 1-2 hr session and digital photos (Max). Unfortunately this put me in a real bind because now it was extremely hard to find another photographer that was available for my date. Joel mentioned he would come down to $550...but this was still higher than \"average\". This high pricing also was not in line with the pricing on his website. Although he did not have Maternity specifically listed, he had Engagement Sessions for the same length of time (2 hr session and digital photos) for $400 and this was synonymous to my requested session since it would be only me and my husband for a couple of hours. Given that he put me in such a stressful bind at an already stressful time in my life, I would definitely NOT recommend him. I tried to work out the pricing with him to be more reasonable and even explained my issue of having troubles finding someone else this late...but he was unwilling to work with me...even though he knew that it was his fault because he never answered my text regarding pricing 3+ months ago.

It is impossible to heap too much praise on the artistry of her photography.  And Toni's relaxed and humorous demeanor makes the session a true delight.

I loved that she caught me in moments of quite tears while reminiscing with my daughter on her day of getting married. I loved that she went the extra mile for Jessica and Trey on their day.  From catching all the little ones dancing at the reception to the moment of first looks. I cried a lot that day but it was all happy tears and mostly at the moments that were caught in time by Olivia!
