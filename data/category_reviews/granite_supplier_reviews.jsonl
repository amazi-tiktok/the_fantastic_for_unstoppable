Janet I believe is what she said her name was. (She said she was the owner)\nShe is very rude, impossible to talk to. She had my deposit every since March 2020. We went thru the pandemic. She didn\u2019t call to make other arrangements or ask if I could mail the rest of the money or anything. After business started to open back up, I went back to take care of the rest of my bill. I paid the money in June. She said it will be after Father\u2019s Day before she could get the head stone over here in Monroeville. I have been very understanding and waited. I would ride by the cemetery daily to see if the head stone was there. With so many distractions going on now a days I have been in touch. Today October 6, 2020, I called to inquire about the head stone. I was talking normal and she was very hostile. I told her I wanted a refund because she had more than enough time to have the head stone here. She the head stone was made but didn\u2019t have a reason why it hasn\u2019t been delivered. She said it was just sitting there and didn\u2019t know why it wasn\u2019t delivered, she was rude, insensitive, unsystematic, and to top it off....\nshe hung the phone up on me. I know money is the root to all evil.... but she was not woman enough to have a decent conversation with me. Who wants to do business with someone like that. She will never get anymore of my business, even in death. I will make sure my kid or anyone else in my family go there. DON\u2019T DO BUSINESS WITH WILLIAMS GRANITE MEMORIAL EVER.

Arrived at the showroom about 5 minutes early, walked inside with my daughter for my appointment and waited approximately 15 minutes, when a gentleman walked out and asked if we had been helped yet. After telling him we had not, he took us into the warehouse where the slabs were and also where Betty (the sales person supposed to be taking over my appointment) was chatting with a couple of other employees. We could hear them just on the other side of the door when we were waiting for her to come out and greet me for my appointment. They knew we were in the showroom, yet they continued chatting. Betty finally came over where the young man walked us to, showing us the slabs. After being in the store about 20 minutes at this point, they decide to do a temperature scan on us. It was hot in the warehouse and we had masks on. We both scanned 99 temps. They acted as if we had the plague. Betty behaved one the most rude way I\u2019ve ever witnessed, in any environment but especially a sales environment where a customer is hoping to do business with the company they\u2019re patronizing! Betty treated my daughter and I, first of all as if we had the plague and stayed probably 10 feet from us. Even once, when I turned to speak to her, she stepped back about 3 steps like I was about to attack her. Then she treated us as if she was doing us a favor by walking through he warehouse with us. She was not helpful AT ALL, and allowed two other people to take her away from assisting us! I held out as long as I could. It takes a lot to make me mad and I\u2019m always kind to everyone, but she was so disrespectful and rude! I would NEVER hire her to work in my company and I hope the owner/manager reads this review and thinks twice about maintaining her as an employee! Betty has no idea how much I had planned to spend on my countertops, tile work, sinks and faucets! But she will NEVER know now!! Because I\u2019ll find someone who DOES want my business and who respects myself and my daughter. You see, I own a successful business. But Betty has no idea of that. She treated me as if I were a homeless person who walked in off of the street with no money and no plans to purchase anything. Little did she know, I\u2019ll be doing all of my business with OHM!!

When you place an order for 3 boxes of ceramic tile for the inside of your fireplace at that very same time and you get 1 box because they FORGOT to order 3 and  you have PAID for it ALL!!!!  I am wondering WTH is THEIR problem!!!!  I took back the 1 box of ceramic tile since I didn't like it,  it didn't match, got a refund, pkd up the 3 boxes of flooring and tried to give me the other 2 boxes of ceramic tile I had gotten a refund on?????  Yes, I know had for me to believe too!!  Finally got all of my flooring. Had to reorder more fireplace facing tiles, pd for it, was told it was ordered as I was in the store and would be in that Friday, it came in the next Tuesday!!!! Found out it was NOT ordered until the day AFTER I ordered it!!!!  BTW, I finally went to LOWES, and got the rest of the ceramic tile I needed for the inside of my fireplace that they had IN STOCK!!  All this going on as my contractor was doing what he could with what we had!!!  Needless to say HE was not very happy and will be writing a review also on this store.

Even if they were not going to do a single thing to help me at least have the decency to follow up with a phone call.

If the issue is still unresolved we forward your complaint to the manufacturer\u2019s representatives and ask for their recommendation.  In this case both Carpetland\u2019s management and the manufacturer agreed that the stain resistance in your specific carpet will not withstand the traffic in the area where it was installed. If you wish to consider an option presented to you, please contact Carpetland USA\u2019s retail sales manager."}, "gmap_id": "0x889292971e6afcd1:0x95f0d1a42b251a4a"}

I went in looking for carpet and Michelle waited on me. She was very sweet and attentive to the kind of carpet I was looking for. We didn't purchase that day, I wanted to talk it over with my husband. Michelle stayed in touch with me. She called me to let me know of a secret sale they were having. It was a great sale. Too great to pass up. Needless to say, I purchased the carpet I wanted at a GREAT price and it was installed before Thanksgiving like I had requested.\nThe two men who did the install did a fantastic job! They cleaned up and vacuumed all the rooms before they left. I will definitely be purchasing from Carpetland USA in Dothan for my future flooring and remodeling!", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1520642294255, "text": "Thank you so much for the great Five Star review!!"}, "gmap_id": "0x889292971e6afcd1:0x95f0d1a42b251a4a"}

They did a fantastic job with the floor and Cindy has been wonderful. We decided to have carpet land do are countertops. They called us last week and told us it was going to be installed today on the 24th. They never showed up and now they are saying that my wife is lying about the install date. Now I don't know when it will are ever get installed. I was standing next to her when they called and my wife asked me if Wednesday the 24th would be ok and I said that would be fine. I have other work going on in the house so I moved everything to the garage to get it out of the way. I have a bad back and a bad knee and it is very hard for me to get around. I guess we will have to see if they ever show up.
