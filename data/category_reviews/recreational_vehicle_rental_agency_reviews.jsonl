I was told 89 cents a lbs and that I should have a 20 or 30 lbs tank on my RV. I should have known better than to choose Bankston at this time since the manager on the phone acted like it was such a hassle to give me the total price for both tanks. (After all the trouble he went through for the total.) I was told it was 19.28 for a 20lbs tank and 28.32 for a 30lbs tank. Which sounds reasonable, so I didn't bother to check anywhere else in town. When I arrived today, I was greeted by a professionally dressed man asking if I needed any help. I responded I need to get my propane tank filled and to get my brakes checked. I then pulled around to get my tank filled and was told it would be next week before they could get to my brakes. No big deal I thought. so I go inside to pay and the total came to 53 and some change. I confronted him about the quote I was gave over the phone and he immediately got defensive and started to explain why I was being charged more. Since I was interested in doing more business with them with my brake problem, you would assume that he would do what was necessary to make things right. He might have took a small loss on the propane but would have simply made it up in the outstanding labor charges. When you quote someone a price you stick with that price to make your customer feel valued. I really felt like I was nothing but in the way and a hassle to them as soon as I pulled onto the lot. Bankston Motor homes is less than a mile from my house. However I will make the drive to Coldwater RV center in Muscle shoals for any future service or maintenance I need for my RV. Last time I was there before I made my RV purchase they were very helpful and took the time that was needed to explain to me the different types of water systems I Inquired about and what would better suit my needs.

It has several rv spots which include wifi. This quaint spot is in the country but close enough to stores that it wont take you 5 min to get to town. This rv park also has cabins for rent for very affordable prices. Cabins include wifi and satelight tv. They can include 1 or 2 beds. The 1 bed cabins include a couch and coffee table. The standard micro wave and dorm fridge are also included. There is enough space to really make it a roomy place. Each cabin also has added boot brush to help clean your boots from a hard days work. I love this place and will stay here every time we are this way. Mr Joe, the manager, is friendly and ensures everyone is safe and made welcome here. Ms Angie is one of the sweetest people ive ever had the pleasure of meeting. She will make sure your stay is pleasant and comfortable.

My husband, 3 yr old son and i stayed here a year ago and are back again now. Here for about a month each time and as of right now still have had no problems. People running the place are great, very friendly and helpful, genuinely just good people. The cabins are affordable, clean, well taken care of, there is a trailer set up with 2 washers & dryers so laundry is easy... The only drawback id say is that there's no bathtub, only a shower. Not an issue for me but makes life just a little bit more difficult with my toddler.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889ae89d791cc1ad:0xe9beaba5beb38464"}
