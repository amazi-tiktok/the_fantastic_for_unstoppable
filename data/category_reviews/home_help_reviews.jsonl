She was bed ridden for a couple of months due to the pain, and after the fracture healed remained bed ridden and on oxygen due to progressing congestive heart failure.  This lasted almost 6 months until she passed, with the last 4 months under in-home hospice care.  My mom lived with me, since she (and the rest of the family) did not want her last days to be in a nursing home.  I am a single man and with the constant care my mom required, I could not handle it on my own, I needed caregiving help.  I contracted out 60 hours every week for caregiving and I took the other 128 hours myself.\n\nI contracted with BrightStar based on recommendations from friends, and I was not disappointed.   BrightStar provided qualified care givers, and if mom and/or did not relate well with a particular care giver, BrightStar would provide a different one.  We eventually evolved to a core set of 2 regular care givers, loved by my mom and I,  covering all 60 hours per week.  I don\u2019t know if other companies would be this flexible and supportive.  If a regular caregiver could not come, BrightStar would notify me and fill the gap, so that I could always count on a caregiver at my home at the planned schedule.  Knowing that a caregiver will be there, rain or shine, is a major consideration when determining if you want to hire a known private individual or a company with lots of caregivers.  Additionally, BrightStar schedulers, nurse, business office personnel were always a pleasure to work with and very supportive of mom and I during these trying time.

Mr. Patel and I had several conversations leading up to the date of the installation about specifics of the job.  The statement that I never returned phone calls is patently false.  Mr. Patel has had several conversations with our office as well, to which his phone calls were always answered or returned (records to prove it).  Our office called to confirm the installation date on June 3rd, at which time Tina went over everything that needed to be moved again.  I spoke with Mr. Patel on Monday, June 7, TWO days prior to installation date of June 9. It was at this time I discovered Mr. Patel had been misinformed by his contractor about what needed and didn't need to be removed.  Aqua-Guard only removed Mr. Patel from the schedule when he wanted us to postpone his job.  In that conversation our office manager explained to him that if he postponed the job that we are booked out and couldn't guarantee when he could be worked back into the schedule.  He called us back on June 10 to get back on the schedule and we were unable to give him an immediate schedule date.

We, of course called Aqua-Guard and were pleased to find out that they could extend the system to include the new section.  They even let us do some of the prep work and saved us money!\nIn 2018, again a lot of rain and water was coming in near the corner of the workshop door.  We worked with Aqua-Guard to do some problem solving.  For a few weeks it was a mystery.  They never gave up. But then Mike Shofner and my husband came up with a very creative solution.  We could not be happier.\nIf any other water problem should arise, we would never consider calling anyone other than Mike and Aqua-Guard.  They get our strongest recommendation and would encourage others to give them a call!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889185828db1a29:0x9999084413a45e1d"}

The GOOD: The price was very competitive, Mike (owner) seemed very honest detailing the work to be performed, the crew completed the job quickly, and I haven\u2019t had any water intrusion issues since. THE BAD: following the completion of the job I noticed several items that looked suspect - caulking around door, window, fireplace, and at end of wall sheets was missing or poorly done, sump basin cover had a large cutout and therefore not well sealed, encapsulation in crawl space was made up of what looked like a lot of scrap peices haphazardly taped together and noticeable creases in the tape joints. I didn\u2019t call Mike to come back out because I figured they were the pros and the installation methods were acceptable and/or industry standard - i.e not items I should be concern about. Well... 2.5 yrs later, I\u2019m having issues with the tape joints separating and releasing moisture and foul odors from the soil gases escaping the encapsulation in my crawl space that are coming up into our main level. I contacted Aquaguard and was told that it\u2019s been too long since the install for them to correct the problem free of charge. the customer service representative basically stated that \u201cif the waterproofing system isn\u2019t leaking then it doesn\u2019t fall under their warranty.\u201d So much for standing behind your work. If the encapsulation membrane would have been taped correctly we would not be having this issue. Note* I have already addressed the poor caulking and sump basin lid on my own as to not be a \u201cneedy customer\u201d.\n\nInteresting bit of info... I called BDry about this as I thought they had done the waterproofing. They sent a rep out the next day, he checked the encapsulated crawl space, agreed it was not installed acceptably, and said they would be sending someone out to correct the problem before end of week. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve realized they didn\u2019t perform the work originally so I called them off.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889185828db1a29:0x9999084413a45e1d"}
