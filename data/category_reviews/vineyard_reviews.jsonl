This was the first time I bought Hidden Meadow Vineyard and I don't know if it was a bad bottle or what, but this wine was undrinkable. The smell was very strong, almost chemical-like. One person said it smells like Vicks 666, and another said it smells like \"feet with long toenails\". Either way I could not find anyone to take it. The taste was a bit metallic and extremely \"off\". I'm thinking it was a bad batch perhaps, but this was my first time trying this wine so I am unsure. I'm sorry for the negative review, but...I've had gas station wine and it was more palatable than this bottle.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1596055812808, "text": "We are so sorry bout the wine!!
