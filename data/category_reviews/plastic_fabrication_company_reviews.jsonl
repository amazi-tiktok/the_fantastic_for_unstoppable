I THINK the big hairy brut was either trying to intimidate or threaten me by saying he has to protect the office clerk/ forklift driver..HELL he's a got his big boy pants on let him come to me and say I had an attitude...now that in turn really broke out the ATTITUDE problem.

On my defense I got the drivers name and number and one of forklift drivers name which is Frank stating I gave no attitude upon arrival/check in.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88928d9fe0a19eaf:0x6a1dc8f7aeea076"}
