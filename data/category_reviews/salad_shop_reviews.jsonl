I was desparately needing\nhealing on a cellular level in my gut. I ordered the juice every 3 days and I received my order\nevery time with little to no hiccups. The owners even left for vacation and were communicating\nwith me from paradise when I had questions.\n\nNot to mention, juicing from home 4-5 times a day is so laborious and time consuming...\n\nThis is the fourth time I've done a juice fast for this long, but the first one I've done outside\nof my home. This time was different. There was hardly any hunger, no crankiness or headaches.\nI was able to sleep at night and I had amazing energy. Through this fast, I did lose 20 lbs in 20\ndays but that certainly was not the reason for doing it. The doctor wanted to put me on 20 days\nof antibiotics. So, was this expensive? It wasn't cheap but it was an investment for my health\nand much better for my body than taking so many antibiotics. I did see the doctor halfway through\nand they were very impressed with the outcome and my vitals.\n\nI even called them on the day I started back to solid foods because my  yoga teacher training graduating\nclass was celebrating at the Mexican restaurant. The Juicery made sure I had something raw and vegan and\nhealthy to take with me so I could be included in the celebration.\n\nI've been off the fast for about ten days. I crave the juice like I wouldn't have ever imagined. Since\nI came off, I've decided to be vegan and gluten free for a while and it's working wonderfully for me!\n\nI truly believe that the fresh Almond Milk from The Juicery and the Cold Pressed juice changed my\nlife! I look forward to working with them in the future to help fulfill my juicing needs! Everyone who\nworks there is so helpful. I love the owners, the vision, and the concept.

I was told it could be fixed.\n\nWhile waiting on my sandwich, I noticed the staff watching me and speaking quietly, but I ignored it. 5 minutes later I was called back and when I went to check my sandwich again, I noticed the residue from mayo. It looked as if someone had wiped the mayo off and changed the bread. Again, calmly, I went back up (once again noticing the staff snickering) and asked to speak to the manager for a refund. Said-manager whose name I couldn't get, claimed she was there the whole time they \"remade\" my sandwich and it was fresh. I told her that couldn't be the case because it was now cold, it took her less time to make it than originally and I showed her a piece of lettuce that had mayo in it.\n\nShe then rudely asked me if I still had my receipt, which I did. I was given a refund, but I don't appreciate the way I was treated. If I'm paying for a meal, I expect it to made the way I requested it. I didn't ask them to make me a sandwich befitting God.

I have ordered from Chopt several times since they first opened at the Summit, and have encouraged many friends to do the same. The food is consistently good, but there is no telling when or IF you will get your food! From hour long wait times to my latest experience of never getting food, their management needs to do some work or I don't see it lasting more than a year. This past weekend, I placed an order online on their app for my husband and I for dinner. I knew to order early because the wait time can easily be an hour or longer, and yes, this time was the same. Over and hour, but the food was suppose to be ready by 7:05. When I arrived at the store to pick up my food, there was a sign on the door stating that they had closed early at 5pm due to Memorial Day Weekend. Really? You are in the service industry. Chopt, I believe is a franchise restaurant, but this location seems to be being run like a local Mom and Pop store. And yes, my credit card was charged. I verified that days later after it moved from pending so now I have to deal with getting my money back! I would think that if they had decided to close early, they should have turned off online app ordering. I've seen that several times before with Chopt when they are obviously not able to deal with the amount of their orders because they don't have enough efficiently trained staff. I really want to love Chopt, and I was a fan, but now, it's going to take a lot to get me back as a customer.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1622739137832, "text": "Oh goodness, we hate to read this, Taylor.

After 40 minutes I asked the waitress if she forgot to drop my order to which she told me no and began to argue with me only to produce the receipts and show that she had waited almost 9 minutes to drop my order my problem was I paid when I ordered a to go order the owner showed up before my food came out and one of his regular customers that had been sitting at the bar the entire time I was waiting for my pizza told him that there was an issue with me. He comes over to find out what the issue is and I explained to him how it's been forever since I ordered a cheese pizza and a bowl of pasta for my kids that are in the hotel Room starving to which he apologized and went to ask the waitress what was going on. She whispered to him that I was being belligerent and rude even though that is entirely untrue the patron at the bar can attest to that. The owner then turned to me and explain to me how the customer is not always right as if I had been causing a problem to which I explained to him the only issue I've created was when I asked where my order was at no time was I ever belligerent and he should talk to people around to find out the truth before just blindly believing his head waitress. In the end he felt he should give me my money back I got my pizza the fed achenia turned out to be linguine the chicken was so overcooked it was in edible. The pizza was great the service was total  Krapp. The airconditioner in the front of the store is leaking water so much that they had to empty a picture and it was all over the floor entire time. There are plenty of other eateries around I would not waste my time here unless you are in absolutely no hurry at all whatsoever and there's no other customers in the restaurant.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1563411709015, "text": "Yea Noah i did talk to the customer at the bar after you left.

Didn't ask for our name or number to call when it was ready.\n\nWe stood around for another 10 minutes waiting for her to come back so we could tell her to get our number to call us when it was ready. She told us it would be about 30 minutes and they would call.\n\nAlmost an hour later, we received no phone call and I had to call them to ask if it was ready, which they said it was.\n\nI walked back over from our hotel, paid for our pizza, only to find out when I opened the box (because they clearly didn't check it) that she had put the wrong order in for our pizza.\n\nAt that point we told them we just wanted a refund.\n\nWE RECEIVED NO APOLOGIES FROM YOUR INCOMPETENT AND UNTRAINED STAFF, JUST AN ATTITUDE.\n\nI don't care how good the pizza is, your service was awful.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4fd7562089b5:0x177315578d833c37"}
