I scheduled an appointment and dropped my vehicle off at 7:00 am on my way to work and was assured that it would be completed by 4:00 pm when I came back.  It was almost 7:00 pm before they were complete, so I sat there for 3 hours waiting.  When they were complete they told me that I would need to come back and get a ball for the hitch since they didn't have an that fit the hitch in stock.  This defeated the purpose of needing a hitch before the weekend, but I borrowed a ball from a neighbor.  When I hooked the trailer up, I noticed the lights were not coming on. Something was wrong with the electrical.\n\n3 days later I called and they said to come in and pick up the ball.  When I arrived they said that they were mistaken and did not have one.  I mentioned that the electrical was faulty, but they could not look at it that day since the trailer hitch guy was not there.\n\n1 month later I called(they never called me back) and was told they had a ball that fit and I picked it up.  Once again, they said no one was there to look at my electrical issue.\n\nA few months later I called to make an appointment to have the hitch fixed.  Their phone disconnected me three times and I gave up after wasting 30 minutes on hold.\n\nWhen I go by the location and finally make an appointment, i'm told it will cost me upwards of $100 to have it repaired since it only had a 30 day warranty.  They said there was no record of me having ever mentioned the issue before.\n\nOverall, this location has awful customer service.

The first time when I moved to this area I dropped off my UHaul equipment here and a middle aged Army Veteran greeted me and helped with the process of the return. He also helped me to figure out the area and gave me some local information which was very helpful. Now when I moved from this area I picked up my UHaul from Quality Used Automotive and I would not recommend picking up from that location but I had to unfortunately and the UHaul equipment dolly and pads were not in the truck and it was incredibly dirty. So I took the truck and drove only 4 minutes back to this initial UHaul location where I had another amazing experience. The General Manager, Clay Reed JR, met me in the store and I told him what was going on. He helped me get a dolly and pads as well as offered to clean my truck for me free of charge. His kindness, professionalism, and overall customer care is the entire reason UHaul still has my business.

I had searched as best as I could online to determine if UPS had a main warehouse in the area to which I could have a package delivered.  I kept getting redirected to the local UPS stores, like this one.  I even called the UPS customer service line to find out if there was a local warehouse, and was placed on hold for 30 mins before I gave up.  I then checked for a local UPS store (again, including this location), went to the location\u2019s website, copied the address, and used it for shipping.\n\n***At no point was there any indication from the primary UPS website or this local UPS store website that any charges may be incurred for using the address for shipping***\n\nSo, as the clerk brought my box to me, they stated there would be a $5 charge.  Surprised, I asked why and was told it was because I used their location as a shipping address.  I was also informed by the clerk the location was not an \u201cactual\u201d UPS location, so there were extra fees that may be incurred. I said I understood, and asked they show me any literature that indicated there was a charge for using the location for my shipping.  They could not produce any literature, documentation, or point out anywhere on their website that this particular service would incur a fee.  However, the clerk did advise if I had simply called the store ahead of time to ask about shipping, they would\u2019ve informed me about the charge.\n\nIn this day and age, who calls for quick info unless it\u2019s a last resort? And why aren\u2019t these charges posted on UPS corporate site or on the local store\u2019s site?  Where\u2019s the transparency?\n\nI tried to give them the benefit of the doubt - I stepped out of line so they could assist other customers and I searched online on my phone for any indication of a charge for this service and found none.  So, really folks, this store - based on their logic - could hold your package ransom for whatever amount they want: $5, $15, $20?  The charge is not posted anywhere, they have your shipment, and won\u2019t release it until you pay.\n\nAfter a fun back-and-forth between me and the manager (?), she finally, out of the \u201cgoodness of her heart\u201d (she essentially spat those words out at me), allowed me to take my shipment without charging me.  She also made certain she made some serious notes near my pick-up signature for her future reference.  Finally, as I was leaving, she made one of those passive-aggressive comments to her colleague, but loud enough to be certain I heard it, something to the extent of: \u201call of this over $5?!\u201d  I responded, \u201cYes. Over $5.\u201d  There have been many times when $5 made or broke my week.\n\nI completely understand and support a business\u2019s right to charge whatever they want for whatever products or services. However, we should not be ransomed into paying some arbitrary, unpublished, hidden charge that we are surprised with at the counter before we can pick up a package. This is the digital age - there is no reason that charge can\u2019t be easily - and prominently - be listed on their website.  Or even printed on one of their many signs behind the counter, or even on a menu of costs/services that they can hand the customer.  Where is the transparency??  But there was nothing other than the word of the clerk.  In this day and age, and in a business that aligns itself with such a large delivery corporation, that lack of information is egregious, especially due to how easy of a fix it is - just update the damned website.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626f0c76816d65:0xbc02540c826f8b7c"}

I came to this location with multiple packages today and was initially relieved to see I was the only customer there when I first walked in. This was my first experience with returning some items from amazon where UPS will package and label the items for you and I was hoping for some guidance. Instead, the girl accepting my items just stood there looking annoyed as I fumbled through my phone to try and locate the barcodes she needed and trying to match them to the correct items. I apologized multiple times and explained that this was my first time returning this way, but there was zero attempt by her to even try to help make this uncomfortable process quicker or easier for either of us.\nI also had an expensive lens that I rented and was returning. I had it already packed up in the box, which closed on its own, but still needed tape to ensure it didn\u2019t come open in shipping. I mentioned this to her (I was more than willing to buy tape, if needed), but she just scanned the box in and put it to the side without a word. I mentioned again before leaving that I really needed to tape up the box before shipping and she unenthusiastically said that she would do it, but I did not leave this location with the warm and fuzzies that my package will make it safely to its destination.

It was such a bad experience that I will never use U-Haul again.  On Dec. 30, 2015 I reserved a pickup truck for rental the following day at the location at 3713 Governor's Drive in Huntsville.  I was scheduled to pick this vehicle up at 11:30am.  I showed up a few minutes early and the location was empty.  A few minutes later, Tammy, the General Manager comes in from the back and informs me that my reservation has been moved to the location across town at 4400 University Drive in Huntsville.  I needed to have the truck in a certain location to pick up some furniture by noon of that day and this was already placing me behind schedule considering that I was never notified in advance of this change.  A few minutes later I arrive at the location on University Drive to attempt my pick up.  While waiting in a line of 5 people, I start to become stressed because it is already 11:45am.  The General Manager at this location, Paulette Boehlke, informs me that it doesn't matter when I was scheduled to pick up this truck.  She states, that I will have to wait in line while she continues taking peoples orders and then going outside to fit them for their truck.  I am a bit in a panic because this is not what I expected considering that I had reserved the truck for a specific pick up time for a reason.  I finally left the location because I could not see it fit to pay U-Haul for the poor job they had done with having my reservation ready for pick up that morning.  All this especially considering they have a sign in office guaranteeing that they will have the truck you order at the right location at the right time available for you.  I cancelled my order with U-Haul and was able to reserve a truck with another moving company.  Tammy, from the first location called while I was on the way to pick up the new truck and tried to get me to come by and pick up a truck that was now there at her location on Governor's Drive.  She claimed that the reason I couldn't pick up the truck at the scheduled time and scheduled location was because the call center had double booked that time.  The pick up that was sitting outside her location when I was their earlier, she said, had been left by someone that had not left their keys with her.  Either way, the whole thing was crap.

I had to call and get someone at 1:30 to pick me up after the installation couldn't be completed in time and had to get another ride back to your establishment. During the install a bracket was removed that was not part of the written instructions. Three factory bolts were removed from that bracket and only one was reinstalled. I picked the bolts up off the floor. The manager Mr. Hall ended up giving me $50 off the price but, made sure the shop got the full install money thus rewarding themselves for a job poorly done. He accused me of raising my voice and I apologized telling him I am hard or hearing and wear hearing aids showing him one. He then stated he was done talking with me and tried to charge me for priority shipping when another clerk had removed the shipping because of late delivery. I informed him of that and he decided he'd best call his employee at home to verify. So, more time waiting... I am very unhappy with your operation. It took an hour and a half to finally settle with Mr. Hall and get out the door with him going into his office and refusing to come out after it had been finished and was waiting on me to pick it up...   Finally, at the end of the transaction I thanked him and stretched out my hand and he refused to shake it. Mr. Hall has a chip on his shoulder that needs to be challenged. I remain unhappy with your service. In the past I have rented storage space for 6 months, rented vehicles to move but that business will go elsewhere. I will be needing storage again but another company that can do the job correctly, that doesn't have an attitude that they were doing me a favor by poor quality work...that other company will get my business.

It was such a bad experience that I will never use U-Haul again.  On Dec. 30, 2015 I reserved a pickup truck for rental the following day at the location at 3713 Governor's Drive in Huntsville.  I was scheduled to pick this vehicle up at 11:30am.  I showed up a few minutes early and the location was empty.  A few minutes later, Tammy, the General Manager comes in from the back and informs me that my reservation has been moved to the location across town at 4400 University Drive in Huntsville.  I needed to have the truck in a certain location to pick up some furniture by noon of that day and this was already placing me behind schedule considering that I was never notified in advance of this change.  A few minutes later I arrive at the location on University Drive to attempt my pick up.  While waiting in a line of 5 people, I start to become stressed because it is already 11:45am.  The General Manager at this location, Paulette Boehlke, informs me that it doesn't matter when I was scheduled to pick up this truck.  She states, that I will have to wait in line while she continues taking peoples orders and then going outside to fit them for their truck.  I am a bit in a panic because this is not what I expected considering that I had reserved the truck for a specific pick up time for a reason.  I finally left the location because I could not see it fit to pay U-Haul for the poor job they had done with having my reservation ready for pick up that morning.  All this especially considering they have a sign in office guaranteeing that they will have the truck you order at the right location at the right time available for you.  I cancelled my order with U-Haul and was able to reserve a truck with another moving company.  Tammy, from the first location called while I was on the way to pick up the new truck and tried to get me to come by and pick up a truck that was now there at her location on Governor's Drive.  She claimed that the reason I couldn't pick up the truck at the scheduled time and scheduled location was because the call center had double booked that time.  The pick up that was sitting outside her location when I was their earlier, she said, had been left by someone that had not left their keys with her.  Either way, the whole thing was crap.

Today, I took my vehicle in for a tow hitch at 8am.  It was only supposed to take a few hours.  It ended up taking them until 2pm to finish it, because they kept taking the installer off the job to handle the crowd.  You should have a separation of concerns when running a business.  That installer should've been able to focus on his work instead of having constant distractions.  In that time, he managed to somehow run my battery dead.  After I finally hooked a 5x8 trailer up, I found out that the hitch was slanted towards the ground, making it impossible to use a trailer.  I ended up having to have the movers who were moving most of my stuff take everything, but the stuff they couldn't take (i.e. aerosols, propane, gas cans, etc) which caused my move to take longer and cost more.  My muffler also was rattling against the hitch which was very annoying.  I finally got to my destination and had the hitch uninstalled, and and a full refund was made.  However, the installer at my new destination found damages made to my vehicle from the initial install.  So, now I\"m going to have to take it to my dealership for repairs, which will be getting paid for by UHaul's claim agency.  If only all the time that I put into this whole ordeal could be compensated too!\n\nMy 2nd issue was that my calls to check the status were being routed to their corporate office who kept claiming they were unable to give any status on my install, and they discouraged me from directing my call to the location, claiming they probably wouldn't answer.  Corporate customer service sucks basically.  What they should've done was figure out what was going on with it instead of just leaving me out in the dark, which basically forced me to drive back down there and wait on it.\n\nAlso, don't buy boxes from these people.  In order to get the \"discounted\" rate, you have to buy them by the bundle.  I put quotes on \"discounted\", because Home Depot sells them individually for the same price...actually, cheaper.  Plus you can get an additional 5% discount if you have a Home Depot credit card.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88626b6847403349:0x2e03344eb6e6a43e"}

Promptly at 8a, Christian, Spencer, Charlie, Andrew and Phillip showed up at our house in Homewood with 2 large trucks. They were amazing. Efficiently and carefully, they started in the attic on the third floor of the house and worked their way down carrying heavy boxes, Christmas decorations and furniture. They loaded 4 king beds with no problem. Three heavy beds had to be carried down 16 steps and two had to be carried up 15 steps at the new house.  When two trucks were loaded, they headed to The Preserve and unloaded quickly putting everything exactly where it went. After lunch, they headed back to the Homewood house and packed everything else that we wanted, including a swing set that they took down and put back up at our new house. They loaded 2 large, 200 lb each, patio umbrellas and a wooden porch swing with ease.They packed all of my potted plants, including the huge and heavy ones! Everything they did was seamless and done efficiently. I did not think our sectional would fit in the garage apt staircase and they assured me it would work, which it did! Not one piece of furniture was scratched or damaged! Amazing! For hours, these 5 guys ran up and down steps loading and unloading with incredible ease. All of this with a smile on their faces and being so respectful! When they left, all of the beds were up, all of our furniture was put together and everything was in the right place! I would hire these guys again in an instant! Worth every penny and more! I seriously can\u2019t brag enough on each of these young men!

Jenkins walked through the apartment, asked about each item to be moved, and there and then formulated a plan to move each item in the right order. The entire crew then worked with purpose in clearing the apartment.\n\nAlso worth a mention is how respectful they were--not just in their bearing, attitude, and speech, but also in the way they treated our property. The move covered only a short distance, but the team did not take any shortcuts in transport, using the full range of blankets, pads, ropes, and other restraints to make sure the items did not move, scratch, or break during transport.\n\nFinally, other than an hour break for lunch (for which we were not charged), the entire group worked diligently until the entire truck was unloaded.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8889176e57b14ddd:0x1b664f72e5c57b81"}

Please refer to your copy of the move sheet and your copy of the damage report stating 2-3 business days. On the 3rd business day, we explained to you that the replacement was delayed due to business closures related to the current pandemic, and that we would continue working diligently to complete the replacement. We regretted that the accident occurred and expected the matter to be resolved the following Monday or Tuesday.\nDespite your sense of urgency, we attempted to contact you every day for 6 days to schedule delivery. On Saturday, you returned our call, and on Monday we delivered your table. As a courtesy, we delivered the table to an address unrelated to your move, an hour round trip from our office.\nYour claim that one of the men said, \u201cthat\u2019s ok, we\u2019ll milk the clock and make the best of it\u201d is absurd nonsense. The 2 matters are unrelated, and no one stands to gain anything by making your move take longer than it should. If you would like your moves to take less time, consider reserving an apartment on the main level, and reserve your storage on the main level.\nThis move and your previous move conducted by the same movers both took 5 hours. Both moves took less time than we would expect. Perhaps their performance is the cause for you to use our service again. We are truly sorry for whatever happened to cause you to post such an untruthful and deceptive review, but we wish you the best and hope you get through it."}, "gmap_id": "0x8889176e57b14ddd:0x1b664f72e5c57b81"}

This is maybe the 7th time I've used movers, first with them. The guys got there before me and we're already a third of the way through the move before I even showed up minutes after them.\n\nMy friend who was moving was very stressed and the guys set her at ease. They grabbed everything, they would ask about anything that they had questions about, recommended we put a couple of loose pieces of art in the car for extra safety, and made sure everything was nicely packed in the truck. They were legit jogging back and forth from truck to house. And even pointed out a couple things that we missed that needed to go.\n\nWhen they got to the next location they dove into the work. Again unloading fast (but safely) and putting each thing where they needed to go. Making sure that odd and important things were set aside or noted. On top of that the guys did a great job with my friends 4 kids and her mom that were at the house! The guys put them all at ease and engaged with them happily!\n\nAnd the thing that I personally liked the most due to my line of work was how good they were with the family dogs. They were aware of the little one running around and were sure they were clear when doing anything. Justin and Tyler were HANDS DOWN the best moving crew I've used. And (I probably shouldn't mention this because they're bosses will see lol) because of their hustle it ended being a little cheaper than I expected.

I have seen some sorry movers in my day.  From the first phone call, MoveDaddy was different.  Relaxed and helpful on the scheduling, actual customer care in a time period that it is dead in America.  Rain was imminent on the scheduled day and I called them several times that week stressed out about it.  They said they would gladly move in the rain if we had to but could easily reschedule if needed.  They gave me the option of Friday afternoon or Saturday morning, no worries.  Sat morning came and two polite bright eyed men showed up right on time.  They were eager to get started and worked diligently to protect our things and move quickly.  They actually ran out of the truck back into the house to get another load, actually ran.  They had to move several awkward things, including a very heavy sofa over a rail to the bottom floor, did so with precision and care.  They moved artwork and TVs, all came out perfect.  They showed great respect and patience with my wife as to where she wanted things.  It was a hot long day and they still ran out of the house back to the truck for another load as the move was winding down.  Polite the whole time.  Their names were Matt and Justin.

I called around to several moving companies prior to Movedaddy and was less than impressed with the fact that I was not guaranteed arrival within a specific timeframe, not to mention the job date was more than a month out with other companies, namely those having a cartoon logo, sons, and transfer in their names. Other companies made me (and my family) feel like a number and insecure about booking with them. Movedaddy took special care and provided a very customer-centric approach to our relocation. Not only were they punctual, they were also very polite, respectful, and communicative with respect to determining the logistics of our move. We have heavy, oversized antique heirloom furniture and had packed over 200 boxes from our previous 4-bedroom house. Tyler and Theo provided the utmost and outstanding customer service by ensuring every piece of furniture and miscellaneous item was carefully, neatly, and brilliantly packed. My wife and I were so impressed, and frankly inspired, by how fit these young guys are, as they literally ran (sprinted) back to the truck non-stop to grab another item in this hot summer weather. Tyler and Theo are absolute beasts...thanks a million guys!!! We will always recommend Movedaddy to our friends and family. The one-star reviews from the Amacher family or any others representing less than 5-star ratings are obviously hateful, unappreciative, spiteful, etc., and should be absolutely disregarded.

Wouldn't it have been easier to simply give a refund to the customer.  The owners gesture shows how racist he really is...His 2600 dollar donation shows guilt and malice toward the customer.

But I mention this because....Having to load and unload that long truck with my belongings made my move time much longer!!!!! The extra walking through the truck, etc... I paid over $1,000. I think it was $1,300. It has been so long. I definitely felt cheated. The manager/owner drove up in a red corvette lol to have me sign the paperwork before the move. I think they told me they would only compensate me 20 cents on the dollar for any damage. Awful place.\n\nEdit: maybe it wasn't a red Corvette. It was definitely a sports car!!! The year was 2012.

Channel 6 receives more complaints about this company than any other.  Good reviews are done by employees and family members.\n\nRESOLUTION has NOT been reached with this company!  FRAUDULENT business practices!  It does NOT take 14 HOURS ($1600) to move someone from a 2 bdrm apt 12 miles away. No packing involved!\n\n1.  A refund is  DEFINITELY JUSTIFIED!  It is the ONLY resolution to the primary complaint; I was OVERCHARGED!  The company's workers intentionally \"rode\" the clock and took extended breaks and lunches that I paid for.  MoveDaddy's LACK of INTEGRITY and PROFESSIONALISM is palpable.\n2. It is unacceptable to wait for compensation for the damaged furniture.  As a good faith effort, this part of the dispute should be addressed immediately and separately.\n3. The donation to the Civil Rights Institute is NO CONSEQUENCE to this claim.  The fact that the owner, Richard McBee, offered to make a donation to an African-American entity is patronizing and dismissive.  This dispute is about POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE and POOR BUSINESS PRACTICES!  The owner's donation offer is indicative of his own internal conflict with being a racist.\nThe RESOLUTION is to refund me 8.5 hours that your were overcompensated due to your employees extended breaks and lunches.  Second part of resolution is to compensate me for damaged property. REFUND me my money!\n\n## UPDATE## Active BBB Complaint.   This complaint is about MoveDaddy's POOR DELIVERY of CUSTOMER SERVICE and POOR business practices!! Richard McBee's employees were taking extended breaks, lunches and being preoccupied on their cellphones while on the clock resulting in a 14 hour move that should have taken 5 hours or less.   I am willing to compromise and compensate you for 5 hours at $118 per hour.  I am requesting a refund of the other 8.5 hours plus the cost of a damaged chair estimated at $595 for replacement.\n\nThe owner, Richard McBee, did not provide me with a resolution!  I asked for a refund or at least a compromise for the POORLY executed services I received. Instead of providing me with a comparable resolution, the owner donated money to an institution that has NOTHING to do with this business transaction.    POOR service on this date was evident!  The movers took almost 14 hours to move a two bedroom apt. into a house 30 mins away.  There was NO packing involved...just loading and unloading.  The owner's $2600 donation shows guilt and malice towards the customer.  I understand that companies have bad days.  How those missteps are handled determines the company's value.  Donating money to a non-affiliated business is NOT a resolution to my business transaction.\n\nPlease note: It is a nice gesture to donate money; however, the BHM Civil Rights Center has NOT received any donation from you or your company per company representative.\n\n***UPDATE:  I have FILED a COMPLAINT with the BBB and BCA.\n\nDo NOT hire this company!!  They charged me $1600! The move was absolutely horrendous!!. Zack (with the locks) stayed on his phone the entire time. It took them 14 hours to move me!!!   I was charged $1600 for a move from a 2 bedroom apartment to a house 30 mins away.  Zack was completely belligerent when asked to complete the job and get off his cellphone.   I had to threaten to call the POLICE in order to remove him from my property. This took 14 hours and the job still was never completed. The company had to call in another truck to help the other 2 workers. My furniture was not put together. My house was left in shambles. The manager/owner Jared was UNPROFESSIONAL and rude!  Incorrect hookup in laundry caused my washer to leak in the laundry room. This crew was quite inexperienced and rude. Second crew was called in to complete unpacking!  Second crew finished unpacking within 1.5 hours. They never completed putting items together.  They offered to come back the next day and charge me again. Overall, a HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE!!

I was shipping to packages off today, one to my mortgage company and another to At&t. When I got to the counter the representative told me that AT&T system was down but she would check to see if  it was back up and running. It was still down so she directed me to the UPS store about 1.2 miles away and I went to go get in the car to call ATT before going to UPS to see if this was a outage all over it just Fedex Kinkos. The ATT representative told me they didn\u2019t have a issue so I go back in the store to see if their system was back up. A older lady that I helped in the store before leaving stopped me and said the Caucasian guy behind me earlier had a package he was shipping back to At&t as well. The representative told him that the system was down but she would hold it for him and ship it when the system came back up. I asked the representative when I walked back in the store was the system back up, she replied no it\u2019s still down. I asked could she hold my package and ship it when it come back up, she replied they aren\u2019t allowed to do this.\n\nI replied but you just did it for the Caucasian man who was sending a package to At&t to. She looked shocked!  She replied she isn\u2019t suppose to do that but my problem is you did do it & he was behind me. You sent me to UPS but you didn\u2019t send him! Do you know how this makes me feel (small very small) because I\u2019m Black I can go to UPS but because he is white you can hold it for him and ship it later.

However, since she is no longer in the store, if they accept my perfectly good boxes, I will use this branch again.  if not, I will continue to ship through my employer.\n\nPREVIOUS POST: This used to be my favorite shipper and favorite FED EX location.  I even have my own personal Fed Ex account.  However about a year ago Fed Ex must have brought in a new female day manager or supervisor and she behaves like a shrew.  I was believe her name was Helen.  She misquotes Fed Ex's shipping policy and refuses to use \"banker's\" boxes and other good boxes that are actually more sturdy than she sells at that outlet. She says it is FedEx's policy and I have since found out - it is not FedEx policy, but may be the individual store policy.  But she says it is FedEx policy.  However, she is most loud and belligerent and actually refuses to ship unless in boxes \"like she sells\" and pulls off the shelf \"because Fed Ex will no longer accept those boxes\".  Not true.  She won't accept the boxes.  She claims my boxes are not as sturdy (not true) and it is FED EX's policy not to accept those boxes.  Not true.  I've checked Fed Ex's shipping and packing policies and my boxes are very acceptable...and they are more sturdy than the boxes she is trying to force me to buy.  I will no longer ship there but ship through my work and have the charges deducted form my payroll.  Fed Ex is happy to pick up my boxes at my work without trying to make me buy boxes from Fed Ex.  My work place ships many boxes like my boxes (that's where I get my boxes) without any problem.  Someone needs to retrain or terminate the weekday supervisor or manager at this office.  I have read of many complaints about the personnel at FedEx-Kinko locations since Kinko and Fed Ex combined their locations.  I will not go back to this location with Helen there.  When I can't use my work place for shipping (as when the boxes too heavy for me to take in), I have driven 35 miles round trip to drop off my boxes elsewhere instead of dealing with this unpleasant person...what a shrew.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891b9130ca25b5:0x5bd40fa6ae8c11d"}

We are ten folks from Birmingham who do graphic design and digital and wide-format printing and offer UPS, USPS, and DHL services as a third-party vendor.\n\nYour complaint against the United Parcel Service, Inc is an understandable one, but rating our location 1* won't accomplish any change. We aren't the logistics company based out of Atlanta, and this location isn't owned by them either. Your review is understandably but incorrectly levied at us, and that hurts our business, despite that fact that we don't operate UPS trucks, nor do we maintain UPS drop boxes.\n\nWe know the name \"The UPS Store\" makes us sound like a corporate entity, but we're not, or else we couldn't say that the name \"The UPS Store\" was a stupid choice for loosely-affiliated franchises.\n\nWe would kindly ask that you remove your rating if you are not one of our customers, or that you correct your rating to reflect our service correctly if you have commissioned work from us before. Again, that would really help our locally owned small business thrive. We can also put you in touch with people at UPS who can actually help get your complaint to the right people.

The person I was dealing with was so horrible and incompetent that after 5-6 phone calls over 3 days(and zero of 4 emails responded to, emails with all the pertinent information for items to be picked up, packed and shipped) I asked to speak to a manager, well Bradley WAS the manager.  Great.  I asked if he had a supervisor or the owner and he dismissively told me HE was in charge - this is where the attitude ramped up, before it was somewhat subtle.\n\nHe would not respond to any email asking for quotes or telling me when they would pick up the items (the pickup service they offer).  It was like he didn't want to have record of the quotes or times in email.  He would respond to direct questions in email with \"would you please just call me, how hard is that\" - as if my schedule revolved around him.\n\nAfter 3 weeks of trying to get them to pick up the auction lot, I made arrangements with another UPS store that would pick up the same day.  I called to cancel at the previous store, told Kody (who told Bradley while I was on the phone) and someone else as well and I also emailed the cancellation.  3-4 hours later they used the paperwork from the first email to pick up the items and I was informed by the other UPS store that the items were already picked up (the seller wasn't supposed to release it to them either but that isn't as much their fault)\n\nWhen they packed up the items they used a huge box, about 3x larger than what was actually necessary basically tripling the cost of everything. It was very expensive now.  I knew this wasn't right so I emailed asking for the weight and dimensions of the box he used, and I got a reply of the dimensions and a \"just call us\" response.  This was after I had called 4-5 times that day and they were always too busy to talk.  Now he wanted me to call immediately (6 hours after the my first call) and when I didn't he proceeded to call 6 times in 30 minutes while I was  on the other line (call waiting beeping 40-50 times for each call, he just let it ring harassing me - I couldn't end my call it was important and why I called 6 hours prior and used email).\n\nThis harassment continued 3 more times with about 2-3 calls each time until their closing time (total of about 13-15 calls, ringing non-stop b/c no voicemail turned on).\n\nMy calls the next two days were hung up on, I never knew who answered the phone, but 5 calls were immediately hung up on when they were switched to an employee.\n\nI called the other UPS store I had scheduled and told them what was going on and was going to have them pick up the items to ship.  I was informed of who to ask for at the other store and that they would be helpful.  I called back and got someone I hadn't worked with - Mikee.\n\nThis was a delight. From the very beginning the attitude was like night and day.  Bradley has no business working with customers or in customer service.  Mikee was helpful, promptly returning emails with complete answers and readable sentences, complete quotes, etc.  Included in the emails were the photos of how Bradley wrapped the items and it looked like a 4yr old had done it.\n\nThere were a couple fragile items, noted 3-4 times in previous emails (maybe Bradley can't read, IDK) that were to be wrapped in bubble wrap b/c they were glass.  These were the only things not in bubble wrap.  The large bulky durable plastic items were layered in bubble wrap and I told him they didn't need ANY.  So, Mikee took everything out of Bradley's packaging and re-packaged the items and did an EXCELLENT job.  I would rate that  part 5 stars,  but after 3+ weeks with Bradley, 1 star is too much.\n\nThe final shipping was less than 1/2 what Bradley quoted (and it wasn't $5 vs $10, it was MUCH higher).  The items arrived and everything looks to be in  order.\n\nI just can't understand how this business can make Bradley a manager and deal with customers. I had another problem with  them 1 year ago with bad packaging on a piece of glassware, it looked like a 4yr old wrapped it too.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1553624970087, "text": "Thank you so much for your review.

Ended up working with Hunter King and Hugh three times in one day, the day before the rental pickup date, to iron out my issues.\n\nHunter gave the info for traffic try and get it sorted out, which eventually did work. There wasn\u2019t anything he could do to add my reservation to the store because they were out of truck. By an act of God someone canceled later and I got the truck I needed at this location. Then \u201ctraffic\u201d moved it again..\n\nNeedless to say. Hunter K. was knowledgeable, patient, and extremely helpful in getting the reservation squared away again and even helped add an extra day to my reservation so I could get the truck immediately.\n\n11/10 recommend this store because of the employees Megan, Hunter K., and Hugh.\n\nI say everything here to show you how much of a hassle it can be to reserve online.

My question is: why was the dolly even there in the first place? I had not reserved it!  And if there was something in the back of the truck, he should have opened the back and shown it to me.

When the tech came out bout 10 mins later he proceeds to tell me that I can't make a reservation in the store I had to do it on-line.(just to get me out if store I think).     After calling customer care they told me this was absurd u must make appointment in store.  So long story short their a bunch of lazy people that wanna do nothing.  They also told me that it would take an hour, but the service rep on phone said 4 hours and would be $210.00 plus parts and wire.   Called CTU(CUSTOM TRUCKS UNLIMITED) RIGHT up the street and they install for $125.00 parts and all.  Never ever using these morons again.

From the only employee I\u2019ve ever seen there (Jay?) to the actual customer service online. The employee clearly wasn\u2019t trained on how to properly communicate to customers as there are a couple of issues that I would like to point out from that alone. He speaks in a manner that tells me, \u201cGet out of my face, I don\u2019t want to deal with this,\u201d or \u201cI know what I\u2019m talking about and you don\u2019t,\u201d which seems to not be the case as I\u2019m reading the everlasting one-star ratings. We walk into the store with no one at the front office and him doing whatever that he does. After the wait, he comes out, talking on the phone. I cannot even begin to explain how and why this was extremely disrespectful and even offending. We were having issues with the transaction of our package, however the way handled this was- to say the least- atrocious. He started muttering under his breath in his language, no doubt something less than appropriate in the workforce, directly to our faces. Not to mention the stench of smoke was absolutely putrid in this building. It\u2019s atrocious. I was thankful I had my mask, but it was still so strong that I couldn\u2019t wait to exit the establishment (from both his attitude and the stench). Speaking of masks, he did not have one throughout the entire time I came in. In a pandemic. Do I need to elaborate any further? In case you thought there couldn\u2019t be any more wrong with this situation, I called customer service and got hung up twice. The third time they tell me I have to make an account on their website in order to have any of my questions answered. That is by far the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever heard and if they wasn\u2019t enough, when I actually made an account, they acted as if I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think they actually allow customer service calls at all and this is their way of doing so. This is just for this location because I called customer service for every other UPS near me and they picked up right away. I am 110% sure that Jay is the reason I cannot call, as he was using the phone for his own personal enjoyment.

You forgot to mention that you walked out to your car, and that is when other customers were helped. You also forgot to mention that the owner was working by himself as his employee was at lunch. A print job that was emailed earlier in the morning was being produced and we have one color machine, so it's impossible to work on 2 print jobs at the same time. So, that order would have been completed first. That's why you were offered to leave your flash drive and come back. We do know that more than one file, 5x5, fits on one page. The owner misspoke because his mind was on the other print job. We produce hundreds of these type of print jobs (invites, note cards, business cards, etc) each year and would be happy to assist you in the future.

I said you couldn't add 2 more pieces and he said NO!!!    Can you freaking believe this???? I'm so PISS because of the at least 100 plus times in the last 10 years of doing business there.

Will never go back there again don't care if I have to drive my packages to where their going.\nWhat A JOKE!!!!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88892432944b4601:0x24e22da5ec234d00"}

They do not wear proper PPE(masks completely off, etc) when entering homes. This company lacks professionalism and decency. They do not value your time either.

That hr turned into close to 6hrs. The only explanation i could think of is they were traveling on the other side of God\u2019s back to get to my home. When they entered my place, they did not have on masks and they smelled like they took a lengthy break to get high. THEIR EYES WHERE NEARLY CLOSED SHUT FROM BEING SO HIGH. THE SMELL OF MARIJUANA FOLLOWED THEM THROUGH MY HOME.  They entered the home briefly, asked a question, then left out saying they were getting the truck ready. There I was waiting for and hr or so for them to return and they did not. I spoke with their manager over the phone and he said they wouldn\u2019t be returning with no explanation. I explained to him that the guys did not say anything other than they\u2019d be back after getting the truck ready. The manager was uncooperative and hung up in my face.

Took an hour lunch break when they are only allowed 30 minutes. When we called to ask where they were they stated they had to stop and run a few errands. They scratched up multiple pieces of furniture. Put dents in the floor and walls. But what really really was the final straw and what prompted me to post this review was the fact we are about to paint so pulled out dresser out and found a huge hole in the back!!!! Instead of being honest about it they thought they could hide it bc how often to pull out large furniture. You can't miss it either it is right by where the mirror attaches.

To the point where we were rushing to get off the property before the new owners arrived. Only one of the 3 guys worked the whole time and the others were constantly on their phone sitting in the truck. As you can imagine this made the move out considerably longer. They damaged a wall in the staircase multiple times. It looks horrible. The new home owners were upset with what they were left with. My wife and I contacted the office and informed of the damage in which they made it seem like they would take care of it. Well it\u2019s now 3 weeks later and they have just advised we need to provide them an estimate. Why was this not stated weeks ago. They have attempted to give us $180 to repair a desk, bed, and dresser, and wall. That is ridiculous. Now it\u2019s to the point where I just want the wall fixed and that not enough to pay a handy man to drive out to provide an estimate and then have to go back for the repair. I could not be more disappointed and dissatisfied. You could do better to hire literally anyone else.\n\nPs. The driver/mover was the only positive thing about the move after it started.

I have never written a negative Yelp/Google review, BUT I have also never been treated so poorly (thank you Nate) as a paying customer of a business. We booked with All My Sons for our Saturday move a few weeks in advance. My husband spoke to MULTIPLE different reps, male and females, confirming that movers would be at our house at 8:00am. On the day of our move, we got a call saying, \u201cthe crew never showed up\u201d and they were going to be late. 9:00am rolls around, and we get another call saying they won\u2019t be there until 9:45am. Frustrated that we have now lost 2 hours of moving time (moves are already high-stress to begin with without the added frustration of movers not showing), I call the office to express my concerns. Enter the ever-so-lovely \u201cNate\u201d, who I HOPE does not have a \u201cManager\u201d title to his name. If so, you should seriously reconsider. Argumentative, rude, arrogant\u2026the list goes on. Nate probably needs a refresher in Customer Service 101, \u201cthe customer is always right\u201d. Nate tells me that their moves start from \u201c8-10am\u201d, so \u201ctechnically\u201d they weren\u2019t late and \u201cno one would have told us they were going to be there by 8am\u201d. I explained that we spoke with MULTIPLE people and that was not the case\u2026.we were assured they would be there at 8am. After a few LOVELY back and forths with this Nate character, he says, \u201cAlright, I\u2019m cancelling your move and you can find someone else.\u201d\n*Click*\nHe hangs up the phone. If you are the owner of All My Sons, please know that you have someone representing your business in the POOREST way. I have already submitted a complaint to the BBB. This business needs to be INVESTIGATED and management needs to be reevaluated. My experience is NO WAY to treat a paying customer. Cancelling someone\u2019s day-of service because they receive a VALID complaint is beyond me and I hope there are repercussions for Nate treating people the way he does. Based on Google/Yelp reviews, this is not an isolated incident.  Luckily, the bright spot in the day was calling MOVEDADDY who completely rearranged their moving schedule to accommodate us and did so with the most POSITIVE attitude. And they were $50+ less expensive/hour. SO all-in-all crisis averted in doing business with All My Sons, and I\u2019m glad they did not get a PENNY of my money.

The manager could not give us an exact time for when the movers would arrive, just that they would be arriving some time that day. The person we talked to on the phone was condescending, saying that they\u2019ve been doing this \u201cfor 20 years\u201d and that \u201cthey\u2019d handle this situation\u201d while refusing to give us an estimated time of when the movers would be here. At one point, we\u2019d try to call and they wouldn\u2019t even answer the phone. I didn\u2019t have time to wait around for them to show up. I guess I\u2019m surprised and grateful they showed up at all, given the other poor reviews about this moving company. It sounds like they have serious management issues.

This time, this was a local move.  It was an easy move for the movers as well.  I had already taken most of our things, but I hired All My Sons to move a few dressers, an fridge, washer, dryer, and a couple of game tables.  We also had a large piece of furniture in storage.  But, they didn't have to move beds, clothes, dishes, etc.  The move should have taken about 2-3 hours.\n\nMy move was scheduled to start at 8am.  At 7:45am, I received a call that due to DOT requirements, the driver could not arrive until 10-10:30am.  I get it.  I work with DOT every day.  But this was poor scheduling and the last-minute notice wasn't pleasing, but I was willing to let it slide.  But the driver did not arrive until 11:45am.  I had an important appointment at 2pm that day.  I told the driver we needed to get moving.  He replied saying his boss called him at 10am wanting to know if he could work.  Now, I finally know the truth.\n\nAt first, the guys were moving well.  They loaded up the house in about 35 minutes.  I was pleased.  Then we dropped by our storage unit and the driver was more interested in looking at our pictures or checking out our motorized toys.  At this point, I knew he was dragging his feet and running up the clock.  They finished the move in about 4.5-5 hours.  We were moving to a new home that we built.  They scratched the staircase in two places pretty severely.\n\nI spoke to the supervisor and told him about my complaints.  He asked me what I was looking for.  I told him I would leave the resolution up to him, but I knew if I ran my business with this type of communication and lack of urgency, I would lose my customers.  He responded, \"Well, you were moved today and the guys have to get paid.\"  So, I paid, but I promised myself I would leave reviews everywhere I could.  I was completely disappointed.\n\nThe response below seems to be the same cut and paste response issued by All My Sons to every negative review.  I gave All My Sons the opportunity to make the transaction right over the phone.  I told them I would leave the remedy up to them and the response I got was, \"You got moved today and the guys have to be paid.\"", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1536595536947, "text": "Hi Ryan, thank you for leaving your feedback.

Apparently had a few issues that morning delaying crew getting to our house. So they finally arrived later in morning. Everything was off to ok start until I noticed a lot of cursing going on that was upsetting. I asked them to please tone it down and be professional. That just pissed them off even more to the point they were being very careless with the furniture. The manager Chris was calling crew throughout day over and over and over yelling and screaming at top of his lungs to where I could hear every word from across the room in kitchen. I asked what was that? And crew said oh he's always like that. So now crew is trying to rush and throw everything on truck on top of already not doing a great job. One of the crewmen even made the comment we are way overworked and underpaid and management is horrible. Needless to say we have a lot of damage, the movers hate management and their jobs, and we had to pay for a horrible move. I spoke with friends afterward who encountered a lot of these same issues.

Very unprofessional, unethical and plain rude!!!!!  I WISH I HAD READ PREVIOUS REVIEWS BEFORE I SCHEDULED A MOVE!  AAANND I WISH I COULD RATE THEM A ZERO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nI called several weeks in advance to schedule a moving date. The customer service was awesome! I even called back several other times to verify some other information.  NEVER  IN ANY OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS WAS I GIVEN DIRECTIONS HOW TO SET UP MY HOUSE FOR MY MOVE!!!\nSaturday, April 13,  2019  the movers arrived. They walked through then had me to sign some papers. They begin to move a few things. The heavier set gentleman was on the phone. Still no moving going on! The next thing I know a lady shows up , introduces herself and said she was doing a walk through. I said okay. She walked my town house and stated to me that I need to clean my dresser off. There was some sticky residue on there. I said okay and cleaned the dresser.  I went back to sit down. I noticed they had packed my TV and I needed it because Direct TV was headed to the new location. My friend was coming to pick it up the TV.  I went to the truck to get the TV. The manger and the heavier set guy were behind the truck smoking cigarettes. So I asked,  \"Were we moving anything today.\" \"You all are on a smoke break and nothing has been moved!\" She said , no ma'am.  We are getting ready to move you. \"I suppose what I said led to what happened next\"  She sent  the African American guy into my town house to let me know they had to CANCELED my move today.  I guess because I was African American that was the reason for sending him. He had no explanation. I asked since she was the manger why didn't she come and tell me what the problem was and why my move was canceled.  He said she a White lady. In other words, he was sent to do the dirty work! By this time I am furious! I call the office and some gentleman couldn't really explain either. He just said it was cancelled. I used some unprofessional words and hung the phone up. I called back to speak to her and she stated that there was no room for their dollies to pass through, there was an odor and it was not clean. All of those were lies! I don't know any place that will be clean when you are moving.  I had all of my boxes and bags in one  location. They were labeled and separated.  The only items upstairs were the bedrooms. I used some more unprofessional , choice words again! My issue with the entire thing is NO ONE explained to me how to set up for the move or came our prior for a walk through. SHE told me that was COMMON SENSE! I gave some more unprofessional , choice words.  I live in a town house which does not have a lot of room. I can not help how many items I had. I did contact corporate office and explained EVERYTHING! I even expressed that I used unprofessional words and I did apologize to the corporate office.  Thank God I have awesome family and friends!!! They moved me with no hesitation and never complained. What about the people who don't have family and friends in the city!  Treat people how you want to be treated!  KARMA is for real!!!!

Quinton (the driver) and his team (Quinteze, Jamaul and Colin) showed up right on time, moved quickly and efficiently, and never once acted like anything was a problem! They really went above and beyond, even taking items that we planned to give away down to the basement for us.

Which chose to hire movers because we just completed renovations and wanted to avoid causing damage to our newly renovated house. They told my wife they had an early morning opening and a late morning opening. We chose the later option because of our work schedules. They showed up an hour earlier than we expected and we were not prepared. The staff was nice  and they did not waste anytime getting loaded. When I arrived to the house my wife was disappointed. When we called AMS to arrange the move we asked them if they could assemble some items. My wife was told they disassembled and assembled. When my wife showed the men the items she was told her they would only assemble what they had previously disassembled at the pickup. It might have been a misunderstanding on our end, but I'm not sure why it would be a problem since they charge by the hour. The most disappointing part was the damages caused to our house. We know these men are working hard and furniture can be difficult to move through hallways and doors so we expected minor scratches/dents might  occur, but in two places the damage was beyond what I would call minor. The casing on the front door and one of the hallways has chunks of wood taken out of them.  While we still would have been annoyed.. If we had we been notified during the move we would have let it go. Nobody said anything about the damages and now we will have to make repairs to work that was just completed. Nice people to work with, but they need to work with their staff on communication to their clients and honesty.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1465391540721, "text": "Brian, Thank you for your valuable feedback, we are sorry we did not meet your expectation on your relocation with us.

I was told I would receive a call 24-48 hrs before the move to comfirm time. I did not. I contacted them less than 24 hrs before our scheduled move only to be told they over booked and if it was ok, would I be willing to moved the day back one day. So I agreed since they offered to lower the rate and make me the firts appointment of that day. So Monday came. I was told they would be there between 8:30a and 9:30a. I'm almost 3 months pregnant & I feel asleep about 9am. I woke up around 11am. No movers!!! My husband said they called at 10:48a saying they were behind and several workers called out. 8 to be excat. This is one of the reasons I originally scheduled my move for that Sunday--the day before the Holiday (Memorial Day). My husband was told they would be there in a few hours. A few hours passed, still no movers. We called them back around 1pm. Was told they were still coming it would be another few hours. At this point we are upset but we wait, and wait and wait. I took another nap this time with my 17 month old who wasn't to thrilled about being in the house all day with boxes everywhere. We wake up around three. Still no movers. My husband calls. It was a little before 4pm. He was told \"the guys are finishing up a job now and they are headed your way\". My husband asked what time can we expect them? He was told \"between 5p and 6p\". At this point we wait and wait and wait. 5:55p, NO MOVERS, NO CALL! My husband calls back, NO ANSWER!!!! Calls again and again and again. NO ANSWER. Around 6:10p the rain starts and it doesnt stop. It's heavy rain. 6:20p driver calls. Here is our conversation:\nDriver: We are headed your way\nMe: Sir it's raining, like really raining. Isn't our stuff going to get wet??\nDriver: Yes Mam it is. Even if we use the pads they will get wet and then sit on your stuff.\nMe: I feel like I have no choice\nDriver: What do you want to do? Do you want us to head that way?\nMe: I don't know\nDriver: Mam we haven't eaten all day and we would like to see our families before 11pm.\nMe: Well why don't you all stop and get something to eat and maybe the rain will stop by then.\nDriver: Mam we don't get paid to eat\nMe: (Mouth drops), I'll just cancel.\nDriver: Ok call Chris\nMe: Who is Chris? Do you ha.....\nDriver: Click up (He hangs up on me)\n\nThis all happened before anyone physically came to move our stuff.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x88891ede3ecc47dd:0x6e0df98ae12a8cda"}

I've used 2 different moving companies in the last year, All My Sons and 2 Men & A Truck. In short, I'll likely be using 2 Men going forward because it was just a better experience overall and worth the difference in rate per mover.\n\nPositives: The All My Sons (AMS) hourly rate, per mover, is far less than the competition in the field. Their sales staff is persistent in booking orders (which I like - some don't). They call a lot to check in and see what they can do to help. The movers didn't really sit around; they moved with purpose most of the time. The movers were very nice and did everything they could to provide good service.\n\nNegatives: We were scheduled for 8-8:30am arrival; they didn't show up until 10:30am. Furthermore, I had to be the one to call to find out why they were late (had to call 3 times). The operations gentleman/rep that I talked to about their delayed arrival was straight forward but more in the sense of being border line rude. Just my opinion at that time; and I'll admit I was heated & mad having to call 3 times so the rep could have been nice the whole time but I wasn't truly listening...the underlying issue had something to do with the moving truck needing gas and their gas card limit was too small for what the moving truck needed; getting approval for the gas was what created the delay. Ultimately, the ops office set up the movers for failure.\n\nMoot Points: I don't know that the movers were properly prepared for my move. I don't know if I did a poor job of describing what's going to be moved, or if AMS didn't communicate to the moving team.\n\nBottom Line: I needed a moving company to move items. AMS did that. I wasn't blown away by their service.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1477920573821, "text": "Matt, Thank you for your valuable feedback, we are sorry we did not meet your expectation on your relocation with us.

The issue was that there was no social distancing encouraged in the small lobby space! There were 13 people crammed in a small area at one point + employees. There was one employee not wearing a mask at all. She kept walking around in the front area and making trips out the front door through the crowds of people. Another had on a 3\" chin visor mask, that let's be honest, wasn't protecting anyone.

The gentleman behind me also expressed how uncomfortable he was with the thought of having to step inside the lobby with so many people. In fact, we both hung back and allowed people to filter out before going inside, only to have many more people cram in behind us just moments after we walked in.\n\nWe've been at this pandemic thing for months. Concern for safety is not new. Why was there no one at this location telling people, \"So sorry guys, only 5 allowed inside at a time so we can keep everyone safe.\"  Not to mention the fact the if I have to wear my mask to enter the building, WHY are employees not required to wear proper masks as well?", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1608217204865, "text": "I am sorry that you had a bad experience.

No, she was not. I quickly grabbed the package and left the store. I drove over to USPS down the road and went in to have the package shipped. The total cost for priority mail ended up being $32.50.

She states that this particular document does not require \"for _ only\" and instructed me to come back and they will redo it for Free. Today, 9/20, I go in speak with Raquel, catch him up on my conversation with his wife. His reason for not redoing was because nationwide rep was not present in store with me and it would be illegal for him to do so. I request a refund for his document error. At first his stance was services were rendered because the dicument has been accepted in the past and its his principles (whatever they were). Finally we agree that he should issue a refund. He soon changed his mind and after I suggested him and his wife get on one accord with the policy and look into new notary standards. Razuel ordered me to leave because I should just be quiet (his words). I obviously refused and called the police instead.\nA refund was eventually issued after the police arrived, however not before Razuel allowed his pride to dictate his moral code.\n\nCustomers are in the business of donating funds to your business.

They lose packages, packages are delayed because they can't do their job and the UPS store should not have to take the blame for the USPS inadequate culture. So guess what?

We told the employee that we wanted the most economical option - the contents were valuable and needed insurance (china, books, birdhouse, rug, etc.), but speed was not a concern.  We were told 3 day residential was the cheapest option.\n\nOne of the five boxes was completely crushed during shipment and several china pieces were broken despite purchasing nearly $100 of bubble wrap and china specific packaging supplies.  I filed a claim with UPS, provided pictures, etc.  Without inspecting the box, UPS ultimately denied the claim because there was a sweater in the package that I'd sent in the box to free up room for stuff in my luggage.  UPS claimed it was inappropriate packaging material even though it was just part of the contents.  UPS would not discuss the denial with me because UPS deemed the UPS Store as the shipper (not me).\n\nDuring the claims process, I found out that ground service was available and would have been ~$200 less expensive.\n\nI called the UPS store and spoke to the manager.  I started by telling her about the insurance denial.  She said it was not their issue since they didn't package the box.  I agreed, but told her UPS will only speak with them (as the shipper) and that they needed to act on my behalf to help resolve the issue.  I next mentioned that we could have shipped the boxes via ground for less money and that staff misled us.  She became INCREDIBLY RUDE and told me the staff just recommended that service - not that it wasn't the cheapest option.  I pushed back and asked if she was present at the time of the transaction - she said no.  With no knowledge of the interaction, she continued to blindly and aggressively tell me what her staff said and did.  It was clear the conversation was going nowhere.\n\nA manager from a different location called later.  She said they'd file an appeal with UPS on our behalf.  No followup occurred.\n\nI rarely get fired up, but this experience was AWFUL!  The staff misled and overcharged us.  UPS denied a claim without ever inspecting the box.  UPS would not speak to me despite my family boxing, shipping, paying for and receiving the boxes.  The manager was incredibly rude.  They were unhelpful and failed to help resolve the claim with UPS.\n\nThis is a great store if this is the service you're looking for.\n\nTo make it even worse, as I was filing the dispute with UPS (which took hours and multiple calls), I contacted the UPS Store to get copies of our receipt.  They were helpful and said they'd send over the receipts.  Instead of sending our receipt, they accidentally emailed me a copy of another customer's DRIVERS LICENSE and SOCIAL SECURITY CARD.  I guess you can add careless to the list too.....\n\nFIND ANOTHER WAY/LOCATION TO SHIP YOUR UPS PACKAGES!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889a4d6271b3defb:0x3377d583ad8084ed"}

I was told I could drive 50 miles to pickup at the ship center on Saturday or wait until Monday for re-delivery. Then I was told that the shipper could request Saturday delivery. I conference the the shipper and Fed-ex and shipper provided account number for Saturday delivery. After being on the phone and talking to 4-5 diffrent people over a 2 hour period, I finally was told by a supervisor that the fed-ex ship center where my package was being held, was not even open on Saturday.REALLY? So due to thier incompetence not only will I not get my \"next day package\" on time, but when I do finally get the shipment, it will be useless to me. I guess I'm lucky I called back enough times to finally figure out that the ship-center was not open Saturdays, before I made a 100 mile round trip for nothing. Do not use Fed-ex if you need to get your packages delivered on-time. They cannot follow shipping instructions and are incompetent.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888bcf0944ac4529:0x399cd70d8300bd13"}

They stated the company put it for standard delivery and I had the company we purchased for on the other end of the phone that stated no they did not. It was sent express delivery and Belk had sent me the proof. Fedex phone rep still continued to lie on Belk. Then when told we were recording the conversation and wanted to see proof that Belk had sent the shipment out for standard 5-7 day delivery as he told us and have it emailed for documentation purposes he hung up because he knew he was caught in his own web of lies. On top of that, it shows the package has been at the Birmingham facility since the 10th and yet still hasn\u2019t been delivered. The second package shows it is in Georgia and has been for 2 days with no movement. The rep said nobody would answer the phones at the Georgia facility in Kennesaw as well as this Birmingham facility so he couldnt speak with them about why the packages hasn\u2019t moved or been delivered. This place is a total joke and fraud. They charge you for express shipping and never do it. That is the same as stealing from people. They take your money and then do not deliver.
