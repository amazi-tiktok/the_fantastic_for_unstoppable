Went in for something super simple and can put with an even bigger problem. I purchased a windshield wiper arm. It was confirmed that the arm was for the year and make of my car. I asked if I could pay extra for him to put it on and he agreed. He wasn't able to put it on claiming that it was becuase I needed a nut. I noticed that the wipers were no longer working after he tried putting it on. He claimed the wiper motor was not working. The wiper motor was working completely fine prior to him touching my car. I took it to my trusted mechanic and it was confirmed that not only did the wiper arm Hammett sold me was NOT for my year and make car, but he also tore my wiper transmission when he ripped the arm off of it. Prior to me even going to Hammett, I took it by my mechanic to confirm what was needed. It was confirmed that I only needed the arm as the wiper motor and wiper transmission were perfectly fine in great condition, I had also driven the car in the rain the day before and the wiper worked just fine. I called and text  the guy who damaged the car and sent photos and I have yet to receive a response. Do not only did i pay $40 for an arm that doesn't fit my car (Oriellys Auto Parts confirmed that the Hammett arm was likely for a 2003 not a 2008), but I also had to pay $75 for the part Hammett broke as well as $75 for a brand new arm from The dealership. This was a $40 fix that ended up costing me $190! This is a real review. I would not suggest taking your car or buying any parts from this company. The honest thing to do would have been to at the very LEAST reimburse me for the arm that didn't fit the car. I gave them that opportunity by calling and texting prior to this review and I didn't receive any response back.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPpTCHuu-CePVv-YXiLx8J980jtxWAtSiqVGX6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888a24f244bcf02b:0x42810f229b40e283"}

I had arranged for my mechanic to install it before X-Mas because I had planned on driving my vehicle to see relatives for the holiday. I went to meet the delivery driver to inspect the transmission, sign for it and leave my vehicle at the shop to have it installed that day.  After I had specifically made sure they had the correct information on my vehicle, I was still sent an automatic. Not the manual 5sp. that I had made a point to be sure was correct.  To their credit, they did place the correct order with the place that they got the tranny from, but they sent the wrong one anyhow. So, while technically it was not their fault, I'm still out 4 days of waiting and another 6 days to get the right one sent, so it forced me to rent a car.  It finally did arrive on 12/28/2015 and it was in good working order but when I looked at my invoice receipt, the shipping cost had dropped $25 because of the weight difference of the two transmissions.  By then I was so frustrated that I didn't even bother trying to get a reimbursement.  Again, as I said, it wasn't their fault that the wrong part shipped, but in the end, I did pay them a $250.00 finders fee, so that's none of my concern WHY the wrong one was shipped, but I'm the one that got screwed for it and I feel like I should have been compensated for them wasting my time and causing me to rent a car.

Let me explain why. On Thursday April 2, 2015 I went on the internet looking for an automatic transmission for my 2001 Honda Prelude. Within minutes I received an email from J and J used motors that they had found me a transmission and that it was located in Phoenix Arizona. They told me that the car had 58,000 on it when the transmission was removed. They even sent me a quote and a confirmation number. I told the lady that I was working with that I was going out of town on Friday April 3 for the weekend and that I would call her Monday April 6 with the address of my mechanics shop. On Monday April 6, I called J and J with the address and all my credit card information. At this time she told me that I had to fill out the warranty paper work before the transmission would be shipped. She sent me the warranty paper on a PDF on April 8, I completed the warranty paper work and sent it back to her at 2 A.M. on April 9. I had not heard anything from J and J by the April 10 so I emailed them to see where we were on my transmission. Monday April 13 I received an email that my transmission had already be shipped and was given a tracking number.\nWhen I went in to track my transmission is when I found out the it was shipped from Joplin Missouri not Phoenix Arizona, and I also found out the car it came off of had 106,000 miles on it. J and J used motors never contacted me to see if this 106,000 miles transmission was ok with me and to give me another quote. The lady that I was working with assured me numerous times that the 58,000 mile transmission was mine. I have contacted J and J numerous times and they keep telling me that I need to talk to someone name Debbie, and that she will return my calls, but she's not return my calls after 4 days. Today being April 16. I KNOW I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH J AND J USED MOTORS AGAIN, AND I SUGGEST YOU THINK BEFORE YOU DO.\nJ and J you have not heard the last from me!!!!!!!!!!\n\nUpdate to my dilemma. I just got off the phone with Debbie from J and J used motors, and she agreed that someone should have gotten back to me when the 58,000 mile transmission was not available. After working other issues out she has agreed to reimburse me $100.00 to my account. This has been a lesson learn. I still don't think I would do business with J and J used motors again.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x889ba84f4bf10129:0x3e3d14c582de6d3c"}

You can pull your own part or you can get them to pull it. The service is so so and expensive if you go there in person.

They do have some 2000's but limited stock. Prices vary drastically! Needed parts for a ford expedition approx 8 years ago. Told me it was $125.... A new one was $118 at auto zone! Got my friend to call (he recommended them) then and ask for the same part..He was told $40. Dress country or your prices are higher. Especially in a polo or shirt with button. Did this approx 6 times for different parts. Alternator, rotars(twice), muffler, coils and wires rearview mirror. My friend always got the best price_. Dressed in Dale Earnhardt shirt, old wrangler jeans i found at yardsale down the road. I went in person and got the same price my friend received. In polo shirt and khaki shorts, they multiplied the price by 3 or 4. The last time, in summer 2011, i needed another rotar i got a price over the phone talking country of $20.
