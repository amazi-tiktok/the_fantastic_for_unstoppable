The vehicle in question was brought in because the ignition switch was defective. Due to the connector going to the anti-theft module was not making connection. After I spent 30 minutes on the phone with the chevy dealer I found the connector was not available. I instructed your daughter to go and get a complete unit with a new pig tail. After explaining to them that a code reading would bring no results to identify the issue. I did allow the vehicle to sit in my parking lot until the problem could be addressed. Most places charge several hundred dollars to do this. Several days later they brought in a switch from a junk yard that was ripped out and badly damaged. I told them they could not use part due to being damaged. After a couple days a night time worker offered to help with diagnostics, he brought his scan tool and tried to diagnosis the issue. Found the anti-theft module was not making any connection with the vehicles pcm. He spent over an hour trying to help your daughter for free. He normally charges $70 an hour for this. We have gone out of our way to help your daughter every way we could. Including letting the vehicle sit for over a week. No way did your stand out in the cold while we laughed at her.

They come out during normal business hours so I was unable to be there but I had my father let them into my garage. The guy called me and said he's never seen this type of car and he was \" pretty sure\" he could put the front windshield in right but knew he could do the back. I just told him not to install the front since he had no clue what to do. Then he install the rear with their universal molding, which is fine since Toyota didn't have it available anymore.\nI got home and looked over the job, it was horrible. He had installed the rear windshield way out of sort, it wasn't positioned in the opening evenly as it is extremely too far forward, to the point that there's a 3/4 inch gap at the bottom. Even with the gap they only installed their molding around the top and two sides leaving the huge gap in plain sight.\nI called the owner the next day and he was horribly rude, told me he wouldn't come back and to take it to a paseo specialist. Clearly I took it to a hack.\nI wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy, not only do they perform poor installations they owner has a filthy mouth when speaking to you about it.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x888901976e6521ff:0x23df663e0fa70098"}

My SUV was more difficult. I asked for good quality glass and I'm not exactly sure what I got.\nI wanted the glass installed following the instructions spelled out in the factory Service Manual. When I would explain to the installers how it NEEDED to be done they pushed back by saying that was not necessary. My SUV has a specific way to install the windshield that is out of the ordinary. If steps aren't followed then its going to leak. They assured me that it wouldn't leak the way they did it and I really did not want to put that to the test with their way of doing it. I supplied my own new factory gasket for the job. If I had not had that they would have reused the 20 year old gasket that was glued to the old windshield. The manual says to use a NEW gasket.\n\nAll the glass installers I have delt with to get this done have just about all been the same. They are payed by they job and want to get done and on to the next job. I care about my car and if I'm gong to pay to have this done I want it done right. As the customer they need to consider that I probably have a good idea what I'm talking about and should listen and absorb what I'm telling them because I didn't want it to leak and I know they didn't want to have to come back and fix it.\n\nMy experience with the installers that came today was the reason for the bad rating. I don't appreciate their attitude towards my instructions I had for them.  I walked inside to get cash to pay them while they were working and quietly came back outside to hear them talking about me and how I was trying to micromanage them.  One of the guys actually told me he could see why they other companies didn't want to do the job. Which was a rude thing to say. He couldn't handle I wanted things done a certain way (the correct way).\n\nI'm sure most windshields are simple and easy to replace. If you have any specifics on how your car windshield should be done like I did then skip this company. Along with Cassady and Self.
